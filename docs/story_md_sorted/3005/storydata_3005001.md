**Mahiru：**  
Hm hm-hmm! ♪  
My cows are the cream of the crop...  
Hmm-hmm! ♪  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh, Mahiru!  
You're up early, as usual.  
Good morning!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, Limalima!  
You're as pretty as a peach this mornin'!  
You're lookin' so bright 'n' beautiful,  
my eyes are fixin'  
to pop outta my head!  
  
**Lima：**  
Hmph. Always with the jokes, Mahiru.  
Flattery will get you nowhere!  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh, who am I kidding?  
Keep the compliments coming!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I ain't jokin', honey.  
Besides, I got way better material 'n that.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ahh, lookit that shiny, fluffy coat.  
Limalima, you're like my farm's idol.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wait, idol! That's a great setup  
 for an improv skit!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You be the idol, and I'll be your producer.  
Welcome, ladies 'n' gents! We got another  
silly story for ya!  
  
**Rin：**  
Shaddap...  
It is way too early for all this noise and nonsense.  
I'm trying to sleep over here.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, Rinrin!  
What'cha doin' sleepin' on Limalima's back?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
She ain't a horse, y'know.  
She's a valued guest of the farm!  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh, don't be so hard on her.  
Actually, I love feeling her hug on me so tight!  
  
**Lima：**  
I love it here in general.  
No one gives me funny looks!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
'Course not. If it tickles your fancy,  
you're welcome  
to stay at my farm forever!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But Rinrin, you can vamoose.  
Yer mom back home's gonna be worried!  
  
**Rin：**  
Ahh, it's all good.  
We live and let live in our house.  
  
**Rin：**  
Besides, I technically have a job here as a security guard.  
  
**Rin：**  
I'm so overworked, I can barely stand up.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I don't reckon I've ever seen ya workin', Rinrin.  
And the farm's as peaceful as crickets on a summer night.  
You ain't got squat to do!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Since you're free, why don'tcha help me out a bit?  
We got more animals 'n ever to take care of,  
and not  
enough people to care for 'em.  
  
**Rin：**  
Mmm... Nah.  
Right now, I've got like, zero hit points.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hit... Pants?  
I know all about animals, but I reckon  
I got a lot to learn about beastfolk.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Do y'all gotta wear \"hit pants\" to keep your humanoid forms or  
somethin'?  
  
**Rin：**  
Urgh, please stop.  
I'm exhausted. Just be quiet.  
  
**Lima：**  
Hit pants?  
If I get my hooves on some of those, maybe...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Good morning.  
You all seem quite energetic today.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, Shioshio!  
She smiles above us, we smile  
below! Good mornin', sunshine!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Sun... shine?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Sorry. All this ruckus woke you up, huh?  
You gonna be all right without a full night's sleep?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes.  
I actually feel quite well today.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Well, I sure am glad to hear it!  
Just don't push yourself, 'kay?  
  
**Rin：**  
Shiorin. If you're feeling up to it,  
can you patrol the farm for me today?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I just took a look around while I was on my walk.  
It's another quiet, peaceful day.  
  
**Shiori：**  
The mountain air here is so fresh and clean.  
I think I'll make a full recovery if I stay here.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Lima,  
I picked some perfectly ripened apples  
on my walk. I brought some back for you.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Here. And Rin, I got you some acorns.  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh, thank you! You're so considerate, Shiori.  
I love you to pieces!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Blech.  
Please try not to spit.  
My face is all sticky now.  
  
**Rin：**  
*nibble, nibble*  
Acorns are great and all,  
but what I really want is  
a sweet bun!  
  
**Rin：**  
They sell them everywhere back in Landosol.  
That's the one thing this place is lacking.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Less boo-hoos and more thank-yous, Rinrin!  
You heard Shioshio went 'round and did your  
patrol, didn'tcha?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I know y'all both come from Caon,  
but it's *your*  
job to make the rounds. Shioshio's just here to  
set a spell till she feels better.  
  
**Rin：**  
I know. You're a lifesaver, Shiorin.  
Thanks a bunch.  
  
**Rin：**  
You should come over. I've got this awesome new game  
I'm totally obsessed with.  
I'll let you have a turn.  
  
**Rin：**  
It's the coolest. I've been staying up all night playing  
for like a week now.  
Of course, now I'm totally drained.  
*yawn*  
  
**Shiori：**  
A game?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I don't know what that is, but I'd like that.  
I'm almost done reading all the books I brought  
with me.  
Lately I haven't had much else to do.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'd love for you to show me some new things!  
  
**Rin：**  
That's more like it.  
Just be grateful, and it's all good.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Now hold your horses, Rinrin!  
*You* should be thankin' *her*!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wait, were you tryin' to bait me into jumpin' in?  
Dang it! I coulda come up with somethin' a lot funnier!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Anyhoo. I've gotta get back to cleanin',  
so if y'all are gonna play one of them game  
doohickeys, do it outside.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Now skedaddle!  
It's a beautiful day out there!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, Mahiru, may I help?  
If I wouldn't be in the way, of course.  
  
**Lima：**  
Me too! I need to burn off all those apples.  
It's so hard to maintain my girlish figure!  
  
**Rin：**  
Seriously? Then I'm going back to bed.  
Try not to be too loud.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ah ha ha.  
Thanks, y'all!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
For a long time, it's just been me 'n the animals out here,  
so it's been lovely havin' nice folks like y'all here to  
talk to.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Even if I can't get y'all to crack a smile with my routines,  
it seems like everyone's naturally got a big grin  
on their face 'round here!
