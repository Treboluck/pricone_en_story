**Shiori：**  
Sorry  
 I have to ride on your back again, Lima.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I know you don't like being treated like a packhorse.  
  
**Lima：**  
You're fine. Don't sweat it!  
I've put on a few pounds since  
I came to the farm and started eating all that delicious food!  
I could use the exercise!  
  
**Lima：**  
Besides, you've been feeling out of sorts for a while now.  
  
**Lima：**  
And you weren't exactly athletic to begin with.  
You came to the farm to recuperate, right?  
  
**Lima：**  
I could never let someone who's sick push herself too much.  
  
**Lima：**  
Especially out here. The terrain is rough, and if  
you got a dizzy spell and fainted, you'd be dead  
before anyone could get to you.  
  
**Lima：**  
Don't feel guilty about hitching a little ride.  
After all, what are friends for?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Thank you so much.  
But aren't I heavy?  
  
**Lima：**  
Not a bit! I'm a strong girl.  
To me, you're as light as a feather, Shiori!  
  
**Lima：**  
Honestly, I'm jealous of how slim you are.  
I bet you weigh about a quarter of what I do, if that.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm only skinny because I'm unwell.  
I might even have some  
digestive problems. It seems like no matter what I eat, I can't  
gain any weight.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I wish I had a strong, solid physique like you, Lima.  
  
**Shiori：**  
And your hair! Mine is always dry and scraggly because I  
get dehydrated.  
Your coat is so healthy and shiny.  
I think it's lovely.  
  
**Lima：**  
Aww, you're so sweet!  
You sure know how to make a girl feel pretty, Shiori.  
Keep them coming!  
  
**Lima：**  
Whoops.  
We shouldn't get carried away chatting.  
We'll get caught off-guard.  
  
**Lima：**  
Technically, this is still a security patrol.  
We're here to protect the farm, so we have to stay alert  
for any dangerous monsters.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm keeping an eye out, don't worry.  
Both the farm and the surrounding areas are naturally  
very peaceful.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Frankly, I don't think there's any need to be  
overly cautious.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Regardless, guarding the farm is Caon's job.  
They're taking such good care of me, so I have to do my part  
in return.  
  
**Shiori：**  
If we wait for something to happen before we show up, it'll be  
too late to prevent it. These daily patrols are very important.  
  
**Lima：**  
But patrolling is supposed to be Rin's job, not yours, right?  
  
**Shiori：**  
That's true.  
But both of us are affiliated with Caon.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Rin helps take care of me, too. Plus, I feel bad  
about how she's forced to do this job when doesn't  
have the energy to do it.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Out here, I'm blessed with clean air, delicious meals,  
and a peaceful, quiet life. I want to repay everyone here at  
the farm for all of that as well.  
  
**Lima：**  
Shiori, you're too precious.  
That's why you have to get healthy and find happiness.  
If there's ever anything I can do, just say the word!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Thank you, Lima.  
*gasp* Hold on. Can you stop for a second?  
  
**Lima：**  
What is it?  
  
**Shiori：**  
It could just be my imagination...  
But something feels off here.  
Sorry, can you put me down?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oof! Whew.  
I just want to look around the area.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I was right.  
Look, this spot looks unnaturally messy.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Chunks of this tree have been gouged out, and the ground  
is full of holes.  
Maybe there were monsters fighting over  
the territory?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hmm? *sniff*  
This smell...  
H-huh?  
  
**Lima：**  
Shiori?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's all right.  
Stay where you are, Lima.  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's a monster, but just a baby one.  
It's on high alert.  
We don't want to approach it too carelessly.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'll bring it down with my bow.  
  
**Lima：**  
Wait! It's just a baby, right?  
Please don't kill it! That's so sad!  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's a very dangerous type. None of us would be  
able to handle it once it's an adult.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm afraid it has to die here and now  
if we want the farm to stay safe from here on.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm sorry. You can hate me if you want.  
But in this world, it's survival of the fittest.  
  
**Shiori：**  
And because I don't want to die.  
No...  
I should say, because I want to live,  
I can't turn a blind eye to a dangerous creature like this.  
  
**Shiori：**  
...  
  
**Lima：**  
Wh-what's wrong?  
  
**Shiori：**  
It... Umm...  
I don't know why, but the monster is rubbing up against my  
feet.  
I can't aim my bow properly when it's this close to me.  
  
**Lima：**  
Ah ha ha, that's so cute!  
It likes you, Shiori!  
  
**Lima：**  
It looks like a kind of monster cat. Maybe since you're  
kind of cat-like, it thinks you're related?  
Or actually, maybe it thinks you're its mother?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm not a cat, I'm a tiger beastgirl.  
Wh-what do you think I should do?  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's being so affectionate, I'm having trouble  
bringing myself to kill it.  
  
**Lima：**  
Hmm. Maybe I'm being naive, but who says you have to?  
It doesn't look like it's got long to live, anyway.  
  
**Lima：**  
See how it's dragging its leg? It's badly injured already.  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh, look! There's the body of an adult of the same species  
over in the bushes.  
  
**Lima：**  
It must be this one's parent. I guess it died trying to  
defend its territory, and the child got caught up  
in the fight.  
  
**Lima：**  
Out in this harsh environment, with no parents to protect it,  
it doesn't have much chance of surviving. Sooner or later,  
it's going to die.  
  
**Lima：**  
That's why  
I don't think you need to force yourself to be  
some kind of heartless demon. You don't need to get  
your hands dirty like this.  
  
**Lima：**  
Even if it you think you have to because of your job or  
whatever,  
it doesn't matter. Listen to your conscience, Shiori.  
  
**Lima：**  
Otherwise, I just know you're going to regret it.  
  
**Shiori：**  
...  
  
**Lima：**  
We're back! ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey, welcome back.  
Where were you two?  
  
**Lima：**  
Shiori was patrolling the farm, covering for you!  
I went along for the ride.  
  
**Lima：**  
Anyways, forget the small talk and boil some water.  
And bring some bandages too, okay?  
  
**Rin：**  
Wait, what?!  
Did Shiorin get hurt?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh no!  
M-Mahiru, get the first aid kit!  
Hurry!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Huh? What's all the ruckus?  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's all right. This little guy is the injured one, not me.  
Umm, Mahiru, do you know how to treat a hurt monster?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Monster?  
Depends on what type it is.  
If it's an animal type, I reckon I can probably do somethin'.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
They ain't really that different from regular animals,  
and I'm an old hand at patchin' up livestock.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wow. Y'all brought this cat monster home, huh?  
  
**Shiori：**  
No, not exactly...  
It was just all over me and followed me home.  
  
**Shiori：**  
We tried to leave it behind, but it kept following us.  
In the end, I didn't have the heart to abandon it.

**Rin：**  
Hmm. Lemme see.  
What kinda monster is it?  
  
**Rin：**  
Aww, it's cute!  
It's just like a kitten. You're keeping it as a pet?  
  
**Rin：**  
I wonder what monsters eat.  
And before you ask, I'm not giving it any of my acorns.  
  
**Shiori：**  
No, it's not a pet.  
Don't worry.  
I'll kill it when the time comes.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Now why in tarnation would ya wanna do that?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ain't so sense in treatin' every single monster like it's  
out to gitcha.  
Some of 'em can get used to people  
'n' even be helpful.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Raise it with heaps 'n' heaps of love, and I reckon it'll  
pay y'all back for savin' it.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
We got an open spot in the stable.  
You can keep it in there.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Aww, you poor critter. That's a nasty wound.  
I'll have you patched up lickety-split!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Whoa!  
 Poor thing's really skittish!  
Nearly bit my hand off.  
Seems like it's downright  
taken with you though, Shioshio.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I know. I wonder why.  
Anyway, please tell me how to apply the first aid.  
I'll do it.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm the one who picked it up.  
Both saving and killing it are my responsibility.  
  
**Rin：**  
Shiorin, it needs a name.  
It's too cute!  
  
**Shiori：**  
But if I name it, it'll be that much harder to eliminate it  
when the time comes.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Then again, it would make things easier if it had a name.  
I'll come up with something.

**Shiori：**  
I'm sorry.  
Someday, when you're grown, I may have to kill you.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Monsters are evil beings that eat away at the lives  
of other living creatures.  
We can't coexist.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I may one day regret having saved your life.  
  
**Shiori：**  
But for now, I'll let you live.  
I won't call it saving you.  
What I'm doing might prove to be very cruel.  
  
**Shiori：**  
In the long run, dying at the side of your dead parent...  
may have been the happier option for you.  
  
**Shiori：**  
This girl that you're so attached to, so enamored with,  
may end up taking your life.  
  
**Shiori：**  
But if there's any chance at all that we can coexist,  
then I'll pray for that.  
  
**Shiori：**  
When you cuddled up to me, I could feel the warmth of  
your body.  
And I couldn't bring myself to take it from you.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Please don't die. Live.  
Live until the day when you become a true monster.  
Until we are enemies. Until I have to kill you.  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's *my* responsibility to ensure your survival now.  
And if you ever become dangerous, I'll put you down.  
  
**Shiori：**  
But until then, we'll both live on.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I promise you...  
Umm...  
Nyatt! ♪
