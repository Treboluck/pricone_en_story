O-oh my gosh! What is that?  
It's so cool!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. Perhaps it is a statue of a deity from a past era?  
  
It is quite a fine statue. Bringing it to an antiques store to sell  
would surely garner a handsome price.  
  
**Karyl：**  
H-hey, guys! Wait!  
Just calm down, all right?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Look, uh listen...  
Statues found in ruins like that one  
generally only mean one thing.  
  
**Gargoyle：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Eeek! It's moving!
