**Narration：**  
Having completed their New Year's card delivery work,  
Karyl and {player} are strolling through  
the bustling Landosol streets together.  
  
**Karyl：**  
*sigh* I was hoping to relax at the start of the year,  
but things sure got hectic.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're sorry?  
You don't have to apologize, you know.  
I was the one who said I'd help, and I even took my cut.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's hang out.  
`Tag 1`  
**Karyl：**  
Hang out? Can't you see that I'm tired from working so hard...?  
Ah, fine then.  
I did just get a fat wad of cash.  
I can hang out for a little while.  
  
**Man：**  
Come one, come all! Test your luck in our New Year's lotto!  
We've got lots of fabulous prizes!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, that's right. When I bought those spellbooks,  
I got a free raffle ticket.  
I doubt I'll win anything, but might as well give it a go.  
  
**Man：**  
Winner winner, chicken dinner!  
Aren't you the lucky one, young lady?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're kidding!  
I did it! I wonder what the special prize is!  
C-could it be a proper Tantalizing Tropical—  
  
**Man：**  
Three months' worth of tasty mochi!  
Each one is a little masterpiece, carefully crafted by artisans using the  
highest-grade rice!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Oh.  
Come on, what am I supposed to do with three months' worth of mochi?  
  
**Karyl：**  
If I was Pecorine, I'd be crying with happiness?  
I guess if you think of it like that, it *is* a pretty good prize.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I mean, why do I have to think about her first?!  
I'm the one who won the prize!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  What's up with you?  
`Tag 2`  
**Karyl：**  
N-nothing's up with me!  
Anyway, let's hurry and get that prize.  
  
**Man：**  
The mochi will be mailed to you at a later date,  
so you have something to look forward to!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.  
...  
Wonder how many days they'll last?  
  
**Karyl：**  
It may only be mochi, but a special prize is a special prize.  
This year's already off to a great start!  
  
**Vendor：**  
Limited edition New Year's grab bags! We're down to the last one!  
The fun is in not knowing what's inside until you open it!  
There's good fortune to be found in leftovers!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hear that?! The last bag!  
We've gotta buy it!  
I've got a feeling that we can get something real good!  
Come on!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, that grab bag there—I'll take it!  
  
**Vendor：**  
Thank you, thank you!  
...  
Wait, hold on.  
  
**Karyl：**  
What's the matter?  
Get on with it please.  
  
**Little Girl：**  
I want it too...  
  
**Karyl：**  
What? I'm not gonna let you have it just because you're a kid!  
I was here first.  
If you always get what you want, you won't grow up into a decent adult!  
  
**Little Girl：**  
............  
  
**Choice: (3)**  She seems determined.  
**Choice: (4)**  She looks like she's about to cry.  
`Tag 3`  
**Karyl：**  
I-I can see that!  
I bet she came here with her New Year's money...  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Karyl：**  
I can see that!  
But she has to learn that crying will get her nowhere...  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Karyl：**  
Argh! Fine!  
Whatever! I'll let you have the dumb grab bag!  
Here, take it!  
  
**Little Girl：**  
Are you sure...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yes, have it.  
  
**Little Girl：**  
Thank you, miss!  
  
**Vendor：**  
All right, here you go.  
The very last grab bag.  
  
**Little Girl：**  
Thank you!  
  
**Karyl：**  
H-hey.  
Seeing as I let you have it,  
can I at least see what's inside?  
  
**Little Girl：**  
Sure!  
Let's open it together!  
Ready...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...The heck is this?  
  
**Little Girl：**  
A broken toy and...  
some trash...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Something's wrong here.  
Let's swap it for a decent one...  
  
**Karyl：**  
What?! The seller's gone!  
Huh?! Was he a con man?!  
  
**Little Girl：**  
But... my poor New Year's money…  
  
**Little Girl：**  
...*whimper*  
*whimper, whimper*... *sniff*  
  
**Karyl：**  
Great job holding back the tears.  
Since it's come to this, for your sake, I'm gonna  
find that dirty fraudster and ki—...  
  
**Little Girl：**  
And ki...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
...And  
catch him!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm borrowing the grab bag.  
  
**Little Girl：**  
What for...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
The criminal has left a trail, so I'm gonna find him using search magic.  
I'll make him regret ever making me angry!  
  
**Karyl：**  
............  
  
**Karyl：**  
All right, got him!  
I'm going after him!  
  
**Little Girl：**  
Me too!  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's too dangerous for you, so wait here.  
I promise I'll get your money back.  
  
**Little Girl：**  
Can I really not go with you...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's too risky.  
I'll be back before you know it, so hold tight.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I see him!  
Over there!  
  
**Vendor：**  
Erk!  
What are you doing here?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
That's not important.  
Give back that little girl's money right now!  
  
**Vendor：**  
What kind of idiot would just return the money when told to?  
I'm outta here!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Use my power!  
`Tag 6`  
**Karyl：**  
Let's combine our strength so we can clean up this mess  
in no time at all!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Eat this, scumbag!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Aaaaaahhh!  
  
**Vendor：**  
Nguaaaaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hah! He was just a cream puff in the end.  
All that's left is to get the money back, and hand him over to the  
royal knights.  
  
**Little Girl：**  
Wooow!  
That was amazing!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? You...  
I thought I told you to stay put because was dangerous.  
  
**Little Girl：**  
I'm sorry...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm just glad you're not hurt.  
Here, take this. It's your money.  
  
**Little Girl：**  
Thank you!  
H-hey... Miss?  
  
**Karyl：**  
What? Is there some cash missing?  
  
**Little Girl：**  
No, it's not that.  
I, um...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Come on, spit it out.  
  
**Little Girl：**  
Do you think that if I try really, really hard,  
I can be as cool as you when I'm older?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?!  
C-cool? Me?  
  
**Little Girl：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Karyl：**  
W-well! How should I know?  
Maybe if you put in enough hard work, sure, you'll get to be like me!  
  
**Narration：**  
Until she handed the con artist over to Nightmare,  
Karyl was bombarded with questions about what to strive for,  
all the while wearing a rather smug expression.
