## Subtitle: A Touch of Kindness
  
**Narration：**  
{player} and Karyl are enjoying a brief respite  
after returning to the guildhouse from the calligraphy competition.  
  
**Karyl：**  
*sigh* I've been on my feet since the very beginning of the year.  
I've had enough. I already need a break.  
Maybe it's because I'm tired, but it's unnaturally bright...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ah!  
What the—?! You're shining again!  
This light...!  
  

---  
  
**Kiruya：**  
New Year's Day, and you're working part-time as a mailman?  
You really like working, don't you?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Happy New Year.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kiruya：**  
Yeah, Happy New Year.  
There's nothing to be happy about though.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
What have I been up to?  
Not much.  
I said I was going to the shrine, and left home. Just been hanging around  
since. There are people absolutely everywhere. It's really pissing me off.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
But whatever. Anyway, you're working,  
which means you've got money, right? I'll let you treat me.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Here's your New Year's gift.  
**Choice: (3)**  What do you wanna eat?  
`Tag 2`  
**Kiruya：**  
Huh? Why are you so ready to just hand over cash?  
What the hell's going on in your head?  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Kiruya：**  
I had a feeling you'd say that, but you're being extorted,  
so you should at least look a little annoyed.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Kiruya：**  
Argh! Forget about it!  
I was just kidding about the whole \"treat me\" thing, so don't take it so  
seriously!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
You wanna treat me?  
Seriously? You really are one hell of a soft touch!  
Pull yourself together, man!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Can't you see? You look less like you're getting ripped off,  
and more like you're giving me charity. It's making me pissed.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
What? Then let's go and get some free shiruko soup?  
Well, if it's free...  
  
**Woman：**  
Happy New Year.  
Here you go—shiruko.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
It's pretty good, considering it's free. And this stuff warms you up too.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
What's with that smug look on your face?  
You didn't even do anything...  
  
Well, that's because I wouldn't let you, but still.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
*sigh*...  
Looking around, there sure a lotta people wearing kimonos.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Don't I wanna wear a kimono too? Well, yeah... I'd like to,  
but there's no way my mom would fork out that much cash.  
And it's also her fault that I can't hold down a job...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  You can use my money!  
`Tag 5`  
**Kiruya：**  
......No. If you go that far, I'm outta here.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
What, do you have some kinda evil plan?  
That would probably be healthier, to be honest...  
But you're not that kind of guy, are you?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
I'm not gonna take your money.  
If you could get me a free kimono, I'd happily wear it.  
But what are the chances of that happening?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  So, free is good?  
`Tag 6`  
**Kiruya：**  
Only if it actually costs nothing.  
Do you even know where to find something like that?  
Besides, there's nothing scarier than something that's free, so they say...  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Hey!  
Don't walk away while someone's talking to you!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Why the hell did you bring me to this kinda place?  
It's just a regular neighborhood.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
What? Take a good look?  
Huh? I'm looking...  
There's a signboard for a photo studio.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
It might have a signboard, but it still just looks like a regular old house.  
You didn't bring me all the way out here to do something weird to me,  
did you?!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Ahhh! You already pressed the buzzer!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Yes, yes. Sorry to keep you waiting.  
Oh?  
You already delivered my New Year's cards...  
  
**Old Man：**  
What's this? A customer?  
Oh my, what's the matter?  
  
**Old Man：**  
Hmmm.  
You want us to let this young lady try on a kimono?  
  
**Old Woman：**  
My, my!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
H-hey! Don't cause trouble!  
Why the hell would you say that all of a sudden?!  
Apologize this instant!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Oh, don't you worry.  
It's no trouble at all.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Old Man：**  
We're thinking of closing the studio soon.  
We do kimono rentals and photo shoots at bargain prices,  
but we haven't been getting any customers at all.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
The studios by the train station have been taking all the business.  
If you want to talk about trouble, well, that's it. Either way, we're closing  
the shop. Wouldn't you like to help us go out with a bang?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Uh, okay...  
But if it's a rental, then it's not free after all, right?  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Has he not told you, dear?  
  
**Old Woman：**  
It's already the new year, so it's a little late, but we've been looking for a  
young lady to dress up and advertise for us. Of course, we'll pay her for  
her time, and she can wear whichever kimono she likes, free of charge.  
  
**Old Man：**  
That's what we told him when he was on his delivery rounds.  
I'm impressed he remembered the ramblings of a couple of old-timers...  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Hey, dummy!  
You should've explained that to me *before* you dragged me out here!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
W-well.  
If I can wear a kimono... and earn a little pocket money...  
I guess I could go do it right now...  
  
**Old Man：**  
Ohhh!  
Really?!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
How wonderful! Let's get you in a kimono right away!

**Kiruya：**  
W-well?  
D-do I look like an absolute weirdo?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  You look really cute.  
`Tag 7`  
**Kiruya：**  
C-cute?!  
I'm asking you if there's anything wrong with the damn kimono!  
C-cute? The hell, man?!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Heheheh.  
You look cute, so he's just letting you know.  
  
**Old Man：**  
It really suits you.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Y-you sure...?  
  
**Old Man：**  
All right!  
Let's take a photo to commemorate the occasion.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Huh?!  
A photo?!  
B-but I'm not ready for that...!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  It's fine, because you look really cute.  
`Tag 8`  
**Kiruya：**  
Shut the hell up!  
Yeah, yeah!  
I get it, I'm really cute!  
  

---  
  
![112000402.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/112000402.webp)  
**Kiruya：**  
Huh?!  
D-did you just take the picture?!  
  
**Old Man：**  
Yep!  
The best time to take a photograph is when the subject has a relaxed  
expression.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
R-relaxed?  
But I was angry. Couldn't you see that?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Well,  
of course I'm happy to be wearing this pretty kimono too...  
  
**Kiruya：**  
............  
  
**Kiruya：**  
I guess it would be bad form to scan it with my mimi, huh...?  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Do what with your what, now?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
N-nothing.  
Forget about it,  
please.  
  
**Old Man：**  
I'd like to know what you're talking about.  
Please, go ahead. Ask away.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Y-you sure? Well, er...  
If I scan the kimono with this device called a mimi,  
I can wear it inside a game too.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
I probably won't ever get another chance to wear something like this,  
but at least in the game, I could wear it whenever... O-or maybe not.  
That's asking too much! Sorry I brought it up!  
  
**Old Man：**  
Ohhh, wearing the kimono in a game?  
How modern!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
So trendy.  
Lots of different people will get to see it that way.  
The kimono will also be really happy, I bet.

**Kiruya：**  
A-are you sure?  
It's okay...?  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Of course.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Th-thank you very much!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
I, um, seeing as you're doing all this for me,  
I'm gonna do my best to bring in the customers...!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
My  absolute best!

`image display end`  
**Ameth：**  
Karyl's really admirable...!  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'll tell you what happens next.  
Karyl goes to the train station wearing the kimono in order to attract new  
customers for the studio. She really, really puts her whole heart into it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Karyl may act tough, and have a really hard time trusting people,  
but I truly want her to know that kind people like that do exist.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And you're the one who's going to show her that world.  
Well, I'm not too worried about that part.  
  

---  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmmm... Huh...?When did we fall asleep?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I feel like I had the weirdest dream.  
This kimono was even in it...  
Huh? You had the same dream?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Is that right?  
I dunno if it's because of the dream, or what...  
But I feel kinda grateful for this kimono.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I was planning to spend the rest of New Year's cooped up at home,  
but maybe it's not a bad idea to take a page from your book and be  
helpful to others...  
  
**Narration：**  
Karyl smiled tenderly as she clutched the sash of her kimono.
