# Karyl (New Year) Episode 3
When {player} and Karyl see a flyer for a New Year's calligraphy contest featuring an extra-large maneki-neko as the grand prize, they practice together in order to win. In the end, they each only receive a small cat charm as a participation prize, but Karyl is secretly happy that they both have items that match.
  
## Subtitle: The Thrill of Calligraphy
  
**Narration：**  
After turning the con man over to Nightmare, {player}  
and Karyl are on their way to the Gourmet Guild's guildhouse  
when they notice a particular flyer posted to a bulletin board.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm?  
Why'd you stop all of a sudden?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Look at that.  
`Tag 1`  
**Karyl：**  
What, the flyer about the Guild Association's  
New Year's calligraphy contest?  
Well, considering the time of year, it isn't that unusual.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Look at the prize?  
The prize is...  
an extra-large maneki-neko?  
Is that something you actually want?  
It'll only get in the way.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That being said, a supersized maneki-neko does sound kinda cute...  
It would be nice to have in the guildhouse, I guess.  
  
**Karyl：**  
W-well, if you insist!  
If you really want that mega maneki-neko, I guess I have no choice but  
to cooperate with you!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You've got this!  
`Tag 2`  
**Karyl：**  
\"You've got this,\" my foot! You're taking part too!  
I thought that much was obvious.  
  
**Karyl：**  
All right.  
We've got all our calligraphy stuff here, so let's get to it!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Let's get to what?  
`Tag 3`  
**Karyl：**  
What do you mean, \"what\"?  
I'm obviously talking about calligraphy...  
  
Oh, right. You dunno what New Year's calligraphy is, do you?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'll show you an example. Just watch.  
  
**Karyl：**  
First, you grind the inkstick like this,  
then you write your goal for the new year using the brush.  
The paper has both a front and a back, so be careful.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? Which side's the back?  
I think it's the smooth side!  
Yeah, I'm right! Definitely!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Okay then, I'm gonna write.  
But what, exactly? It's a bit cliched, but maybe \"Live, laugh, love,\"  
or something?  
Whatever. It'll do for now.  
  
**Karyl：**  
\"Live, laugh, love...\" Phew.  
There, all done! Thoughts?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-why're you looking at me like that?! \"Your handwriting sucks,\" is that  
what you wanna say?  
Well, of course it does! I lived like an alley cat for  
years, so I never learned good penmanship!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Look, I've already given you an example, so now it's your turn to write!  
If both of us enter, our odds of winning that massive maneki-neko are  
double right off the bat!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'm gonna own this brush!  
`Tag 4`  
**Karyl：**  
Perfect response! That's the spirit!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I wasn't really expecting much...  
But you kinda suck at this too.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're sorry?  
There's no need to apologize.  
Just work hard at getting better.  
That's what we bought all this paper for.  
  
**Karyl：**  
On the other hand, I won't forgive you if you give up...  
Well, it's not like you would do such a thing.  
Anyway, let's just do as much as we can!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm... I think I'm a lot better than when we started,  
but something's still off.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You've gotten pretty good at it too.  
Well, I know that's not very convincing coming from someone who sucks,  
but...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, there's no need to look so happy!  
You're still just a noob!  
  
**Karyl：**  
All right, let's get back to practicing!  
Come on, chop chop!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Stop, flick, sweep—these little techniques are so important.  
Just knowing about them makes a world of difference.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You don't know them?  
I'll teach you, so just keep writing.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yep, that's the sweep. Then, that's the stop. And that's the flick.  
...  
I think.  
  
**Karyl：**  
What do you expect? I hardly know anything about calligraphy.  
But I feel like I really get it when I inspect your writing.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Can I?

**Karyl：**  
I think if you do it like this here,  
and then like this, it'll look much better...  
Then here it's like this...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?  
Hmmm... It's not going well, is it?  
When I looked at it from over there, I felt like I knew what I was  
talking about.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Again.  
Here, stop neatly. And here, a soft sweep.  
And then, a quick flick, just like that. Next, another—  
Hrk!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Isn't it supposed to be a stop?  
**Choice: (6)**  Was that a hiccup?  
`Tag 5`  
![112000302.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/112000302.webp)  
**Karyl：**  
Y-yeah, I know!  
The brush j-just slipped, that's all!

`Tag 6`  
![112000302.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/112000302.webp)  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah, that's right, a sudden bout of hiccups!  
O-oh no, what to do? And it was going so well!  
H-hiccup!  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-what should I do?  
If you think about it, this position is no different from hugging!  
  
**Karyl：**  
And yet, he's totally cool about it.  
Come on, at least get *a little bit* flustered...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
............  
  
**Karyl：**  
*sigh*  
I'm overthinking it like an idiot.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  You're not an idiot.  
`Tag 8`  
**Karyl：**  
As if I need the likes of you to tell me that!  
We're gonna keep practicing like this until I'm happy with the results!

**Man：**  
Dear participants, thank you all so much for your submissions!  
This concludes our New Year's calligraphy contest!  
We look forward to receiving your entries again next year!  
  
**Karyl：**  
We did the best we could,  
but I guess we just didn't practice enough to be able to win the jumbo  
maneki-neko.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But these maneki-neko charms we got for participating are really cute,  
so I don't mind.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Now we match.  
**Choice: (10)**  You're pretty happy, huh?  
`Tag 9`  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?!  
Oh yeah...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Now that you mention it,  
we will be matching.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I was gonna walk around with it, but do you think it'd be embarrassing if  
we both did? N-nobody's really gonna care, right?  
It's not a problem. Yeah, not a problem!  
  
Jump to tag 11  
`Tag 10`  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah, I am!  
It's nice to see your hard work take shape, isn't it?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? You're glad we have matching charms?  
What the heck are you saying, all of a sudden...?!  
  
`Tag 11`  
**Karyl：**  
W-well,  
it's not nice to treat things poorly.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm gonna take extra special care of this little charm,  
so you'd better not lose yours or anything, you hear?  
  
**Narration：**  
So said Karyl,  
as she gently held onto her new good luck charm.
