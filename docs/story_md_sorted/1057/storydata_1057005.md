## Subtitle: A Name and Its Value
  
**Narration：**  
{player} and Djeeta are in the middle of escorting  
someone from a nearby town to Landosol.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Well, here we are!  
Thanks for putting up with us the whole way.  
  
**Man：**  
Here's your reward. Gotta admit,  
I panicked a bit when those monsters turned up,  
 but you two  
sure are strong. Guess the word on the street was right.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
The word on the street?  
What have people been saying?  
  
**Man：**  
\"If you're around Landosol and need work done,  
then you're best off leaving it to skyfarers.\"  
  
**Man：**  
You barely hear about skyfarers and their crews these days,  
so I was kinda iffy on it at first,  
but now I'm glad I left things  
to you two. I'll hit you up next time, too.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
That's great to hear!  
Thank you so much!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Wow, did you hear that?!  
People are actually recommending us now!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
We've been getting plenty of work these days  
even without actively looking for it,  
but I didn't realize it's because we built a good reputation!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
That sure makes all the effort worth it.  
Now we just need the funds to buy an airship.  
Then we'll be a proper crew!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's keep it going.  
`Tag 1`  
**Djeeta：**  
Yeah! And then, when the time comes, we can take to the skies!  
Oh man, now I'm *really* motivated!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hahh!  
  
**Monster：**  
Rrrrghhhhh!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Down they go!  
 Next up,  
we've gotta deliver these goods to the beach!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hello!  
We've got some goods here scheduled for delivery!  
  
**Woman：**  
Over here! Thanks for that.  
Darling! The new net's here!  
Ah, right. Please, take this.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
What's this?  
  
**Woman：**  
One of our local goods. It won't go bad anytime soon,  
so feel free to eat it on the way back home.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Thank you!  
Last, but not least, we've got a merchant to escort. Let's go!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hah! Yahhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
Rrrrghhhhh!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Now is your chance! Get going!  
  
**Merchant：**  
Thanks! I'll leave this to you!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
You follow behind him!  
I'll handle the rest of the monsters!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Don't worry. I'll be fine!  
Haahhh! Yaaahhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
Rrrrghhhhh!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Phew... Today sure was hectic.  
Good thing that escort job was the last one.  
I might not've been able to go all-out if it wasn't—  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Ah?!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Ouch. That hurt...  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Eheheh. Goes to show how tired I am.  
...!  
Up we go.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
What's up?  
Oh, don't worry. I can walk just fine.  
Come on, we should get back to town before it gets dark.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Urgh...!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Carry her.  
`Tag 2`  
**Djeeta：**  
Whoa! H-hold up! What's the deal here?!  
Eee!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Err... You're not planning on running back to town, are you?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Don't worry about it. Really! I know you're tired as well!  
And, uh... Aren't I heavy?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  That armor's a bit...  
**Choice: (4)**  Light as a feather.  
`Tag 3`  
**Djeeta：**  
Yeah, I've plenty of equipment on, so—  
Hey, that's not what I meant! I was talking about my own wei—  
A-actually, you know what? Forget I said anything.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Djeeta：**  
R-really?  
I'm preeetty sure you just put more effort into holding me up there.  
How do you explain that one,  
mister?  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Djeeta：**  
Anyway! You don't need to take me all the way home,  
so don't push yourself. Okay?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Sorry...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  No need to apologize.  
`Tag 6`  
**Djeeta：**  
Honestly. How are you so kind?  
You'd think I'd be used to it, but it surprises me every time.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Well. If you're willing to go this far, then I shouldn't complain.  
Let me promise you this, though. If the same thing happens  
to you,  
 then I'll be right there to pick you up.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Thanks.  
  
**Narration：**  
Though said quietly, the warmth behind her words  
was more than apparent to {player}.
