**Narration：**  
Having finished their work for the day,  
{player} and Djeeta are taking a break on the outskirts of town.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
I got us some taiyaki and tea. Here's yours.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
According to the clerk, taiyaki's perfect for when you're tired.  
Or, to quote her, \"it's purrfect.\"  
  
**Djeeta：**  
*munch* Mmm!  
Freshly made, just the way I like it!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
How's yours?  
...  
Delicious?  
Great. That's what I was hoping to hear.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hmm? Is it just me, or did the taiyaki start shining?  
That can't be right...  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Whoa! It really is!  
W-what's the deal here?! It's so bright!  
  

---  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hmm? That's weird.  
I'm pretty sure I was meant to make a turn there...  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Man, how did I get lost this badly?  
Urgh... I'm gonna be late on my first day at this rate...  
  
**Djeeta：**  
I can't even see anyone with the same uniform as me.  
Hmm... Maybe I should get in touch with the school  
and have someone come pick me up.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Oh! That person's got the Tsubakigaoka uniform on!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Umm, excuse me!  
Hey! Wait up!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Off he goes...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Did you call out to me?  
`Tag 1`  
**Djeeta：**  
Whoa!  
Phew, you actually noticed.  
Umm... I'm trying to get to Tsubakigaoka High,  
but I kind of got lost.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
You're from there, aren't you?  
Please, help me out!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  No problem.  
`Tag 2`  
**Djeeta：**  
Thanks!  
What's your name, by the way?  
I'm Djeeta. I'll be a second year at Tsubakigaoka.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  We should hurry.  
`Tag 3`  
**Djeeta：**  
Hurry...? Oh, shoot! You're right!  
We'll make it if we run, so let's go!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
*pant, pant*  
Phew... We made it...  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Thanks a lot. I owe you one.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Don't worry. I can use the school map to get to the faculty lounge.  
You should hurry over to your classroom. We're both  
students here now, so I'm sure we'll see each other again soon.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
So yeah. Catch you later!  
And thanks again!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
What a nice person.  
Hopefully the people in my class are like that...  
  
**Teacher：**  
All that aside, I'm glad you managed to make it in time.  
We wouldn't want that happening again,  
so I'll ask if anyone's willing to come with you tomorrow.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
I'm sorry.  
You don't need to ask, though. I'll do it myself.  
I'd like to make friends with them as soon as possible.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Quite the outgoing one, aren't we? That's what I like to see.  
Well. Here's your new classroom.  
You ready to introduce yourself?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
I am, yes.  
I hope it goes well.  
  
**Teacher：**  
I'll go in and give them the rundown first, so wait here.  
Come in once I ask you to.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Okay.  
  
**Class Rep.：**  
Stand... Bow. Be seated.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
...Oh man. I'm starting to get nervous.  
Hopefully I can make some friends. Even just one...  
  
**Teacher：**  
Good morning, everyone.  
I've got some exciting news for you today.  
We've got a new transfer student joining us!  
  
**Student：**  
Oh yo! For real?!  
  
**Teacher：**  
She's from abroad as well,  
but her Japanese is really good.  
No need to worry about her not understanding you.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Come on in.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
...Right! Gotta write my name on the chalkboard first!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
That went well. Next up is a proper introduction!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Good morni—  
Err,  
good to meet you!  
I'm Djeeta! I hope we can all get along!  
  
**Teacher：**  
Take good care of her now, you hear?  
Now then. Your seat's right behind his.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
His...?  
Oh! It's you!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
So we're in the same class, then? That's a relief.  
Thanks again for helping me out!

**Ameth：**  
And there we have it. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Think of what you just saw as something of a dream.  
Chances are you'll forget about it the second you wake up,  
so no need to brood over it that much.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I guess that tendency of yours to help anyone and everyone  
can actually come in handy after all, huh? And hey,  
you even ended up in the same class. Talk about fate.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I know you're a fiend for helping others, but Djeeta  
seems like she's cut from the same cloth.  
If anything goes down,  
it's your job to support her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, that's enough for today.  
Catch you later. ♪  
  

---  
  
**Djeeta：**  
...Mmm...  
That sure was a weird dream...  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Even weirder is how I felt comfortable in a place  
I've never even seen before.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Oh, right! My taiyaki!  
Phew. Didn't drop it.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hey.  
Did you fall asleep as well?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I showed you the way to school.  
`Tag 4`  
**Djeeta：**  
Oh, so that person really was you! I knew it!  
The similarities were a pretty big giveaway, haha.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Have to admit, though.  
I'd have liked to go to the same school as you.  
Every day would have been super fun.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
As you know, I'm not from Landosol.  
I'm from a tiny village really far from here.  
I was the only one my age there, so I'd play by myself a lot.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
What's more, I started my training as soon as my dad left.  
Pretty much all my time went into that, so there's a part of me  
that wishes I got to experience that sort of stuff more.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
But well. Now I've got you.  
Life's been super fulfilling ever since we met.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Same here.  
`Tag 5`  
**Djeeta：**  
Ehehe. Thanks.  
It's funny, though.  
Somehow I knew you'd say that.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Well then. Let's ride this wave into  
tomorrow by lining up some work!  
  
**Narration：**  
Saying that, Djeeta grabbed {player}'s hand  
and dashed off to the nearest request board.
