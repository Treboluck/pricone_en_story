# Djeeta Episode 6
Djeeta and {player} are scouted by a major guild. Though they're unsure whether or not to accept at first, they eventually come to the conclusion that there's value in the freedom they have, and thus decline the offer.

**Narration：**  
{player} and Djeeta find themselves busier than ever  
thanks to the amount of job offers they have been receiving.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Phew... Having work's good and all,  
but it's getting kind of tough with just the two of us.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
We're probably gonna have to start balancing  
how much we take on.  
 Otherwise we'll end up  
working ourselves beyond exhaustion.  
  
**Woman：**  
Hey. You're Djeeta, aren't you?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
That's me. Is there something I can help you with?  
  
**Woman：**  
That's right. I've heard a lot about you and your crew.  
Enough so that I spent the whole day  
running about trying to find you, in fact.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
This sure doesn't sound like a job offer, at the very least.  
  
**Woman：**  
You're right... is what I'd like to say, but it's technically related.  
I'll be blunt. How does joining our guild sound?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Well then. That makes se—  
Wait, what?! Wh-what's this all about?!  
  
**Woman：**  
Makes sense that you'd be surprised.  
Let me clarify, though.  
This isn't a show of pity for a crew without an airship.  
Far from it, in fact.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Ahaha...  
H-holding back no punches, are we?  
  
**Man：**  
Our guild passed the  
fifty member mark just recently.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
F-fifty?!  
  
**Woman：**  
We travel all over the place, taking on various jobs wherever  
we stop. In fact, we'll be leaving here the day after tomorrow.  
  
**Man：**  
That includes hunting down vicious monsters,  
escorting large groups of merchants, all that good stuff.  
It's tough work, but the pay is more than worth it.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Makes sense. The tougher the job,  
the better the pay is.  
  
**Woman：**  
As you can guess, every day poses a new kind of danger to us.  
And that, in turn, means we can't let anyone and everyone in.  
We don't have the leeway to support those that can't keep up.  
  
**Man：**  
Now for the main point. We've heard plenty about you.  
And we've judged that you pass our standards with flying colors.  
Moreso considering you've done so much with only two of you.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Ehehe.  
Thank you.  
  
**Woman：**  
Which brings us back to the question.  
We'd love to have you in our guild.  
  
**Man：**  
It works out for both parties, too.  
We get two new, reliable members,  
while you can make much more money. Sounds good, right?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Err, umm...  
I have to be honest, this kind of hit me out of nowhere...  
  
**Woman：**  
Take some time to think about it. We'll wait.  
See you later.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
And off they go...  
I'm kind of at a loss here.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
I'm... gonna go home for today.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
They made the effort to come invite us,  
so it's only fair that I think it through properly.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
This is about our future, too. So even more so.  
But yeah, see you tomorrow!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
*sigh*  
I dunno what to do...  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Getting scouted by a guild like that is the last thing I expected...  
They've got the reputation too,  
so we'd be able to do all sorts of big jobs with them.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
And we'd be travelling around a lot too,  
which makes finding leads on {player}'s memories easier.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
We'd have to disband the crew,  
but joining them seems like the best way to achieve our goals...  
  
**Djeeta：**  
It'd be the fastest way, at the very least.  
So why am I being so indecisive about it?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Something on your mind?  
`Tag 1`  
**Djeeta：**  
H-how come you're here?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Your concerns are my concerns.  
`Tag 2`  
**Djeeta：**  
Thanks. As reliable as always, aren't you?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Now that you're here, let's think through this together.  
It's both of our futures in question, after all.  
  
**Narration：**  
The day after.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hello.  
  
**Woman：**  
Oh, hello.  
  
Seems like you made your decision, based on your expression.  
Which way did the dice roll?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
We did.  
And well...  
  
**Djeeta：**  
As much as we appreciate the offer, we've decided not to accept.  
We're really sorry!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
But, well... We thought about it long and hard.  
And this is the answer we're satisfied with.  
  
**Man：**  
Do you mind if I ask why?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
It's my dad who inspired me to become a skyfarer.  
I don't want to give up on that inspiration.  
I want us to be as free as possible.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
I want us to experience things in a way only we can.  
It sounds super selfish, I know. But I just can't give up on that.  
I can't give up on my dream!  
  
**Woman：**  
You sound determined, at the very least.  
What a bummer. It's not easy to find people like you two,  
  
you know.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
I'm sorry...  
  
**Man：**  
Hey now, don't sweat it!  
We've been all over the place at this point, so trust me.  
We're used to it.  
  
**Woman：**  
You took the time to think it through properly, though.  
We appreciate that a lot more than you know.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Thank you. Your offer meant a lot to us, too.  
  
**Woman：**  
I do wish we could work together, but well,  
there's little sense in trying to force it.  
 You've got your  
dreams and aspirations, so let us cheer you on, at the very least.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Thank you! I hope things work out for you, too!  
  
**Woman：**  
We'll be off, then. Here's hoping we meet again someday!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
And off they go.  
Hey. Are you really fine with this?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
If anything, it would make sense for you to go with them.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I've only got one leader. And her name is Djeeta.  
`Tag 3`  
**Djeeta：**  
Oh, you! Thanks. Don't forget, though.  
  
I was only able to reach this conclusion thanks to you.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
This isn't about me anymore.  
Your memories are the priority now.  
If I want my dreams to come true, then that's down to me.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
So yeah. Let's give it all we've got. Together.  
  
**Narration：**  
Sharing a firm handshake, {player} and Djeeta  
swore to give their all for their future.
