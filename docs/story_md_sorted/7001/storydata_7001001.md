## Subtitle: The Investigation Continues
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh! Those monsters dropped more treasure!  
Now this is the good stuff, haha!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Man, I really messed up.  
I'd have brought a bigger bag  
if I'd known we'd be swimming in treasure.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Now now, Makoto.  
I won't judge you for giving in to the allure of treasure,  
but let's not forget our main objective here.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
This isn't a simple treasure hunt, my friend.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sorry, you're right. My bad.  
That goes without saying, right, Yui?  
  
**Yui：**  
Of course. We're here to investigate the tower  
and find any leads on Mr. Knight's memories.  
  
**Makoto：**  
How about it, Kasumi?  
After making it this far,  
I assume you've got a few theories swimming around in your head by now.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Not quite, I'm afraid.  
I don't have enough information to work with yet.  
  
**Makoto：**  
So we just gotta push on, then.  
That treasure's all mine, baby!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Was I talking to a brick wall this whole time?  
  
**Yui：**  
You could at least pretend you were listening, Makoto...
