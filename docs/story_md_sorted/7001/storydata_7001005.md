# A Happy Mystery
A dream sees Kasumi trying to get to the bottom of a mystery involving the contents of {player}'s lunch box being switched. The truth becomes apparent based on how Makoto and Yui react, but Kasumi keeps it to herself, instead proposing that they all eat lunch together.

**Kasumi：**  
Phew. That one was rather strong, wasn't it?  
Are you all okay?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yeah, I'm good.  
How about you, Yui?  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight kept me safe, so I'm fine.  
Thank you.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Haha. The two of you are getting along just fine, aren't you?  
Good stuff.  
Hey, wait a minute. What's this thing?  
  
![700100503.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/700100503.webp)  
**Yui：**  
That monster we just defeated dropped it, didn't it?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh!  
This might be the key to recovering {player}'s memories!  
Quick! Try holding it!  
  
`image display end`  
**Kasumi：**  
...Well, so much for that. It's not doing anything at all.  
My fault for jumping to conclusions.  
  
**Makoto：**  
No point in brooding over it, I'd say.  
Ahh man, I'm hungry. Let's have some grub!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Agreed.  
I'm rather exhausted myself.  
  
**Yui：**  
Same here.  
Give me a second, and I'll whip something up for us.  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh? Huuuh?!  
Mr. Knight! Look! That thing's shining!  
  
**Makoto：**  
What the?!  
You're right!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Wh-why is it so bright?!  
It's going to engulf the whole room!  
  
**Yui, Makoto & Kasumi：**  
?!  
  

---  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh? Hello there.  
Quite the coincidence bumping into you at the canteen today.  
I assume you're having bread for lunch?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm? Why is it a coincidence, you ask?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Well,  
because you always bring a packed lunch on Mondays, of course.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's basic nature for a detective to memorize their target's  
routines, you know. Not much worth being surprised over.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The question is how this situation came about, though.  
Ah. Hold on. This is where my powers of deduction come into play.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You usually bring your lunch, yet today you're here to buy bread...  
Hm... Hmmm...  
Ah. I've got it.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You opened your lunch box, only to find that it was empty.  
How does that sound?!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ahaha. Sorry.  
That was just a blind guess.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  How'd you know?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kasumi：**  
Hehe. It was nothing special. Anyone hoping to be a detective should be able to— Wait.  
What?! I was right?!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Th-that's honestly not what I was expecting.  
A missing lunch isn't exactly a common occurrence, after all.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Um. Do you mind if I accompany you to your classroom?  
This is a mystery that needs solving,  
so let's carry out an investigation together.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
There's no time to waste.  
Let's get going!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  But then the bread'll sell out...  
`Tag 2`  
**Kasumi：**  
Now's not the time for that!  
We have bigger fish to fry!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Sure, the bread may sell out.  
But that's nothing compared to leaving this mystery unsolved!  
So let's get going!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Sorry for the intrusion...  
Ah. So this is the fabled lunch box.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's quite big. Just the size you'd expect a boy to carry.  
Proof that you're eating well, too.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Huh? This feels a little bit... heavy, doesn't it?  
Certainly not the weight of an empty lunch box, I'd say.  
Do you mind if I open it?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Thank you.  
Let's see what awaits us inside.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Well, this sure looks like a lunch to me.  
Huh? You're sure it was empty before?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Now that's odd.  
But if your memory serves you correctly, then...  
Hehe... Hehehe...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
This is it! Precisely the sort of mystery I've been hoping for!  
Woo-hoo! Today is the best!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Huh?!  
S-sorry. I got a little bit too excited.  
Now everyone's staring at me. How embarrassing...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
U-um, I'd really like to solve this mystery.  
Ideally with your help.  
We can both work together to uncover the truth.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You'd love to help? Thank you.  
First thing's first. We should check every nook and cranny of this lunch box.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm. It certainly looks like your standard lunch box...  
Wait a minute.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Does someone else normally make your lunch for you?  
Or do you make it yourself?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I see. Your mother makes it for you, does she?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Which means there's no way for me to confirm whether or not  
the lunch before us was made at your home or not.  
That makes things a bit complicated... Huh?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hey. Is it just me, or does the amount of food not match up  
with the box size? Look at all the empty space in the corner.  
Is that normal for your lunches?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's not? I see.  
Hm... Your average girl could probably eat this amount and feel full.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's too early to draw any conclusions,  
but it wouldn't be too farfetched to say that the current  
contents of your lunch box were made for a girl to eat.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The motive is a mystery in and of itself, though.  
Why would someone switch the lunch boxes in the first place?  
  
**???：**  
Huh. What's up, {player}?  
You skipping out on lunch?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Heh. I've got it. You forgot your lunch, didn't you?  
Then why don't you ask Yui to share some of—  
What the?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Wh-what's the deal?! Why's your lunch box full?  
Err. I-I mean, what's taking you so long to eat? Haha.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Why're you panicking?  
**Choice: (4)**  What was that about my lunch box?  
`Tag 3`  
**Makoto：**  
Wh-what?!  
I'm not panicking! *You're* panicking!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Makoto：**  
Gulp! N-nothing. Nothing at all.  
Just thought your lunch, uh, looked real tasty.  
Yeah. Ahaha. Ha.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Yui：**  
Oh, there you are!  
Um, {player}...  
  
**Yui：**  
W-wait, Makoto?!  
Sheesh. What are you up to now?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Whoa! D-don't pull so hard, Yui!  
  
**Yui：**  
Shush! Just come with me!  
U-um. Sorry for the bother, {player}!  
U-urgh! Why are you so heavy, Makoto?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
H-heavy?!  
Did you really have to put it like that?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Especially after I... Ah, whatever.  
Catch you around, {player}.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Excuse me. Could you please wait a moment?  
Yui Kusano and Makoto Aki, I believe your names were?  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh? Y-yeah, that's right. And you are?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Can't say I recognize you.  
You a first year?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I am. My name is Kasumi Kirihara.  
Apologies for coming into your classroom unannounced.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
A word, if I may.  
I'm afraid that there won't be any  
bread left at the canteen by now, Yui.  
  
**Yui：**  
...?  
Huh?! How did you...?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hm? What're you talking about?  
Yui brought her lunch today.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Yup. Bingo.  
Their reactions told me everything I needed to know.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The food in {player}'s lunch box  
originally came from Yui's own lunch box.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Furthermore, it was Makoto who ate {player}'s original lunch.  
A devilish tactic to ensure that he and Yui would eat lunch together.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And how would this plan come together?  
Simple. Yui would share her own with him.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Eating up {player}'s lunch was all well and good, but  
little did Makoto know that she had been caught in the process by Yui.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Actually,  
it seems Yui forgot to pack a lunch today.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh? Now you've totally lost me.  
You said your name's Kasumi, right?  
How would you possibly know that—  
  
**Yui：**  
...  
  
**Makoto：**  
What's got you all frozen up, Yui?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Yui, out of sheer guilt, replaced the contents of {player}'s  
lunch box with her own.  
A fact that, ironically enough, Makoto wasn't aware of.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That concludes my take on the matter.  
As for the truth behind it all, well...  
I suppose leaving it unsaid would be the wise move here.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Um, Yui.  
I'd like to make a suggestion, if I may.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You won't be able to get any bread at this time,  
so why don't the four of us eat together?  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh? The four of us?

![700100501.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/700100501.webp)  
**Makoto：**  
Come on, Yui.  
Give him a nice, big mouthful.  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh?! Why?!  
N-not like I don't want to or anything, but still!  
  
**Makoto：**  
No time for chat. He looks pretty hungry.  
  
**Yui：**  
Sh-sheesh. You can be so forceful sometimes, you know that?  
O-okay then. O-open wide!  
  
**Yui：**  
H-how is it? It doesn't taste weird, does it?  
It's delicious?  
Th-thank goodness... That's a big relief.  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh? You want another bite?  
S-sure! Give me a second... H-here you go!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hahaha. You sure make it look delicious, don't you?  
Well, I guess we can call this a win.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Say. The more the merrier,  
so why don't you join in?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh?!  
N-no way. I ain't doing anything like that.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I mean, you're not making much progress with your own food.  
I'd hate to see it go to waste if you can't finish it.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Part of me had the sneaking suspicion that you might already be full.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Wha—?!  
D-don't be silly.  
Hahaha...  
  
**Makoto：**  
F-fine, fine.  
Here, {player}. You can have some of mine.  
O-open wide?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Dang. Didn't expect you to open *that* wide.  
You must be pretty hungry.  
Huh? You're practically starving?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ahh, right. Guess it makes sense, all things considered.  
Sorry, I should have realized that.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hm? What things considered?  
D-don't ask me!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Anyway... How is it?  
Doubt it can match up to Yui's, but it should still be pretty decent.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh? You're jealous of my parents' cooking?  
Come on, man! Really?!  
I made it! You're eating my cooking!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Man. Shouldn't have even bothered...  
Hey. Why's your mouth open again?  
Huh? It was so delicious that you want another bite?  
  
**Makoto：**  
W-well, you don't say.  
Sheesh. Guess you can have another one then, h-haha. ♪  
Hope you're ready! Open wide! ♪  
  
![700100502.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/700100502.webp)  
**Yui：**  
Ahaha. He looks so happy.  
I bet you're feeling good about him complimenting your cooking, too.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Y-Yui?!  
L-look. I just fed him 'cause he was hungry, okay?!  
  
**Yui：**  
Hehe.  
Sure. Let's leave it at that.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Argh! Don't you play with me, girl!  
  
**Yui：**  
Hm... This really won't be enough to fill {player}'s  
stomach though, will it?  
  
**Yui：**  
Hey, Kasumi.  
How about you share some of yours with him as well?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Me?! Really?!  
V-very well. Here you go...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm? You want to know about the truth behind this whole incident?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Let's not sweat the minor details, shall we?  
It's entirely possible it was all a misunderstanding, too.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
More importantly, we have food that must be consumed.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Here you go. Open wide.  
Hehe. You're kind of like a puppy. It's adorable.  
  

---  
  
`image display end`  
**Makoto：**  
A puppy, huh?  
Haha. I get where you're coming from.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ah! Good to know I have a fellow comrade!  
How do I put this...  
Your heart sort of skips a beat when he looks at you, doesn't it?  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh?! S-skips a beat?  
Kasumi, don't tell me you...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Now hold up.  
Just so we're clear,  
someone else has first dibs on {player}—  
  
**Kasumi：**  
W-wait! You've got it all wrong!  
I just wanted to say that there's times when he  
seems really cute, that's all...! Err. Uh-oh.  
  
**Yui：**  
Ah! Ahhhhhh!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Should've known this would happen.  
*sigh* Yui's got a long road ahead of her...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Come on, Yui. Don't let her get the advantage!  
Give him another big helping of food!  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh?! O-okay!  
Um, open wide!  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh! S-sorry! Did I give you too much?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Whoa! This ain't good! He's choking!  
Kasumi! Give him something to drink! Quick!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
S-something to drink?!  
E-err, I have this. But then it'd be an indirect kiss...  
  
**Yui：**  
A-an indirect kiss?!  
Nope! That's not allowed!  
  

---  
  
**Yui：**  
Mmm...  
H-huh? Where am I...?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Looks like we're still inside the tower.  
That said, what was that just now?  
  
**Yui：**  
Pretty sure I was dreaming...  
We were all sharing our lunch together.  
I also remember us wearing strange clothes...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hm? Hold up, Yui.  
That's pretty similar to the dream I had.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Likewise.  
What's going on here?  
Did we all share the same hallucination or something?  
  
**Yui：**  
Maybe...  
I'm not sure why, though,  
but those clothes seemed awfully familiar.  
  
**Makoto：**  
You thought so too?  
I kinda got the same feeling.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm... I'm not one for making assumptions without a proper basis,  
but it's hard to ignore your takes on this.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
We know this tower has a connection to {player}'s  
memories, but what if the same holds true for us as well?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hehe. Now this is a mystery worth solving!  
Climbing those seemingly endless stairs sure was worth it!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hey, {player}. Where are you going?  
Huh? There's something over there?  
  
**Makoto：**  
This, uh, sure feels familiar.  
Hey! You might wanna stay away from whatever it is.  
  
**Yui：**  
Hey! It started shining once he got close to it!  
Ah! This is warp magic!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Here we go again, huh?!  
Whatever!  
Splitting up is asking for trouble, so let's jump in at once!  
  
**Yui, Makoto & Kasumi：**  
One, two, three!  
  

---  
  
**Yui：**  
Where did it take us this time?  
Huh? Isn't this the first floor?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Whaaaaaat?! Who came up with a trap like that?!  
You telling me we gotta do that all over again?!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Not quite, it seems.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Look.  
The spell that sent us here in the first place is still active.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
In other words,  
if we jump into it again, it'll take us back to where we were.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Got it.  
Okay then, let's jump right back in—!  
  
**Yui：**  
Makoto, wait.  
I don't think I have enough magical energy left to fight...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And I'm just plain exhausted.  
Now's our best time to retreat, I'd say.  
Let's leave the rest for another day.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
We're one step closer to solving this mystery.  
That's worth being satisfied over.  
  
**Makoto：**  
If that's the case, then let's head back to my folks' tavern!  
Don't worry, it'll be on the house.  
  
**Yui：**  
That sounds good to me!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I wouldn't mind joining, either.  
Hehe. Which means the four us will be eating together again.  
Just like in that dream we shared.  
  
**Yui：**  
That dream...?  
W-waugh...  
  
**Makoto：**  
C-come on.  
Don't remind her about it.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
O-oh...  
Sorry.  
That was my mistake. Forget I said anything.  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus their silent journey back to Landosol began.
