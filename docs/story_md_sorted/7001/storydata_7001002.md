# Love Is War
{player} offers to carry Yui's bag for her, but she refuses to let him burden himself even more. Noticing this, Makoto pulls her aside and tells her to follow the advice written in a magazine Yui reads every month.
  
## Subtitle: Love Is War
  
**Yui：**  
Phew. We've come pretty far.  
Look at all the treasure we have, too.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm...  
Netting ourselves some treasure isn't exactly a bad thing,  
but having to carry it all certainly is.  
  
**Yui：**  
That's true.  
The monsters are getting stronger too,  
so we need to be quick on our feet.  
  
**Yui：**  
Hm? What's wrong, Mr. Knight?  
Huh? You're sorry for not noticing?  
  
**Yui：**  
You'll carry my bag for me?  
D-don't worry about it!  
You're already carrying your own share!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sheesh.  
Yui. Get over here.  
  
**Makoto：**  
You're doing it all wrong, girl.  
You read last month's \"Your Coach in Love,\" right?  
Love is war, and you need to let yourself be spoiled!  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh? I mean, yeah.  
It did mention that. Why are you bringing it up now, though?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Listen up. You gotta take advantage of the situation.  
\"Thanks! Wow! You're so strong and hunky, Mr. Knight!\"  
Hit him with something like that! Aim right for the heart!  
  
**Yui：**  
D-do you honestly think I could say something that embarrassing?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I don't care if you can or can't! Just do it!  
That's the whole reason you keep reading  
that magazine every month, isn't it?  
  
**Yui：**  
It is, but...  
I'm just not ready to do it.  
What about you? Could you say something like that with a straight face?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Urgh... Th-this ain't about me!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
*sigh*  
Am I the only one that remembers why we came here?
