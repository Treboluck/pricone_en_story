Yui, Makoto and Kasumi make their way to the Tower of Luna along with {player}. A seemingly inactive warp spell reacts to {player}'s presence, sending the party inside the tower.
  
## Subtitle: The Exploration Begins!
  
**Narration：**  
A giant tower appears almost out nowhere in Astraea.  
Yui, Makoto, Kasumi and {player} set out to  
uncover the truth behind the mysterious structure.  
  
**Yui：**  
So this is what the Tower of Luna looks like up close.  
This place is our ticket to regaining Mr. Knight's memories, isn't it?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sure seems like it.  
  
**Makoto：**  
It matches up almost perfectly with the tower mentioned  
in that old book we found a while back.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Indeed. There's no room for doubt there.  
  
**Makoto：**  
And with that said, now we just need to make our way in.  
Yui. The place mentioned in that book was around here, right?  
  
**Yui：**  
Yeah.  
There should be a shrine that'll guide us to the entrance.  
  
**Makoto：**  
There's too many monsters to make it by boat.  
And there wasn't a proper entrance as far as we could see, either.  
  
**Yui：**  
Yeah.  
Hopefully we can find a clue or two—  
  
**Yui：**  
Wait, Mr. Knight? Where are you going?  
Huh? There's something strange over there?  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh. Does this have warp magic built into it?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Doesn't seem like it's active though, does it?  
Hey, {player}. You might not wanna get too close.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Whoa?! It just activated out of the blue!  
What's the deal here?!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I have a theory, Makoto.  
The spell seems to have reacted to his presence.  
  
**Yui：**  
That proves the tower has some sort of connection to him!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
All right! Let's all jump in at the same time!  
Is everyone ready?  
Then let's go!  
  
**Yui, Makoto & Kasumi：**  
One, two, three!  
  

---  
  
**Yui：**  
Mmm...  
Uhh, where are we?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sure looks like the inside of the tower to me.  
Haha! We did it!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That went well. And now that we're inside,  
it's time to uncover the mysteries that lay ahead.  
Let's get exploring, shall we?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Aww yeah!  
Time to finally get to the bottom of what's going on with  
{player} and his memories!  
  
**Yui：**  
Let's go, Mr. Knight!  
We might just find something crucial in here!
