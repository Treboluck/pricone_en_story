# Twinkle Wish Episode 2
Twinkle Wish come across an old lady in peril during a job, who turns out to be part of a trap set by bandits. Hiyori, unaware, wipes them out, collecting what would turn out to be a genuine Sol Orb from them in the process.

**Narration：**  
Having taken on a delivery job, the members of the newly formed  
Twinkle Wish make their way towards the Elven Forest.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Thanks for agreeing to help out! It means a lot!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That's what friends are for.  
**Choice: (2)**  It's no big deal.  
`Tag 1`  
**Hiyori：**  
Eheheh. Really though, thanks!  
This job'll go a lot smoother with you around!

`Tag 2`  
**Hiyori：**  
It IS a big deal!  
Don't worry, we'll pay you back in kind!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rei：**  
That said, there's a little too much  
here for the four of us to handle on our own.  
I pray for the day when Hiyori thinks before taking on a job.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
M-my bad...  
  
**Yui：**  
Don't worry, Rei's just saying that.  
It's thanks to you that we've got so much work coming in.  
I know she appreciates it as much as I do.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, Yui!  
Thanks for the warm words!  
  
**Rei：**  
No one spoils quite like you do, Yui.  
Wait. What's that up ahead?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
*staaaare*  
Whoa! An old lady's collapsed!  
We gotta help her!  
  
**Yui：**  
Wait up!  
Rei, Mr. Knight! Let's go after her!  
  
**Rei：**  
Yui!  
Well, I can't say I'm surprised by this turn of events.  
Let's follow suit.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Urghhh...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey! Are you okay?!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
W-who might you be?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
We're just a guild in the middle of delivering some goods.  
More importantly though,  
what happened to you?  
  
**Old Woman：**  
I lost sight of my son while on our way to the Elven Forest.  
I can only hope that he and the rest of the party made it there safely...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey, that's where we're heading as well!  
Don't worry, we'll get you there safe and sound!  
  
**Rei：**  
You do realize how far behind schedule that'll put us, right?  
It would be much smarter to split up after tending to her wounds.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
She's right.  
I would hate to get in the way of an important job, so please...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
No way!  
I'd rather die than abandon someone in need of help!  
Come on!  
It won't be a hassle. I swear!  
  
**Yui：**  
I'm honestly fine with it...  
  
**Rei：**  
Hiyori's the guildmaster, so she gets the final say.  
There's no guessing how things will play out, so let's just push on.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'm starting to get worried.  
`Tag 4`  
**Rei：**  
Likewise.  
It goes without saying that only a scumbag would be  
willing to abandon their mother in a place like this. Let's keep our guard up.  
  
**Yui：**  
Is it just me, or are there a lot more monsters  
popping up here today than usual?  
Hey, Rei. You don't think that...  
  
**Rei：**  
Well spotted.  
Chances are they're people in monster's clothing.  
A tactic often used by bandits, no less.  
That old lady might not be what she seems.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Oh, there he is! My son's over there!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Really?!  
Lemme go check!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
(What's the deal here, Mom?! They're way too strong!)  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh come on, another one?!  
Get a clue already!  
  
**Monster：**  
Rrrrghhhhh!  
(What is she, some kind of one punch cat?!)  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Oh no, oh no...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Phew, that was close.  
Are you okay?  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Y-you leave me no choice!  
  
**Rei：**  
Not good! She's planning something!  
  
**Yui：**  
Get away from her, Hiyori!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Stay away! Stay away, I tell you!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
H-hey, calm down!  
I cleared out all the monsters already!  
  
**Monster?：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
(Come on, troops!)  
  
**Monster?：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
(Time for some payback!)  
  
**Rei：**  
We're surrounded!  
  
**Yui：**  
What should we do?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Hiyori! Don't hold back!  
**Choice: (6)**  Hiyori! Let's wipe them out!  
`Tag 5`  
**Hiyori：**  
Got it!  
You stay here, ma'am!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
H-hey, wait a minute!  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Hiyori：**  
Righto!  
You stay behind me, ma'am!  
There's no need for you to fight, so I'll be taking that!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
What the?!  
Give me my knife back!  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Hiyori：**  
I won't let any of you near her!  
Let's gooo!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Oh, shoot!  
  
**Rei：**  
They've split up! Now's our chance!  
Clear out the easy targets first!  
  
**Yui：**  
Right!  
Let's go, Mr. Knight!  
  
**Monster?：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
(Eeek!)  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Down. You. *Go*!  
  
**Monster?：**  
Rrrrghhhhh!  
(Arrgghhh!)  
  
**Rei：**  
That was much easier than expected.  
Though I guess we have Hiyori to thank for that.  
  
**Yui：**  
I get the feeling that she would have wiped them  
all out even if we weren't here.  
  
**Monster?：**  
Spare me, please! I'm begging you!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Did that monster just speak?!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Dammit! You got us good! We submit!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Wait, what?!  
We took down all the monsters already!  
  
**Yui：**  
I don't know how to break this to you Hiyori,  
but that old lady was trying to trick us.  
Along with all the people pretending to be monsters.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Well that's intere—  
...  
Wait, what?!  
For realsies?!  
  
**Rei：**  
She certainly wouldn't be submitting if that weren't the case.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
No way... How'd I manage to get tricked...?  
  
**Rei：**  
Not to rub salt in the wound, but the rest of us  
noticed something wasn't right from the outset.  
Though it's thanks to you that everything went well in the end.  
  
**Yui：**  
Yeah. The fact that you trusted her so much is what  
helped us get through all the ambushes safely.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yui, Rei...!  
I sure hope that's the case...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Look, take this! Take it and let us off!  
It took a lot of effort to get our hands on that!  
A proper treasure, if there ever was one! So please!  
  
**Rei：**  
Wait a minute, this is a Sol Orb!  
It's the same as the ones in my dreams!  
Very well. We'll gladly take this.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Great! Then—  
  
**Rei：**  
You didn't think we'd actually let you off, did you?  
I very much doubt that you obtained this through legitimate means.  
Split up and tie them up. Nice and tightly.  
  
**Yui & Hiyori：**  
Got it!  
  
**Rei：**  
According to Caon, those bandits had been targeting all  
sorts of people around that area.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh...  
  
**Yui：**  
Don't let it get to you.  
How about some more taiyaki?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
You are gravely mistaken if you think food will cheer me up.  
That won't stop me from taking it,  
though. *munch*  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Mmm! Delish!  
Hey, Rei. Why's that bag shining?  
  
**Rei：**  
Oh, so it is. I never even noticed.  
This is the bag I got from that old lady...  
  
**Yui：**  
It wasn't shining back then, was it?  
This light's kind of familiar, too. It reminds me of those dreams.  
  
**Rei：**  
Same here. It only started to shine when  
we brought it close to the tower too.  
Which means...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It's the real deal! A real Sol Orb!  
Heck yeah!  
  
**Rei：**  
Shh! Keep your voice down!  
This means that there's other Sol Orbs to be found.  
And if we do just that, then we'll be able to climb the Tower of Sol!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Sorted, then!  
We've gotta go to all sorts of  
places and gather them all up!  
  
**Yui：**  
I knew it! There really was more to those dreams!  
  
**Rei：**  
Indeed!  
  
**Narration：**  
Spurned on by the radiance of the Sol Orb,  
the trio set their hearts and aspirations  
to the adventures that awaited them.
