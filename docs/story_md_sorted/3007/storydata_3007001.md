A chance meeting under the Tower of Sol leads Yui, Rei and Hiyori to the realization that they've all been seeing the same dreams. Chance leads to fate, and thus Twinkle Wish is born.

**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**???：**  
A monster!  
Watch out!  
  
**???：**  
Hiyori, follow me! We’ll strike first!  
  
**???：**  
Whoa, hold up Rei!  
Yui, back us up!  
  
**???：**  
Mr. Knight! What should I do?  
  
**???：**  
Okay!  
I’ll seal its movements first!  
  
**???：**  
Down you go!  
  
**???：**  
Hah!  
  
**Monster：**  
Rrrrghhhhh!  
  
**???：**  
Phew... Good job, everyone!  
The monsters really do get stronger around this area, though.  
  
**???：**  
Indeed. Though we’re not lagging behind, either.  
We’ve got plenty of orbs to prove it.  
We just need a few more at this point.  
  
**???：**  
Yup, yup!  
The four of us will reach the peak in no time!  
And once we do...  
  
**???：**  
We’ll have our wish granted!  
  
**Yui：**  
That was the same dream as always...  
  
**Yui：**  
I wonder who the people that appear in it are? And then there’s  
the idea of having your wish granted at the Tower of Sol’s peak.  
I always thought that was just a fairy tale for children...  
  
**Yui：**  
I can’t remember their faces that well,  
but it’s clear how much I value them  
within the dream itself.  
  
**Yui：**  
It’d be nice if I could meet them for real sometime.  
  
**Yui：**  
Wahh!  
  
**Rei：**  
Oh, I’m sorry.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I’m so sorry! Are you both okay?  
  
**Yui：**  
Don’t worry. It was just a light bump.  
  
**Rei：**  
Thank goodness. I was so fixated on the tower that  
I didn’t pay attention to my surroundings.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yeah, I was just kind of staring at the Tower of Sol  
without thinking about where I was going.  
  
**Yui：**  
Don’t worry about it.  
Truth is,  
I was doing the exact same.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh!  
So we all had our eyes on the tower, then!  
  
**Rei：**  
Quite the coincidence.  
Oh, I ought to introduce myself.  
I’m—  
  
**Woman：**  
Someone please help! I’ve been robbed!  
  
**Thief：**  
Tch! Quit the yapping and let go, wench!  
  
**Woman：**  
Ahh! Someone please get my purse back!  
  
**Thief：**  
Outta the way! Beat it or get beat!  
  
**Yui：**  
He’s robbing someone in broad daylight?!  
  
**Rei：**  
He’s running in our direction, too.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Hey. How about the three of us catch him?  
  
**Yui：**  
C-can we even manage it?  
  
**Rei：**  
It’s none of my concern, I’m afraid.  
Though I’m more than willing to give him  
what’s for if he tries to force us out of the way.  
  
**Thief：**  
Scram, kids! I’ll mow you down if you don’t!  
  
**Rei：**  
You stop him in his tracks!  
We’ll deal with the rest!  
  
**Yui：**  
Okay, I’ll try! Hah!  
  
**Thief：**  
Woah!  
You got some real guts if you’re tryna step to me!  
  
**Yui：**  
Eek!  
I-I’m sorry!  
  
**Rei：**  
Good job! Now he can’t move!  
Hah!  
  
**Thief：**  
Graagh!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
And now for the finishing touch!  
That purse doesn’t belong to you!  
Punchy-punch!  
  
**Thief：**  
Aaaaaaghhh!  
  
**Soldier：**  
You’ll be coming with me, criminal scum!  
I’ll make you spit out any other felonies you’ve racked up, too!  
  
**Thief：**  
Urgh! Dammit!  
  
**Woman：**  
Thank you so, so much!  
I’ll never forget this debt! I swear!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
We did it!  
Mission accomplished—no problemo!  
  
**Yui：**  
Yeah!  
I can’t believe it went so well!  
  
**Rei：**  
We owe a lot of that to you for stopping his movements.  
Perhaps now’s the best time to introduce ourselves.  
I’m Rei. It’s a pleasure to meet the both of you.  
  
**Yui：**  
I’m Yui.  
The two of you sure packed a punch with your attacks.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
And I’m Hiyori!  
Sure didn’t feel like the first time we teamed up, huh?  
Reminds me of that one dream I’ve been having a bunch!  
  
**Yui：**  
A dream...? Say, why were both of you looking at the tower?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Well, uhh...  
This is the first time I’ve seen the Tower of Sol in person,  
but I’ve seen it plenty of times in my dreams!  
  
**Yui：**  
Those dreams wouldn’t happen to involve  
going on adventures with other people, would they?  
And then...  
  
**Rei：**  
They all aim for the Tower of Sol’s peak, hoping to have their wish fulfilled.  
Am I right, Yui?  
  
**Yui：**  
H-how did you know?!  
  
**Rei：**  
Because I’ve been having similar dreams, of course.  
Over and over, with no sign of stopping.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey, wait a minute!  
Does that mean you two are the people  
that’re with me in those dreams?!  
  
**Rei：**  
I can’t say for sure.  
It is likely that we’ve all been having the exact same dreams, though.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Let’s find out, then!  
We can get stronger together,  
just like in those dreams!  
  
**Yui：**  
Then we can aim for the Tower of Sol’s peak!  
  
**Rei：**  
Not a bad idea. There must be some meaning behind this.  
Plus,  
I already intended to aim for the peak myself.  
Having some comrades along the way would be reassuring.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Sorted, then!  
Here’s to a bright future for us!  
  
**Rei：**  
Indeed.  
We should get the guild application sorted out today.  
  
**Yui：**  
Yeah! I’m looking forward to it!  
  
**Rei：**  
What should we do about the guild name and guildmaster, though?  
I’m not quite fit to be a leader, I’m afraid.  
One of you two can take up that role.  
  
**Yui：**  
I don’t think I’d do much of a good job, either...  
Do you mind being the guildmaster, Hiyori?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
No problem! Now we just need a name!  
Hmm...  
  
**Yui：**  
It's a bit... cheesy,  
but how does \"Twinkle Wish\" sound?  
  
**Rei：**  
I like it.  
Thoughts, Hiyori?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I love it!  
Thing is, though. I feel like we're missing something important...  
  
![300700101.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/300700101.webp)  
**Yui：**  
Something important?  
Oh, aren't you Mr. Knight?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hello.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
Hello!  
You're here to see the Tower of Sol? How come?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I've been seeing it in my dreams.  
`Tag 2`  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, now I remember!  
It wasn't just the three of us! We had one more comrade!  
How come I forgot about something that important?  
  
**Rei：**  
That's a good question. I couldn't remember him myself  
despite how often he appeared.  
 You wouldn't  
happen to be that same person, would you?  
  
**Yui：**  
That would be great if true.  
How much of your dreams do you remember?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Just a little bit.  
`Tag 3`  
**Rei：**  
Not ideal, but the theory could still hold up.  
It's possible that  
you've been having the same dreams as us,  
so we'd like you  
to join us in our adventure to the Tower of Sol's peak.  
  
**Yui：**  
You might be able to recover some of your other  
memories if you come with us, too.  
How about it?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Nod.  
`Tag 4`  
**Hiyori：**  
Awesome! Mr. Knight has joined the party!  
  
**Rei：**  
It's a pleasure.  
  
**Yui：**  
Umm... I hope we can get to know each other better now.  
  
**Narration：**  
Brought together by a dream, today marked  
the beginning of a new adventure for them.
