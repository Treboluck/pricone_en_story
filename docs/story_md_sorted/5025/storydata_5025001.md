**Narration：**  
On Misogi's suggestion, the intrepid members of Little Lyrical  
have come trick-or-treating at a mansion said to be haunted.  
Curiosity getting the better of them, they venture inside its open doors...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Helloooo? Anybody home?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Looks like nobody's here...  
Sure is creepy, though. No wonder people say it's haunted.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
W-well! I think that's enough! Let's go home!  
  
**Mimi：**  
What a big house it is...  
  
**???：**  
Let's play... Let's play...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahhh!  
 Wh-what was that voice...?  
  
**???：**  
Let's play... Kyoka...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wh-why does... it know my name...?

Sorry, sorry!  
I just knew you'd give me an awesome reaction!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Um... Hey, Misogi, Kyoka... It's a bit cold in here, huh...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh?  
 ...A-actually, it does feel colder than a minute ago...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Really?  
 I can't tell the difference...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Waaagh!  
 Wh-what was that noise...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I-I'm sure a draft just blew something over.  
It's an old house, you know.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Yeah, that's gotta be it...  
Listen, guys, I'm sorry. Maybe we *should* head home!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Y-yeah...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
H-hey, Misogi! Don't tap my shoulder!  
 Is this another prank?
