Wahhh?!  
Those spooks look just like us!

Wh-what are they...?  
I'm scared... Misogi... Kyoka...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Even conjuring up fake friends to cause trouble for little Hana?  
Unbelievable!  
  
**Misogi：**

We've gotta teach him a lesson!  
  
**Mimi：**  
OK, I'll do my best!  
We're gonna finish this and have a Halloween party with Hana!
