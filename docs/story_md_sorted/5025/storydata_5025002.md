# Voices from the Void
Misogi brings {player} to the mansion, but they can't seem to get inside. Meanwhile, Kyoka explores the mansion itself, and stumbles into a graveyard where she hears Misogi's voice. Desperate for any link to the outside world, she calls out in response.
  
## Subtitle: Voices from the Void
  
**Narration：**  
This Halloween, {player} has been asked  
to help Saren prepare a big party for the children.  
While he's hard at work, he hears a voice calling for him.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Mister {player}! Mister {player}!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Oh, Misogi. Happy Halloween.  
**Choice: (2)**  Here for some candy, Misogi?  
`Tag 1`  
**Misogi：**  
There's nothing happy about it!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Misogi：**  
No, dummy!  
 There's no time for candy right now!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Misogi：**  
You gotta help me! Mimi and Kyoka are in trouble!  
  
**Narration：**  
Meanwhile, trapped inside the mansion,  
Kyoka bangs desperately on the closed front door.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi! Misogi! Why won't it open...?  
Ahhh... What now...? *sniff*...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
It'll be OK... Misogi will bring help soon, won't she...?  
  
**Children's Voices：**  
Ahaha... Ahaha...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahhh!  
 ...*sniff*... We're supposed to be having fun...  
Why is this happening...? I wanna go home...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I'll just stay put until help arrives... Then nothing will...

**Mimi：**  
Kyoka!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Aaaaahhhhh!  
  

---  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Mimi... She must have been scared too, but she protected me...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Mm... I can't let this scare me!  
This time, it's my turn to save Mimi!  
  
**Misogi：**  
And then, soon as I got out, the door slammed shut...  
Oh, c'mon, look!  
 This is it—the haunted mansion...  
  
**Misogi：**  
See? It won't open, right?  
This is my fault for saying we should come here...  
  
**Misogi：**  
It's all my stupid fault...  
  
**Misogi：**  
I just wanted us all to have fun for Halloween...  
  
**Misogi：**  
I'm sorry... Mimi... Kyoka...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'll help you save them both.  
`Tag 4`  
**Misogi：**  
Mm... Thanks, mister.  
But how are we gonna...  
  
**???：**  
Misogi? ...Misogi!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? That voice... Kyo... ka...?  
  
**Narration：**  
A short while earlier, after getting to her feet to search for Mimi,  
Kyoka was exploring the mansion's halls...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Let's try this room first...  
  

---  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahhh! Wh-what's all this?!  
  

---  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Are these... graves?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Then I made it outside? No, something's not right.  
The door we came through is behind me...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...?! A-a monster?!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Y-you won't scare me with all that growling!  
You just... give Mimi back! Yahhhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I-it vanished...  
Could these monsters be ghosts too?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
In the rumor, Misogi said people who go inside become ghosts...  
Then... is Mimi already...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
No, of course not! I can't think that.  
 I'm sure she's still OK.  
  
**???：**  
It's all... my stupid fault...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
A-another ghostly voice?!  
  
**???：**  
I just wanted us all to have fun for Halloween...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
No, this voice is...!  
  
**???：**  
I'm sorry... Mimi... Kyoka...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi? ...Misogi!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Are you there?! Misogi!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? That voice... Kyo... ka...?  
  
**Narration：**  
Scared that it might vanish at any moment,  
Kyoka called out as if to cling to the sound of Misogi's voice.
