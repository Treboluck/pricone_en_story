# Farewell to Unhappy Halloweens
Finally rejected by his daughter, Hana's father uses the power of the children's spirits to transform into a terrifying monster. Thanks to Misogi's plan to lure the spirits away with candy, Mimi and friends defeat him, and Hana convinces him to pass on.

## Subtitle: Farewell to Unhappy Halloweens
  
**Narration：**  
Determined to put a stop to this twisted Halloween,  
Misogi, Kyoka and {player} arrive back at Hana's bedroom.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Mimi! Hana!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Mnhh...  
  
**Hana：**  
Big Sis! Big Sis!  
  
**Man：**  
...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
No way... Mimi?! Wake up, Mimi!  
  
**Mimi：**  
...I'm sorry, guys... I guess I couldn't win...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Don't say that! You were so, so brave!  
Misogi, it's our turn.  
  
**Misogi：**  
You bully... How dare you hurt Mimi!  
  
**Misogi & Kyoka：**  
Yaahhhhh!  
  
**Man：**  
As I have said, I am not of this world.  
Your attacks mean nothing to me.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ngh!  
 Th-that's not fair at all! How do we beat a ghost?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi, don't give up! Let's keep attacking!  
{player}, we're counting on you!  
  
**Mimi：**  
...I've gotta fight too... I'm still... the big girl here...  
I've gotta protect everyone...  
  
**Hana：**  
You can't, Big Sis!  
 He'll kill you!  
  
**Mimi：**  
But... I'd be so sad if it was me...  
If my friends disappeared like yours, I know I'd cry...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Hana... You've been trying hard all on your own, right?  
But it's OK now... You've got us now... so...!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Let's go outside and enjoy Halloween together!  
Nobody has to go away anymore...!  
  
**Hana：**  
Ahhh...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Aaaahhhh!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Kyoka!  
  
**Man：**  
You've had your chance to run.  
If you wish to join the spirits so badly...  
  
**Hana：**  
Please, stoooop!  
  
**Man：**  
...?!  
  
**Hana：**  
The Daddy I know... He wouldn't do this!  
  
**Man：**  
...You're still too young to understand.  
This is the only way we can be together...  
  
**Hana：**  
Then I...  
 I'll say goodbye!  
I don't want this... This is just making everyone sad...  
  
**Hana：**  
I'll be brave just a little longer... and say  
 goodbye to you, Daddy!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Hana...  
  
**Man：**  
No... No, no, no, no, no!  
If she leaves me, I truly will be dead and gone!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wh-what now...?  
  
**Man：**  
Ah, yes... Why does she need to be alive?  
We should have simply become ghosts together...  
Haha... Ahahahahahahahahah!  
  
**Children's Voices：**  
Ahaha... Ahaha...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
All the spirits are coming together?  
  
**Man：**  
Your Halloween fun ends nooooow!  
  

---  
  
**Misogi：**  
Whaaa?! We're here *again?!*  
  
**Phantom Baron：**  
I won't allow anyone to leave this place!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahh... Is this really still Hana's dad...?  
  
**Children's Voices：**  
Trick or treat!  
Give us lots of candy, or you get tricked!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Is he... *wearing* those spirits?  
  
**Mimi：**  
I have to... help them...!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Mimi!  
 You mustn't push yourself!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Eheheh... Misogi... Kyoka... Mr. Nice Guy...  
You're all working so hard...  
 I don't want you to leave me out...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Besides, I'm...  
 the big girl here... Right?  
  
**Hana：**  
Yes...  
 Big Sis Mimi...  
Help them...  
 Help him... Save my daddy!  
  
**Mimi：**  
...Mm!  
  
**Phantom Baron：**  
Huaaarghhh!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Waaaghh!  
 C-can you quit that?!  
Take one of these!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Stay back, Misogi!  
Our attacks will never reach him through those spirits!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Whaaa?! B-  
but they're all stuck to him like sticky taffy...  
Oh! I know! I've got a great idea!  
  
**Misogi：**  
All those ghosts came to our world to have Halloween fun, right?  
How about we use treats to get them off him?!  
If I can just find something to stuff them into...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Would my cape work?  
`Tag 1`  
**Misogi：**  
Nice one, mister!  
Look! Mimi, Kyoka, toss all your treats in here!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Separate them with treats?  
 What a weird idea...  
But your weird ideas at times like this do usually seem to work!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Eheheh!  
 Here, take my treats too!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Nice! Let's do this, then!  
  
**Man：**  
GUAAAAAHHHHH!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
It's time to stop this!  
 If you really care about Hana,  
you can't steal her future away any longer!  
  
**Misogi：**  
That's right!  
 At this rate, you're just gonna be a bad dad!  
No one wants that!  
Don't you want your daughter to be proud of her daddy?!  
  
**Man：**  
I can't... If I pass on, Hana will forget about me...  
I'll disappear from this world! Be forgotten forever!  
  
**Man：**  
I'd rather be a monster than that!  
If it means I'll be remembered,  
 no sin or crime is too much!  
It's all for love... Because I love her... I can't let her forget!  
  
**Mimi：**  
She won't forget!  
  
**Hana：**  
...  
  
**Mimi：**  
You can't forget people you love!  
Even if Misogi and Kyoka and Mr. Nice Guy all vanished,  
I'd never forget any of them!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Saying bye-bye after playing all day is always lonely and sad.  
But...  
 feeling lonely and sad just tells me how much I love them!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Mimi...!  
  
**Hana：**  
I'm not  
 going to forget you, Daddy...  
  
**Man：**  
...Ahhh...  
  
**Hana：**  
Thank you for always staying here with me.  
But you know, I can sleep on my own now.  
I can go to the bathroom by myself, too.  
  
**Hana：**  
Even so, I thought I'd be lonely...  
But I'm not on my own anymore.  
I've found  
 Big Sis and her friends!  
  
**Hana：**  
Daddy... I love you  
 just like you love me!  
Forever and ever! I always will!  
  
**Man：**  
...I see...  
 You can do all of that by yourself?  
How you've grown... I suppose I should be brave too, then.  
  
**Hana：**  
Daddy...  
  
**Man：**  
\"I won't forget\"... Those words were all I needed to hear.  
It was me who needed you by my side...  
  
**Hana：**  
...  
  
**Man：**  
Thank you for showing me you care...  
Thank you so very much...!  
  

---  
  
**Hana：**  
Bye-bye,  
 Daddy...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Looks like he passed on!  
Aurghh... N-now that it's over, my whole body's aching...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ueeeerghhh?! Wh-what is it now?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
N-now that her dad passed on, his realm might be falling apart!  
Come on, we should get out quick!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahhh... I can't run any more...  
  
**Misogi：**  
I-I'm pretty beat up too! Carry me, mister!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
This is hardly the time for—  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Huh?

**Narration：**  
Suddenly, the group found themselves bathed in light...
