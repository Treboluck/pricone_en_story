# One Door Apart
Managing to open the door by attacking from the outside and inside simultaneously, Misogi is reunited with Kyoka. Together, they follow the ghostly noises further into the mansion, until they discover Mimi in one of its rooms with an unfamiliar young girl.
  
## Subtitle: One Door Apart
  
**Narration：**  
Misogi returns to the mansion with {player} in tow,  
determined to save Mimi and Kyoka.  
Soon after they arrive, they hear Kyoka's voice coming from thin air.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Kyoka, where are you?  
 I can hear your voice, but...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Umm... I'm in a graveyard...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? We're in the graveyard too!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Um, no... It looks the same, but... I think it's actually different...  
  
**Misogi：**  
What do you mean?! I don't get it!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Maybe she's in the spirit realm.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kyoka：**  
That voice... Is {player} out there too?  
No, hold on. The \"spirit realm\"...?  
  
**Misogi：**  
At Halloween, the boundary between worlds gets thinner?  
So a door might have opened to the spirit realm...?  
  
**Misogi：**  
B-but mister, why do you know all this stuff?  
Are you one of those spirit mediums?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  A bunch of stuff happened last Halloween...  
`Tag 2`  
**Kyoka：**  
Um, \"stuff\"...? This kind of thing isn't exactly normal!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh! Maybe it's the door to the mansion!  
The ghosts only started appearing after we went inside!  
  
**Misogi：**  
But... that's not gonna help when the stupid thing won't open!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wait, Misogi! If we're still able to talk like this,  
maybe the boundary really is thin...  
If you and me attack the door from both sides at once...  
  
**Misogi：**  
B-but our attacks aren't all that strong...  
No, wait! We've got Mister {player} now!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Yes. If he lends us his power...  
Misogi! Stand by the door! I'll go back to the hall too!  
  
**Misogi：**  
I dunno if your power will be able to reach Kyoka...  
But this is our only chance to save them!  
 C'mon, mister, let's do it!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Lend them your power.  
`Tag 3`  
**Misogi：**  
Whoaaa!  
 This might actually work!  
Kyoka! How's it looking in there?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
No luck... I don't think his power can reach me...  
  
**Children's Voices：**  
Ahaha... Ahaha...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wahhh!  
 I-I've had it up to here with your spooky antics!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...?! Huh? I-I'm powered up... How come...?  
No, the reason why doesn't matter right now. Let's do this, Misogi!  
  
**Misogi & Kyoka：**  
Yaaahhhhhhh!

**Kyoka：**  
*cough*... *cough*...!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Kyoka!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi... {player}...

**Misogi：**  
...Waaahhh! Kyokaaaa! You're OK! You're really OK!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Aahhh... *sniff*... Misogi... Misogiiii...  
  
**Misogi：**  
I'm sorry! I... I made you guys come here, and then...  
I'm so sorry, Kyoka!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
No... You came to rescue me. I knew you would. Thank you, Misogi.

**Misogi：**  
All right! We've got our exit now, so we just gotta find Mimi!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Yes...  
 But I still don't have any idea where she's gone...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Wahhh! What's that? A ghost?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
B-bring it on!  
We're not scared of a few spooks anymore!  
  
**Misogi & Kyoka：**  
...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Th-they're not doing anything?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Could they be asking us to follow them?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh...?!  
 It has to be a trap!  
After everything they've done so far...!  
  
**Misogi：**  
B-but... Searching randomly won't help much...  
Even if it is a trap, we can handle it together, can't we?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...A-all right.  
It's true, if we just search wildly, we'll end up somewhere weird again...  
{player},  
 will you protect us if things look bad?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Of course.  
**Choice: (5)**  You two are stronger than I am...  
`Tag 4`  
**Kyoka：**  
Thank you very much. We're counting on you.  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Kyoka：**  
Even if that's true, at least try to reassure us!  
You really are hopeless sometimes...  
 In that case, I'll protect you,  
so you try to protect us as well.  
 That works, doesn't it?  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Misogi：**  
Well then, let's go.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
The noises stopped right outside this room...  
  
**Misogi：**  
I-I'm opening the door!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Oh, huh~? Misogi... Kyoka...  
Wow! Mr. Nice Guy's here too!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Mimi! Thank goodness you're...  
 safe...  
  
**Girl：**  
...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Um... who's that?  
  
**Narration：**  
Misogi and Kyoka were surprised to see Mimi  
with an unfamiliar little girl.
