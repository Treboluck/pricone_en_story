**Misogi：**  
We had a bunch of scares,  
but I guess this is it for Halloween...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Why do you sound disappointed?  
I just want to go home...  
  
**Misogi：**  
But Kyoka, once we got going, even you didn't seem very scared!  
Did you get over your fear of ghosts?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I-I was never scared in the first place!  
But forget that. Let's stay focused to the end!  
We can't let anything ruin our Halloween party!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Eheheh!  
Let's all go home and eat lots of tasty treats!
