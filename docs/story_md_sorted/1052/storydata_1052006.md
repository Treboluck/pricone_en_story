**Lima：**  
Neneka? Where are you?  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh, there you are!  
You're this tree, right?  
  

---  
  
**Neneka：**  
Hmm. I thought my transformation was perfect.  
How did you know it was me?  
  
**Lima：**  
Umm, it had a different scent, I guess?  
Somehow, I just knew it was you!  
  
**Neneka：**  
I see. Even if my outward appearance is flawless,  
I can't deceive the sense of smell.  
  
**Neneka：**  
This is useful information. Clearly, I still have room  
to improve my abilities. I need to redouble my efforts  
to achieve a complete transformation.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Or at least rebuild them to the same level as they were in the  
previous world. This amateur-level shapeshifting  
shames the name of the \"Metamorph Monarch.\"  
  
**Lima：**  
Previous world?  
Metamorph Monarch?  
  
**Lima：**  
I have no idea what you're saying,  
 but anyways...  
I stayed up late last night thinking about your offer,  
and I decided that I still want to be a human.  
  
**Lima：**  
Living amongst humans is just too hard in this body.  
But at the same time, I don't want to abandon my true self.  
If I transform, will I have a way to go back to normal?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Yes. As I am now, completely replacing your body would be nigh  
impossible. I can only temporarily turn you into something  
humanoid,  
 and even that will take everything I've got.  
  
**Lima：**  
Okay. Then can I transform now?  
We'll call it a trial run!  
  
**Lima：**  
I'm a little nervous, but I might never get a chance  
like this again.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Indeed.  
Now, take my hand.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I'm about to tamper with the fundamental makeup of your body  
and completely transform it.  
This is my first time attempting  
this on someone else, so I apologize if anything goes awry.  
  
**Lima：**  
I don't quite understand.  
Is this going to hurt?  
Now I'm scared!  
  
**Neneka：**  
It's possible there will be intense pain. After all, I'll be  
molding your body like clay.  
This whole concept was ludicrous  
to begin with, so be prepared to endure various consequences.  
  
**Lima：**  
Right...  
Okay, have at it, Neneka.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Get ready.  
On my honor as the Metamorph Monarch,  
I will bestow a miracle upon you.

**Neneka：**  
Hmph. That's all there is to it.

**Lima：**  
...  
  
**Lima：**  
So am I transformed already?  
I don't really feel different.  
  
**Neneka：**  
You are. I should've thought to bring a mirror.  
How do you feel? Are you in any pain?  
  
**Lima：**  
No, I'm fine.  
Brrr, but I am cold!  
Ah... Achoo! ☆  
  
**Neneka：**  
Hmm. With your new human form, you've lost the  
insulating effect of your fur coat.  
You're actually dressed  
quite inadequately.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I was at least able to shrink down the armor and other items  
you had equipped to the proper proportions.  
  
**Lima：**  
Thanks a bunch! If you'd left the armor at its original size,  
I'd be naked!  
Wow, I can see my skin!  
I almost feel kinda bashful!  
  
**Lima：**  
Whoopsie!  
Suddenly having a body that's a completely different size  
makes it hard to keep your balance!  
  
**Lima：**  
A-and my sword feels so much heavier.  
I definitely couldn't fight like this.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Agreed.  
Please try to avoid any physical altercations.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Until your body can be stabilized, I'd assume a strong enough  
shock will turn you back to normal. I had to force quite  
a lot of things into place to make this transformation work.  
  
**Lima：**  
I understand. I'll be careful.

**Lima：**  
Wait, I hear footsteps. Not a monster's, though... Maybe a  
human's boots?  
Hee hee. At least my sense of  
hearing seems as strong as before.  
  
**Neneka：**  
It should. I left your ears as they were,  
to resemble a beastgirl's.  
  
**Neneka：**  
To make you look fully human  
would make you look too dissimilar  
from your original body, which could potentially cause  
malfunctions.  
  
**Lima：**  
Hmm.  
Yeah, I definitely look similar to Shiori and Rin.  
  
**Lima：**  
But forget me for a second. You should hide, Neneka.  
You don't want other people to see you, right?  
  
**Lima：**  
Now that I look so human, no one's going to mistake me  
for a monster.  
 If anything, maybe I can even chase them away  
for once!  
  
**Neneka：**  
That would be helpful.  
I sincerely apologize for the trouble.  
  
**Lima：**  
Don't!  
You've made my dream come true.  
  
**Lima：**  
You're my new favorite person.  
Let's be friends!  
I'll do whatever you want to pay you back. Just say the word.  
  

---  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh? Neneka?  
Oh, did she turn into a tree again?  
  
**Lima：**  
Oops, I need to deal with our little intruder.  
Hello? Who's there?  
  
**Lima：**  
Hmm?  
Oh, {player}!  
Howdy!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Do I know you?  
**Choice: (2)**  Lima...?  
`Tag 1`  
**Lima：**  
What? That's so mean!  
How can you act like we've never met before?  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh yeah, I'm transformed.  
He has no idea I'm Lima.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Lima：**  
Yes! Why do you look like someone just smacked you  
with a dead fish?  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh?  
What do you mean, you have the wrong person?  
  
**Lima：**  
Of course.  
He can't tell that I'm Lima  
now that I've been transformed into a human.  
  
**Lima：**  
But I'm still me!  
Maybe he thought I was a stranger who resembles Lima?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Lima：**  
What should I do? Is it safe to tell him who I am?  
If this were a fairy tale, I'd turn back to normal the second  
my true identity was revealed.  
  
**Lima：**  
Since I don't know what might turn me back yet,  
I should play it safe.  
For now, I'll keep my identity  
secret from {player}.  
  
**Lima：**  
I'll make sure to ask Neneka for all the details on what will  
change me back later.  
  
**Lima：**  
Oops, {player}'s starting to look suspicious!  
Let me think...  
  
**Lima：**  
Sorry. You're looking for someone named \"Lima?\"  
Why?  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh?  
The people at Elizabeth Park have been worried about her  
because she looked like she was anguishing over something?  
  
**Lima：**  
So they asked you to check up on her?  
  
**Lima：**  
I see.  
Well, I'm sorry everyone's so worried.  
But it's okay, I'm totally fine!  
  
**Lima：**  
Err, that is...  
I mean,  
I'm sure this \"Lima\" is okay and totally fine?  
  
**Lima：**  
D-don't ask me why I'm so sure, I just am!  
Call it a woman's intuition!  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh?  
{player}, where are you going?  
  
**Lima：**  
T-to look for Lima?  
But I'm right... Oh wait, I look like this now.  
Argh, what am I supposed to do?!
