Lima has trouble proving her identity to {player}. She feels dejected, thinking she'll never manage to become human, when {player} invites her to a costume ball.
  
## Subtitle: Princess or Not
  
**Lima：**  
Yes. I'm telling you, I'm the Lima you're looking for!  
  
**Lima：**  
Please believe me.  
I met a mysterious child in this forest who used  
something like magic to change me into a human!  
  
**Lima：**  
It's true.  
I wouldn't lie to you!  
  
**Lima：**  
*sigh* {player} looks really skeptical.  
I can't blame him. What I'm saying should be impossible.  
  
**Lima：**  
This isn't a fairy tale. In real life, there's no such thing  
as animals changing into humans.  
  
**Lima：**  
If it wasn't me who'd been transformed,  
I wouldn't believe it, either.  
  
**Lima：**  
It's not just an illusion that makes me appear human  
to the eyes, either. I've been completely physically changed.  
  
**Lima：**  
I wonder who Neneka really is.  
She's so mysterious... Maybe she's a god?  
I'm really curious, but now's not the time to wonder about her.  
  
**Lima：**  
I have to figure out how to get {player}  
to believe I'm Lima!  
  
**Lima：**  
He seemed worried about me being gone so long.  
And now that we're both human, there are so many things  
I want to do that I never could before.  
  
**Lima：**  
Like going out shopping in town.  
I've wanted  
to do that with {player} for so long.  
That, and all  
the other things human boys and girls do together.  
  
**Lima：**  
Okay.  
How can I convince you I'm Lima?  
  
**Lima：**  
I'll do whatever it takes.  
It makes me really sad to be called a faker and  
an imposter when I'm really me!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Tell me something only Lima would know.  
**Choice: (2)**  Do something Lima-like.  
`Tag 1`  
**Lima：**  
Oh, good thinking.  
If I say something only Lima would know,  
that would prove I'm her, right?  
  
**Lima：**  
Okay, ask me anything!  
I'll answer all your questions!  
  
**Lima：**  
Hmm.  
This is surprisingly tricky.  
  
**Lima：**  
If only we'd shared some kind of secret only the two of us knew...  
But I don't think we've ever talked that much in-depth.  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh, do you remember what happened when we first met?  
  
**Lima：**  
I crashed right into you, {player}!  
But you weren't upset or angry with me in the least.  
  
**Lima：**  
Even though people normally get scared and think I'm a monster  
when they first see me,  
you just talked to me like I was  
a normal person.  
  
**Lima：**  
That made me so, so happy.  
  
**Lima：**  
Thank you, {player}.  
I've loved you for doing that ever since.

`Tag 2`  
**Lima：**  
Hmm, something I would do?  
That's actually kind of tough.  
  
**Lima：**  
Normally I'd let you bury yourself in my fluffy wool...  
  
**Lima：**  
But now that I'm human, my coat's completely gone.  
We could hug, but I've got no wool to sink into.  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh wait, I've got it! ♪  
  
**Lima：**  
*PTHEH*!  
  
**Lima：**  
Heh heh. I've got a bad habit of spitting, remember?  
No normal human girl does that.  
That was very Lima-like, wasn't it?  
  
**Lima：**  
H-huh?  
{player},  
you look like a child who just got spanked  
by his parents for the first time.  
  
**Lima：**  
Wait a second...  
I've always tried to avoid spitting in front of you  
because I was worried you'd think I was gross!  
  
**Lima：**  
I've probably never spat in front of you once,  
and now I just did it right in your face.  
No wonder you're dumbfounded.  
  
**Lima：**  
I-I-I'm so sorry!  
I'll wipe it off!  
Shoot, I really thought that was a good idea, too!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Lima：**  
Urgh...  
I'm sorry, {player}.  
Proving my identity is harder than I thought.  
  
**Lima：**  
If this is just going to make you worry about me,  
maybe I should turn back.  
  
**Lima：**  
I'll go ask Neneka to return me to the way I was.  
I really wanted to try going on dates and stuff,  
but I guess that's not going to happen.  
  
**Lima：**  
The everyday joys of regular girls are always going to be  
out of reach for me, aren't they?  
  
**Lima：**  
But that's all right.  
It means a lot that you're concerned about my \"normal\" self.  
  
**Lima：**  
Even if I don't have a humanoid body...  
There's a boy who treats me as an equal without even  
raising an eyebrow.  
  
**Lima：**  
I should have been satisfied with what I had,  
instead of always wishing for more.  
  
**Lima：**  
Hmm?  
What's that, {player}?  
Is that flyer for me?  
  
**Lima：**  
*Animal Costume Ball*?  
What is this?  
It sounds kinda suspicious.  
  
**Lima：**  
Ohh, it's kind of like a masquerade... But everyone has  
to wear a full-body costume, including covering their face?  
So it's a event even Lima would be able to join, you say?  
  
**Lima：**  
And you came all the way up to the farm to bring the  
invitation. Hmm? It's open to everyone, so I  
should attend, too?  
  
**Lima：**  
Got it.  
Thanks. Maybe I'll decide to go if the mood strikes me.  
  
**Lima：**  
You're so friendly to everyone you meet.  
You always approach people with a kind, sincere attitude.  
That's what I love most about you.  
  
**Lima：**  
A costume ball!  
Straight out of a princess fairy tale,  
like the ones all little  
girls love.  
  
**Lima：**  
I doubt I'll be able to dance or act like the heroines  
in those stories, though.  
  
**Lima：**  
Whether in my usual form or human form,  
getting a happy ending is going to be really hard for me.  
  
**Lima：**  
But I'll do my best!  
I've still got someone who hiked all the way up this mountain  
just for me.  
  
**Lima：**  
If I can't smile and find contentment in what I have,  
this will all have been in vain.  
 No, even worse.  
I'll have wasted my life!  
  
**Lima：**  
I don't know why the gods gave me a monster's body,  
but a human heart.  
  
**Lima：**  
But I won't just hang my head and accept my fate  
as something sad.  
I'll be happy, one way or another!  
  
**Lima：**  
{player}, this might sound weird...  
But can I hug you, just once?  
  
**Lima：**  
Really?  
Yay!  
Hee hee. This feels so strange.  
  
**Lima：**  
{player}, you're so tall.  
Our skin is touching, and I can feel your heartbeat.  
So this is what it's like... I'll never forget how this feels.  
  
**Lima：**  
Thank you, {player}.  
If nothing else, I got to live out the happiest dream  
I've ever had.
