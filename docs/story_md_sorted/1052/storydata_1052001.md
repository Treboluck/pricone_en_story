## Subtitle: I'm Late, I'm Late!
  
**Lima：**  
Oh gosh, I'm so late!  
  
**Lima：**  
I'm so stupid. I overslept,  
but I still took forever to get  
groomed and dressed before I went out!  
  
**Lima：**  
I couldn't help it, though! My hair just wouldn't cooperate.  
And I'm going to be close to town today,  
so I never know who I might run into.  
  
**Lima：**  
I can't afford to dress like a slob.  
People already misidentify me enough as it is!  
  
**Lima：**  
If I don't dress as humanly as possible,  
I could get mistaken for a monster and be greeted  
with a volley of arrows again!  
  
**Lima：**  
But I should be fine today.  
I'm decked out in all the trendiest fashions!  
  
**Lima：**  
And in case anyone *does* mistake me for a monster,  
I've got fine weapons and armor equipped, too!  
  
**Lima：**  
*sigh* I wish I didn't have to be so vigilant.  
Why don't I look like other people?  
My words and my heart are as human as anyone else's.  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh well, complaining won't solve anything!  
I was born this way, and that's that.  
Besides, plenty of people accept me for who I am.  
  
**Lima：**  
Everyone at Elizabeth Park treats me normally and  
loves me despite my looks.  
But I don't want to  
just live in their little bubble.  
  
**Lima：**  
And that's why I signed up to start carrying some of the load!  
Today I'm just supposed to haul this lumber down  
and drop it off.  
  
**Lima：**  
The timbers are pretty heavy...  
But I'm a strong gal—I've got this!  
  
**Lima：**  
Oof!  
Oh no, did I just run someone over?!  
  
**Lima：**  
I'm so sorry! I was in a rush.  
Are you okay?  
You're not hurt, are you?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Please be more careful.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm fine. Are you okay?  
`Tag 1`  
**Lima：**  
I will. I apologize.  
Umm, can you stand?  
Here, let me give you a hoof. Up you go!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Lima：**  
Yup! This wooly coat's not just for show.  
It's soft and fluffy enough to cushion me very well.  
Add in the armor,  
and my defense is impenetrable!  
  
**Lima：**  
Ha ha ha. I appreciate the concern, though!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Lima：**  
Hmm? Oh, my name's Lima.  
I'm heading down to Landosol on a delivery job.  
  
**Lima：**  
And you are... {player}?  
Nice to meet you!  
  
**Lima：**  
You... aren't afraid of me at all, are you?  
  
**Lima：**  
You're funny.  
Most people shout, \"Monster!\" and run away  
screaming when they see me.  
Or worse, they say, \"I'll vanquish  
you!\" and attack without a second thought!  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh? No, no, I swear I'm not a monster!  
At least, I consider myself to be a normal human.  
I just look different is all.  
  
**Lima：**  
Apparently I'm unique.  
 I'm neither truly human,  
beastfolk, elf, or demonfolk.  
I'm the only one of my kind in the world!  
  
**Lima：**  
Yup! Mahiru's done a lot of research, and she...  
Oh, Mahiru's like my guardian.  
She runs the farm Elizabeth Park up in the mountains.  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh? You're heading there now to deliver the mail?  
That makes sense. This road connects the farm  
to Landosol, after all.  
  
**Lima：**  
Are you part of a delivery guild, {player}?  
No?  
You just took on the job as a freelance gig?  
  
**Lima：**  
You're one hard worker, then.  
Hee hee! Why don't I take the mail back up to  
Elizabeth Park for you, to apologize for our little crash?  
  
**Lima：**  
Yes. Once I drop off this lumber, I'm going straight back  
to the farm.  
  
**Lima：**  
I'd be happy to take that mail back with me.  
It's a long hike all the way up the mountain to the farm.  
  
**Lima：**  
I can't exactly go for a stroll through the city anyway...  
Once my job is done, I have to leave right away so I don't  
cause a big fuss. \"There's a monster in town!\" and so on.  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh, but don't worry.  
I'm not a goat! I'm not going to eat the paper.  
I promise I'll bring it all there safe and sound.  
  
**Lima：**  
Hmm? It's your job, so you want to do it yourself?  
Wow, you take your work seriously! Hee hee!  
  
**Lima：**  
Oops. That reminds me, I'm late as it is.  
I need to get going.  
  
**Lima：**  
Sorry again!  
I'll make up for crashing into you some other time.  
  
**Lima：**  
Hope we meet again soon, {player}.  
I've already taken a liking to you!
