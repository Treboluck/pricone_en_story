## Subtitle: Flight of Love
  
**Narration：**  
Several days after attending the costume ball,  
Lima is hard at work felling timber.  
  
**Lima：**  
Hrrragh!  
  
**Lima：**  
Phew... That should be enough for today. I've been going to  
Landosol a lot lately, so I haven't been able to chop much wood.  
  
I need to stock up, just in case.  
  
**Lima：**  
Thanks for helping out.  
You reeeally saved me!  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh? You invited me out, so of course you would help?  
No need to worry about that!  
  
I still really appreciate it!  
  
**Lima：**  
Even though we had a bit of an incident, I had lots of fun.  
I was hoping to stay a bit longer though.  
But that probably would've been asking too much, right?  
  
**Lima：**  
We should go again?  
You're right, I guess if I use a metamorph apple,  
going to Landosol isn't such a problem.  
But I'm scared to go alone. Something might happen.  
  
**Lima：**  
You'll go with me again?  
You really are kind, aren't you?  
But  
that kindness alone is enough for me.  
  
**Lima：**  
Don't be shy, you say...?  
Why would you go so far for me?  
  
**Lima：**  
Because I looked like I was having fun?  
Is that so?  
In that case, can I ask something a little selfish?  
  
**Lima：**  
Among the mail you delivered the other day,  
there was a flyer for a show.  
It might be nice to go see it.  
  
**Lima：**  
Just kidding.  
That's asking too much, right?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'll go with you.  
`Tag 1`  
**Lima：**  
You'll really go with me?  
Are you sure it's not too much trouble?  
...R-really?  
  
**Lima：**  
Then can I take you up on your offer...?  
  
**Lima：**  
Hee hee!  
I'm really about to see a show, right?  
It's like a dream!  
  
**Lima：**  
Today's performance is about star-crossed lovers!  
A boy and girl fall for each other, overcome some difficulties,  
and then in the end...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Sounds fun.  
**Choice: (3)**  How does it end?  
`Tag 2`  
**Lima：**  
Oh my, I'm sooo excited!  
I've only ever read the book,  
but now I get to see it live!  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh, oh no, oh no!  
It's starting,  
so we have to be quiet!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Lima：**  
Ohh! I'm so sorry!  
You don't need my explanation,  
because we're about to watch it!  
I'd much rather you  
enjoy it with your own eyes!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Lima：**  
Ahhh! Am I really about to watch a live play?  
  
**Lima：**  
Of course stage shows themselves are great fun, but seeing so many people  
enjoying their time up close is  
absolutely heartwarming too.  
  
**Lima：**  
I hope {player} is enjoying himself as well...  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh good! He's totally focused on the stage.  
I was worried I'd forced him along,  
but it really looks like he's having fun!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Oi oi oi!  
What a dumb story!  
When are you just gonna get together? Huuuuh?!  
  
**Lima：**  
Hey, hush! What is this?!  
We're at the best part, so keep quiet!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Huh?!  The hell?!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Look out!  
`Tag 5`  
**Lima：**  
Waaahh! {player}, are you all right?!  
*PTHEH* *PTHEH*!  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh no! I was so flustered, I spat on him!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Wha—?! Y-  
you!  
You can't go around just spittin' at people! What the hell?!  
  
**Lima：**  
S-sorry!  
I didn't mean to!  
It was an accident,  
okay?  
  
**Ruffian：**  
There's no such thing as a girl who spits on people by accident!  
  
**Lima：**  
Eek!  
Well, *I* do if the mood takes me!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Let's get out of here.  
`Tag 6`  
**Lima：**  
Huh?  
But I can handle this kind of guy on my o—  
Eek!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Oi! Where the hell are you going?!  
Get back here!  
  
**Lima：**  
Ah! He's holding my hand!  
{player}'s hands are surprisingly big.  
Soft hands...  
It's a feeling I can only experience in this form.  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh? Oh no! Now that I've noticed, my heart is pounding!  
But I have to focus on escaping now!  
  
**Lima：**  
*pant, pant...* We've run so far, I think we're safe now, right?  
I can't believe he chased us for so long.  
It really caught me off guard.  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh no, oh no!  
First, I need to thank you!  
So thanks for saving me!  
  
**Lima：**  
If I'd gotten into a fight back there, I probably would've turned back  
into my old self.  
I got carried away and totally forgot...  
  
**Lima：**  
You really saved me by being there.  
You looked so cool  
when you helped me escape.  
  
**Lima：**  
Um, uhhh, about that... Could you maybe...  
possibly hold hands with me again?  
I-it's totally fine if you don't want to!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I can hold your hand as long as you like.  
`Tag 7`  
**Lima：**  
Thank you!  
Th-this is how lovers hold hands, right?!  
W-wow... I never thought I'd get to do anything like this!  
  
**Lima：**  
Our fingers are intertwined so tightly... So soft, so warm...  
If I hadn't transformed, I wouldn't have been able to experience this...  
  
**Lima：**  
I'm so glad that I had the courage to do this.  
I can only feel this happiness  
because he's  
here with me.  
  
**Lima：**  
You say that I look like I'm having fun whenever I'm in Landosol,  
but when I'm with you I'm always having fun.  
I'm a little embarrassed to tell you this to your face,  
but...  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima, llima llimallima...  
(I want to be with you forever...)  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh?! Why am I getting side effects at the most crucial point!  
And argh! Now I'm back to talking normally!  
I don't have the guts to say it again!  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} looked on in wonder as Lima  
held her head in her hands.
