**Narration：**  
Having resolved to perform on stage,  
Lima is now striving to rehearse hard day in and day out.  
  
**Lima：**  
Sorry! One more time!  
  
**Director：**  
No, let's take a break.  
Take a proper rest and come back refreshed.  
  
**Lima：**  
Hey.  
Thanks for being here with me every day.  
All I do is make the director angry. I bet that's no fun to watch, right?  
  
**Lima：**  
That's not true?  
Thank you. Now that you've said that,  
I'll have to do my best for your sake!  
  
**Staff Member：**  
I've brought you some water, Lima.  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh! Thank you very much!  
  
**Staff Member：**  
Lima, you're getting better and better. Keep up the good work!  
I'd best be off. I still have a lot to do!  
  
**Lima：**  
There are other people besides you who care about me,  
so I've got to do my best.  
Even the director only scolds me because he cares.  
  
**Lima：**  
To be honest, even being told off is loads of fun.  
Maybe because I was always scaring people off, this feels fresh.  
  
**Lima：**  
Trying my best, getting chewed out, being cheered on...  
It's all so fun.  
That's why I have to live up to everybody's expectations, right?  
I'm gonna do my best, so I'm counting on your support!  
  
**Citizen：**  
Over there!  
  
**Soldier：**  
So this is it, huh?  
The troupe that brought a monster to town!  
  
**Lima：**  
Eep! What's going on?!  
  
**Staff Member：**  
M-monster?!  
Where?!  
  
**Director：**  
Oi, you! What's your problem?  
  
**Lima：**  
E-everyone stay calm!  
I'm used to this kinda thing!  
  
**Lima：**  
Ohhh, it turned out like this after all...  
It's all been going miraculously well, but I guess it was bound to  
end eventually.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Don't give up.  
**Choice: (2)**  There are only entertainers here.  
`Tag 1`  
**Lima：**  
Y-you're right!  
I've already come this far, so I have to keep going!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Lima：**  
Hrk?!  
Right!  
There are no monsters here!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Soldier：**  
What's all the fuss about?!  
If you resist, I won't go easy on you!  
  
**Soldier：**  
Looks like you're not backing down, eh?  
Guess I'll just have to rough you up a bit.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Show him the fruits of your rehearsals.  
`Tag 4`  
**Lima：**  
The fruits of my rehearsals? Because monsters can't perform?  
Right! I'll give it my all!  
Watch me go, {player}.  
  
**Soldier：**  
O-oi!  
Don't come any closer!  
  
**Lima：**  
If you want to slay me, then do it!  
My blood flows red, as does yours!  
See for yourself!  
  
**Lima：**  
I am human! Even though I was transformed into this, my blood and my heart  
are still human!  
  
**Lima：**  
If only my blood had turned blue and my heart had turned cold.  
Then I would no longer have to feel such anguish!  
  
**Lima：**  
Now, with that sword, slit my throat!  
  
**Lima：**  
Then, after that, if you feel even the slightest bit of guilt,  
it's because you know I was undeniably human...  
  
**Lima：**  
I did it!  
That was my very best yet!  
But it might well be my very last.  
  
**Soldier：**  
............  
  
**Soldier：**  
M-my apologies.  
Looks like I got it all wrong.  
  
**Citizen：**  
Your costume looks so real...  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh? You... think so? Ah ha ha ha...  
I'm sorry for misleading you.  
  
**Citizen：**  
I-it's all right! Still, what an incredibly moving performance!  
When the play is staged, I'll definitely be in the audience!  
  
**Lima：**  
Really?!  
Thank you! I'll keep an eye out for you!  
  
**Soldier：**  
With that, I should be going.  
Sorry for causing such a commotion.  
  
**Director：**  
That was incredible!  
What a realistic performance!  
  
**Lima：**  
Y-you think so?  
Hee hee.  
I'm just glad I managed to pluck up my nerve before the big day!  
  
**Lima：**  
Well then, let's get back to rehearsing!  
  

---  
  
**Lima：**  
A lot happened during rehearsals,  
but ready or not, it's  
finally time for the real thing.  
  
**Lima：**  
I was once a princess, but due to an evil mage's curse,  
I was transformed into a monster.  
  
**Lima：**  
I'll look like this the whole time I'm on stage, but if I really was a princess,  
I'm certain I would look like you.  
  
**Lima：**  
I'd wear beautiful dresses like this one  
and go on fun dates with someone I like.  
I'd do lots and lots of fun things, wouldn't I?  
  
**Lima：**  
As I am now, I can't wear this dress,  
but I've still been blessed with so much.  
  
**Lima：**  
I can handle physical labor with ease, and...  
I have a nice boy to hold me tight.  
  
**Lima：**  
Right now there aren't many people willing to accept me as I am,  
but I *will* make more friends—I'll give it my all.  
  
**Lima：**  
I'll probably need your help now and then,  
so let's be great friends from here on out.  
  
**Lima：**  
Whenever the time comes, I wonder if I'll be able to wear this dress.  
It would be great if I could.  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh, looks like a wonderful boy has come to get me.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  The show's about to start.  
`Tag 5`  
**Lima：**  
Thank you.  
Well then, I guess I should be getting out there.  
  
**Narration：**  
The play was a great success.  
However, Lima never took to the stage again,  
and the enigmatic actress became a minor urban legend in Landosol.
