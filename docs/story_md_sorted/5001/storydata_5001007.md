# Hatsune's Perfect Present
The trio make their way to a restaurant to reward themselves for their efforts in sealing the monsters back into the picture book. Shiori takes this opportunity to surprise Hatsune with a present of her own: a nice, fluffy pillow. Hatsune, overwhelmed, swears to treasure it forever.

**Narration：**  
With the bookmark finally located, Shiori entrusts  
the picture book to Hatsune. A few days later, the trio  
gather to discuss what happened with it following that.  
  
**Shiori：**  
The Menagerie and Forestier had a meeting  
to determine what they should do with the picture book.  
They finally reached a conclusion today.  
  
**Shiori：**  
They decided that it should be kept safe within the Elven Forest.  
In other words, I no longer have either the book itself nor the bookmark.  
  
**Shiori：**  
...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I'm so sorry, Shiorin.  
That was supposed to be yours, too...  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's not your fault, so please don't apologize.  
If anything, I should be thanking you for all the effort.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Aww... Shiorin, Shiorin, Shiorin!  
  
**Shiori：**  
H-Hatsune...  
I need to thank you for all your help too, {player}.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Things might have ended a lot differently if you weren't there.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  We did get recompensed, so let's party.  
**Choice: (2)**  We did get recompensed, so let's go somewhere.  
`Tag 1`  
**Hatsune：**  
Wahey! Now that sounds good!  
We even promised to do something together again a while back!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Shiori：**  
Hehe. That does sound good.  
How about we hold our own little party, then?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Hatsune：**  
Anywhere you fancy going, Shiorin?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm both physically and mentally exhausted after all that.  
So... I think I'd enjoy something nice and sweet.  
Does that work?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
You betcha it does!  
With that decided, let's get a-going! ♪  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Mmm! ♪ Delish! ♪  
Here, Shiorin! Open wide for me! ♪  
  
**Shiori：**  
Th-that's really embarrassing, Hatsune...  
Ahh...  
You're right, though. It's delicious.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ehehe. Never expected any less from one of your recs!  
Do you come here often?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Umm... Hatsune. I, uh, meant to say...  
  
**Woman：**  
This is for you, miss.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh? Wh-what's this?  
A... pillow?  
  
**Shiori：**  
That's why I chose this store.  
I wanted to surprise you,  
so I handed it to them in secret.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Shiorin! You... You...!  
  
**Shiori：**  
This is my way of thanking you. For everything, really.  
I've heard lots about how hard you're working too, you know.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Shi... Shi...  
Shiorin! Thank you so much!  
You have no idea how happy this makes me!  
I'll treasure it forever!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, right! I gotta give you something back!  
I never got around to replying to your letter, either!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Y-you really don't need to.  
Besides, if you give something back,  
then I'll have to do the same again.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
That won't stop me! Oh, and also...
