# Resonating Hearts
The trio arrive at a nearby village, only to be split up by a surprise attack from one of the monsters. Shiori winds up in peril, but a clutch plan from Hatsune results in them successfully sealing it away. They find themselves with little time to celebrate, however, as the Ziz itself appears before them.
  
## Subtitle: Resonating Hearts
  
**Narration：**  
Chasing after one of the remaining monsters,  
the trio arrive at a village near Elizabeth Park.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Zzz... Zzz...  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm sorry for having you carry her, {player}.  
The last monster I faced likely came this way, but...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Something seems... off? This village is usually so lively,  
but I can't see or sense anyone around. The doors are  
all locked, too.  
Don't tell me the monster already—  
  
**Man：**  
H-hey. Is someone out there?  
  
**Shiori：**  
That sounded like it came from inside...  
Umm, we're not here to cause any harm.  
Do you mind explaining what's going on here?  
  
**Man：**  
Ohh, you're one of the girls from Elizabeth Park.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I am, yes. What exactly happened here?  
It's awfully quiet, plus I can't see anyone else around.  
  
**Man：**  
Everyone else is hiding out in their homes.  
I'm not sure why, but a monster managed to get through  
the anti-monster barrier we have here.  
  
**Shiori：**  
A monster that can bypass that type of barrier... That has to be it.  
They're nothing like regular monsters, after all.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  We should hurry and seal it.  
**Choice: (2)**  We need to help them out.  
`Tag 1`  
**Shiori：**  
Agreed. It's my fault that this happened in the first place,  
so I have a responsibility to bring it to an end.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Shiori：**  
Of course. I'm the one who undid the seal,  
so I have every intention of making up for it.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shiori：**  
Please stick with me for just a bit longer, {player}.  
  
**Man：**  
You guys should get outta here.  
That thing could come back any time now...  
  
**Shiori：**  
That's precisely what we're hoping for.  
You, however, should stay inside.  
  
**Man：**  
F-for real...?  
Don't go doing anything too wild now, you hear?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Something's still off... The air is far too still  
in spite of a monster like that lurking nearby.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I can't even trace it with my heightened senses, either...  
  
**Shiori：**  
A surprise attack right now would prove deadly...  
I need to find it quick, lest anything should happen to Hatsune and {player}...  
  
**Shiori：**  
If it's going to attack, then where is it likely to come from?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Zzz...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wah!  
Shiorin, above you!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Above?! Gurgh!  
  
**Monster 1：**  
GGGHHKKKKKSSS!  
  
**Shiori：**  
I didn't expect it to be concealing itself among the rooftops.  
That could have been awful if you hadn't noticed...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ehehe. No way I could stay asleep  
when you're in danger!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Thank you.  
We can seal it away now that it's shown itself, though.  
I have my arrows and bookmark at the ready!  
  
**Monster 1：**  
GGGRRRRGHHHHH!  
  
**Shiori：**  
I-it's too fast!  
I can't take proper aim at a target like this!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hatsune, {player}! Take cover inside one of the buildings!  
It'll pick us off one by one if we stay together!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wait up, Shiorin!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Did it go back up on the rooftops?  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's predicting how I'll act based on my line of sight and  
body language.  
All while exerting a terrifying amount of  
pressure, too... The second I let my guard down, it's over.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ohh... So *that's* why it can predict her actions.  
Yeah. I can generally tell what Shiorin's thinking.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Chances are that monster has a really sensitive sense of sight and smell!  
Oh man, what should I do?! Shiorin's in real trouble now!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  How about throwing it off using magic?  
`Tag 4`  
**Hatsune：**  
Magic doesn't work on that thing though, right?  
Hmm?  
Ohh! Good call!  
That's a surefire way to help her out!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Righty-o!  
I'm at full power again after that nap on your back,  
so let's do this!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  How're you gonna relay the plan to her?  
`Tag 5`  
**Hatsune：**  
Wa-ha-ha! Don't forget, my friend.  
Words aren't necessary between the two of us!  
Sha-shing! ☆  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Get ready, my dude. 'Cause I'm going all out!  
  
**Shiori：**  
This isn't good.  
The longer this drags on, the more exhausted I'm going to ge—  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Shiorin! Shut your eyes!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hatsune?  
Oh!  
  
**Monster 1：**  
GGGRRRUOOHHHHH!  
  
**Shiori：**  
That's her magic!  
She used it to dull the monster's senses!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Won't do much damage-wise, but now it can't predict her movements!  
Get ready, Shiorin! It's gonna charge right at you!  
  
**Monster 1：**  
GGGRRRUOOHHHHH!  
  
**Shiori：**  
She made the perfect opening for me. I won't let it go to waste!  
  
**Monster 1：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
We did it! That bad boy's sealed away for good!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Mmghh...  
I-I felt like you were talking to me from afar,  
so it's all thanks to you.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ehehe. Nothing can trump our beautiful bonds!  
Wow, though. That thing sure was strong.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Let's see what the book had to say about it...  
Hm... It boasts an incredible sense of sight, hearing, and smell...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Smell as well?  
Th-that sure was a close one, haha...!  
  
**Shiori：**  
That leaves just one monster to be sealed.  
The Ziz, I believe?  
We should stay on gua—  
  
**Ziz：**  
KKKKRRRSSSKKKRR!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh! There it is!  
And it's got its eyes on the book!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Shiorin, {player}! You two okay?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
We're both fine, yes.  
Fighting that thing here is just going to  
cause unnecessary damage to the village, though...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Then let's lure it away!  
Come on, you two!  
  
**Narration：**  
The trio promptly fled the village as the Ziz made chase,  
its thunderous cry echoing through the sky.
