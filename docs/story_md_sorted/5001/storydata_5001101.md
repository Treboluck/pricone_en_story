Hatsune decides to surprise Shiori with a present for all her hard work. And thus begins Operation: Hatsune's Perfect Present!
  
**Hatsune：**  
Shiorin, Shiorin!  
It's been so long! Have you been staying well?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, Hatsune. I'm feeling good more often than not these days,  
Maybe it's because of the cleaner air at Elizabeth Park?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Nice, nice! That's great to hear!  
Speaking of hearing,  
someone from the Menagerie told me about how hard you've  
been working at Elizabeth Park!  
You're making me all proud!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Wah... Th-that tickles!  
What brings you here today, though?  
Do you need something from me?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Yuppity! To tell the truth, I've got a little—  
A-actually, no! Forget I said anything!  
  
**Shiori：**  
That was strange...  
But that's part of why I love her. Hehe.
