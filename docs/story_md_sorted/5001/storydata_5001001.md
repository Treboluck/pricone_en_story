## Subtitle: A Walk Down Memory Lane
  
**Narration：**  
A few days following Hatsune's encounter with Shiori,  
she finds herself at a complete loss over what the perfect present would be.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hm... I just can't think of a perfect present for her...  
How can I call myself a good sister like this?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Maybe if I asked someone she gets along wi—  
Speak of the devil!  
Hey, you! What're you up to?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I came for some grub.  
`Tag 1`  
**Hatsune：**  
Well then! Your timing couldn't have been any better!  
I need your help with a little something.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
This is between me and you, okay?  
Put it right up there with my superpowers  
in terms of top secret stuff.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I need your help finding a good present for Shiorin!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I've been trying to come up with something on my own,  
but it's just not happening...  
Oh, right. By \"Shiorin\" I mean my little sister!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  She said she's got an interest in monsters.  
`Tag 2`  
**Hatsune：**  
Monsters?! Th-that sure didn't come to mind...  
Actually, hey! Since when did you get to know her?!  
That's perfect, though! Let's get a-searching!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
A lovely little present. ♪ For my lovely little sister. ♪  
Ohhh! How about this? This taxidermy mount looks super realistic!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  More like super scary...  
**Choice: (4)**  That's so cool.  
`Tag 3`  
**Hatsune：**  
Hm... Fair enough.  
It might give her a fright in the middle of the night.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Hatsune：**  
Ehehe. Right? ♪  
Then again. It might be a bit *too* realistic for her...  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Hatsune：**  
Guess we can cross this off the list.  
Picking a good present sure isn't easy, huh?  
  
**Shiori：**  
You're looking for a present?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, Shiorin! Perfect timing!  
Guess what? We're actua—  
Wait, Shiorin?! For realsies?! For realsies!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Please don't poke my cheeks so hard...  
O-  
ow... I'm just here to do some shopping.  
How about you?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
We're, uh... Just...  
Just doing things. That people do. You know?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Like eating delicious sweets together.  
`Tag 6`  
**Hatsune：**  
R-right! I heard about a new store opening up,  
so I invited {player} to come try it out with me. ♪  
  
**Shiori：**  
That sounds fun...  
I'd love to go eat with the two of you sometime!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Then let's make plans!  
How come you're alone, by the way?  
Did the others go check out another store?  
  
**Shiori：**  
They're all busy today, so I came on my own.  
I'm feeling good today, too, so it was a nice excuse for a walk.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wait, really?! Y-you're here all by yourself?!  
A-are you okay? Can you get home on your own?  
Do you want me to go back with you?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Don't worry. I can get home just fine.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
O-oh... If you say so.  
Or not! I'll be a nervous wreck if I let you go by yourself!  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'll be fine. I promise.  
Plus, I don't want to put {player} out.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I'm as worried as Hatsune is.  
`Tag 7`  
**Shiori：**  
You are?  
Well... Okay.  
It'd be rude to say no at this point.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wahey! Then let's get a-going!  
Don't worry, big sis'll get you home safe and sound. ♪  
  
**Hatsune：**  
It's been a while since we were together like this, hasn't it, Shiorin?  
  
**Shiori：**  
We don't get to see each other that much now that we live apart.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  How come you don't live together?  
`Tag 8`  
**Shiori：**  
Well. We used to live in Landosol together.  
But then, one day...  
  

---  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Shiorin, Shiorin, Shiorin!  
Big news, big news! You'll never believe it!  
  
**Shiori：**  
*cough, cough*  
Did something happen?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
You okay?  
Oh, sorry. Did I startle you?  
  
**Shiori：**  
No, it's fine. I've just been coughing an awful lot today.  
Don't worry about me, though.  
More importantly, what is this big news?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, right! You know Forestier,  
the guild that keeps watch over the Elven Forest?  
Well! They handpicked me to join them! ☆  
  
**Shiori：**  
Wow... That's amazing! Congratulations!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Only issue is, well...  
I'll have to move to the Elven Forest if I do end up joining.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
There's no way I'm leaving you behind, though.  
So I'm gonna ask them to let you live there with me, too!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hatsune...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Race doesn't matter. You're still my precious little sister!  
Living apart from each other is a big, fat nope!  
  
**Shiori：**  
...Thank you, Hatsune.  
That's not an offer I can accept, though.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Shiori：**  
You've always been there to look out for me.  
But I can't keep living like that.  
  
**Shiori：**  
If anything, this is the perfect chance for me to change.  
And I... I want to work under the Menagerie.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
No way! Wh-what's with you, Shiorin?!  
Do you hate me now?!  
Is that why you don't wanna live together anymore?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'd never hate you.  
I just don't want to be a nuisance to someone I care about...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
You're anything *but* a nuisance!  
I care about you just as much!  
That's why I'm always so worried! I just want you to be safe...!  
  
**Shiori：**  
I know full well just how much you care about me.  
That's why I need to do this, though.  
I want you to see that I can get by on my own, too.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I want to be more like you...  
I want to be able to look out for you, just like you do for me.  
That's my goal. My earnest desire.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
...  
You've already settled on this, haven't you?  
And if that's the case, then I gotta cheer you on!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
If you wanna change yourself,  
then I'll support you every step of the way!  
Living apart'll be tough, but it's for your sake!  
  
**Shiori：**  
You're not mad at me...?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
How could I get mad when you've put that much thought into it?  
Just don't forget, though. I'll always be here for you.  
So gimme a call if you're ever lonely! I'll be there in a flash!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yeah. I will. Thank you.  
  

---  
  
**Shiori：**  
We started living apart following that,  
but Hatsune would always come check on me out of concern.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wait, you noticed?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Of course. This is you we're talking about, after all.  
What's more, you would normally trail behind me  
instead of hiding.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ehehe... Got me all figured out, haven't you?  
Truth is, I'm the one that ended up feeling super lonely after that.  
That's why I kept popping in to see you. ♪  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, Hatsune...  
That said, I was always happy whenever you came.  
Seeing you always gave me the strength to keep going on.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
O-oh... That's great to hear. ♪  
  
**Hatsune：**  
And here we are! ♪  
  
**Shiori：**  
Thank you for walking me home.  
Both of you, even.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Been a while since we got to talk that much!  
Catch ya later, Shiorin!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh. Hatsune...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hm? What's up?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I get the feeling that you've had something  
on your mind for a little while now...  
But you'll tell me about it if you really need to, right?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Actually. Forget I said anything.  
Bye-bye. ♪  
  
**Narration：**  
Shiori continued to wave them off until  
their figures disappeared into the distance.
