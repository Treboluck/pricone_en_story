## Subtitle: A Curious Find
  
**Narration：**  
Hatsune finds herself in Landosol's business district,  
still unable to decide on the perfect present for Shiori.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ahh, man! What should I do?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hello.  
**Choice: (2)**  What're you up to?  
`Tag 1`  
**Hatsune：**  
{player}!  
Help a sister out!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Hatsune：**  
{player}! Perfect timing!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Hatsune：**  
Remember how you told me about Shiorin's interest in monsters?  
I started thinking about presents related to that, but well...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
There's too many options! I can't settle on just one!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You [i]still[/i] haven't decided...?  
`Tag 4`  
**Hatsune：**  
Urgh... Yeah.  
I'd give her the whole bunch honestly,  
but that'd probably be more of a burden than anything.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, you're both together again. Hello.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Waugh?! Sh-Shiorin?!  
T-talk about coincidences!  
  
**Shiori：**  
I had to report in to Caon, so...  
What brings you two here?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh?! Well! We're, uh, we're just...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wait! I might be able to figure out what she wants  
if I invite her to come shopping with us!  
Yup, that's the ticket!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
You're such an ultra genius, Hatsune! ♪ Sha-shing! ☆  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hmm? Is something wrong?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Nope! Not at all!  
More importantly, are you free after this?  
Let's go shopping together if you are!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh...  
I am free, yeah.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Perfect! Then let's roll!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
There should be stores we haven't checked around here...  
Oh,  
there's one!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hey, wait for us—  
Honestly, now.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Umm, {player}...  
Has Hatsune asked you to help her with anything lately?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Dunno what you're talking about.  
`Tag 5`  
**Shiori：**  
Hehe.  
You're as bad at fibbing as she is.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm not quite sure *what* it is,  
but you're trying to do something for me, aren't you?  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's funny, really. Hatsune's always been something  
of an open book to me, ever since we were kids.  
We might live apart now, but that fact hasn't changed.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Knowing she's planning something for my sake makes me  
really happy, you know.  
But I don't want it to just end there...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Hopefully you can return the favor.  
`Tag 6`  
**Shiori：**  
Yeah. One day, for sure.  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Hey there! Welcome!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
You two sure took your time!  
Check it out!  
There's so much cool stuff!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Wow, there really is...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Anything that tickles your fancy?  
`Tag 7`  
**Shiori：**  
Hm...  
Rare, unusual books can be a staple of stores like this.  
It'd be nice if I could find one of those...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I knew it'd be book-related!  
Let's see here... Unusual books...  
Hm?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Did something catch your eye?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
This book did, yeah.  
There's magic flowing out from it.  
  
**Shiori：**  
A book filled with magic?  
It doesn't seem like a spellbook, at the very least...  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Great catch, you two!  
That book there was found in some ancient ruins not that long ago!  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
It's a monster-based picture book, but get this!  
The illustrations  
actually move thanks to the magic imbued in it!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Whoa, for real?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Th-that's amazing!  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
I've been in this business for a long time now,  
but I ain't ever seen a book like this before.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I've read all sorts of books myself,  
but this is also a first for me...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I take it you're curious about it?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yeah.  
I didn't bring that much money with me today, though...  
And encounters with new books can be fleeting.  
There's no guarantee it'll be here next time... *sob*  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Sha-shing! ☆  
That's the ticket!  
  
**Shiori：**  
H-Hatsune?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Heh heh heh!  
Guess what, lovable sister of mine?  
I've been looking for a present to give you after all your hard work, so...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Behold! This book shall henceforth be yours!  
  
**Shiori：**  
R-really?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
For realsies! You deserve it!

**Shopkeeper：**  
Now that's what I like to hear!  
There's a bookmark that they  
found along with the book, so how about grabbing that as well?  
It's got a pretty neat design, I'd say.  
  
`image display end`  
**Hatsune：**  
Sure! Gimme the whole shebang!  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Great!  
Let's see here...  
You're looking at this much for the both of them!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Okay...  
W-wait, I don't have enough?!  
N-no way! So much for the perfect present!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Use this.  
`Tag 8`  
**Hatsune：**  
{player}...?  
I-I can't accept this. Especially after all your help...  
  
**Choice: (9)**  We're both doing this for Shiori.  
`Tag 9`  
**Hatsune：**  
Mmm...  
Okay! Thanks!  
I'll pay you back real soon!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Here ya go! Enough for the book and bookmark!  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Great doing business with ya!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ehehe... Here you go, Shiorin!  
A reward for all your hard work!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Thank you. I really mean it.  
I'll make sure to treasure this forever.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Woo!  
Operation: Hatsune's Perfect Present is officially a success!  
Sha-shing! ☆  
  
**Narration：**  
Hatsune, seeing Shiori's reaction to her present,  
felt almost as happy as her sister did in that moment.
