## Subtitle: Operation: Hatsune's Perfect Present!
  
**Narration：**  
Hatsune has made her way to Landosol  
to deliver goods from Forestier to the Menagerie  
...Or so she was supposed to.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Not good, not good! I'm never gonna make it!  
Not unless I resort to drastic measures...!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
No one's around, right?

**Hatsune：**  
Touchdown, baby!  
Now to sprint!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hello! I've got a delivery here!  
*huff, huff* I made it on time... right?  
  
**Menagerie Staff：**  
Yup. Right on time.  
Let's run a quick check on the goods.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Okay.  
But first, I kind of need to...  
Zzz... Zzz...  
  
**Menagerie Staff：**  
I'm never not surprised by how much she sleeps.  
Hey, Hatsune! Get up!  
I did the checks, and everything matches up.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
The... checks...?  
Oh!  
For real?  
Now that's a relief!  
  
**Menagerie Staff：**  
Our members tend to get hurt more often than not,  
so Forestier's medicinal herbs being so effective is a lifesaver.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ehehe. That's great to hear!  
We really appreciate all the  
delicious food and stuff you give us, too. ♪  
  
**Menagerie Staff：**  
Pretty much everyone loves the produce from Elizabeth Park.  
Speaking of which, I hear Shiori's been working real hard lately.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Really?  
  
**Menagerie Staff：**  
Seems like she's big on the idea of repaying  
everyone that's helped her.  
Even Mahiru had  
nothing but praise for her work ethic.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh... Ehehe. That's my Shiorin, all right.  
...  
Oh! I just had a super good idea! ♪  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wa-ha-ha!  
And on that note,  
it's time to go find the perfect present for Shiorin!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
My adorable little sister's working hard,  
so its only right that I get her something she'll love! ♪  
  
**Hatsune：**  
But what oh what should I get her? ♪  
If there's one thing she loves, it's a nice old book.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
She's already got stacks of them, though.  
And I don't wanna get her one she wouldn't even enjoy.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hm... There's gotta be something that makes me go \"jackpot!\".  
  
**Shiori：**  
What're you doing, Hatsune?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
WAHHH! Sh-Shiorin?!  
What're *you* doing here?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm on a shopping run with the rest of Elizabeth Park.  
Then I heard your voice, so...  
Sorry. Am I being a bother?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Of course not!  
Have you been staying well?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I have. I'm feeling good more often than not these days,  
and I haven't had as many dizzy spells either.  
Maybe it's because of the cleaner air at Elizabeth Park?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh... My head...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Shiorin!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ah... It's been a while since I travelled this far out.  
I think all the exertion finally caught up to me...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
A-are you okay?! Uhhh, where's the nearest hospital?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Please don't worry. I'm fine now.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh... W-well, if you say so...  
Just don't push yourself too hard, you hear?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yeah. Thank you.  
What were you doing, by the way?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Me? Well! I was here on super duper important business with the  
Menagerie. ☆  
And then I heard all about you, Shiorin!  
  
**Shiori：**  
About me?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Yuppity! Heard you're working real hard at Elizabeth Park!  
That made all happy and proud! ♪  
  
**Hatsune：**  
And then I thought, what if I—  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I was gonna ask her if there's anything she wants,  
but this is best off left as a surprise!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wh-what if I praised you to high heavens?!  
Atta girl, atta girl!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Mmghh...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Anyway! I gotta run home! You take care now, okay?!  
And say hi to everyone at Elizabeth Park for me!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
S-see ya later!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh... Off she goes...  
  
**Shiori：**  
I get the feeling that she had something she wanted to tell me...  
Oh. That's a cold breeze... Brr...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
O-oh man! Almost feels like I fled the scene of a crime!  
That was super awkward of me, wasn't it?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Shiorin's ultra smart, too, so she probably noticed something was off!  
B-but that's better than sticking around and spilling the beans!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Anyway! I'm gonna give her a big, happy surprise!
