## Subtitle: For Whom I Fight
  
**Narration：**  
Today, {player} and Nanaka are out on the Prano Plains  
taking care of some monsters for a client.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Pfft, what a joke!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ahh, this feels like grinding to level 100 in the first patch of long grass.  
It's just boring. Whose idea was this challenge run?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hey, on another note! Recently, I learned a neat new spell!  
You'll let me try it on you, right? No? Too bad!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Well? How's that? Hm? Hm? Hm?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I want to eat something sweet...  
`Tag 1`  
**Nanaka：**  
Right?!  
 Aw yiss! Success!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Heheheh. That was a funny little spell  
that makes you suddenly crave sugary treats.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I even thought up a name!  
 \"Desserta,\" I will call it!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  What's it actually useful for?  
**Choice: (3)**  Th-that's amazing!  
`Tag 2`  
**Nanaka：**  
Oh, all sorts of things! While you're fighting,  
your enemy suddenly starts craving snacks, see?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
\"Urghh... I need my candy...\"And while he's distracted, you strike!  
Ahhh, I'm such a genius!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Nanaka：**  
Right? Right?! Quirky magic is the coolest of all!  
If you use it on an enemy, it might work as a fatal distraction!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Mmm, aren't I just... a genius?!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Merchant 1：**  
S-somebody help!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Mm-hm? Who's that running this way?  
Hey there! What seems to be the problem?  
  
**Merchant 1：**  
Ahhh! You two there! H-help us, please!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Whoa... For starters, can you calm down a little?  
A little explanation would be great!  
  
**Merchant 1：**  
*pant*... *pant*... W-we run a business trading in magic equipment...  
But on the way to the capital, our whole carriage of goods was stolen!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
A whole carriage?!  
That sounds pretty serious!  
  
**Merchant 2：**  
You're telling me!  
We even had a super rare spellbook in there...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
A rare spellbook?!  
 Wha—srsly? For reals?!  
  
**Merchant 2：**  
S... \"srsly\"...?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Oh, I'm sorry! I got a little overexcited there!  
Pay my words no mind! Tee-hee!  
  
**Merchant 2：**  
Y-you sure are an unusual sort of girl...  
  
**Merchant 1：**  
Hm? Speaking of unusual...  
Those dirty thieves used some magic I've never seen!  
  
**Merchant 2：**  
Oh yeah... I'll bet they're in cahoots with the Dark Collector.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Huh?! You guys know about the Dark Collector?!  
  
**Merchant 2：**  
Well, I'm no expert... I've just heard rumors here and there.  
But y'know, how else are you gonna explain all that crazy magic?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hmm. Our target's apprentices, stealing spellbooks...  
Hey, mister, d'you know which way they went?  
  
**Merchant 1：**  
Huh? I think they were heading for the cave just past here...  
W-wait, you're not planning to go after them, are you?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Of course! Leave it to me!  
I can't allow anyone to misuse magic!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
And that goes double if the Dark Collector's involved!  
Magical Girl Nanaka is on the case!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
This seems like the cave the merchants were talking about...  
  
**Mage 1：**  
Hey. This is the book... Take a look.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
There they are, admiring their stolen spellbook...  
Little do they know their punishment is nigh!  
  
**Mage 2：**  
All right, then let's get started with—  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Du-dun, du-dun... Du-duuun!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
To protect the world from exploitation!  
To defend the smiles throughout our nation!  
The adorable and totally OP magical girl Nanaka... descends upon you!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
With a cybernetic flash,  
I smite my foes!  
  
**Mage 1：**  
...Who're these jokers?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Fwahahahah!  
 I am the magical girl who will defeat you!  
How I've longed to meet you, minions of the Dark Collector!  
  
**Mage 1：**  
Wha...?! H-how do you know that name?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Heheh. You should have laid a little lower!  
Now, let's hear the truth! What is your real objective?!  
  
**Mage 2：**  
...Utopia.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Utopia?  
  
**Mage 2：**  
We swore an oath to reach our utopia.  
And we need power to achieve that... Overwhelming power.  
  
**Mage 1：**  
I don't know where you learned about us,  
but you're not leaving this place alive!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Whoa, talk about feisty.  
Thanks for the line straight out of Villainy 101!  
  
**Mage 1：**  
Now die!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Whoa! A-attacking already?!  
And yep, this magic is the Dark Collector's, all right!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
{player}, back me up!  
I'm gonna go all out! Take this!  
  
**Mage 2：**  
Suddenly... I feel like eating candy.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Guahh! Oopsies! I accidentally cast Desserta there!  
  
**Mage 2：**  
Wh-what do you take us for?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Arghh! This Desserta spell is useless!  
Actually, isn't fighting two of these guys at once totally suicide?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
However... a magical girl snatches victory out of despair! Hiyah!  
  
**Mage 1：**  
Tch... What a pain!  
Hey! You take care of the dopey-looking guy!  
  
**Mage 2：**  
Right! Heh...  
Think you can just stand and watch, eh?! Think again!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ahhh! {player}!  
  
**Mage 2：**  
Hah! He went down in one shot! The guy's a weakling!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
...!  
  
**Mage 1：**  
Aw yeah! Now if we can just—  
  
**Nanaka：**  
H-how dare you... How dare you hurt him?!  
  
**Mage 1：**  
Wha...?! Wh-what kind of spell is that?!  
  
**Mage 2：**  
Th-the power is unreal... Ugh!  
Let's just grab the guy and scram!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Get your filthy hands off him!  
  
**Mage 1 & 2：**  
Ng-guaaaarrrrghhh!  
  
**Merchant 1：**  
Maaan, you're our heroes!  
Thanks a bunch, strange travelers!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Aww, I just did what any magical girl would do!  
I just hope those goons learn their lesson in jail!  
  
**Merchant 2：**  
I can't believe you even handed them over to Nightmare for us.  
We'll be here in Landosol for a few days!  
Let us know if you need any equipment! We'll give you a discount!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ooh!  
 That does sound good!  
I'll be sure to drop by soon!  
  
**Merchant 1：**  
Well then, we oughtta get going!  
Thanks again for everything!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
...I'm really sorry, {player}.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
As a magical girl, I've always wanted to protect the whole world...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Yet today, I failed to protect  
the person closest and most important to me.  
I feel super ashamed.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  \"Most important\"?  
`Tag 5`  
**Nanaka：**  
Huh? Well, of course you're...  
 Wait!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
No! I-I didn't mean it like that. I just meant like, uh!  
You're like the heroine to my hero!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Wait, that's still no good!  
Umm... L-like a partner!  
 A best buddy!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Someone I don't want to get hurt?  
S-stop staring at me like that! My social skills can't take it!  
  
**Narration：**  
Though Nanaka struggled to forgive herself for her personal failure,  
they had at least succeeded in resolving the incident.
