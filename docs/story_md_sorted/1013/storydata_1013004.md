# Nanaka Episode 4
In a dream of Ameth's creation, {player} and Nanaka visit an anime shop together. Nanaka goes on a wild rant about her favorite video game character.
  
## Subtitle: Doing the Rounds Together
  
**Narration：**  
Today, {player} and Nanaka have come to the  
shopping district to do the rounds of her favorite stores.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Are you ready for this, my lad?!  
It's finally time to do the rounds together!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ooh, there are so many new releases to check out,  
I could barely contain myself until today!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Honestly, I've gotta say these moments are all I live for—  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Wait, whaaa?! What's this light?!  
Don't tell me we're being reincarnated into another world?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
A brave new world of cute waifus awaits us both?!  
And the only one who can stop my OP skills is—  
  

---  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hmhmhm~!  
What new wonders will I encounter today?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Oh! Hello!  
This is a surprise!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
What're you up to?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Just enjoying a walk.  
**Choice: (2)**  I came out for some fresh air.  
`Tag 1`  
**Nanaka：**  
A walk, huh?  
 I like it!  
 You never know when a cute girl  
might barrel around a corner and bump into you!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
And even though it's her fault, she calls you a pervert!  
But the next day, she suddenly transfers into your class!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Gueheheh... Perfection...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Nanaka：**  
Ooh!  
 What a noble goal!  
I do get a craving for fresh air after days cooped up in my room!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
\"Is it morning or night right now?\" \"What am I doing with my life?\"  
Those moments of existential crisis! Every otaku has 'em!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Maybe we're the ones who need fresh air most of all!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Nanaka：**  
Wait! So does this mean you're totally free?  
Then let's go on my regular rounds together!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Private {player}, follow my lead!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Bahah!  
There's no better place to be than here!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Why go home?! Can I live here forever?!  
Okay! We're setting up camp here!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Anyway, what's today's...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ahhhh!  
 Check this out!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Whoaaa! It's the new anime ad for Reign of Bahamutia!  
Check that sakuga! Oh god. I'm dying here!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Wait for it...  
 There she is! Lyrialle!  
Pant-pant, sniff-sniff!  
Aaahhhh! Turn this way, girl! OH, SHE DID!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
My prayers were answered... Ah, sweet gods!  
...Aghhhh! The mystery light is blocking my glimpse of heaven!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Stop, please! My HP is already sub-zero!  
No, I lied! Don't stop! I need moooooore!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Huff... puff... Heaven help me...  
I think Lyrialle's sheer cuteness damaged my sanity...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I have to share this cuteness with the entire world  
by giving Lyrialle way more main plot focus!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You can do that?  
`Tag 4`  
**Nanaka：**  
Hohohoh... Actually, yes, I can!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Listen and be amazed!  
My very own father is the producer of Reign of Bahamutia!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
So if I beg him hard enough,  
he may just grant my heartfelt wish!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
In fact, I took advantage of this once already  
to make some last-minute edits before it went on air!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
My apologies to the hardworking staff...  
But it's all for Lyrialle's sake, not mine!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Gueheheh... Lyrialle is too cute to handle...  
Just think if she got upgraded to a main heroine...!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ahhh, my Lyrialle... You angel, you absolute angel!  
Ahh, it's no use... My sanity... Lyriaaaaaaalle!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Whew... Sorry about that little outburst.  
Yeah, I just love my sweet Lyrialle so much,  
it drives me literally crazy!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
But I've let it all out now, so it won't happen aga—  
Aaahhh! Is that an Astrum strategy guide?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Whoaaa!  
 It's thick as a dictionary!  
Of course, I'd never actually use a guide!  
I like to take every challenge as it comes and solve them myself!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
But if it has any tips to let mages fight on the front lines,  
I can't deny I'd be tempted...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
No, there's no point if I don't figure it out with my own ability!  
In Astrum, I can become a real magical girl!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Even a plain old otaku like me  
can become all I've ever dreamed of!  
Isn't that the best?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ohhhh, if only that world could be our real reality!  
Not just a game, but the start of a real magical girl journey!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ahhh, my fantasies are going wild!  
I wanna get home and log in right away!  
Private {player}! I declare today's mission a success!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Well then, I'll see you around in Astrum!  
Farewell, my shining youth!  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Aaaand welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just saw was essentially a dream.  
I'm sure it'll fade when you wake up,  
so no need to dwell on it right now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That Nanaka, though. Really loves her magical girls, doesn't she?  
  
**Ameth：**  
How ironic that her wish has actually come true...  
It feels more like a cruel joke than anything.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm sure Nanaka is happier in her current situation,  
but she'll have to face up to reality someday.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Even a magical girl's transformation can't last forever, after all...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Sorry, I didn't mean to be a downer.  
I'm just talking to myself, so don't worry about it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, that's enough for today.  
I'll see you later!  
  

---  
  
**Nanaka：**  
...Huh?  
Why am I asleep in a place like this?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I feel like I was in a dream...  
And I think you were there, too!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Huh? You feel like that too?  
Hohoh! Sounds like the hands of fate at work!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Memories from a past life, maybe?!  
I know our Anna would love that idea!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hmm... I can't remember much aside from you being there,  
but I do have this strong recollection of a character called \"Lyrialle\"...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I've never heard the name before,  
yet somehow it feels incredibly familiar...  
One thing's for sure... She was TOTALLY my type.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ahhh, what I wouldn't give to see you again, Lyrialle...  
Actually, I should go search for her! Yeah! That's what I'll do!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
The sheer impact of that incredible cuteness...  
If she really exists out there, I must find her and shower her with love!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Welp! No time like the present!  
For today's rounds, we'll go on a hunt for Lyrialle!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so instead of searching for the legendary spellbook,  
the two of them headed into town to hunt for a legendary cutie.
