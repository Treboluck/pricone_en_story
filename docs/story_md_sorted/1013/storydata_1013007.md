**Narration：**  
Nanaka stands upon a volcanic mountain,  
a complex expression on her face.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
...

**Nanaka：**  
Ahhhh...  
I just can't seem to get over how I failed last time.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hmm? Ooh! This is a limited edition item!  
Uhhhh... It can wait for another time, I guess.  
  
**Merchant 1：**  
Hey there, missy! J-just who I was hoping to see!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Huh? You're... the merchants from the other day?  
Hey again!  
 What's up?  
  
**Merchant 2：**  
I-it's terrible!  
Those nasty mages you captured have escaped from jail!  
  
**Merchant 1：**  
A-and worse, they actually attacked us again  
and stole our valuable spellbook!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Uwehh?! Th-that same pair of goons?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
This is... not a good turn of events,  
but it could be my chance to avenge {player}.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I... I'll get your spellbook back, so you just wait right here!  
  
**Merchant 1：**  
H-hey! Wait, missy!  
  

---  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I followed their magical signature, and it led me here, but...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Aahhh...Why do I keep thinking about {player}?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I don't want him to get hurt again, though...  
Coming without him was the right decision!  
  
**Mage 1：**  
Ugh, this has been a real ordeal.  
  
**Mage 2：**  
But hey, we did get what we came for in the end,  
so it's all good.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Found 'em. All right!  
  
**Mage 1：**  
There's nobody here but us,  
so we can finally test this spellbook properly.  
  
**Mage 2：**  
Yeah. Let's begin.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
You really think I'd allow that?!  
  
**Mage 1：**  
Wha—?! The book...!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hahah!  
 One spellbook, successfully retrieved!  
  
**Mage 2：**  
You! Why are you here?!  
We had to suffer jailtime thanks to your interfering!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Heheh! And that's exactly what you two deserve!  
I'll send you back there in a jiffy!  
  
**Mage 1：**  
You're going to regret messing with us...  
Prepare yourself, \"magical girl\"!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ooh, I like that! You're such perfect villains!  
However! Did you forget? I've got the spellbook!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
You don't mind if I try out... this ultra-rare spell, do you?!  
I'll use it to defeat you both!  
 Haaahhhh!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
...Hmm? Did I bungle it?  
 One more time!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Haaaaahhhh!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Whoa, whoa, whoa, why isn't it working?!  
Fatal comprehension error!  
  
**Mage 1：**  
Hahah... Ahahahah! Too bad for you!  
That magic spell needs two people to perform the incantation!  
  
**Mage 2：**  
It's a unique form of magic fueled by bonds of trust!  
That's why this spellbook is considered so remarkable!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
No... It can't be...!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Or that would be the classic reaction, but the great Magical Girl Nanaka  
doesn't need a spellbook to whoop your butts!  
 No problemo!  
  
**Mage 1：**  
What an irritating brat... Hrgghhh!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
O-ouchie! You really do have some nasty spells...  
But I ain't about to lose! It's my turn now!  
  
**Mage 2：**  
I don't think so!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hey! I guess real life doesn't work like turn-based battles...  
But who cares! I can block this!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
 Urghh... F-fighting one-on-two... is pretty... tough...  
  
**Mage 2：**  
What's this? You're weaker than last time!  
Is this really all you've got?! Here, eat this!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ngh... Guaaahhhh!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Urgh...! But... why?!  
Last time, I was a match for them!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ah...  
  

---  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Oh! Of course! I forgot about your ability!  
Wooo! This feels like... a power rush!  
  

---  
  
**Nanaka：**  
You're on support duty, 'kay?  
I'll take the front lines!  
  

---  
  
**Nanaka：**  
{player}, back me up!  
I'm gonna go all out! Take this!  
  

---  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Haha... Of course...  
Against the thief, and the monster, and these guys...  
I only ever won because he was with me...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
All this time, I was just relying on his strength...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
But I forgot that... Tried to go it alone...  
What kind of a magical girl am I?!  
  
**Mage 1：**  
This is where it ends.  
 So long, \"magical girl\"!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
*sigh*... So Magical Girl Nanaka is getting cancelled mid-run.  
I just wish...I could see him... one... last...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Wh... what?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I made it.  
**Choice: (2)**  Sorry I'm late.  
`Tag 1`  
**Nanaka：**  
Huh...? This voice...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Nanaka：**  
No way... But why?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Nanaka：**  
What are... you doing here, {player}?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I see... Those merchant guys  
told you about the situation too, huh...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
But how did you find this place?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I saw your magic light up the sky.  
`Tag 4`  
**Nanaka：**  
No way... You're kidding me...  
 Ha... haha...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Aha... ahahahahah!  
 Ahahahahah!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
It's perfect! The classic climax!  
Just when all seems lost, the magical girl's friend arrives!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I can't believe I got to live through this moment!  
Hyahhh! My hype is through the roof!  
  
**Mage 1：**  
Tch... Another pest to deal with.  
  
**Mage 2：**  
Oh, who cares? We know that guy's weak as hell.  
If we attack 'em both, they'll go down in—  
  
**Nanaka：**  
You sure about that?!  
It's time I showed you... the power of our friendship!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hey, {player}... Could you try reciting  
the incantation in here with me?  
  
**Mage 2：**  
Hah! Of all the ridiculous ideas!  
You really think the two of you can use that?!  
  

---  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I'll channel the magic for both of us!  
So... you just believe in me and say the words!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Just like I believe in you...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Here goes!  
This is my... No, this is *our* magical girl power!  
  
**Mage 1：**  
Ugh! L-let's block it with our own magic!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Eat thiiiiiis!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Sol Diana!  
`Tag 5`  
**Nanaka：**  
Sol Diana!  
  

---  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Whoaaaa?!  
Wh-what's this?!  
 Such strength! Definitely OP!  
  
**Mage 1：**  
I-it's no good... I can't block... it all...!  
  
**Mage 1 & 2：**  
Aaaghhh!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
*pant*... W-we got 'em... right?  
  
**Mage 1：**  
I can't... lose now...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Aaagh! What a toughie!  
Couldn't he just conk out like his partner?!  
  
**Mage 1：**  
This can't... Urgh!  
W-we must join our master in... the Twilight City...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Twilight City?!  
Wh-where did that name come from?!  
  
**Mage 1：**  
My... deep... est... apolo...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
W... wait!  
Hrmmm... This can only... mean one thing, right?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
The mystery man's goal is... the Twilight City.  
But then why would he be handing out spellbooks...?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ahhh, it's just mysteries upon mysteries!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
W-well, we managed to defeat his cronies,  
so let's see what info they cough up after we throw them in jail!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
More importantly...  
 Thank you, {player}.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
That spell is fueled by the trust between its casters...  
So you must have really trusted me...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Even after I got you hurt before...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I believe in you with all my heart.  
`Tag 6`  
**Nanaka：**  
...Ehh?!  
 That's, uh... R... right!  
You just mean as an ally! Yeah, that's it! No deeper meanings!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
B-but... when you come out and say it like that...  
I-it's kind of embarrassing!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Waaghh... I feel all hot!  
Why's that?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Oh... right, the volcano! My face is hot from the lava!  
That's it. That's gotta be it!  
  
**Narration：**  
An incredible new spell, and the mystery man's goal...  
Having gained many things from this encounter, the magical girl duo  
headed back to the city, their bonds stronger than ever.
