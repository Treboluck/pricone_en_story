**Narration：**  
For the first time in a while, {player} and Nanaka  
have come to the shopping district for Nanaka's regular rounds.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Whew!  
 Feels good to be out on my rounds again!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I've been too busy to go shopping lately,  
so my urges were starting to reach their limit!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Now, let us go forth! To the field of battle!  
...  
Wait, hmmmm? Are you glowing?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ahhh... I've seen this glow somewhere before...

**Nanaka：**  
Whewww!  
 Finally! Finally this day has come!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
The Reign of Bahamutia collab cafe!  
My whole body is itching to experience it!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Now, my friend! Are you ready?!  
Onward ho! Our utopia awaits!  
  
**Boutique Clerk：**  
Hello there!  
 Are you on a date?  
I'm with the boutique just over there...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
A-a-a fashionista? Wh-what's this about?  
I'm not carrying any valuables!  
  
**Boutique Clerk：**  
We're offering a free trial of this season's top items and makeup!  
Would you be at all interested?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
N-no, I, uh... I've sworn to live a dark and lonely life...  
  
**Boutique Clerk：**  
With a little fashion and makeup,  
you'll be transformed into a whole new you!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ehhh? T-transformed? Like metamorphosis?  
  
**Boutique Clerk：**  
M... meta-what?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Every magical girl has... a transformation...  
Even Celly got a big power-up after her metamorphosis...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Yeah... I'll... do it.  
...You just watch as I transform!  
  
**Boutique Clerk：**  
All right! ♪ Come right into this booth, then!  
  
**Boutique Clerk：**  
Have you finished changing? Then... I'll open up the curtain!

**Nanaka：**  
E... eheheh...

`Tag 3`  
**Nanaka：**  
Urgh... P-please don't stare so much! It's embarrassing...  
  
**Boutique Clerk：**  
Ahaha. Your boyfriend looks totally captivated!  
  
**Nanaka：**

Ah! Wait, miss! The clothes!  
...Um, well then, sir, could you come over here and pay? ♪

**Ameth：**  
Aaaand welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Those fancy clothes left Nanaka a flustered wreck, didn't they?  
She does have a cute face, so she should have more confidence!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, that insecurity's probably why  
she turns to her magical girl fantasies.  
If that's what makes her happy, I guess it's fine.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I hope you'll accept whoever Nanaka chooses to be.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, I'll leave you two to it. See you later!

**Nanaka：**  
Mn... mnhhh... Oh? Did I just fall asleep?  
Huh? You too?  
 Full-on napping out in the sun...  
We must've been pretty tired.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Didn't something like this happen before?  
Us having the same dream...  
Hmmm... What a fantastical little situation!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I seem to remember in the dream I got dressed up all fancy...  
Well, probably a warning that fashionable clothes aren't for me!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  That's not true.  
`Tag 4`  
**Nanaka：**  
Uweh? H-hey! Where are you going?  
Huh? We should go clothes shopping?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Wh... whaaaaaaa?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
No, really, that sort of thing isn't my... Urgh...  
Fine! If you insist! But only 'cause you're my bestest bud!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Magical Girl Nanaka  
 will attempt a new transformation today!  
  
**Narration：**  
With {player} saying she was cute in every single outfit,  
Nanaka almost died of embarrassment that day.
