**Narration：**  
One day, when {player} is handling an extermination job  
on the Prano Plains, a pair of monsters suddenly attack him.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Monster 2：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**???：**  
Now it's my turn! Brand new spell: activate!  
  
**???：**  
Effect: the enemy dies!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Wowie, what a huge blast!  
I only just learned this spell, but it worked pretty well!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Yeah! Defeated monsters, check!  
Good job, Nanaka! You're a genius! And so incredibly modest!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
How many did I take out?  
One, two, three...  
 Wait, huh?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
This one doesn't look like a monster...  
Hey! It's a human?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
But there wasn't anyone around...  
Could this guy have fallen from the sky?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hype as heck!  
I know this story! Where's the flying ship?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Oh! You just waking up, sky-boy?  
Your timing's on point!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Listen and be amazed!  
You've just been transported to a parallel fantasy world!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Which makes me  
 your beautiful heroine!  
 ...Probably.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Actually, I got hit by a stray spell.  
**Choice: (2)**  You totally attacked me!  
`Tag 1`  
**Nanaka：**  
Whaaaa?! You mean like, mine?  
No no no, a genius like me would never make such a silly...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Nanaka：**  
Oh, please! You're such a joker!  
Maybe your memories are confused  
from the whole dimensional transportation thing?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Nanaka：**  
...Huh? Y-you really did get blown away by my blast?  
You're not trolling me? G-got any sauces on that?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Urkkk... I-it's true... Your clothes are in tatters.  
So your own body is the ultimate proof...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Aw, geez... I was so sure nobody else was around...  
I totally went all out!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Are you hurt?  
Well, if I knocked you flying, I guess you can't *not* be...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Wait a minute. Does this make me a criminal?! Is this assault?!  
Wh-wh-wh-wh-what now?! I don't wanna be arrested!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Jail cells don't have any manga, right?!  
No merch or anything?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I can't possibly live like that!  
Works of fiction are the blood that runs through my veins!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
N-no, hang on. If you're alive, is it all good?  
Surely they don't lock people up for a few little scratches?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
...Uh, I mean! I'm real sorry!  
I really wanted to try out the new spell I learned!  
I didn't mean to hit you or anything, I swear!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
So, um, it'd be really nice if, uh...  
you maybe didn't report me... or anything...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
You weren't gonna turn me in?  
Really...?! As in the actual truth?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
ZOMG! Forgiving the girl who just blew you up?!  
Kid, are you some kinda saint?! Maybe there's hope for this world yet!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Whew~! Thank heckity...  
If I'd landed in a dingy cell, that would've been my life over!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Oh, while we're here, I guess I oughtta introduce myself!  
I am Astrum's greatest magical girl, Nanaka!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Smiting my foes  
with a cybernetic flash!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
...Nailed it. Wahah!  
How was that? Super cool, right?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I knew I was the cutest *and* strongest!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  A \"magical girl\"...?  
`Tag 4`  
**Nanaka：**  
Wha—?! Y-you've never heard of magical girls?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Magical girls are like, super cute girls  
who save the world with their magic!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
They only exist in stories,  
but since I can already use magic,  
what's to stop me from being one, right?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
When I realized that,  
I swore to become a magical girl right then and there!  
And that's my story!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hey, actually, for a guy who just went kaboom,  
you look in pretty good shape!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
If you can withstand my ultimate spells...  
You've gotta be someone special!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Good sir! Tell me thy name!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hohoh... {player}, is it?  
Sounds like a hero's name to me!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Have you heard of a legendary spellbook?  
A key character like you must have some juicy info!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
If you know anything... tell me, please!  
 C'mon, c'mon! I'm all ears!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Never heard of it.  
`Tag 5`  
**Nanaka：**  
Aw, man... What a bummer.  
Well, I guess that's the normal response.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
The legendary spellbook I'm looking for is an incredible relic  
that gives you the ability to use mega-powerful magic!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Magic that rends the heavens and earth,  
reforming the world itself according to the caster's wishes!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ultimately, it transforms you into an all-powerful god!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
...god... god... god...  
OK, a lot of that was just my overactive imagination.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
But the spellbook itself totally exists!  
Just thinking about it gets me fired up like crazy!  
I'm all about that spirit of adventure!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
So please, if you hear anything about it, try to tell me first!  
As a collector, I've gotta get my hands on it!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
For today, since I'm done testing my shiny new spell,  
I should get going!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I haven't done my regular rounds yet, so I need to hurry back!  
There's a big new release coming out today,  
and I don't wanna miss out on the special edition!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I work at a local second-hand shop.  
So drop by if you find any info!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Well then!  
 'Til we meet again!  
  
**Narration：**  
As he watched the strange girl dash off,  
{player} couldn't help but think that if she was a mage,  
she could at least have healed him up a little before leaving.
