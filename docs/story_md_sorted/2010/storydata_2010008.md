# Chapter 10 Episode 8
The Twinkle Wish members discover a mysterious fairy in the Tower of Sol gardens, encased in some kind of crystal. When Rei touches the crystal, the name \"Fio\" comes to her out of nowhere, and as soon as she says it out loud, Rei and Hiyori find themselves standing in an unfamiliar world.

**Hiyori：**  
Wahhh?!  
H... hey, you guys! Come over here a sec!  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh?  
What's wrong, Hiyori?  
  
**Rei：**  
Have you already found some sign of the exit we're looking for?  
Very impressive.  
You always seem to have excellent luck, Hiyori.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
No, it's not an exit... Ohhhh, I don't think I can explain in words!  
Sorry, it'll be quicker if you see for yourselves,  
so could you get over here?  
 Everyone to me! ☆  
  
**Yui：**  
Haha.  
No matter what you're doing,  
you always seem to be having fun.  
  
**Yui：**  
Hmm, let's see now...  
 Wahhh?!  
  
**Rei：**  
...?!  
Yui, are you all right?  
  
**Rei：**  
The ground is surprisingly uneven, so be careful!  
If you get hurt, it can expose your body to all kinds of infections!  
  
**Yui：**  
I-I'm all right!  
I just fell over out of surprise, that's all!  
  
**Rei：**  
Surprise, you say? At what?  
...Wha—?!

**???：**  
...  
  
**Rei：**  
Could this be... a human corpse?  
No, some of these body parts don't look quite human...  
And what are these unusual wings?  
  
**Rei：**  
Is it a monster? Or perhaps a rare human race?  
She most closely resembles the \"fairies\" spoken of in legends,  
but she seems a little large for that.  
  
**Rei：**  
No... Somehow this being seems beyond our abilities to comprehend.  
Almost divine... So perhaps a fairy after all, then?  
Or even one of the gods or angels from the most ancient legends?  
  
**Yui：**  
Umm...  
This might sound completely crazy, but...  
Don't you feel kind of nostalgic looking at her?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, you're getting that feeling too, Yui?  
 Same here!  
She looked so familiar, it really shocked me!  
Since she looks dead and all...  
  
**Yui：**  
D-do you think she really is dead?  
It looks more like she's frozen...  
  
**Rei：**  
No, this material isn't ice.  
From the texture, it seems more like a precious stone.  
  
**Rei：**  
Like an insect trapped in amber,  
 this mysterious fairy-like being  
seems to be encased in... a jewel? A crystal?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
A-aren't you scared of touching it like that, Rei?  
You're so brave!  
  
`image display end`  
**Rei：**  
No... For some reason, I feel sure that this isn't a danger to us.  
What is this? This strange sense of fond familiarity?  
  
**Rei：**  
Ngh...?!  
What now? There's an image in my mind?

**Rei：**  
Yes... I think... we know this girl.  
  
**Rei：**  
Right. Before we realized it, she was always flitting around us...  
Whenever {player} said something strange,  
she would quickly react...  
  
**Rei：**  
Laughing, crying, getting angry, always awhirl with emotion...  
It feels like I  was always happily watching  
the two of them bickering together...  
  
**Rei：**  
Yes. I know you...  
Your name was... It was... Fi... o...?  
  
**Rei：**  
Fio... the Guide Fairy!
