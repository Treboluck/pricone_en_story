## Subtitle: The Cheer Before the Storm
  
### Place: Landosol Plaza
  
**Narration：**  
Days turn into weeks,  
and soon the day of the rescue operation is at hand.  
As planned, the city of Landosol is filled with festival celebrations.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm... I was expecting this,  
but the sheer volume of people is quite overwhelming.  
Please hold my hand so we do not get separated, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. It would certainly not do to get lost today.  
This is the big day when we will finally rescue Miss Pecorine.  
We cannot afford to make any mistakes.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I know.  
**Choice: (2)**  I wish we could enjoy the festival, though.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Good.  
Still, we should not become *too* tense.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If we act so strangely as to be conspicuous,  
the knights of Nightmare on their security duty  
may turn their attention toward us.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As such, let us try to act natural,  
enjoying the festival like anyone else for the time being.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed. I would like nothing better  
than to freely enjoy a festival like this by your side, my lord...  
The thought enchants me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
However, such pleasures can wait until after we have saved our friend.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It seems the festival will last for five days...  
As such, if everything goes according to plan,  
we will have time to enjoy it afterwards.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
When we do, Miss Pecorine... and, I hope, Miss Karyl can join us.  
Let us all enjoy the festivities together as the Gourmet Guild.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see no reason why we should not at least hold on to that hope.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah...  
Look at that stand over there, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
They are selling crepes.  
Did we not agree to meet our friends from Labyrinth  
at a crepe stand, if I recall correctly?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Since they are wanted as criminals,  
they have been evading notice by moving frequently from place to place,  
so they could not provide us with an exact location...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But as long as we speak the correct password,  
the crepe stand's proprietor should help us.  
Such was the message that I received via my messenger crows.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It's hardly a flawless method, so I was concerned  
that we may not be able to meet up with them as soon as we might like,  
but perhaps this is just the crepe stand we are looking for.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Let us quickly approach,  
while remembering to act casual, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ehmm...  
 Excuse me.  
  
**Crepe Seller：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh...? The individual selling the crepes  
does not look like a familiar face from Labyrinth... does it?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We are still not especially well acquainted with them,  
so I cannot feel entirely certain...  
But I fear it may be an entirely unrelated crepe stand.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Just in case, let us try giving the password.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ehmm, excuse me.  
Is a double-garlic, double-oil, double-topping crepe  
available here, by any chance?  
  
**Crepe Seller：**  
Oh, great!  
You actually said the password properly! ♪  
  
**Crepe Seller：**  
Where've you been?  
Honestly... I guess people like to splurge at these festivals,  
'cause I've been swamped with customers since morning!  
  
**Crepe Seller：**  
I've been frying all day and doling out toppings  
without a moment to catch my breath!  
  
**Crepe Seller：**  
Still, seeing you perks me right up, {player}!  
My Big Sis Power is fully recharged! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah...  
Ehm, you are Shizuru from Labyrinth, yes?  
You are dressed very differently from usual, so I hardly recognized you.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ahhh, wait.  
 You shouldn't say that name.  
Remember, we're wanted right now... So shhh! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Eheheh. Guess I gave you a surprise, huh?  
It's a little disguise of mine!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
The enemy does know my face,  
so it would be a pretty bad idea to come in one of my usual outfits.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah... I see.  
That certainly makes sense. Disguising yourself is a wise move.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yep. Just like a real secret society! ♪  
You remember that Masaki guy who's staying with us?  
Apparently he's great with disguises. He gave me lots of tips!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, and I borrowed a potion made by that Neneka girl, too.  
Apparently, it completely changes the aura you give off.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I'm using it right now, so you didn't recognize me at first, right?  
Physical contact neutralizes its effect, though,  
so we shouldn't get too touchy-feely today!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I'd love to hug my little bro, but I'm desperately holding myself back!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It's not just me. The other Labyrinth members, plus Novem and the rest,  
are all hiding in disguise here and there around the festival,  
waiting for the appointed time.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
As soon as they get the signal, they'll all charge the palace at once...  
So both of you can rest here at my stand until it's time to move.

**Boy：**  
Excuse me! Can I have a crepe?  
A strawberry one!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh—sure!  
Strawberry, right? I'm on it!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Whewww...  
I've never been worked this hard before.  
Our guildmaster would be thrilled if she could see it.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ehm... You seem extraordinarily busy,  
and we have little to do but wait...  
If you like, shall we help out with the stand?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, would you really?! What a sweet girl!  
Have a big sis pat of approval! There, there! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Heheh.  
 Hey, Kokkoro,  
thanks so much for always looking after {player}.  
I heard you'd recovered, but it's such a relief to see you're doing well.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I'm sure today will be a challenge, but let's do our best! ♪
