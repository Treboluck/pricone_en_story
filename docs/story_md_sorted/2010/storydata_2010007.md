### Place: Tower of Sol Gardens
  
**Narration：**  
Meanwhile, on the upper levels of the Tower of Sol...  
The members of Twinkle Wish are continuing their own adventure.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
We're the guild Twinkle Wish!  
On the hunt for mysterious treasures known as Sol Orbs,  
we go adventuring come rain or shine!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Recently, thanks to a suspicious map we obtained in the city,  
we've been exploring the Tower of Sol—  
probably the most mysterious place in the whole world!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
By the time we figured out that the map was a sham,  
we'd already ventured so far that we couldn't turn back!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
What will become of Twinkle Wish?!  
Hang in there, Twinkle Wish!  
Our amazing adventure is still only just beginning!  
  
**Rei：**  
Hiyori. I know you're full of energy, but please quiet down.  
We're still inside a dungeon here.  
All your shouting might draw the attention of monsters.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh! Sorry about that, Rei!  
  
**Rei：**  
No need to apologize.  
 Just be more careful from now on.  
...  
I have to ask, though,  
was there a reason for the sudden dramatic recap?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Well, I was just getting confused...  
I mean, who'd have thought we'd find such a weird place  
all the way up here?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
What *is* all this? It's like... a fancy park or something.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Up until now, this place was all dingy dungeon corridors...  
And the scenery's nice, but there's no sign of any animals!  
It's like the land of the dead...  
  
**Rei：**  
Ah...  
 So you were recapping our situation  
to get your thoughts in order, so to speak.  
  
**Rei：**  
Haha. You certainly can come across as bizarre at times,  
but there's a surprising amount of logic to your actions.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ooh!  
 That was a compliment, right...?  
  
**Rei：**  
Yes, of course it was.  
I was falling into a bit of a panic myself,  
but watching you has calmed me right down.

**Yui：**  
Hey, guys! I made tea for us all! ♪  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Uh, really, Yui? Tea, in this situation?!  
  
**Rei：**  
I think you may be disoriented as well, Yui...  
  
**Yui：**  
No... Actually, I'm feeling so calm it's kind of weird.  
I guess after all our adventures,  
I must have gotten used to seeing unbelievable things.  
  
**Yui：**  
Recently, no matter what happens, it never throws me off!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, huh! You've really grown a lot, Yui!  
I'm so proud of you! ☆  
  
**Rei：**  
Let's not become too numb to danger...  
But I'll have some tea. Thank you, Yui.  
  
**Yui：**  
Uh-huh.  
 The herbs in this tea have relaxing qualities,  
so let's calm down and think.  
What exactly is our situation right now?

**Rei：**  
Hmm... Since Hiyori just summed up our activities so aptly,  
I'll try to follow on from there.  
  
**Rei：**  
The map we were using,  
which claimed to lead to a Sol Orb, turned out to be fake.  
  
**Rei：**  
I suspect that the map  
was actually just leading us into a trap.  
A ruse for unsuspecting adventurers.  
  
**Yui：**  
Ohhh... They are pretty common,  
those traps that transport you somewhere else.  
Especially in ancient ruins, or on this tower's higher levels.  
  
**Rei：**  
Hmm. But aren't warp spells  
a form of highly advanced magic that's forbidden by law?  
  
**Yui：**  
No... It varies with number of people and distance,  
but the magic itself isn't actually all that difficult.  
If I trained hard enough, I might even be able to use it myself.  
  
**Yui：**  
It's rare nowadays because of the strict laws,  
but there might have been a time when warp magic was really common.  
It's so convenient, I'm sure it would be popular.  
  
**Rei：**  
Hmmm.  
And that's why these ancient ruins  
tend to feature warp spells so frequently...  
  
**Yui：**  
Yeah. It's not only traps—  
they even include warp panels just for getting around.  
So maybe we accidentally stepped on one of those.  
  
**Yui：**  
In the first place, you two keep saying the map was fake,  
but I'm still not totally sure...  
  
**Yui：**  
I mean, the interior of the tower is supposed to be uncharted,  
but the map's layout seemed really accurate.  
  
**Rei：**  
Hmm. The map was real, and we simply made a mistake?  
I'll admit that theory sounds more appealing  
than assuming ill will on the part of the map's creator.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yep, yep! Let's have a little faith!  
That's the kind of people we are!  
  
**Rei：**  
Agreed.  
...  
But even if it wasn't fake, I'm not sure that helps us right now.  
  
**Rei：**  
What should we do now?  
 The area seems perfectly peaceful,  
so shall we split up and look for an exit?  
If anyone finds anything, they can just shout to notify the others.  
  
**Rei：**  
We should stay alert just in case, but I don't see any sign of monsters.  
I think we should be able to explore without much trouble.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ooh! Yeah, let's do that!  
 Sounds like a plan!  
  
**Rei：**  
Right. We spent days traversing the Tower of Sol,  
so we're running short on provisions.  
Let's find a way out and head home for the time being.  
  
**Yui：**  
Yeah, you're right.  
I know Mr. Knight and his Gourmet Guild  
often cook up monsters to eat...  
  
**Yui：**  
And if we really run out of food, we can try that...  
But the monsters in the Tower of Sol tend to be on the cute side.  
I'd rather not eat them if I can help it...  
  
**Rei：**  
Hmm. Since you bring him up,  
{player} has been difficult to get hold of lately, hasn't he?  
  
**Rei：**  
Is he busy, I wonder?  
 His ability to strengthen his allies  
would be a real help to us in the Tower of Sol...  
  
**Rei：**  
It would have been reassuring to have him along.  
  
**Yui：**  
Yeah...  
But I guess there's nothing for it.  
Mr. Knight has his own life to live, after all.  
  
**Yui：**  
I do sometimes wish I could be with him all the time...  
  
**Yui：**  
It would be wonderful, but life is never that simple.
