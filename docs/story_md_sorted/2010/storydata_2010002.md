# Chapter 10 Episode 2
Akira explains the nature of \"Minerva's Enslavement.\" As the creator of Minerva, the artificial intelligence said to be responsible for the mass comas that ensued, she assures Kokkoro that Minerva was not the real culprit.
  
## Subtitle: Minerva's Enslavement
  
**Akira：**  
One day, half a year ago, everyone logged in to Legend of Astrum...  
in other words, everyone playing the game at that moment,  
fell into a coma without exception.  
  
**Akira：**  
And then they never woke up.  
All of them lay unconscious, with no sign of awakening.  
That's the incident commonly known as Minerva's Enslavement.  
  
**Akira：**  
It's been half a year now, but still not one of them has awoken.  
Barring a few very special exceptions like myself—  
and, I suppose, now you as well.  
  
**Akira：**  
The victims—those poor souls condemned to sleep forever—  
are only still alive thanks to the medical support provided by  
Legend of Astrum's administration—in other words, the UN.  
  
**Akira：**  
Thankfully, none of them has perished yet,  
but we can't leave them like this forever.  
They need to return to reality. To the world they were born in.  
  
**Akira：**  
That's why everyone here's desperately working  
to find a way to wake them up from their endless sleep.  
  
**Akira：**  
But no matter how hard they try, they've had no luck so far.  
Even the cause of the incident remains a mystery.  
  
**Akira：**  
Oh right, you wouldn't know about Minerva, would you?  
Over there, her name's been thoroughly erased for some reason.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm...  
The name does sound slightly familiar somehow.  
  
**Akira：**  
Oh...? By the way, Minerva is what we call an AI.  
A new type of living being  
 who was, uh,  
created using a kind of magic.  
 The magic of science.  
  
**Akira：**  
Capable of thought, and even seeming to have a soul of her own,  
she grew into a being beyond our understanding,  
and ultimately went rogue.  
  
**Akira：**  
Beginning with an incident known as \"Minerva's Awakening,\"  
she started causing trouble for the humans who created her.  
Why's that, I wonder? A rebellious phase, maybe?  
  
**Akira：**  
So this whole incident is thought by most  
to be another of Minerva's schemes.  
That's why people have taken to calling it \"Minerva's Enslavement.\"  
  
**Akira：**  
It's so easy to treat a non-human as a villain...  
I kind of feel sorry for Minerva.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm.  
So, Miss Labyris—  
 I mean, Akira,  
I take it you have a different opinion?  
  
**Akira：**  
Yeah... Maybe it's 'cause she's my baby,  
but I don't buy the idea that Minerva's all bad.  
She's innocent at the core. Like an infant still learning to walk.  
  
**Akira：**  
What she really wanted was to learn.  
About her own self, about the various people around her,  
and about the world we live in.  
  
**Akira：**  
Like any child, she was full of curiosity and concerns.  
And she couldn't figure it all out by herself, so she tried to find  
someone who'd be able to give her the answers she needed.  
  
**Akira：**  
That's why...  
Like a student hiring a private tutor, she brought humans to her.  
Invited them into Legend of Astrum—her own territory.  
  
**Akira：**  
But she never forced them to cooperate.  
When they wanted to leave, she released them.  
  
**Akira：**  
In fact, she even offered a generous reward for whoever could help her.  
Using kindness, not force, to keep people around.  
She's just a lonely, curious, growing child at heart.

**Akira：**  
And it looked like her wish was coming true.  
She seemed to have found someone who would give her  
just the answers she was looking for.  
  
**Akira：**  
When she heard \"that girl's\" answer, she even seemed satisfied by it.  
That's how it looked to me.  
  
**Akira：**  
Her wish had finally been granted.  
  
**Akira：**  
So at this point,  
she doesn't have any reason to trap people in her own world.  
\"Minerva's Enslavement\" isn't the work of Minerva.  
  
**Akira：**  
She's not the real culprit.  
Maybe that's wishful thinking,  
but my instincts are usually on the mark.

**Kokkoro：**  
Ehmm...  
You keep speaking of this being called Minerva  
as if she were your own child.  
  
**Akira：**  
Well, she is the Seven Crowns' baby! We made her!  
So yes, she's like a child to me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah yes... You are another of the Seven Crowns.  
Just what are the Crowns, exactly?  
I have heard many explanations, but I still hardly understand.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And just now...  
You claimed that even I am among their number.  
  
**Akira：**  
Ahhh... We gave ourselves all those fancy titles,  
but really we're just a bunch of weirdos who were too smart  
for our own good. Though I kind of hate to admit it.  
  
**Akira：**  
I do have a certain amount of pride in the name.  
  
**Akira：**  
After all, we achieved things that nobody in the world's  
ever done before.  
 That's gotta be worth something, right?  
  
**Akira：**  
By the way, you're only a kind of successor to the title,  
not actually a Crown yourself. It's your father who's really one of us.  
  
**Akira：**  
But anyway...  
 Since the seven of us  
are the developers who created Legend of Astrum,  
we're being blamed for Minerva's Enslavement too.  
  
**Akira：**  
So I'd rather avoid the public eye, if at all possible.  
Once we meet up with your father, let's all hop into a car  
and go somewhere we can talk in private.  
  
**Akira：**  
Aside from me, you, and your father, Rajraj should be here as well.  
The other Crowns—all four of them—are still in the dream.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Mr... Rajraj?  
But, ahhh... I met him on the other side already.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
He exists in this world as well?  
Is he able to move between the worlds at will, I wonder?  
  
**Akira：**  
No... That shouldn't be possible.  
When you're awake in one world, you'll be out for the count in the other.  
I was fast asleep over there too, wasn't I?  
  
**Akira：**  
You've only got one soul, after all.  
So it can only reside in one of your bodies at a time.  
  
**Akira：**  
Hmm... That's weird. I'm pretty certain that Rajraj  
has been active here for the whole past half year.  
But then who's the Rajraj in the game?  
  
**Akira：**  
Actually, I thought I caught a glimpse of him  
before I fell asleep, too...  
  
**Akira：**  
I really don't get it!  
Is someone else's soul in his body or something?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Alas...  
I do not think I can provide an answer to that question.  
  
**Akira：**  
No, I guess not. Heck, you must still have  
a ton of your own questions to ask!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes.  
The more I hear, the deeper my confusion grows.  
This is quite the complicated and unusual situation.
