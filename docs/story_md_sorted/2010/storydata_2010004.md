## Subtitle: Our Task as Dreamers
  
### Place: Clinic
  
**Narration：**  
While Kokkoro lies unmoving after being attacked by a vicious monster,  
{player} is staying in her room at the clinic.  
  
**Narration：**  
According to the doctor, her wounds are all fully healed,  
yet for some reason she has remained unconscious for an entire day.  
  
**Narration：**  
It begins to seem as though she may never return to the waking world...  
Until, just as the clock strikes midnight, her eyes softly flicker open.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Mnn... mnnhh...  
Ahh... *yawwwn*  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh dear...  
I let out a terribly large yawn. How unbecoming of me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It would appear...  
I have returned to this world without any issue.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What time is it right now?  
The sky outside looks very dark...

**Kokkoro：**  
...What's this?  
 M-my lord!  
Whyever is he lying with his head atop my bed?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh, this nostalgic sensation...  
It truly does feel like a dream, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord... My lord... ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  ...Kokkoro?  
`Tag 1`  
`image display end`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes.  
I am here by your side, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh.  
Were you holding on to my hand the entire time I slept?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Your grip is so tight...  
It may even have restricted my blood flow.  
I actually feel a little numb.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You must have been worried. I am terribly sorry for that.  
But as you can see,  
 I am perfectly all right now.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I would never abandon you to fend for yourself in this world  
that you still know so little about.  
I will always remain here by your side for as long as you will have me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So please, do not be afraid... my lord.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Hug her tightly.  
`Tag 2`  
**Narration：**  
Afterwards, Kokkoro explains what happened while she slept.  
She relates the things she saw in the other world—in reality—  
and reports everything she has learned.

**Kokkoro：**  
Haha.  
And so, you see, I am now able to travel  
between these two separate worlds.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Akira... Miss Labyrista took me aboard a \"bus\"  
to the home where I once lived in that world.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Do you know of it, my lord?  
It is a research institution, beside a menagerie called a \"zoo.\"  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Beside... the Menagerie?  
**Choice: (4)**  Beside... a zoo?  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, no, I am not speaking of a guild.  
In this world, the Menagerie may be an beastfolk organization...  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, the word must sound unfamiliar.  
In this world,  
such recreational institutions seem to be relatively rare.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Kokkoro：**  
But, ah... A zoo, or menagerie, is a place where many animals are kept.  
Before I came to this world,  
I lived in a facility where those animals were studied.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Due to my father's difficult position, he was not there today,  
but for now, that is where I will be staying on the other side.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As it was getting late, I retired to bed in my home.  
My body in the other world—a device called a \"robot,\" apparently—  
is nonetheless organic, and so requires rest.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. Miss Akira explained all of this to me, but it seems  
while I am sleeping over \"there,\"  
I can awaken in my body \"here.\"  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The soul, or mind, can only exist in a single location.  
So at any given time, I can only be awake in one of the two worlds.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In that world, I am in a well-guarded home,  
where my body should be fairly secure.  
So I think I will operate mainly in this world for now.  
  
`image display end`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Until we rescue Miss Pecorine, this world is my priority.  
Indeed, we now have even more reason to retrieve her.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You see... When I am awake over \"there,\"  
my body here lies asleep and dreaming.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And I could not bear to rest  
while our friend remains in such terrible danger.
