# Interlude 11
In the interlude world in between stories, Ameth explains to Rei and Hiyori that she owes a debt to {player}, that Yui made an important decision at a crucial moment in the past, and that she would like them to support and protect Yui as a friend.

**???：**  
\"Ensnared,\" you say... Not the most accurate choice of words.  
I'll gladly send you back whenever you like.  
  
**???：**  
In fact, if you stick around too long,  
we might run into trouble with your minds fusing...  
So it's better if we keep this short.  
  
**Rei：**  
...Wha—?!  
You're... that girl we just saw?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, it's the fairy who was trapped inside the crystal thing!  
  
**???：**  
Ahaha.  
It's been a while since anyone called me a fairy.  
  
**???：**  
Hmm... From the looks of things,  
I'm guessing you entered the chamber where my body's stored?  
Wow, when was the last time anyone made physical contact?  
  
**???：**  
I'm impressed. I suppose I should expect no less  
from the guild that once conquered the Tower of Sol...  
  
**???：**  
You all seem like relatively normal girls,  
but perhaps you really are quite special.  
  
**???：**  
Still... It's fine this time, since it was just you girls,  
but I wouldn't want anyone less friendly finding my body.  
  
**???：**  
It would be quite the problem  
if they went and damaged it, or tried to control me somehow.  
  
**???：**  
What a pain...  
I'll have to speak to Nebbia and rethink our security plan.  
  
**Rei：**  
Uhhh... Ahem.  
Sorry to interrupt you while you're preoccupied,  
but would your name be Fio, by any chance?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hm? Well, I actually go by Ameth these days...  
Rei, are you saying you've remembered me?  
  
**Rei：**  
No... I don't really know why,  
but when I saw you, that name just popped into my mind.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Huh... That's good.  
My hard work with all those dreams must be paying off.  
Even if it'll still be a while before your memories come back completely...  
  
**Rei：**  
Memories...?  
I'm not sure I understand. Who are you exactly? An old friend of ours?  
Where is this place, and why did you transport us here?  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's a lot of questions. Didn't I say we should keep this quick?  
  
**Ameth：**  
And this is all basically a dream,  
so you'll forget it when you wake up...  
Not much point in giving detailed explanations.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Still, whether it's a coincidence or something else,  
you did come all this way, and that's worth something.  
So I'll answer as best I can manage.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Really, you deserve a proper reward  
for reaching the upper levels of the Tower of Sol.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But I don't have that kind of power right now,  
so you'll have to make do with some words of wisdom.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It looks like {player} is so busy  
he doesn't have time for dreams right now...  
I was longing for someone to talk to, so this does work out.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Even so, we can't take too long.  
Tell me if you feel strange at all, and I'll wake you up right away.  
  
**Rei：**  
Understood.  
 Just being in this place  
does fill me with a very strange sensation...  
So I'd also prefer to keep this fairly brief.  
  
**Rei：**  
That said, I appreciate your offer to help.  
I hope you can answer a few questions.  
  
**Rei：**  
First,  
 do you know where Yui might be?  
She's another friend of ours.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh, no need to explain—I know all about Yui, of course.  
Such a sweet, kind girl she is.  
Pure maidens like her are a rarity in both \"that\" world and \"this\" one.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
\"That\" world?  
 \"This\" one?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Let's not go into that right now. It'd take too long.  
If you're interested, and you remember...  
You should try asking {player} later.  
  
**Ameth：**  
He seems to have gathered a fair amount of info at this point.  
  
**Ameth：**  
He'll be able to enlighten you a whole lot better  
than a girl in a dream you'll quickly forget.  
  
**Rei：**  
{player}...  
You're familiar with him too, are you?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh, yes. We go way too far back...  
That boy's the reason I'm still here now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Now, to answer your original question, you won't find Yui here.  
Unlike you two, she's still awake.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Right now... she seems to be calling out to you two in your sleep,  
and trying to wake you with healing magic.  
  
**Ameth：**  
We wouldn't want to worry her,  
so that's another reason we should make this quick.  
  
**Rei：**  
Hmm. So we're in a dream right now...  
One where we can think clearly... what they call a \"lucid dream.\"  
But then, why only us and not Yui?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yeah... She was right there with us.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Yes, the three of you are always together.  
Even when the world itself was reformed,  
there you three were, fighting side by side.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It was {player} and me, the three of you,  
and so many others working together...  
Those moments almost feel like happy memories now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But anyway. Nobody has physically accessed my domain  
since before the world was reconstructed...  
I wasn't sure what would happen, so I left Yui out of it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I deliberately repelled her, ensuring that she didn't make it inside.  
I know it seems cruel to abandon her like that...  
  
**Ameth：**  
But... at the end of our battle,  
Yui fulfilled a certain very important role.  
I can't risk reminding her of what happened then.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Even when I make my usual dreams,  
I've been careful to only show her happy memories.  
Those forbidden memories need to stay buried, no matter what.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Otherwise that kind girl might shatter completely.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...? What's this about?  
What happened to Yui? Huh?!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Please, ignore what I said. This really is a matter that's better forgotten.  
I don't even want you to speculate, so I won't say anything more.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Rei, Hiyori...  
Please try to watch over Yui carefully.  
And if the worst happens, as her friends, I need you to support her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It may be rather cruel of me to ask this of the girls who weren't chosen...  
But I beg you. Please take care of that girl's heart.
