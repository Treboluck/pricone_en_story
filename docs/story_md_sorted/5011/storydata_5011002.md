## Subtitle: Showdown in the Kitchen Stadium
  
**Narration：**  
Shizuru and Eriko face off in the kitchen.  
Between them, the air sizzles with palpable sparks of tension.  
  
**Eriko：**  
At last... the time has come to settle this.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You certainly seem confident, Eriko.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Well, of course.  
After all... this is my chance to crush the irritating bugs  
swarming around my love!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Heheh. Sounds like you still haven't realized that  
it's you who'll be saying goodbye to my little bro!  
  
**Rino：**  
Ooh,  
 the contenders both seem pumped to win already!  
They're really glaring daggers! The death has been cast!  
  
**Rino：**  
By the way, if you cast a death spell,  
doesn't that mean you've already won?  
Sounds like a really short battle!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Mm-hm, that sure would be an anticlimax!  
But the saying is \"the die has been cast,\" so it's just about rolling dice!  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, I get it!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Are you sure you're happy playing host, Rino?  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh?  
 How d'you mean?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Well, you're a friend of Shizuru's, are you not?  
I wouldn't mind at all if you challenged me two-on-one.  
  
**Eriko：**  
My victory is assured regardless...  
 Teeheehee.  
  
**Rino：**  
No, I'm here to host today!  
That means I have to stay neutral!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh, I see. By the by, Rino...  
I hear you have a habit of calling yourself  
my beloved's \"little sister\"?  
  
**Rino：**  
Um, yes?  
 What about it?  
  
**Eriko：**  
THEN YOU MUST PAY!  
  
**Rino：**  
Ehhh~?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Not only a big sister impostor, but a phony little sister as well!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Why must my love be surrounded by  
such an array of delusional maggots in heat...?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ahh, my poor dearest {player}...  
I will gladly exterminate the pests that plague you,  
so wait just a little longer...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It sounds like you need to take me a little more seriously!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I'm the only big sister {player} has,  
so it's my job to make sure he's happy!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
That duty is what makes me his true family!  
This is my battlefield, so I won't bow to any challenger!  
  
**Rino：**  
Well said!  
Naturally, I want to make Big Bro happy as his little sister as well!  
Sisters are rivals too, you know!  
  
**Eriko：**  
F-family, you say?!  
How can you speak such nonsense when you share not a drop of blood?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Taking advantage of my love's kindness  
to claim a position that will never truly be yours...  
Have you no shame at all?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Urgh...  
Eriko's glares are starting to sting,  
but we're on a schedule here, so let's start the main event!  
  
**Rino：**  
The rules are simple!  
Each contender makes a chocolate treat  
before the timer runs out.  
  
**Rino：**  
Whichever treat Big Bro likes best wins the contest!  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, and of course...  
Once the contest's over, there'll be free samples for the audience!  
  
**Rino：**  
Now then, let's get this snow on the road!  
Ready, set, cook!  
  
**Eriko：**  
...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
...  
  
**Rino：**  
Now, our confident contenders have begun  
laying out their ingredients in the kitchen!  
  
**Rino：**  
Will the tale of this day go down in history as a battle for the ages?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ahh...!  
  
**Rino：**  
Uh-oh! It's disaster for Eriko!  
One of the pistachios she delicately prepared  
has tumbled to the ground!  
  
**Rino：**  
That can't be good!  
Will Eriko be able to recover from this setback?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Tell me... Are you trying to make a fool out of me, girl?  
  
**Rino：**  
Shizuru, meanwhile, is already tempering her chocolate!  
Will she leave the competition in the dust?!  
  
**Rino：**  
But no! It looks like Shizuru has stopped in her tracks!  
What could have brought about this development?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
...Say, Rino. Could you try to quieten down a little?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Dear me... This background noise is most irritating.  
  
**Rino：**  
Hmmm? Both contenders seem to be voicing complaints,  
but I can't make them out from here!  
  
**Rino：**  
I'm sure it won't affect this commentary,  
so let's keep the hype going, shall we?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Now for a twist! It's time for the Special Helper round!  
  
**Eriko：**  
I don't recall hearing any such plans...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
A helper? Um,  
 who's going to help with what?  
  
**Rino：**  
Ehmmm, for a limited time only,  
both contenders can ask for a little assistance from Big Bro!  
  
**Rino：**  
Any request at all is totally fine!  
Well then, Big Bro, good luck!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  But what should I do exactly?  
**Choice: (2)**  This is kind of sudden...  
`Tag 1`  
**Eriko：**  
I would be happy to guide you in all the details, my love.  
  
**Eriko：**  
In fact, if you simply submit yourself to me,  
this battle will be as good as won...

`Tag 2`  
**Shizuru：**  
Don't worry, {player}!

In return, I'd love it if you could look only at me  
and cheer me on! ♪

**Rino：**  
That's a wrap!  
  
**Rino：**  
I think Shizuru really put on a fine showing there!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ooh, thank you!  
 You were the best, {player}!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Hold it right there!  
Do you think I can't see you trying to pounce upon him?

`Tag 5`  
**Rino：**  
And Eriko was really going for it toward the end there!  
  
**Eriko：**  
We did beautifully, my love!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ah, bliss...  
 Well then, nobody will mind  
if I take {player} home with me now, I trust?  
Teeheehee.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hold it!  
Why are you trying to abduct my little bro?!  
Can't you see he's uncomfortable?!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 6`  
**Rino：**  
Wow, this will be a close contest for sure!  
The crowd's excitement is going through the roof!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Guooohhh!  
You were the best, Big Sis!  
  
**Man 4：**  
Eri-Eri, you've got this! I know you can win it!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ahaha...  
 We haven't even revealed the sweets yet...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Pray tell... Who just called me by that ridiculous name?  
Please step onto the stage where I can pulverize you.  
  
**Rino：**  
Aw, c'mon! Everyone's just trying to show their support!  
Don't be too harsh on them!  
  
**Rino：**  
Now then! I think that's enough audience reactions,  
so let's move on to the big reveal!  
  
**Narration：**  
Who would claim victory, and with it, {player}'s hand?  
The moment of truth had almost arrived!
