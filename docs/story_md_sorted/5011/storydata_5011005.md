# Emotions in Bloom
As the stadium swells with the sound of booing, the baby Cacaola's cocoa pod erupts into a gigantic, violent monster. Eriko and Shizuru attempt to fight back, but before they can stop it, it captures {player}.
  
## Subtitle: Emotions in Bloom
  
**Narration：**  
Clinging jealously to {player}, Eriko and Shizuru  
continue their bitter struggle for romantic supremacy.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Now, my love, open wide...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You'd rather have your big sister's cooking, right?  
  
**Rino：**  
Seriously, I don't think he can eat another bite!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Ahhh... My perfect Eriko...  
She's fawning over that man like a puppy...  
  
**Man 2：**  
N-n-n-n-no, this is all wrong!  
That's an illusion! Our weak minds are tricking us somehow!  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Uh, listen. I only came here because I heard there'd be chocolate!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
You promised free samples for everyone, didn't you?!  
Hurry up and hand out the goods already!  
  
**Man 3：**  
I should've known... I was a fool to think a loser like me  
could ever eat a girl's handmade chocolates...  
  
**Man 4：**  
At least declare a winner, for crying out loud!  
  
**Man 1 & Woman 2：**  
Yeah, what gives?!  
  
**Man 2 & Woman 1：**  
What's the big idea?!  
  
**Cacaola：**  
*whiiiine*... *whiiiine*...  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh? Cally?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
What's wrong with him?  
  
**Rino：**  
I don't know! He suddenly started crying...  
  
**Eriko：**  
I have a rather bad feeling about this...  
  
**Woman 1 & 2：**  
Aaaaghhhhh!  
  
**Rino：**  
Aw, man!  
 The whole stadium's ruined!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
We have to keep the audience safe from the monster!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
We should stop it before the damage gets worse!  
  
**Rino：**  
Big Bro, can you lend us your power?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
All right! Time for Big Sis to get serious!  
  
**Eriko：**  
My love, please watch over me.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hahhh! Here I go!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Begone from my sight at once!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Wait, why are you attacking at the same time as me?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
My dear Shizuru, kindly refrain from interrupting my assault.  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, for heaven's sake! Can't you two stop fighting for even a minute?!  
  
**Cacaola：**  
*whiiiine*...  
  
**Ugly Lovely：**  
GRRUOOOOOGHHH!  
  
**Rino：**  
Anyway, its body's so gloopy, our attacks aren't doing a thing!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ngh... And I think it might be slowly growing stronger...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Yes, a moment's hesitation could be fatal.  
 Ahhh!  
  
**Ugly Lovely：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Cacaola：**  
Chocooo! Chocooooo!  
  
**Cacaola：**  
Cuaahh!  
  
**Rino：**  
Cally?!  
  
**Cacaola：**  
*whiiiine*...  
  
**Rino：**  
No way... He jumped in to protect us... But why...?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
How could you?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Wait, I think he's just unconscious!  
Li'l Bro, can you get this little guy to safety?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  All right!  
`Tag 1`  
**Ugly Lovely：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Eriko：**  
That beast seems to be quite focused on the little one...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Well, it did come out of his cocoa pod, right?  
There must be some connection.  
  
**Rino：**  
It's going to catch up with Big Bro!  
Now it's my turn...  
 I can't let that thing hurt Cally!  
  
**Ugly Lovely：**  
GRRRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Rino：**  
Aaaaaghhh!

**Rino：**  
H-huh? I'm... not hurt...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh my! My darling {player} shielded Rino with his body!  
  
**Rino：**  
Big Bro?!  
 Why did you...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I couldn't let Cally see you get hurt...  
**Choice: (3)**  Cally's like family to you, right?

Even so...!  
  
Jump to tag 4

**Rino：**  
Family...?  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Eriko：**  
My love! Behind you!  
  
`image display end`  
**Shizuru：**  
Wha—?! The monster spat a strange liquid!  
  
**Rino：**  
It's glued Big Bro to the floor?!  
  
**Narration：**  
With {player} taken hostage by the monster,  
will his friends and Valentines be able to turn the situation around?!
