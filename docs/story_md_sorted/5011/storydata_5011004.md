## Subtitle: Big Sis Goes for the Stomach
  
**Narration：**  
With Eriko's reveal over, it's time for Shizuru to unveil her creation.  
  
**Rino：**  
Well then, let's move on to Shizuru's tasting session!  
  
**Rino：**  
Shizuru! Please take center stage!  
  
**Rino：**  
...Huh? Shizuru?  
  
**Rino：**  
Th-this is very odd! Where's she run off to?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm feeling sleepy...  
`Tag 1`  
**Rino：**  
Ahhh! Big Bro!  
Don't start to nod off on us now!  
  
**Rino：**  
You still need to try Big Sis's chocolate!  
  
**Rino：**  
Um, Shizuru! Shizuru!  
Please return to the stage!  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh? A blackout?!  
I can't see a single thing!  
Everyone, please stay calm and remain in your seats!  
  
**Rino：**  
Wha—?! A spotlight suddenly lit up the main entrance?!  
  
**Rino：**  
C-could this mean...?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I'm back, everyone! ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Yes, folks, it's her!  
Shizuru has returned with a kitchen cart in tow!  
  
**Rino：**  
Wait. A kitchen cart?  
  
**Rino：**  
Wh-what are all those dishes laid out like a French full-course dinner?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ehm... This is a chocolate contest, is it not?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Look a bit closer.  
There's some chocolate right here, see?  
I'm saving it for dessert!  
  
**Rino：**  
All these dishes, and only a single morsel of chocolate?!  
What the heck is our contender thinking?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hmm?  
As always, I'm thinking of {player}, of course!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Now, {player}!  
Eat up and build plenty of stamina!  
  
**Eriko：**  
This *is* a chocolate contest, is it not?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Well, yes, but eating nothing but chocolate  
would be awful for {player}'s health!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
See, I think he's getting all tired  
because of a lack of nutrition!  
  
**Rino：**  
Um... I dunno about that...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But! He'll be all better after this!  
 The menu I cooked up  
is made from only the healthiest organic vegetables!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Here, let me feed it to you myself!  
Say \"aaa~hhh\"...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Eheheh.  
How's that? Tasty?  
  
**Rino：**  
Whoa. Big Bro's diligently chewing the food in a sleepy daze!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  ...Tastes kind of bland?  
`Tag 2`  
**Shizuru：**  
Too much salt is bad for you, you know!  
But don't worry, I didn't put a single grain of salt in this meal!  
  
**Rino：**  
I think too *little* salt might come with its own issues...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But this is all your big sis's cooking!  
So it's delicious, right? Right?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Yes, it's delicious...  
`Tag 3`  
**Rino：**  
Ooh, we got a \"delicious\" out of him!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Whoaaa! Big Sis Power is incredible!  
  
**Man 2：**  
That meal sure does look fancy!  
  
**Eriko：**  
As if he'd have said it without prompting.  
  
**Rino：**  
Is this even a chocolate battle at all anymore?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Shizuru is spooning mouthful after mouthful into Big Bro's waiting jaws!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
There's still plenty left, so eat up!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ahhh, my beloved's belly is swelling before my eyes...  
  
**Rino：**  
And he looks even more tired than before...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Are you starting to feel nice and full?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Tell me, which dish was the tastiest?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Can't... judge... Too... stuffed...  
**Choice: (5)**  They were all too tasty to choose.  
`Tag 4`  
**Shizuru：**  
Awww! They were all so tasty you couldn't stop eating?  
You really are the sweetest little bro!

Ohhh~! {player}, are you some kind of genius  
at making your big sis happy?!

`Tag 6`  
**Shizuru：**  
After such an amazing compliment,  
I might have to give you a big hug!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Wait, are you asleep?  
  
**Rino：**  
Hmm... What brought this on?  
He didn't seem sleepy at the start of the contest...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Perhaps this is  
 a little side effect of my love potion...  
Teeheehee.  
  
**Rino：**  
Heeeey!  
 I thought you said those chocolates weren't harmful!  
So you were lying all along!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ahhh, now I can do anything I please with your body!  
Like this and that, a little you-know-what, or even the unmentionable...!  
  
**Rino：**  
Um, are you listening?!  
 Hellooo~? Eriko?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahhh...  
 I think she's lost to the world for now.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It would be cruel to wake my little bro up,  
so I'll just let him rest on my lap for now.  
  
**Eriko：**  
H-h-h-h-hold it right there!  
What madness are you attempting while I am lost in thought?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Good question! Let me have a turn—  
um, I mean,  
that's against the rules! No touching!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Awww... But he's so cute when he's asleep!  
Look at his squishy cheeks... Eheheheh...  
  
**Rino：**  
Aaahh! That's no fair, Big Sis!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Touching my love? How dare you!  
 How dare you, how dare you...!  
  
**Cacaola：**  
*whiiiine*  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Did I... fall asleep?  
`Tag 7`  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, you've woken up?  
I was enjoying watching your sleepy face... What a shame...  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, excellent! He finally woke back up!  
OK, before he nods off again,  
let's hear the results from the judge's mouth! Go for it!  
  
**Rino：**  
...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
...  
  
**Eriko：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  They were both too tasty. I can't choose.  
**Choice: (9)**  Thank you for making all this for me.  
`Tag 8`  
**Eriko：**  
My love...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You're always such a kind boy...  
Your big sis is starting to tear up over here!

Oh, {player}...!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ahh, such boundless grace.  
I am deeply moved!

`Tag 10`  
**Rino：**  
Aww, after an answer as sweet as that,  
how can we possibly choose a winner?  
  
**Eriko：**  
My thoughts exactly...

**Shizuru：**  
By the way,  
 I've still got lots more dishes  
you haven't tried just yet. Do you want seconds?  
Here, say \"ah\"!  
  
**Eriko：**  
That's quite enough!  
Unfair advances are strictly forbidden!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Here, my love.  
Have some of my chocolate, too.  
  
**Rino：**  
Hey, you can't feed him that stuff!  
  
**Rino：**  
In fact, you both need to stop feeding him now in general!  
You'll make his stomach explode!  
  
**Rino：**  
Geez, can you not chill for like two seconds  
and let things wrap up nicely~?!  
  
![501100402.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/501100402.webp)  
**Shizuru：**  
Hey, Rino! Stop tugging on my little bro!  
  
**Eriko：**  
I will not allow anyone to separate him from me, either...

**Man 2：**  
...Hold up.  
We watched this whole thing, and you're not even gonna pick a winner?!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Th-that lucky little...  
He's got three girls practically wrapped around him!  
  
**Man 3：**  
Ahhh... My beautiful Eri-Eri...!  
  
**Man 4：**  
Hey, what about *our* chocolate?  
The judge just wolfed it all down!  
  
**Cacaola：**  
*whiiiine*  
  
**Rino：**  
Hm? Is something wrong, Cally?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Perhaps he's feeling hungry?  
  
**Narration：**  
Though something seemed to be wrong with the baby Cacaola,  
none of the three girls were willing to let go of {player}.
