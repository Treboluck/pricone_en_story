**Narration：**  
{player} has been captured by the rampaging monster.  
In a blind rage, Eriko goes on the attack.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Take this! And this! And this!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Get your... filthy paws... off my love!  
  
**Eriko：**  
*pant*... *pant*... Its body is all liquid chocolate...  
None of my attacks are leaving a scratch upon it...  
  
**Ugly Lovely：**  
GRRRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ngh... And its tail fires whole cocoa pods as projectiles.  
  
**Eriko：**  
A direct hit would surely prove fatal...  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, what now? What now?!  
It's all my fault that Big Bro's in trouble!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Rino, snap out of it!  
Let's think up a plan to beat this thing!  
  
**Rino：**  
Y-yeah... You're right, Big Sis.  
  
**Rino：**  
Ummm... Since Cally came to this stadium,  
he's heard nothing but bitter words.  
That must be what turned his pod monstrous.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, I see...  
Even after the monster's birth,  
negative words may have been making it stronger.  
  
**Rino：**  
Right. So... If we shower it with happy words,  
enough to cancel out all the nasty ones,  
d'you think it might stop attacking?

**Rino：**  
Yeah! That's gotta be the monster's weak point!  
  
**Rino：**  
I'll shatter it with the power of love!  
  
**Rino, Shizuru & Eriko：**  
Take thiiiiiiis!

**Eriko：**  
Urgh... How disgusting.  
My whole body is covered in sticky chocolate...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ahh! More importantly, where's my love...?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
He's fine. Just a little dizzy, that's all.  
  
**Rino：**  
Whew... Thank goodness!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Uhhh... Where's the monster...?  
**Choice: (2)**  Are you guys OK?  
`Tag 1`  
**Shizuru：**  
Don't worry. We took care of that nasty thing!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You lie down and rest your poor head in your big sister's lap.

`Tag 2`  
**Eriko：**  
Oh my.  
 Showing greater concern for us than for yourself...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Still, it is your body that worries me most, my love.  
Let me examine it very, very closely...

**Rino：**  
Hey, stop that!  
No blatantly taking advantage of the happy mood!  
  
**Narration：**  
Though the girls began to fight over {player} once more,  
there wasn't a hint of bitterness left on their faces.
