**Narration：**  
Shizuru and Eriko have finally completed their masterpieces.  
But who will Lady Luck—and {player}—smile upon today?  
  
**Rino：**  
Well then, first up,  
 let's begin with Eriko's tasting session!  
  
**Man 3：**  
Mistress Eriko~! Good luck!  
  
**Man 4：**  
Let us have a taste too!  
  
**Rino：**  
Here it comes now—the chocolate itself!  
  
**Rino：**  
And Eriko is lifting the dome from atop the dish  
to reveal the goods!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Thank you for waiting... Teeheehee.  
These are the chocolates I created for you.  
  
**Rino：**  
Well, I'll be! A set of bonbon truffles!  
They're individually decorated with delicate designs!  
  
**Rino：**  
Go on then, Big Bro!  
 It's time to dig in!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ahhh, my creation will finally touch my beloved's lips...  
Go ahead. I need you to eat up every last morsel.  
  
**Rino：**  
Hmm? That's a strange way of putting it...  
  
**Rino：**  
Well, whatever!  
I'll have a bite myself, too—

**Eriko：**  
Hold it right there.  
  
**Rino：**  
Ow ow ow ow!  
No need to grab my arm so hard!  
That really hurts!  
  
**Eriko：**  
I did not create any of these for *you*, hussy.  
  
**Rino：**  
R-right, of course not... Awww.

No words could possibly make me happier.  
Now, enough waiting. Eat them all up at once!

When have I ever done anything that would harm you, my love?  
Please, consume these delicacies...

**Eriko：**  
*staaaaaare*...  
  
**Rino：**  
C-c'mon, Eriko... It can't be easy to eat them  
when you keep staring at him so hard!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee.  
 How do you feel, my love?  
Any new... changes of heart, perhaps?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I feel all warm and fuzzy...  
**Choice: (5)**  I guess my body is feeling kind of hot.  
`Tag 4`  
**Eriko：**  
Oh my! What other symptoms are you feeling?

`Tag 5`  
**Eriko：**  
A burning sensation that feels almost dizzying, perhaps?

`Tag 6`  
**Eriko：**  
How is your heartbeat?  
Does it race when you look at me, for instance?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Huh? Not particularly?  
  
**Eriko：**  
How very odd... What could have happened?  
Did I mix the concoction wrong?  
  
**Rino：**  
C-concoction?  
 What's this all about?  
You didn't put anything funny in these chocolates, did you?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Just a little love potion.  
  
**Rino：**  
L-love potion?!  
Don't go feeding that weird stuff to my big bro!  
  
**Eriko：**  
It's not \"weird stuff\" at all.  
Besides, it should have no harmful effects whatsoever.  
  
**Rino：**  
That's not the issue here!  
Nobody's allowed to twist Big Bro's feelings against his will!  
  
**Eriko：**  
\"Twist\"? What an awful expression.  
He and I are destined lovers.  
Of course I must make every effort to keep his eyes on me.  
  
**Rino：**  
That's not the right kind of effort!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Well...  
If we can't agree on this simple matter,  
there's no point speaking with you.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Still, how awful... Another day of my love  
failing to respond in kind to my affections...  
  
**Eriko：**  
I really thought today might be the day  
he truly embraced his fate...  
  
**Rino：**  
Hmm... Is love really just about getting  
the other person to choose you?  
  
**Eriko：**  
What?  
  
**Rino：**  
I mean, I really love my big bro,  
so just being near him makes me happy.  
  
**Rino：**  
Just seeing him motivates me,  
and I always want to show him how much I care.  
  
**Cacaola：**  
Choco! ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Haha! Don't worry, I love you too, Cally!  
Let's stay together forever, OK?  
  
**Cacaola：**  
Choco choco! ♪  
  
**Eriko：**  
...  
  
**Rino：**  
Isn't it like that for you, Eriko?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Well, I...  
  
**Narration：**  
Eriko found herself deeply pondering Rino's words.
