## Subtitle: War is Love
  
**Narration：**  
A few days after the big incident,  
Valentine's Day itself finally arrives.  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahhh...  
 I'm almost at the cafe where I'm meeting Big Bro...!  
  
**Rino：**  
I'm getting so excited, I can't even think straight!  
  
**Rino：**  
I showered Cally in love to make that cocoa.  
So this Love Destiny Chocolate  
 can't be anything but delicious!  
  
**Rino：**  
Well... I'm sure it's nothing compared to Big Sis's chocolates...  
But Cally's here to cheer me on,  
 so it'll go well, right?  
  
**Cacaola：**  
Choco! ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Heheh.  
Oh, here it is!  
 This is the place!  
  
**Rino：**  
Ummm... Is Big Bro  
 here already?  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh! I think I see him over there,  
 with...  
Big Sis and Eriko?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
So you see, what you created for my beloved  
was a full-course meal, not a chocolate at all,  
making me the true victor.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It had chocolate in it!  
And if we're talking rules, using a love potion must be a bigger violation.  
Not that it even worked, so your entry was a total failure!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Wha...  
 I'm sure my concoction was perfect...  
  
**Rino：**  
Are you two really still arguing about that?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Rino. As the host and arbitrator, you must set her straight.  
  
**Rino：**  
Whaaa?!  
 Ummm...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Now, Rino, you're going to back up your big sister, right?  
  
**Rino：**  
Well, umm...  
 Can't we all just be friends now?  
C-c'mon, Big Bro, you say something too!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Cally looks much better now.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rino：**  
Oh,  
 you can tell?  
I looked after him carefully, and he made a full recovery!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
He does look full of energy!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Has he grown even larger than before?  
  
**Rino：**  
I think he has!  
It's so satisfying to watch a family member grow up!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Still... I never imagined I would witness  
a monster protecting a human.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I know, right?  
 That was the biggest surprise of all.  
  
**Rino：**  
Is it that weird?  
I think I know just how Cally felt!  
 Right?  
  
**Cacaola：**  
Choco! ♪  
  
**Eriko：**  
...?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
...?  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, you big dummies!  
It was love, obviously!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  As in... the desire to protect someone special?  
`Tag 2`  
**Shizuru & Eriko：**  
Ah...  
 Teehee...  
  
**Rino：**  
So it's about time the two of you put aside your differences already!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Well, I'm not sure we can ever really be friends!  
  
**Eriko：**  
I quite agree.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
After all, Valentine's Day...  
 is war, isn't it?  
  
**Eriko：**  
A war where all must face off as rivals!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
So, Eriko, I really think we must have another contest soon.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh, I would be all too happy to accept.  
Naturally, this time around, I will crush you into submission.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Only if I don't totally crush you first!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Come on, let's borrow the kitchen and settle things here!  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahhh... Off they go again...  
  
**Rino：**  
There's really no stopping them, is there?  
  
**Rino：**  
Still, after saying that we're \"all\" rivals in this war,  
they sure are careless leaving me alone with you!  
  
**Rino：**  
Here, Big Bro!  
Some special chocolate from us. I hope you like it!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You actually made the Love Destiny Chocolate?  
`Tag 3`  
**Rino：**  
Oh! You really remembered!  
Yep, this present is from me and Cally!  
You've gotta tell us how it tastes!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Wow... It's really good.  
`Tag 4`  
**Narration：**  
Showered in chocolate from his various Valentines,  
{player} enjoyed the sweetest day he could remember.  
  
**Rino：**  
Let's find happiness together, Big Bro! ♪
