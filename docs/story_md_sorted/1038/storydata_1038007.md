## Subtitle: Always a First Time
  
**Shiori：**  
Hello, {player}.  
  
**Shiori：**  
So you've come to deliver the mail  
to Elizabeth Park today as well.  
Thank you for your hard work.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Every week, you usually come around this time...  
So I thought you might show up today.  
I've been waiting for you here at the entrance.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Nyatt, say hello to {player}.  
Say, \"Hi, {player}.  
It's so nyice to see you...\" Yep! ♪  
  
**Shiori：**  
Anyway.  
There's something I'd like to ask you.  
That's why I was waiting here.  
  
**Shiori：**  
One of my favorite novelists  
will soon be visiting Landosol for a book signing.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I really want to go.  
  
**Shiori：**  
But I haven't been feeling well these days,  
and I may become bedridden for a while.  
I was hoping someone could get my book signed on my behalf.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I would normally ask my sister.  
But she lives in the forest,  
so it's difficult for her to get to Landosol...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Besides, I'm always asking her for favors.  
  
**Shiori：**  
But, {player}, you live in Landosol, don't you?  
I thought it would be less of a burden to ask you.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Of course, I will compensate you for your time.  
...{player}?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Wh-what's the matter?  
Your face is bright red.  
And you're stumbling... Are you not feeling well?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I see.  
You feel dizzy, and you've got a runny nose and sore throat.  
I'm pretty sure that's a cold. There's one going around now.  
  
**Shiori：**  
What? You don't know what a cold is?  
That's right, you've lost your memory.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Well, colds are infectious diseases. It means you're sick.  
You shouldn't force yourself to move around when you have one.  
It could potentially lead to your death.  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's suicide to climb the mountain  
to Elizabeth Park in your current condition.  
You need to take better care of yourself.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sorry.  
**Choice: (2)**  So this is the \"cold\" everyone's talking about.  
`Tag 1`  
**Shiori：**  
Please don't apologize.  
It isn't your fault, {player}.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'll take care of delivering the letters and packages  
you brought.  
You should hurry home and get some rest.  
Please, look after your health.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Shiori：**  
Yes.  
Wait, why are you smiling a little?  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's fun to experience new things?  
Well, I can understand that...  
  
**Shiori：**  
But your health comes first, {player}.  
Don't be pleased with yourself for being sick.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shiori：**  
H-Huh?  
Watch out, {player}!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Whew...  
That was a close call.  
I managed to catch you before you hit the ground.  
  
**Shiori：**  
The ground here at Elizabeth Park is mostly unpaved,  
so you'll dirty your clothes if you fall.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Are you okay? Can you move...?  
  
**Shiori：**  
What?  
You have a cold, so I shouldn't touch you...?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I guess you've retained some knowledge about being sick.  
I'll be fine. I'm practically sick all the time anyway.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Don't you worry, {player}.  
We've got our living quarters right over there.  
I'll carry you, so just lie down and rest for now.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I've got cold medicine on hand...  
So I'll be able to nurse you.  
  
**Shiori：**  
This is the first time I've ever nursed someone before.  
But I guess I just need to do what others do for me.  
I'm sure it'll be fine. I can do this.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Up we go... Your feet might drag a little,  
but I'm going to carry you like this.  
Don't worry. Beastfolk are known for their strength.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm indebted to you...  
No, to everyone...  
  
**Shiori：**  
...Since I'm sick all the time.  
That's why it's nice to occasionally do something in return.  
I feel bad always being the one looked after.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Heave-ho, heave-ho...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Whew... So heavy...  
{player} really does have a man's physique.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Maybe he has a fever. He's really hot to the touch.  
I am the one supporting his life right now.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I need to protect this warmth.  
Even if... Even if I...  
don't know when my own brief candle will be snuffed out.  
  
**Shiori：**  
After all, right now, I'm still alive.  
  
**Shiori：**  
{player}, you were the one who taught me  
that the greatest joy in life is to be alive.
