*humm hum hummm* ♪  
  
**Shiori：**  
...H-huwah?  
Oh, you gave me a fright.  
Hello, {player}.  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's been a while.  
Do you remember me?  
  
**Shiori：**  
That's right, I'm Shiori.  
It's nice to see you again.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Um.  
{player},  
may I ask what brings you to Elizabeth Park?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I see... So you've come to Elizabeth Park to deliver mail  
as part of your part-time job.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Thank you for coming all the way here.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Did you spot me on your wayback down?  
Elizabeth Park is all the way up the mountain,  
so it must have been difficult to get here.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I occasionally walk down into town to shop,  
but each time I end up bedridden for a few days after.  
I'm not very strong physically.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, but...  
Today, I'm feeling healthier than usual.  
That's why I've been doing guard duty  
while taking in some sun.  
  
**Shiori：**  
When I'm really bad, I can't even step out of my room...  
But today, I'm doing okay.  
I'm all right. Don't worry about me.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes.  
I was originally a member of Caon,  
the guild that guards the city of Landosol.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I was sent to Elizabeth Park  
so that I could recuperate.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I feel guilty about just being dead weight, though,  
so I sometimes help out a fellow Caon member named Rin  
with her work here as a security guard.  
  
**Shiori：**  
In fact, that's theoretically what I'm doing right now.  
See? I've got my bow and arrows prepared.  
That said, Elizabeth Park tends to be a peaceful place.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Nothing much happens around here. No incidents or disasters...  
No monsters climbing the fence and invading the farm grounds.  
That's why you caught me relaxing and reading my book.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Maybe I was too relaxed.  
I didn't notice you there  
until you said something to me.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I should probably take this work a little more seriously.  
But, really, nothing happens, and I end up getting sleepy.  
Ahaha... I feel embarrassed talking about it.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What book were you reading?  
**Choice: (2)**  Good luck defending the peace!  
`Tag 1`  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, I'm still reading the book I bought  
when I went shopping with you the other day.  
I'm a big fan of this author.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Since Elizabeth Park is on top of a mountain,  
I can't get down into town very often.  
Procuring books can be quite difficult.  
  
**Shiori：**  
That's why...  
I take my time reading each and every single book.

`Tag 2`  
**Shiori：**  
*sigh* Well, I was spacing out and reading my book,  
so you wishing me luck like that sounds almost sarcastic.  
Heheh... Now I'm really getting embarrassed.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shiori：**  
Oh dear.  
I guess you're in the middle of work right now.  
Sorry for taking up your time with all my chatter.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Here at Elizabeth Park, we have more animals than humans.  
  
**Shiori：**  
And the people here act so careful around me.  
As if I'm something really fragile...  
So there's no excitement, and I get bored.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I miss being around people, so it was nice to see you.  
Thank you for taking the time to chat with me.  
But I shouldn't be taking up any more of your time.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I see...  
So you're planning to keep doing  
this delivery work for the time being, are you?  
  
**Shiori：**  
You'll come visit Elizabeth Park often?  
I'm so glad to hear that.  
  
**Shiori：**  
If you see me around, please come and have a chat.  
Though I'm usually confined to my ward when I'm feeling sick,  
so we may not be able to meet that often.  
  
**Shiori：**  
What's that? If there's a book I'd like,  
you'll buy it for me and deliver it to Elizabeth Park  
along with the other mail?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Thank you, but I don't know how I feel about that.  
  
**Shiori：**  
There are so many books I want to read...  
But they're heavy,  
and it would be a burden for you to carry them all the way.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Why is it that you're always so kind to me?  
Is it out of pity?  
Do you see me as a poor, unfortunate child?  
  
**Shiori：**  
...I guess not.  
I can tell just by looking you in the eye.  
  
**Shiori：**  
You really are just a naturally kind person, {player}.  
I'm sorry for questioning your motives.  
  
**Shiori：**  
In that case, I'll take you up on your offer...  
If it's not too much to ask,  
there are a few books I would love nothing more than to read.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Of course, I'll pay you back for them.  
I really appreciate it.  
  
**Shiori：**  
If I get to see you every time you come to deliver a book...  
Oh—oh my... Just the thought makes me so happy!
