## Subtitle: Hand in Hand
  
**Shiori：**  
Hello,  
{player}.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes.  
Can you tell?  
I'm feeling exceptionally well today.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Today is my favorite author's book signing.  
I've been looking forward to it for a long time.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I didn't want to get sick,  
so I've been especially careful about my health lately.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I know you told me you were willing to go in my stead  
if my condition worsened and I wasn't able to go.  
  
**Shiori：**  
But I really wanted to meet the author myself.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ahh, oh dear...  
I'm in such high spirits.  
  
**Shiori：**  
If I get any more elated,  
I might start getting lightheaded!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Heheh...  
Well, we still have some time.  
Would you like to have tea somewhere?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I really appreciate you accompanying me today,  
{player}.  
  
**Shiori：**  
It would mean a lot to me  
if you also enjoyed today to the fullest!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hmm... Where should we go?  
I don't come down into town all that often,  
so I'm not very familiar with the shops.  
  
**Shiori：**  
If there's a cafe you recommend,  
{player}...  
Eeek!  
  
**Shiori：**  
S-sorry about that squeal.  
  
**Shiori：**  
What's the matter, {player}?  
Why is your entire body glowing again?  
  

---  
  
**Shiori：**  
Heheh...  
It's nice to walk around town again  
for the first time in a while.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Thank you for accompanying me,  
{player}.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes.  
You're right—  
we've walked a lot, so I'd like to take a break.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I've only just been discharged from the hospital,  
so I shouldn't be pushing myself.  
That's what both the doctors and my sister told me.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm sorry that I'm resting all the time.  
  
**Shiori：**  
My head is dizzy,  
and my knees are buckling...  
I don't think I can walk any more.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh! You really don't need to worry about it. I'll be okay.  
This kind of thing happens all the time.  
  
**Shiori：**  
In fact, I feel much better today than usual.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm sorry for making you worry.  
What a hopeless case I am...  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm ruining this date,  
my special date with you.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Huh, what?  
I thought you were rewarding me with a date  
as a way to celebrate my discharge from the hospital.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ahaha...  
It looks like I was getting ahead of myself.  
Sorry about that.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hm?  
You don't mind me thinking of this as a date?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh boy...  
Eheheh! This is my first date ever.  
  
**Shiori：**  
{player}, can we try that cafe over there?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I think I'll feel better  
if I rest a little and eat something sweet.  
Is that a \"yes\"?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Okay.  
That's a \"yes.\"  
Let's go inside then.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ahahah!  
When I'm with you,  
I think I act a little spoiled... ♪  
  
**Shiori：**  
Here goes...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Mmm... Mmm.  
This crepe  
is delicious.  
  
**Shiori：**  
But it's a little too much for me.  
I don't think I can eat it all...  
  
**Shiori：**  
{player}, would you like to eat half of it?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Although it'll technically be an indirect kiss.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Yes, please! I'm hungry!  
**Choice: (2)**  What's an indirect kiss?  
`Tag 1`  
**Shiori：**  
Okay.  
Guys sure do eat a lot,  
don't they?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Eheheh!  
Look at me, getting all flustered.  
I'm so silly...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, you don't know what that is?  
I guess guys don't really care about those things.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Then maybe you won't mind this, either.  
You're not the sort to get embarrassed by anything, right?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shiori：**  
Open your mouth, say ''ah''... ♪  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh! Are you okay?  
Was it hot?  
Did you burn your tongue?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Heheh!  
It's because you ate it in such a hurry.  
...  
Did it taste good?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Good.  
I'm glad you liked it.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Your takoyaki looks delicious as well,  
{player}.  
  
**Shiori：**  
*stare*  
  
**Shiori：**  
What?  
Oh, nothing.  
It's not like I want you to feed me a bite, too...  
  
**Shiori：**  
You seem to be really enjoying it,  
so I was just wondering what it must taste like.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Really? I can have a bite?  
You're so nice, {player}.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, but both of my hands are full...  
Do you think... Eheheh...  
You could feed me, please?

**Shiori：**  
Ah... Ahhh... ♪  
*munch, munch* It's dewicious!  
  
**Shiori：**  
...Hm? *squeal*  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ah! I'm okay!  
It wasn't too hot or anything.  
And it didn't get caught in my throat...  
  
**Shiori：**  
There were *two* bits of octopus inside for some reason.  
That's never happened before.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Heheh...  
It's so much fun being with you.  
I get to experience a lot things for the first time!

**Ameth：**  
Thank goodness!  
I'm glad to see Shiori discharged from the hospital.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It looks like she's getting healthier little by little.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm sure she fought hard against her sickness,  
and there's her doctor's skill to thank as well.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But perhaps you also played a role in her recovery,  
{player}.  
  
**Ameth：**  
When people come into contact with others,  
when they laugh,  
when they experience happiness...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Sometimes that's enough for good health.  
Laughter is the best medicine, to some extent.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Besides, I'm sure knowing that happiness awaited her  
outside the hospital wings was part of what motivated her  
to finally get discharged.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Heheh...  
I'm counting on you to make Shiori even happier.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Not that I need to say anything.  
I'm sure you'll do that naturally.  
  
**Ameth：**  
...And try to remember.  
There's happiness waiting for you \"outside\" as well.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, go on then.  
Enjoy your date with Shiori under the open sun.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hold hands together, as young couples do.  
You deserve a bit of fun, after all.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Heheh...  
Well then, {player},  
that's all from me for today.  
Bye-bye now!  
  

---  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh...  
Are you awake, {player}?  
  
**Shiori：**  
That's right.  
You seemed to have lost consciousness for a while there.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I've gotten used to it by now.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Maybe you've been working too hard.  
It makes me worried.  
Please, take care of yourself.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes.  
I wanted to take a break as well,  
so I found a bench to sit on.  
  
**Shiori：**  
The wind feels lovely today.  
I'm also starting to get a little sleepy...  
  
**Shiori：**  
What?  
Oh! You're right...  
  
**Shiori：**  
We got distracted for a moment,  
and it's already time for the book signing.  
  
**Shiori：**  
When I'm with you,  
I seem to lose track of time.  
Hehe... It's because I have so much fun.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes.  
Let's hurry to the venue, {player}.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Huh...?  
Wh-why are you holding my hand?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ah, no...  
It's not that I don't want you to.  
  
**Shiori：**  
If you're leading me by the hand,  
I can stop myself from falling, even if I get dizzy, so...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes.  
As long as you're okay with it.  
Let's hold hands and walk.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Heheh.  
Amazing.  
  
**Shiori：**  
{player}, you always seem to know  
exactly what it is I want.
