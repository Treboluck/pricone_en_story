In a restaurant one evening, Shiori treats {player} to dinner as a thank-you for helping with her shopping. She tells him she enjoyed today's shopping more than usual, and that she usually eats alone.
  
## Subtitle: So Much to Say
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, this table is empty.  
Let's sit here.  
Please, {player}, take a seat.  
  
**Shiori：**  
As a way of thanking you for helping with my shopping today...  
Please let me treat you to dinner.  
Although I'm not sure it'll be enough to repay your kindness.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Heheh.  
Usually, I have to take short breaks  
between my errands.  
  
**Shiori：**  
So the day normally ends before I can buy  
all the stuff I planned on getting.  
  
**Shiori：**  
But since you carried all my shopping for me today...  
I managed to visit all the shops I wanted to see.  
I feel so completely satisfied.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Thank you, {player}.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I hope you had a fulfilling day as well.  
Although it couldn't have been much fun  
taking care of me the whole time.  
  
**Shiori：**  
You did have fun?  
Really...?  
You're probably just saying that to be nice.  
But still, that makes me feel better.  
  
**Shiori：**  
As for me, I enjoyed myself much more than I usually do  
while shopping.  
  
**Shiori：**  
That said, I haven't walked that much in a while.  
I'm exhausted.  
I think I enjoyed myself a little too much...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Maybe it's because I'm tired, but I'm not very hungry.  
I just want to nibble on some fruit...  
I think I'll order a dessert.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I should probably be eating more so I get more nutrients.  
{player}, what would you like to have?  
I've heard this restaurant has a large selection of dishes.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Order a meat dish.  
**Choice: (2)**  Order the same as Shiori (just a dessert  
`Tag 1`  
**Shiori：**  
Okay. A meat dish it is. I'll call the waiter over.  
  
**Shiori：**  
The portions look pretty big.  
Are you sure you'll able to finish it?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I see...  
I guess guys are capable of eating quite a lot.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Shiori：**  
What? Are you sure you'll be fine with just a dessert?  
  
**Shiori：**  
You can order more dishes if you'd like...  
Thanks to you, I was able to buy used books on the cheap,  
so I have extra money to spend.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Huh?  
You want to pay yourself?  
Hmm... Do you feel bad letting a younger girl treat you?  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's okay. Don't worry about it.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shiori：**  
...♪  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hm?  
Oh,  
I'm sorry....  
I was browsing through one of the books I bought.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I really shouldn't be doing something else  
while having a meal with someone.  
That wasn't very polite of me.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm sorry. I usually take my meals alone,  
in a ward-like room at the farm...  
I guess my social skills are rusty from not dining with others.  
  
**Shiori：**  
But you see,  
this book is a new novel  
by one of my favorite authors.  
I've been dying to get my hands on it.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes. The story is about teenagers living in a faraway world  
completely different from ours...  
But I like it because the characters are strangely relatable.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I highly recommend the series.  
Starting from volume three, the buildup really starts to pay off.  
It's an absolute page-turner. ♪  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ahh...  
S-sorry.  
That was rude of me to lean into your personal space like that.  
I just get carried away when it comes to my favorite books.  
  
**Shiori：**  
...It looks like our food is here.  
Let's focus on eating for now.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Huh?  
You want me to tell you more about my books?  
Are you sure?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'd be happy to.  
The others at the farm don't read very much...  
  
**Shiori：**  
So I don't have anyone to talk about books with.  
I've been aching to discuss  
what I've been reading with somebody.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I've got to hurry back to the farm once we finish dinner.  
I could go on and on talking...  
but I'd feel bad for  
making you keep me company and eating up your time.  
  
**Shiori：**  
What?  
You can hang out with me again... anytime?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Th-thank you so much.  
Let's meet again soon then.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Next time, I'll bring my favorite books and lend them to you.  
I'll make a habit of carrying them with me when I visit town.  
I could probably give my arms a workout that way...  
  
**Shiori：**  
It would make me so happy  
if I could get you to like  
the same things I do.
