## Subtitle: Beloved Sister
  
**Shiori：**  
Please don't move.  
If you move, I'll let my arrow fly.  
  
**Shiori：**  
...Hold on.  
Is that you, {player}?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hello.  
I'm sorry for aiming my bow at you.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Recently...  
strange individuals have been wandering the neighboring hills,  
so we've been on alert.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes.  
I'm taking care of security here at Elizabeth Park.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm supposed to be recuperating, but it's dull doing nothing.  
Besides, I want to repay everyone here for their kindness.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Anyway.  
{player}, may I ask what brings you to Elizabeth Park?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hmm.  
So you were taking a walk, and you ended up here...  
by coincidence?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I see.  
Well, um, that sounds like quite a walk.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Next time, please use the main entrance.  
I mistook you for a monster or a bandit  
since you came over the fence.  
  
**Shiori：**  
And also, I would suggest sticking to the paved roads.  
The ground is uneven, so a misstep can easily send you  
tumbling down.  
  
**Shiori：**  
You could be seriously injured.  
Although there is a small clinic here at the farm,  
so you'll be okay as long as you're still alive.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Nevertheless, please be careful.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ah! I'm sorry.  
I shouldn't speak that way to you, since you're older.  
I was just worried for you, {player}.  
  
**Shiori：**  
*gasp*  
Ah! Please don't pat my head...  
It's not that I don't like it. It just tickles.  
  
**Shiori：**  
You must think my ears are odd.  
Even my sister pets my ears and my tail every time I see her.  
She always goes on about how soft and fluffy they are.  
  
**Shiori：**  
That's right.  
I have an elder sister.  
She lives at the elf village in the neighboring forest.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes. My father is a beastman, and my mother is an elf.  
From these genetics, my sister and I were born as different races.  
I am a beastgirl, and she is an elf.  
  
**Shiori：**  
So when I was a kid, I often wondered...  
whether or not  
we were really biologically related.  
  
**Shiori：**  
But whether we're related or not, regardless of our races...  
I still love my sister very dearly.  
No matter what happens, that will always be true.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Eeek!  
{player}, are you glowing?  
What's going on? It's so bright!

**Shiori：**  
Guess who?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hehe.  
Yes, it's me.  
Hello, {player}.  
  
**Shiori：**  
That's right. Shiori Kashiwazaki.  
I'm a patient here. Didn't you know?  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's surprising to see you in the hospital.  
What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?  
That's worrying.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I see.  
You felt like you were coming down with a cold,  
so you decided to visit the doctor just in case.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Good call. Early treatment is important.  
Take care and get well soon.  
 There, there. ♪  
  
**Shiori：**  
H-huh?  
Why are you backing off a little...?  
Sorry, was I too forward?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh... You don't want to pass on your cold to me?  
Well, my immune system is on the weak side.  
Thank you for your concern. Though it does make me a bit sad.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Heheh.  
I seem to be in higher spirits than usual?  
Yes, I am.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm in a good mood today.  
Why do you think that is, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Is it your birthday?  
**Choice: (2)**  Did something good happen?  
`Tag 1`  
**Shiori：**  
Bzzt. Wrong answer.  
My birthday is in November. It's a little further ahead.  
  
**Shiori：**  
What? You want to host a birthday party for me?  
No, um, I would love that, but...  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'll probably still be in the hospital then.  
They wouldn't appreciate us throwing a party here.  
  
**Shiori：**  
As long as I get to chat with you sometimes like this...  
I'm happy enough as it is.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Shiori：**  
Yes, you pretty much guessed it.  
Something good is about to happen.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shiori：**  
Eheheh.  
Actually, my sister is coming to visit me.  
  
**Shiori：**  
{player},  
you've met my sister before, haven't you?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Since I'm a long-term patient here,  
my sister occasionally drops by to bring changes of clothes  
and other various essentials.  
  
**Shiori：**  
During her visits,  
she spends the whole time chatting with me.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I've been really looking forward to seeing her!  
  
**Shiori：**  
I don't go to school very much, and I don't have any friends.  
I rely mostly on my sister  
to maintain contact with the world outside.  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's like my sister is the greatest mage in the world...  
She opens a door to the alternate world  
outside the hospital.  
  
**Shiori：**  
But my sister has her own life to live,  
so I feel guilty that she comes to visit me so often.  
Still, I can't help it. It makes me happy.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Eheheh...  
Would you like to join us, {player}?  
I want to share my happiness with you.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hm? You don't want to intrude on my time with my sister?  
And you would hate for us to catch your cold?  
You don't have to worry so much.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh! Here comes my sister.  
Looks like she's walking with her eyes closed.  
She is actually awake... right?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Honestly, she can't be left to her own devices.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Why don't you at least stick around to say hi,  
{player}?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm sure she'll be ecstatic.  
She doesn't shy away from showing affection.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hey, Hatsune!  
Over here. I'm over here!  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Shiori's older sister is Hatsune, right?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I was wondering how  
their different races would be explained.  
It all feels a little convoluted.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Thankfully, one thing is certain.  
They're sisters through and through.  
As close as any two sisters can get.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oops. Sorry.  
Look at me talking your ear off...  
  
**Ameth：**  
We've been through this over and over again,  
so it's becoming a bit of a chore.  
But, I guess that's part of the job.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just saw was basically a dream.  
Don't worry too much about it for now.  
Once you wake up, you'll probably forget all about it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I expect you'll be seeing many more strange dreams,  
just like this one, in the future...  
There's no point in talking about it now. Just be prepared.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, that's enough chitchat for now.  
Bye-bye! ♪

**Shiori：**  
...Oh, you're awake.  
Good morning, {player}.  
  

---  
  
**Shiori：**  
You gave me a fright suddenly falling asleep like that.  
Well, my sister is always napping in random places, too...  
so I guess I'm used to it.  
  
**Shiori：**  
You must be exhausted from working so hard every day.  
If you have nothing urgent, please get some more rest.  
Just take it easy and relax.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ah, yes.  
I rested your head on my lap.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I couldn't let you sleep on the grass,  
and I don't think I have the strength to carry you.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Heheh... Do you feel comfortable?  
My sister likes to rest on my lap, as well.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Huh?  
Did you fall asleep again already...?  
  
**Shiori：**  
There, there...  
Sleep tight, {player}.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ah, I feel so at peace here...  
I shouldn't be the one to say this,  
but this feels like heaven.
