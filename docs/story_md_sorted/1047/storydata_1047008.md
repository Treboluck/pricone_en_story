## Subtitle: A True Hero
  
**Jun：**  
...  
  
**Jun：**  
Urgh...  
Please try not to stare so, young man.  
  
**Jun：**  
It embarrasses me.  
Also, the sunlight that my visor usually shades me from  
is dazzling my eyes somewhat...  
  
**Jun：**  
The touch of the wind on my cheeks  
makes me feel a little naked, too...  
  
**Jun：**  
A-all this just from removing my helmet...  
If I change into a normal, more feminine outfit,  
who knows what will become of me...  
  
**Jun：**  
I might actually explode from sheer embarrassment.  
  
**Jun：**  
Still...  
I decided that I would do this.  
And a knight abides by her word.  
  
**Jun：**  
I will show you my true face...  
Change my clothing...And accompany you for a meal and entertainment.  
  
**Jun：**  
Because that is what I myself desired to do.  
  
**Jun：**  
And so, I will do my best.  
It will be fine.  
Just give me a moment to calm my breathing.  
  
**Jun：**  
*huff*... *puff*...  
There. I'm ready.  
  
**Jun：**  
First, I will go to that clothing store  
and purchase an outfit that appeals to me.  
  
**Jun：**  
I will use their fitting room to change into it...  
Then rent a lockbox to store my armor and helmet.  
  
**Jun：**  
Simple enough.  
This mission is well within my capabilities.  
  
**Jun：**  
I will do all I can, so please support me.  
  
**Jun：**  
...Young man?  
I would appreciate a response. Your silence unnerves me.  
  
**Jun：**  
Could it be... my constant hesitance to proceed  
has left you at a loss for words?  
  
**Jun：**  
Young man?  
Why are you crouching down?  
A-are you not feeling well?  
  
**Jun：**  
Well, I never...  
It looks like he has fallen asleep.  
I seem to recall this happening once before...  
  
**Jun：**  
I really am hopeless...  
I was so concerned with my own troubles,  
I failed to notice that he was unwell.  
  
**Jun：**  
How shameful. I am a failure as a knight.  
  
**Jun：**  
Are you all right, young man?  
Wake up. This is no place for sleeping.  
  
**Jun：**  
You will obstruct the other pedestrians,  
and in the worst case, you may be run over by a carriage.  
  
**Jun：**  
Urgh...  
What is this light?  
  
**Jun：**  
Oh no...  
For some reason, I am becoming drowsy myself...  
  
**Jun：**  
What is all this?  
What is happening?  
  

---  
  
**Jun：**  
...  
  
**Jun：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Jun：**  
Where... Where am I?  
Ehm...  
  
**Jun：**  
How very odd.  
My memories are confused.  
My thoughts feel sluggish, as though I have just awoken.  
  
**Jun：**  
I am... Jun Shirogane.  
25 years old.  
I make my living as a suit actor...  
  
**Jun：**  
Lately I have mostly been performing  
in a hero show at the local amusement park.  
  
**Jun：**  
My father is a masked wrestler, my mother a ghostwriter.  
My elder sister plays a famous costume mascot.  
  
**Jun：**  
My brother is an anonymous fortune-teller,  
and my little sister, though an ordinary student,  
wears a helmet wherever she goes.  
  
**Jun：**  
Since I grew up in such a family,  
it always seemed most natural to keep my face hidden...  
  
**Jun：**  
So even when I am not performing in costume,  
I wear a mask when out and about.  
  
**Jun：**  
Yes, I remember.  
That is who I am.  
  
**Jun：**  
My memories are clear...  
So what is this strange feeling?  
  
**Jun：**  
...Hmm?  
  
**Jun：**  
What's this? I heard a scream!  
Ehm... This voice is...?  
  
**Robber：**  
Gahahah! Nobody move a muscle!  
Make any funny moves, and this brat's in for a world of pain!  
  
**Boy：**  
Mamaaa!  
Help! I'm scared!  
  
**Robber：**  
Shaddup!  
You there, cashier!  
You're gonna put all the money you got into this bag!  
  
**Jun：**  
Is this what they call a r-robbery?  
Surely not... This isn't some kind of manga...  
  
**Jun：**  
Wh-what now?  
I suppose I should call the police...  
  
**Robber：**  
Whoa there, what did I just say?!  
All of you, put your phones down at your feet!  
You better not be thinking about calling the cops for help!  
  
**Jun：**  
Urgh...  
This must be a premeditated crime.  
At the very least, he's thought about how to avoid capture...  
  
**Jun：**  
The child's safety comes first.  
I can't do anything too rash...  
  
**Jun：**  
This isn't a tokusatsu show.  
There's nothing I can do to combat a crime in real life.  
  
**Boy：**  
Waahhh!  
Help me, help me! Mamaaa!  
  
**Robber：**  
H-hey, brat!  
Quit your struggling!  
You want me to kill you dead?!  
  
**Boy：**  
I-I'm not scared of you, bully!  
Bad guys like you get beaten up by heroes of justice!  
  
**Boy：**  
Help me, Tora Tiger!  
Heeelp!  
  
**Jun：**  
U-ughhh...  
A child is crying for help, yet I cannot move...  
  
**Jun：**  
I'm scared...  
The robber is armed with a knife.  
A single stab could be the end of me...  
  
**Robber：**  
...Whoaa?!  
  
**Jun：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Jun：**  
Is that you, young man?  
Why are you here?  
  
**Jun：**  
Wait, what is he doing?!  
He's dashing straight towards the thief...  
He'll be killed!  
  
**Robber：**  
Wh-what the hell's your deal?!  
Stay outta this!  
  
**Jun：**  
Ahh! Young man?!  
St-stop that!  
A punch that hard could kill him!  
  
**Robber：**  
Shut your face!  
It's this dumbass's own stupid fault  
for trying to play the hero!  
  
**Jun：**  
Ahhh...  
Look at him... The thief is beating him relentlessly!  
Wh-why did he do something so reckless?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Grin and bear the pain.  
**Choice: (2)**  Give Jun a sign.  
`Tag 1`  
**Robber：**  
Why, you... Ugh!  
You're pissing me off!  
You really do wanna die, huh?!  
  
**Jun：**  
Wh-what now?  
The robber is so angry, he seems to have forgotten to use his knife...  
But either way, that young man will be killed sooner or later!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Jun：**  
Huh...?  
Why is he winking at me like that?  
What does he want from me?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Jun：**  
Urghhh...  
I can't stand here and just watch this.  
  
**Jun：**  
Thanks to the young man's reckless actions,  
that villain is completely distracted...  
  
**Jun：**  
This is my chance!  
Now! I have to move!  
If I don't move now, I'll regret it!  
  
**Jun：**  
Hiyaaahhh!  
  
**Robber：**  
Whoaaa?!  
  
**Jun：**  
There!  
A perfect flying kick from behind!  
The thief stumbled away from the young man and the boy!  
  
**Jun：**  
I-I'm warning you, robber!  
Give up and surrender yourself at once!  
  
**Robber：**  
Why, you...!  
Wearing that dumb mask... You think this is some kinda joke?!  
  
**Jun：**  
What's the mask got to do with anything?!  
At any rate, drop that knife at once!  
I'm going to call the police, so don't move!  
  
**Robber：**  
Ehhh?!  
Like hell I'd do that! What kind of idiot d'you take me for?!  
You're dead meat, girl!  
  
**Jun：**  
Aaahhh!  
I-I've been stabbed?!  
  
**Jun：**  
No... The knife only struck my mask!  
It didn't even scratch me!  
  
**Jun：**  
And with my mask knocked away,  
I can see more clearly than ever!  
  
**Jun：**  
I can beat him!

**Jun：**  
Pray to your gods, villain!  
The forces of justice are here to pass judgment!  
  
**Robber：**  
Guehhh....?!  
  
**Jun：**  
Nice! I did it!  
A one-hit knockout!  
Justice always prevails!  
  
**Jun：**  
Now then... I had better tie up this fainted criminal...  
Ahh, I thought I might die...  
  
**Boy：**  
Th-thanks, Tora Tiger!  
I was so scared!

**Jun：**  
R-right...  
I am just wearing a mask, you know—  
I am not actually the hero Tora Tiger.  
  
**Jun：**  
...But no matter.  
Are you all right? You're not hurt, are you?  
That must have been frightening. There, there.  
  
**Boy：**  
Eheheh... I'm OK!  
Thanks for saving me, mister!  
  
**Jun：**  
Ah...  
Strictly speaking, I am not a \"mister\"  
but a \"miss\".  
  
**Jun：**  
Besides which...  
Rather than thanking me, you should offer your thanks  
to the young man over there.  
  
**Jun：**  
He was the one who risked his life to protect you.  
  
**Jun：**  
That young man is a true hero.  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
There we go. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I always think this, but you really do have the most  
ridiculously eventful life, don't you?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Just how unlucky do you have to be  
to get mixed up in a robbery in this peaceful country?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Not that I mind.  
It's pretty entertaining to watch, at least...  
  
**Ameth：**  
And luckily for you, it looks like nobody got injured  
except for the foolish robber himself.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Still, try to take care of yourself, OK?  
  
**Ameth：**  
This isn't a game, you know.  
If you get yourself killed, there's no coming back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ah well...  
I suppose there's no point telling you that now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
More to the point, you should hurry and wake up.  
If you're not careful, you might find yourself mixed up  
in something much trickier than a robbery.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm not entirely sure on the details  
of Jun's background in \"this\" world...  
  
**Ameth：**  
But I'm quite sure that seeing her face  
means involving yourself in her personal issues.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I did warn you, you know.  
But you just had to go and get close to her anyway.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Now that you've come this far,  
I hope you'll stick with her to the end.  
  
**Ameth：**  
If she hadn't come to your aid back there,  
you might have been killed by that robber, after all.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You owe that girl your life, so you'd better be thankful  
and take good care of her from now on.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm pretty sure the only one who can remove that mask  
and reach out to the real Jun...  
  
**Ameth：**  
...is you, \"young man.\"  
  

---  
  
**Jun：**  
...  
  
**Jun：**  
...Mnhh... Urnhh...  
Huh...? Was I asleep just now?  
  
**Jun：**  
Right...  
Good morning, young man.  
  
**Jun：**  
I'm very sorry.  
I suppose I really must not be in the best of sorts.  
  
**Jun：**  
To doze off on the street in the middle of our date...  
That goes beyond mere impoliteness.  
  
**Jun：**  
Oh, I'm sorry. I suppose this isn't a date, exactly...  
I know that, of course.  
  
**Jun：**  
You're just a very kind young man  
trying to keep a lonely woman company.  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha.  
Still, I do appreciate it, and I couldn't be happier.  
I have always wanted to enjoy myself like this.  
  
**Jun：**  
Well then, shall we get back to the business at hand?  
  
**Jun：**  
First of all, I need to obtain an outfit for myself.  
After that, you can show me to a nice spot for lunch.  
  
**Jun：**  
We don't need any dramatic incidents  
to enjoy our time with each other.
