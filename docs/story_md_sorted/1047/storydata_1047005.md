## Subtitle: Behind the Mask
  
**Jun：**  
...  
  
**Jun：**  
...H-huh?  
Was I asleep just now?  
  
**Jun：**  
...?  
I'm feeling a little lost.  
  
**Jun：**  
What exactly is this place?  
I feel like I recognize it...  
  
**Jun：**  
Ah yes... It's the Sarendia Orphanage building.  
When young Saren was preparing to re-establish the guild,  
there was a photograph of this place in the papers she submitted.  
  
**Jun：**  
The interior looks far more presentable than I recall,  
so I scarcely recognized it for a moment.  
  
**Jun：**  
She must have put in so much work  
to clean and furnish that old building to this extent...  
  
**Jun：**  
Saren always has been a hard worker.  
  
**Jun：**  
The Sarendia Orphanage guild she now leads  
and my own guild, Nightmare,  
are both member guilds of Princess Knight.  
  
**Jun：**  
Surely we will have opportunities to cooperate.  
I would very much like to support her in her endeavor.  
  
**Jun：**  
Although lately, inter-guild relations have been a little strained,  
so I may not be able to do much right now.  
  
**Jun：**  
...Hm?  
  
**Jun：**  
What's this? Young man?  
Why are you collapsed right beside my bed?  
  
**Jun：**  
Are you all right?  
You are alive, I hope?  
  
**Jun：**  
Yes... You seem to be breathing.  
That's good, at least.  
  
**Jun：**  
What is the matter?  
Are you feeling sickly?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm all right.  
**Choice: (2)**  Never mind me, are you all right?  
`Tag 1`  
**Jun：**  
I see.  
That's good to hear.  
  
**Jun：**  
But then...  
If I might ask, why are you lying there?  
  
**Jun：**  
I fear some explanation may be necessary, young man.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Jun：**  
Hmm?  
Well, to be honest, I'm not in the best of states.  
  
**Jun：**  
My body feels heavy, as if my limbs are leaden...  
Normally my armor and helmet do not bother me at all,  
but right now, they are a crushing weight upon me...  
  
**Jun：**  
But no, that's enough about me.  
We need to clarify the situation here.  
Could you explain what's going on, young man?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Jun：**  
...I see.  
So on your way home from work,  
you found me collapsed in the street.  
  
**Jun：**  
You couldn't bring yourself to leave me there,  
so you carried me all the way to this orphanage where you are staying?  
Well, I never... That cannot have been an easy task.  
  
**Jun：**  
Thank you.  
You really are a very kind young man.  
  
**Jun：**  
That's right.  
Thanks to the rising crime rate  
and our lack of manpower at Nightmare...  
  
**Jun：**  
As well as for the sake of organizational reform,  
I have been doing tasks outside of my usual guard duty of late.  
  
**Jun：**  
Today, I was on my way to carry out  
a capture operation on the swarm of monsters  
that have suddenly appeared around the Tower of Sol.  
  
**Jun：**  
Not only are they unfamiliar, they're also rather powerful...  
And our orders were not to exterminate them but to capture them alive,  
so it was quite the difficult mission.  
  
**Jun：**  
Due to our lack of manpower, there were junior members participating,  
and I pushed myself a little too hard trying to protect them...  
I'm sorry to say I sustained some injuries.  
  
**Jun：**  
Nothing especially serious, of course,  
so I made do with just some basic first aid.  
  
**Jun：**  
But judging from my current state...  
Those monsters must have been poisonous,  
or else my wound was contaminated with an infection.  
  
**Jun：**  
I seem to have a fever, and I feel dizzy.  
That must be why I collapsed on my way home.  
  
**Jun：**  
How embarrassing...  
Though I stand at the top of Nightmare's hierarchy,  
I usually act as a simple gatekeeper.  
  
**Jun：**  
I am not exactly used to fighting monsters.  
  
**Jun：**  
Of course, that is no excuse.  
To protect the peace of the city's people, I must do all I can.  
  
**Jun：**  
...Young man.  
Could it be that you have collapsed  
because you caught this infection from me?  
  
**Jun：**  
Or perhaps some of the monsters' poison remained,  
and you came into contact with it while treating me?  
  
**Jun：**  
If so, I must apologize.  
Here, show me your symptoms.  
  
**Jun：**  
I can at least apply first aid.  
If you are in any kind of pain, you should tell me.  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm?  
You're just completely worn out from carrying me here?  
That is why you were sprawled out beside me?  
  
**Jun：**  
And since I was occupying the bed,  
you had nowhere to rest but the floor...?  
  
**Jun：**  
Well, I'm very sorry about that.  
True enough, I must have been heavy...  
  
**Jun：**  
I do a lot of training, after all.  
My muscular mass must exceed that of the average young woman,  
and of course, this armor itself is quite the burden too.  
  
**Jun：**  
I think I had better return to my own home.  
So please, you should get some proper rest in bed.  
  
**Jun：**  
I will have to repay you somehow  
for the help you have given me.  
  
**Jun：**  
Wha...  
I-is something wrong? Why are you peering at me so closely, young man?  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm?  
My body is still recovering, so I need to rest for now?  
  
**Jun：**  
You will explain the situation to Saren  
and ask to stay in a different room for now?  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm...  
To be honest, I would appreciate that.  
  
**Jun：**  
My whole body feels like it is burning hot,  
and even speaking is not easy for me right now.  
  
**Jun：**  
I suppose it would be best  
to accept your kind offer and rest here a little longer.  
  
**Jun：**  
Once I recover, I will find some way to thank you.  
...I really do appreciate this, young man.  
  
**Jun：**  
...

**Jun：**  
...Wha...?  
  
**Jun：**  
Huh?  
Wh-why did you remove my helmet?  
  
**Jun：**  
M-my family code forbids me  
from showing my face to any other person!  
Don't look! I can't bear...!  
  
**Jun：**  
Ahhh...  
You thought I might have difficulty  
breathing through that heavy helmet?  
  
**Jun：**  
Well, you are not wrong,  
but please don't remove it so suddenly...  
  
**Jun：**  
I know I am no master of conversation myself,  
but you should work on your communication skills.  
  
**Jun：**  
Well, no matter...  
It seems you meant no harm,  
and frankly, I do not have the energy to protest...  
  
**Jun：**  
Thankfully, I was wearing this mask under my helmet,  
so I have not been fully exposed.  
  
**Jun：**  
Actually, there is a part of me that feels  
I would not mind showing my face to you...  
  
**Jun：**  
But I'm sorry.  
The very idea is still so embarrassing...
