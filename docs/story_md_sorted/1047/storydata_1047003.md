## Subtitle: A Selfie to Remember
  
**Jun：**  
Ah, young man. Good evening.  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha.  
We seem to meet a lot lately.  
  
**Jun：**  
I find myself wondering when you might stop by each evening.  
  
**Jun：**  
No, no, I don't find it a bother.  
In fact, I actually feel a little disappointed if I don't see you.  
  
**Jun：**  
Thank you, young man.  
It seems you have become a source of comfort to me. Just standing here  day after day  
on my own is not good for the soul.  
  
**Jun：**  
However, I should warn you for your own sake...  
You had better stay away from the palace. As the seat of  
this land's government, security here is very strict.  
  
**Jun：**  
I know you're a fine young man, but my comrades...  
my fellow knights of Nightmare do not all feel the same way.  
  
**Jun：**  
Your frequent visits to the palace have led some to suspect  
that you are a spy investigating our movements.  
  
**Jun：**  
That even your conversations with me  
are a ruse to learn about the affairs of the palace.  
  
**Jun：**  
Well, I admit it is difficult to conceive of  
another reason why you would care to befriend  
a dreary old gatekeeper like myself.  
  
**Jun：**  
Objectively speaking, their suspicions do seem well-founded.  
  
**Jun：**  
In addition, you told me before that you stop by here  
on the way home from your part-time work, did you not?  
  
**Jun：**  
But when I asked my subordinates to investigate the matter,  
they found that your place of employment  
is a fair distance from the palace.  
  
**Jun：**  
So you have been going out of your way  
to come here and visit me.  
  
**Jun：**  
It is hard to imagine that you had a great desire  
to join me in idle conversation...  
  
**Jun：**  
So it seems far more realistic to assume  
that you have your own reasons for visiting this place.  
  
**Jun：**  
At any rate, that is the opinion currently held  
by many of my guildmates.  
  
**Jun：**  
So I'm afraid, young man,  
you should refrain from visiting me in the future.  
You don't want to become a suspect, do you?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sorry, was I a bother?  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll be lonely without you...  
`Tag 1`  
**Jun：**  
Not at all.  
Personally speaking...  
I found the conversations we shared most enjoyable.  
  
**Jun：**  
I value the time we spent together.  
Believe me in that.  
  
**Jun：**  
I always thought mine would be an empty life,  
standing like a statue outside the palace till the day I die.  
  
**Jun：**  
But I had the good fortune to meet a fine lad like yourself.  
I count myself lucky.  
  
**Jun：**  
But that is why I do not wish to cause you any trouble,  
or burden you with suspicions.  
  
**Jun：**  
I hope you understand, young man.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Jun：**  
I see...  
Yes, it will be lonely.  
However, I fear we have little choice.  
  
**Jun：**  
You and I have different stations in life,  
and I am a grown-up with responsibilities to fulfill.  
  
**Jun：**  
I could not be so selfish as to cause you all kinds of trouble  
simply because I wish for a little company.  
  
**Jun：**  
I hope you understand, young man.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Jun：**  
Haha.  
Well then, you should be on your way.  
  
**Jun：**  
Though it pains me to say goodbye like this,  
I am truly glad to have met you.  
  
**Jun：**  
You were kind enough to speak most cordially  
with someone as intimidating as myself.  
  
**Jun：**  
You showed me kindness and goodwill.  
It is a rare talent nowadays to be able to love others without reservation.  
  
**Jun：**  
And thanks to that nature of yours,  
I am sure you will receive much love in return.  
  
**Jun：**  
I only hope that your next meeting will lead not to a lonely goodbye,  
but a long and enduring friendship.  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha.  
I'm turning this into an oddly serious farewell, aren't I?  
  
**Jun：**  
Even though the two of us are little more than strangers  
who met on the street.  
  
**Jun：**  
I'm very sorry.  
I have little experience with casual conversation,  
so this situation is difficult for me.  
  
**Jun：**  
Well then.  
Goodbye for now, young man.  
  
**Jun：**  
...Hmm?  
What's wrong?  
Do you have something else you wish to say?  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm.  
You do not want to cause me any trouble,  
so you will do as I say...  
  
**Jun：**  
But you would like to take a photograph before you leave?  
  
**Jun：**  
Ah, I see.  
After I told you about cameras before,  
you developed an interest, did you?  
  
**Jun：**  
You got your hands on a cheap one of your own,  
and you have been taking various photos around the city?  
  
**Jun：**  
I see...  
Since I cannot move from this spot,  
you wanted to take pictures of all kinds of places...  
  
**Jun：**  
...So that you could share them with me, is that right?  
That was why you dropped by the palace to see me today...  
  
**Jun：**  
Well, thank you.  
I truly appreciate the sentiment.  
You are a very kind and considerate young man.  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha.  
Really, though, asking for one last photo to remember me by...  
Is that not a little excessive?  
  
**Jun：**  
Ah, but of course, you have no memories...  
This may be the first parting you have ever experienced.  
  
**Jun：**  
Life is filled with farewells.  
You would do well to become accustomed to them.  
  
**Jun：**  
But I suppose, just this once...  
I am not fond of photographs, and from a security perspective,  
I probably should not allow it...  
  
**Jun：**  
But you were kind enough to accede to my wishes,  
so I would hate to deny you this small request.  
  
**Jun：**  
Stand by my side, young man.  
  
**Jun：**  
Could you pass me the camera?  
Yes, this angle should do...  
I think we will both be in the frame.  
  
**Jun：**  
Well then, here goes.  
My expression will not be visible beneath this helmet,  
but you at least should smile.  
  
**Jun：**  
Yes.  
Flash a big smile, and give the \"peace\" sign...! ☆  
  

---  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha...  
You know, it is our duty at Nightmare  
to protect the peace of this city...  
  
**Jun：**  
But I fear the word \"peace\" may only serve to remind me  
of this parting from now on...
