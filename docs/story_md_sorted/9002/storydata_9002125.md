**Karyl：**  
Two giant, azure horns...  
Yeah, it's definitely an Elder Staghorn.  
This one's our current target, right?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes.  
Business in Landosol has stalled due to delays caused by  
this monster attacking caravans.  
Or so I have heard, anyway.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As such, we, the Gourmet Guild,  
have received a request to defeat it from one of Landosol's public agencies, the Guild Association.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Landosol is experiencing a shortage in seasonings, ingredients...  
meat, fish, vegetables, beverages, and other stuff, all because this  
monster keeps attacking caravans!  
 I won't stand for this! No mercy!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Do you have any idea how angry people can get over food?!  
Let's take this monster down!  
Hiyahhh!
