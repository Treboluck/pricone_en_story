**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Phew...  
Think I've taken care of them all for now.  
Let's get moving, quick.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whew, Karyl's going wild!  
Love to see it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You sure you're okay, though?  
You're looking pale as a ghost.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You dumb in the brain or something?  
Of course I'm not okay.  
I'm just barely getting by.  
  
**Karyl：**  
My reserves are gonna dry up soon at this rate,  
so I'll be useless at best and dead at worst.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That's why I'd rather we ignore the small fry  
as much as possible and focus on reaching Koro.  
This place sure feels like a maze, though, so it won't be easy.
