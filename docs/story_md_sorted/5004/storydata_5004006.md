## Subtitle: Operation Gourmet Guild
  
**Karyl：**  
The Gourmet Guild is on the scene!  
Here to kick butt and save our friend!  
Koro! Let us know if you're okay!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait, huh?  
Where... where in the heck are we?  
How did we suddenly go from that cave to being outside?  
  
**Suzume：**  
M-maybe the door had a trap placed on it?  
One that teleported us elsewhere after going through it...  
That said, the cave itself is still right behind us.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Now that's weird. Have two separate spaces been stitched  
together or something...? That shouldn't even be possible!  
Argh! What's the deal here?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Please calm down, Karyl.  
We need to look for Kokkoro, first and foremost.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Y-you're right.  
We can blow this joint the second we save her.  
Figuring out the details can come later.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh! The search spell is reacting to Kokkoro!  
Based on these readings, she's just beyond here...  
Towards the horizon!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wait. She's getting close—  
Uwahhh?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...?!  
Something huge just burst out of the water!  
A monster?! I've never seen one like this before!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Uh-oh. It looks really strong, too...  
Oh! Look at its tentacle thingies!  
Kokkoro's all wrapped in one of them!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh crap, you're right!  
Koro! Are you okay?! Can you hear us?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
U-urgh...  
Did you... all come to save me?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank goodness...  
Getting dragged to the ocean floor was terrifying.  
I was convinced that my life would end in this beast's stomach.  
  
**Karyl：**  
No chance, kiddo!  
The Gourmet Guild does the eating,  
not the other way around!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't worry, we'll get you right ou—  
Whoa?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Watch out!  
Sheesh, it's flailing those tentacles all over the place!  
How crazy is that?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Seems like they pack a punch, too.  
Just look at what they've done to the beach!  
We'll be flat as a pancake if we get hit by them!  
  
**Suzume：**  
E-eeek?!  
Someone, please help!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh no! Suzume!  
She got caught by the tentacles!  
This thing must be a lot smarter than it let on!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Quit praising it and get your butt in gear!  
  
**Karyl：**  
{player},  
slice off the tentacles that're grabbing her!  
It's game over if she gets dragged into the ocea—  
Waugh?!

**Karyl：**  
Oh god, oh god! They're all over me now!  
{player}! Quit staring and do something about this!  
  
![500400602.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/500400602.webp)  
**Karyl：**  
Aaaghhh!  
They're all slimy! Nope, nope, nope!  
I'm done with this! Done!

**Pecorine：**  
Wowzers. This sure escalated quickly...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whoa, uh-oh!  
 Now they're coming after me!  
Help! Someone help! I'm no good with tentacles!  
Is this my punishment for all the seafood I've savored?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm so sorry! Please forgive me for my transgressions!  
But seafood is just too delicious to resist!  
I won't waste a single bit of what I eat, so please spare me!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I can't bear to watch this any longer.  
Not when they're all in danger...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I have to do something...  
My spear still remains firmly in my hands, fortunately.  
Using it may be a struggle like this, however.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I need to find a way to escape these tentacles.  
Then I can save them and slay this monster.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I'm almost certain that they came here to rescue me.  
That's just the sort of people they are.  
I couldn't bear to see them get hurt because of that.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Urgh...  
I need to move. If I can at least strike its weak spot...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Kokkoro, no! Don't do anything rash!  
You'll be putting yourself in danger again  
if you end up angering it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Those tentacles are way more powerful than they seem, too.  
I don't even want to imagine this,  
but they're strong enough to rip you apart limb from limb.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wh-what should I do?  
Is there even anything I *can* do...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I hate this...!  
Why am I so useless without my Royal Equipment?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Grrr...! This thing's really ticking me off now.  
Get your damn tentacles off me already, you freaky squid!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Whoa!  
Don't start unloading magic on it! It's too dangerous!  
  
**Suzume：**  
This is essentially a hostage situation!  
One wrong step and you might hit Kokkoro!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Urgh. You're right.  
Sorry, I kind of lost my temper.  
Koro! You okay?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Y-yes, I'm fine!  
Don't worry about me!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*cough, cough*  
Oh no. Those spells fried the monster up a little.  
Now there's a positively delicious smell in the air.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hm...  
If only Miss Pecorine had access to her Royal Equipment...  
No doubt she would devour it swiftly if she was in top condition.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh... Kokkoro! Look to your right!  
Karyl's attack made the monster's skin start peeling,  
but look at what's sparkling underneath!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's my tiara!  
One part of the Royal Equipment!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Huh? Oh! You're right!  
It's as dazzling as always, too.  
But why is it here, of all places?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I dunno myself,  
but try and toss it over to me if you can!  
I'll be able to join the fray if I have that on!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
O-okay!  
Regaining even a sliver of your regular strength  
should render this monster powerless, correct?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Very well! I trust in you!  
And I'm almost certain I can reach it...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eeek?!  
I-it started tightening its grip...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Kokkoro?!  
Oh no, oh no! It's gonna crush her!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hm...?  
Have you got something in mind, {player}?  
M-maybe a way to get us out of this sticky situation?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Do as I say!  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
O-okay, got it!  
Wow, though! You're more assertive than usual today!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Then again.  
Something tells me he's always been like this.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Always doing his best for everyone else's sake.  
Coming up with plans, making sure we all fight efficiently.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm not sure *why* I feel that way, though.  
But that doesn't matter.  
Not when he's this full of vigor!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And he's as cool as ever!  
If there's anyone I can entrust my life to, it's him.  
So I will. It's all up to him!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Karyl!  
`Tag 2`  
**Karyl：**  
Hm? What is it, knight boy?  
Got some super plan to get us through this?  
Spit it out if so!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Use your magic to send Peco flying!  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
What?!  
That's *not* what I expected you to say, {player}!  
I'll be fine, right? I can trust you, can't I?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Magic?  
Ohh, you mean the spell I used to get us to the ruins?  
  
**Karyl：**  
So basically, you want me to envelop her in an air bubble,  
then shoot her off at high speed?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, she's the only that hasn't been tentacle'd,  
so it makes sense to go with her.  
 But just to be sure here...  
You want me to send her right at that thing, correct?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm...  
Well, whatever.  
Though I'm almost all out of magical energy at this point.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'll give you every last drop, so you better be grateful!  
Get ready, Pecorine! The rest is up to you!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
O-okay!  
What should I do after this, though?  
You know I'm powerless without my Royal Equipment.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Not if you have your tiara, right?  
`Tag 4`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohh! Now I get where you're going with this!  
You see where the tiara's poking out, Karyl?  
Take aim and send me flying over there!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Cool. Just make sure you don't bite your tongue!  
Off. You. GO!

**Pecorine：**  
W-whoooaaa?!  
Oh wow, oh wow! I really am flying!  
It's absolutely terrifying! But also thrilling!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Urgh... This spell's normally meant to be used underwater,  
so the spellcasting process is entirely different now.  
That's making it hard to maintain the trajectory...  
  
**Karyl：**  
But I'm not just any old mage.  
I'm the one and only Karyl! I can do this!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eeek?!  
Help, help! I'm going all over the place!  
Be a bit more gentle, Karyl!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You better believe I'm being gentle, girl!  
More importantly, be careful!  
There's no way that thing won't retaliate against you!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Suzume! Keep its attacks at bay!  
`Tag 5`  
**Suzume：**  
O-okay!  
Is that all you need me to do?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Please stay still for me, Pecorine!  
I'll keep you safe from the incoming tentacles!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Haaah!  
Come on, me! This is the one time you can't mess up...!  
  
![500400604.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/500400604.webp)  
**Pecorine：**  
Aaahhh!  
There's magic going off all around me!  
How did I get myself into a crazy situation like this?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Shut it, dingus!  
Quit moaning and do your part!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, crap!  
It's started going wild! The tiara's gonna fall!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No way! Wh-what should I do?  
Can I stretch out and reach it before then...?  
Nope! I'm just a bit too far away!

**Choice: (6)**  Kokkoro!  
`Tag 6`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Fear not, my lord.  
Your intentions are clear as day to me,  
so waste not your words.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*huff* *puff*  
Focus, Kokkoro. Carry out my lord's will with utmost precision.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Touchdown!  
Aaand chow time! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*munch, munch*  
Wooo! Roasted to perfection!  
How crazy is that?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll gobble up the tentacles that are restraining Kokkoro first!  
She'll probably be sent flying,  
so cast a spell to make sure she lands safely!  
  
**Suzume：**  
R-roger!  
There's a lasso spell I use for organizing luggage and the like.  
Hyah! I'll use that to reel Kokkoro in!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Whoa! Thank you!  
Can I entrust the monster to you, Pecorine?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You betcha!  
This main course has been a long time coming!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll gobble part of it up, restore my energy, then finish it off!  
Or, actually... I can probably just eat the entire thing!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ehehe. ♪ I'm glad it's so big.  
This'll be a bottomless feast!  
Seafood is the best! Get in my belly!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*munch, munch*  
Mmm! It's so good! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh, now this is what it's all about. A good meal after  
overcoming adversity. That's the Gourmet Guild life!  
Or, well... The perpetually peckish Pecorine life. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahaha... I almost feel bad for that thing.  
Imagine getting eaten alive...  
Survival of the fittest and all that, I guess.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I feel for it too, but you put it best.  
Miss Pecorine! Please leave some for us, too!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
With the monster defeated, we can fill our stomachs.  
And once we're out of this place, we can resume our exciting holiday. ♪
