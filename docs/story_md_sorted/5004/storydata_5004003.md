**Karyl：**  
*huff, huff*  
  
**Karyl：**  
Come on, Pecorine!  
You know I can barely lift a feather!  
Carrying you is way beyond my physical capacity!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I swear, you better thank me for this.  
'Cause you can bet I wouldn't bother if it wasn't urgent!  
Look, we're back at the scene of the crime!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Nnnghhh...  
Please don't shout. My head hurts enough as it is.  
  
**Karyl：**  
What's up with you, anyway?  
You're usually a big ball of energy,  
but today you just look like death.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmph. I bet you just had so much fun yesterday  
that it's finally taken its toll on you today. I get it.  
My whole body's been aching since I woke up!  
  
**Karyl：**  
In other words,  
I absolutely do not want to be carrying you around!  
So get down already. You've got those legs for a reason!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hehe. Don't worry. I know you've been trying so hard  
to carry me nice and gently. Always complaining,  
but always kind. That's why I love you.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Down we go...  
Urgh. I'm feeling kinda dizzy...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Y-you sure you're okay?  
Want me to heal you up a bit?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No, it's fine. You said the two of them disappeared, right?  
Chances are something fishy is going on,  
so I'd rather let you conserve your magical power.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Fair enough.  
And you'll probably recover after  
chowing down on some food, anyway.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Shoot. The beachside cafe still isn't open?  
So much for grabbing something quick.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hm... Sorry, Karyl.  
I don't think food will be enough  
to get me back in proper form today.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
As much as it pains me to admit this,  
something important was missing when I woke up today.  
My Royal Equipment.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I tried looking all over for it, but to no avail.  
Which means I can't convert calories into energy  
nearly as well as I could beforehand.  
  
**Karyl：**  
WHAT?! You lost your Royal Equipment?!  
How did you even... Argh! Really now!  
That's your main lifeline! You gotta keep it safe!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Sorry. The thing is, though...  
I normally hug it nice and tight while I'm asleep.  
Just in case anyone takes that as an opportunity to attack.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But when I woke up this morning, poof. It was gone.  
  
**Karyl：**  
\"Poof\"?  
You sure are making light of this.  
Ahh, man. This isn't good.  
That equipment is the whole reason you're so strong.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That swimsuit sure isn't gonna power you up.  
Which makes you useless! Trash!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
My heart, it aches...  
And yet you speak the truth. Sob.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't go crying on me now.  
We really are in a bind here, though. My magic reserves are  
all dried up, and your equipment's gone missing.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Actually, this is more than a bind. We're screwed!  
Argh! How are we gonna find  
Koro and {player} like this?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Excuse me! You two, over there!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Whoa?!  
Almost scared the tail off me.  
You're, uhhh...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh! Suzume, from the Sarendia Orphanage!  
You're working at the nearby cafe, if I re—  
Hey, wait a minute.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
{player}!  
I heard that you'd disappeared!  
What are you doing here with Suzume?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ummm...  
I found him collapsed by the shore. He explained the  
circumstances there while I tended to him.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Based on what he had to say,  
both he and Kokkoro were pulled into  
the ocean by a massive monster.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Apparently, large tentacles stretched out  
from the waves and dragged them in.  
The sheer surprise left them unable to resist.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh...  
That would explain how you guys  
just disappeared out of nowhere...  
  
**Karyl：**  
A massive monster, though? You gotta be kidding!  
So much for the Marjan Coast being relatively safe.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But wait.  
How come you're okay, {player}?  
And why isn't Kokkoro with you?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Um. According to him,  
Kokkoro sliced the tentacles up  
as they were being pulled down into the ocean.  
  
**Suzume：**  
What's more,  
she prioritized him over herself.  
  
**Suzume：**  
{player} had already run out of breath  
by the time he was set free, though.  
Everything after that is a blur...  
  
**Karyl：**  
What gives... You're so stupid, Koro!  
He might be dear to you, but that's no reason  
to prioritize his safety over your own!  
  
**Karyl：**  
How long ago was this, by the way? There's no  
way she can breathe underwater.  
We gotta go  
save her quick—otherwise she'll drown!
