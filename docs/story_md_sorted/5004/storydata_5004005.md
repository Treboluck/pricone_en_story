# The Sunken Ruins
The crew make their way to the ruins courtesy of Karyl's magic, only to encounter an enormous door upon arriving. The blockade is soon overcome thanks to {player}'s quick thinking, allowing them to make their way towards Kokkoro.
  
## Subtitle: The Sunken Ruins
  
**Narration：**  
With their plan laid out,  
the crew arrive at the sunken ruins  
thanks to Karyl's magic.  
  
**Narration：**  
They're met with a swarm of monsters almost immediately,  
however, hampering their progress significantly.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're in charge of getting us to where we need to go, Suzume.  
I'll focus on wiping out any monsters along the way.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Okay. Leave it to me!  
I'll use magic to get a grasp of the layout here,  
as well as Kokkoro's whereabouts.  
  
**Suzume：**  
This place is basically a labyrinth, but our path should be straightforward  
so long as I have a clear picture of where to go.  
Then I can take us on the quickest route to her.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Don't worry about traps, either.  
The search magic will pick up their location, too.  
  
**Suzume：**  
There's little I can do about monsters, though.  
I'll have my hands full with this spell,  
so it's up to you all to deal with them.  
  
**Karyl：**  
By which you mean, it's up to me.  
Urgh... Normally it'd be fine to just let Pecorine run into  
the swarm and go wild, but that won't work right now.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
S-sorry.  
I'm just dead weight this time, aren't I?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Right you are, girl.  
Most useful thing you can do right now is  
stay close to us and not let yourself get hurt.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Awww... She's even more brutal than usual today.  
But I guess she just has a lot on her plate right now.  
I'll just hang back and make sure not to get in her way.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This is normally {player}'s position  
whenever we're in battle, isn't it?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
He's always been standing back,  
watching us anxiously as we fight...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Right now I feel so powerless. So isolated.  
You've been dealing with that all this time, haven't you?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Is something wrong?  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh. Sorry for staring.  
I just... finally understood what it's like  
to be in your shoes. That got me a bit down.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Not being able to help the people dear to you  
when they're in danger feels awful, doesn't it?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It does, yeah.  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
I figured as much.  
Hee hee... I feel closer to you today  
than I ever have, {player}.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey!  
Quit the flirting and get your butts over here!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wowzers. What's got you so flustered, Karyl?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Take a look.  
You see that massive door up ahead?  
There's an even bigger cave beyond it. That's where Koro is, apparently.  
  
**Suzume：**  
She is, yes.  
I'm picking up life signals ahead.  
She's still alive and well.  
If only we could get to her right this instant...  
  
**Karyl：**  
That'd be ideal.  
But this door's going to be a problem.  
It seems like it can be unlocked through magic,  
but I have no idea what sort of process is needed.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I've tried analyzing as much as I can,  
but I can't quite decrypt the magic circuits behind it...  
There seems to be some sort of protection to prevent that.  
  
**Karyl：**  
What's our plan of action, then?  
Koro might be alive,  
but we have no idea what's going on beyond here.  
  
**Karyl：**  
There really is no time to waste.  
We need to get past this thing and save her, ASAP.  
  
**Karyl：**  
If anything, we might be able to brute force it if  
{player} powers me up and I unleash  
my strongest destruction spell.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But that's only assuming we don't have any other options.  
Do you guys have a hunch on how we should approach this?  
I'd rather not be too careless here.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
H-hm...  
Any ideas, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Let's brute force it.  
**Choice: (4)**  Let's think of another way.  
`Tag 3`  
**Karyl：**  
...Got it. Brute forcing it is.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Power me up as much as possible, {player}.  
I worked my butt off to learn this spell, so keep  
your eyes peeled! It's gonna be a real spectacle!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Focus everything on her, {player}!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Pecorine seems far too weak to do anything right now,  
while I'm simply no good with offensive magic...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Anything you spend on us will just go to waste, I'm afraid.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Meanwhile, Karyl can use every ounce of her energy  
to blast a hole through the door with that spell.  
Simple, but also our most powerful course of action.  
  
**Karyl：**  
A solid plan if I've ever heard one!  
I'm gonna be reeling afterwards,  
but now isn't the time to be complaining!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Gimme all you've got, {player}!  
I'll blast this thing to pieces!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Now THAT's what I'm talking about!  
I can feel his power swelling through me.  
Every cell in my body's going wild! I can do this...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahaha! ☆  
You think you've got what it takes to stand in my way?  
Hell no you don't!  
Eat THIS!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yesss! Blew a hole clean through it!  
Rush in, troops!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Karyl：**  
Hm... Fair enough. Brute forcing it might work,  
but there's no point if I end up depleting my magic reserves here.  
Ideally we'd find a way that involves as little work as possible.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Is that even possible with a door this big...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hey. Take a look at that pond over there.  
There's a lever or something at the bottom, isn't there?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh...  
How'd you even notice something that far away?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ehehe. My eyesight's as good as a hawk's!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That aside.  
Both this door and that lever have  
similar jewels embedded in them.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If they're connected in some shape or form,  
then pulling the lever could make the door open.  
Maybe?  
  
**Karyl：**  
That seems pretty likely, yeah.  
There's plenty of other ruins with those kinds of weird gimmicks.  
Dunno why, though. Seems like it'd just make life a pain.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I doubt people lived their lives in these sorts of ruins.  
I'd guess they were more like graves,  
or somewhere to store valuable treasure and the like.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
More importantly, though.  
Do you mind if I handle the lever?  
I wanna make up for being useless this whole time!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm... Well, it *is* underwater,  
and I'm no good at swimming.  
So yeah, go for it.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Just be careful, though.  
There could be monsters lurking in there.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Got it!  
Off I go!  
One, two, three! Dive! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Nice!  
The water's even clearer than I expected.  
Now then, where's that lever... Over here?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yup! There it is!  
Now I just need to pull it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hnnnggghhh!  
Urgh... It's so heavy...  
I really am a weakling without my Royal Equipment.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But I can't falter here! Not when Kokkoro's in danger!  
Times like this are when I need to shine! And if it's for my  
precious Gourmet Guild, then I'll do everything it takes!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Come on, me!  
Pull that lever like your life depends on it!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh?  
Yesss, she did it!  
That lever really was the key!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Awesome stuff, Pecorine!  
Now get yourself out of there! It's time to storm in!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Suzume：**  
Okay!  
We need to hurry, too!  
Her life signals are getting weaker and weaker!
