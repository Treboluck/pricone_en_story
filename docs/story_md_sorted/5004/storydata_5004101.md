The Gourmet Guild members try their luck in a lottery held in town, and end up winning tickets for a luxurious tropical islands tour. Their extravagant holiday doesn't quite go how they would have hoped, however...
  
**Karin：**  
Oh, if it isn't the Gourmet Guild!  
We're currently holding a lottery here with all sorts of  
great prizes. How about giving it a shot?  
  
**Karyl：**  
A lotto?  
I dunno. I've never won anything good from these.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hey hey, Karyl!  
I really, *really* want that premium fruit bundle in tier three!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You don't just aim for a specific tier in lottos, you know...  
It is free, though, so I don't see why not.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Good luck, Miss Karyl.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Sure. Spin, spin.  
  
**Karin：**  
Aw, tough luck!  
White's no good, I'm afraid.  
You can have this piece of candy as a consolation prize, though. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, nice! Food!  
Looks like you hit the jackpot, Karyl. ♪  
Lemme try too! Spin, spin. ♪  
  
**Karin：**  
W-wow! It's gold!  
Congratulations! You hit the jackpot!  
  
**Karin：**  
Which means... Ta-da! An invitation to our  
Tantalizing Tropical Tour! Four days and three nights at a  
luxurious resort! Even better, it's good for up to four people!  
  
**Karyl：**  
A tropical tour?!  
Heck yes! First prize, baby!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Impressive as always, Miss Pecorine. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aww... But I wanted the fruit bundle...  
  
**Karyl：**  
You can't be serious! Who picks fruits over a luxurious tour?!  
Oh. You are gonna invite us, right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Of course I am!  
Ehehe. The Gourmet Guild always rides together! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
The calm, blue sea! A gleaming white beach!  
Plus the radiant sunshine!  
We've got an incredible summer waiting for us!
