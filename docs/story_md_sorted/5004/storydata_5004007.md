# Monster on the Barbie
Karin turns up as the crew is enjoying a monster-based barbeque. She reveals that the association couldn't simply let the Gourmet Guild continue using their funds for eating, and thus arranged to have them work by taking down the monster.

**Narration：**  
Their rescue mission a success, the crew make their escape from the sunken ruins. Realizing it's lunchtime upon getting back to the beach, they decide there's no better time for a barbecue.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Chow time! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't worry, there's plenty for everyone.  
So dig in!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Even better, it's all free!  
Friends, passerby, everyone! You're all welcome!  
  
**Manager：**  
Just remember that drinks aren't part of the set, though!  
Phew, talk about booming business. Today's gonna be a busy day!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Who's this old sack of bones?  
He just popped outta nowhere acting like he runs the joint.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ahaha.  
He owns the beachside cafe I'm working at.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ohh. I do recall that you were working there.  
Your hard work is always appreciated.  
  
**Suzume：**  
No need for thanks.  
I'm sure you're all exhausted from today's adventure,  
so please take this time to sit back and enjoy yourselves.  
  
**Suzume：**  
And don't forget to fill your bellies, too!  
I'm hardly the best cook, but throwing food on a stick  
and grilling it on the barbecue shouldn't be too difficult. ♪  
  
**Suzume：**  
O-oops!  
Aaaaaaghhh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whoa! Please be careful!  
There's nothing funny about falling face first onto  
roasting hot metal! We'd have a real disaster on our hands!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ehehe...  
Sorry. Looks like I'm a bit more exhausted than I thought I was.  
I guess I should stay put, just in case.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Today was definitely a rough day,  
but everything turned out okay in the end.  
I'd hate to get myself hurt and ruin the mood.  
  
**Manager：**  
Yeah, you get yourself some rest.  
Looks like your family's here, too.  
How does spending some time with them sound?  
  
**Suzume：**  
My family...?  
Oh! Milady! Girls!

**Ayane：**  
Suzume!  
Come on, let's have some fun! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Look, Suzume!  
I found a really pretty seashell! ♪  
  
**Saren：**  
Ahaha.  
The water's nice and shallow here, fortunately.  
Just don't get yourselves hurt, okay?  
  
**Saren：**  
Suzume! Come join us when you're less busy, okay?  
It'd be a waste not to enjoy the beach  
when you've got such a cute swimsuit on! ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yeah! This is a day out for the Sarendia Orphanage!  
Or even better yet... A day out for family!  
Come on, Pukichi! Let's swim!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Hey, gimme a break.  
Water'll make me all moldy...  
Mind casting some waterproofing magic on me, Suzume?\"  
  
**Kurumi：**  
*splash, splash*  
Ehehe. There's so much pretty stuff in the water. ♪  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wow, that sure looks like fun! ♪  
I take it you brought them here?  
  
**Saren：**  
It was a nice way to let them see you at work, so yeah.  
And hey, it's summer. They were itching for a nice dip in the water.  
  
**Saren：**  
But well...  
It's just not the same without you around.  
So come join us. It'll be even more fun that way. ♪  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ahaha. It's rare to see you act your age, milady.  
I'm technically still working, though...  
Are you sure you're okay with this?  
  
![500400702.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/500400702.webp)  
**Manager：**  
No problem at all.  
I'll handle things here, so go have a blast.  
  
**Manager：**  
People have started coming back now that  
the monster hiding in those sunken ruins is gone, after all.  
  
**Manager：**  
The red nightmare isn't gonna become reality at this rate.  
Which means me and my family can live to see another day.  
  
**Manager：**  
And it's all down to you lot. I can't thank you enough.  
You're real saviors. Not just for me,  
but for the Marjan Coast in general.

**Pecorine：**  
You're very welcome.  
Ehehe. We sure went through a lot,  
but at least it all turned out a-okay. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Bringing that monster back to cook it up was genius  
in the first place, but who'd have expected the rest of  
my royal equipment to be hiding in its belly?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What a relief, though.  
I don't know what I would've done if it  
just disappeared into the ocean.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait a minute. Are you... are you implying this is monster meat?  
The stuff I've been gobbling down this whole time?  
It belongs to that freaky, tentacled monster?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You betcha! Not just that one,  
but the other monsters we defeated in the ruins too.  
You know me. I hate to let good food go to waste. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Say no to meaningless slaughter!  
Anything we defeat also gets eaten.  
That's the Gourmet Guild way... ☆  
  
![500400704.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/500400704.webp)  
**Karyl：**  
*PTHEH*! Why the heck didn't you say so beforehand?!  
Oh my god. I actually swallowed it too!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
No need to bring it back up, Miss Karyl.  
It's certifiably delectable.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It's perfectly safe to eat, too.  
Not only did we cook it well,  
we even used magic to check for poison and the like.

**Kokkoro：**  
Here you are, my lord. Open wide. ♪  
Oh. It's still rather hot, so I should blow on it beforehand.  
*blow, blow* All right, here it comes. ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Mmm. Delish.  
`Tag 1`  
**Karyl：**  
Argh! How did I fall for this *again*?! How many times  
do I have to tell you that eating monsters makes me wanna throw up?!  
Speaking of! I think I'm gonna do that right now!  
  
**Karin：**  
Hehe. You might want to eat as much as you can.  
Advanced monsters like that have an abundance of energy  
stored in them, so it should help recover your magic reserves.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wha—?!  
Where the heck'd you pop out from, Karin?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're in on all this, aren't you?!  
Something was fishy about this vacation from the start.  
Especially with so few people around during this season!  
  
**Karyl：**  
And then we heard about how the beach was closed thanks to  
some monster! But you had the nerve to send us here?!  
You realize just what sort of hell we went through thanks to you?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah. You set this all up, didn't you?  
You knew about the issues here, so you sent us in to sort it all out!  
I know it! This isn't even the first time it's happened...!  
  
**Karin：**  
Heehee.  
Feel free to think what you like. ♪  
  
**Karin：**  
But, well... Think about it this way. The Guild Association can't just  
let a guild use all its funds to go about enjoying food without  
doing anything else of note for the country.  
  
**Karin：**  
So we figured it would only be fair to have you do some proper  
work for once.  
 That said, the situation ended up far more dangerous  
than we expected. We apologize for that.  
  
**Karin：**  
As a reward for your hard work here, though,  
we'll allow things to continue as normal.  
You'll remain a officially funded guild.  
  
**Karin：**  
We even have a special bonus for you, too.  
Tickets for the actual Tantalizing Tropical Tour,  
hosted at an actual luxury resort.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, I knew it!  
The Marjan Coast was never meant to be the actual  
resort venue!  
It's way too close to Landosol for that!  
  
**Karin：**  
Heehee.  
Oh, also. This is for you, Pecorine.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? What's this?  
It's super similar to my hair accessory.  
  
**Karin：**  
It is of a similar make, yes.  
But it also has a special blessing placed on it.  
Wearing it should boost your overall abilities.  
  
**Karin：**  
That should let you fight, even in your swimsuit.  
What was it called again... Your Royal Equipment?  
I heard you had a hard time thanks to it going missing.  
  
**Karin：**  
We wouldn't want that happening again, would we?  
That's why we went to the effort of making this.  
Think of it as a reward for all your hard work.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wow! Now that's a real lifesaver!  
I really was nothing but dead weight this time around.  
  
  
**Karin：**  
Hehe. It must have been tough.  
That monster in particular liked to use its subordinates to gather up  
precious metals and people to store inside its body.  
  
**Karin：**  
That's why it aimed for both the Royal Equipment  
and Kokkoro. It even attacked boats that were passing by,  
which took a real toll on the fishing business.  
  
**Karin：**  
A nightmare if there ever was one, really.  
Enough to drive home the reality that people  
and monsters simply cannot coexist.  
  
**Karin：**  
These sorts of monster-related incidents are on the rise, too.  
We could be close to having another  
widespread disaster on our hands here.  
  
**Karin：**  
We may have no choice but to rely on you all again if it comes  
to that.  
So please prepare for such a possibility, at the very least.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hold up. \"Again\"?  
Karin! You're gonna get us  
wrapped up in something like this again?!  
  
**Karin：**  
Heehee. That depends on you all, my friends.  
You're always making an effort to learn,  
so we won't do anything to push you too hard.  
  
**Karin：**  
Now then.  
I have my day-to-day work to attend to,  
so I'll be taking my leave here. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, wait a minute! Don't try and flee the crime scene!  
Dammit! I'm gonna make that four-eyes' life hell next time!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Now, now. She probably doesn't have much choice  
considering she works for the association.  
And hey. We all turned out fine in the end!  
  
**Karyl：**  
The ends don't justify the means!  
Man, this sucks. Time to eat the frustration away!  
Hey, manager! Get me some non-monster fish! Pronto!  
  
**Manager：**  
G-got it!  
It'll be ready in a jiffy!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
The ends do justify the means here, I believe.  
Especially with such delicious food before us.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Allow me to thank you all again for rescuing me.  
I truly appreciate it.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Being able to share another delicious meal with you all  
is arguably one of life's greatest blessings for me.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And we're happy that you're here with us.  
I'm so glad we were able to get you back.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Don't try and pull something like that again, though.  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
What he said!  
We heard all about how you prioritized saving  
{player} and let yourself get taken away.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Which is nice and all, but there's no way  
{player} would feel happy about that.  
You really need to give more thought to yourself.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Every single one of us here couldn't bear to see  
something happen to you. You're just that important to us.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I apologize for causing you all concern.  
But also, thank you for that.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oops. Didn't mean to sound like I was scolding you.  
Everything turned out fine and dandy,  
so let's forget about it and party away!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We're at the beach on a beautiful summer's day!  
It'd be a waste to spend it being all depressed now, wouldn't it? ♪
