## Subtitle: Always by Your Side
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The ocean breeze feels so pleasant...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Spending the summer days like this with you  
brings me insurmountable joy, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I can only hope that we're able to see this  
same scenery once again. Not just next year, but in the years that follow as well.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
To that extent, my lord... I look forward to being always by your side. ♪
