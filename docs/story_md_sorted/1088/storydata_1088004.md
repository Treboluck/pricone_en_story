## Subtitle: Always Kind, Always Caring
  
**Narration：**  
Exhausted from the events at the temple,  
Yui and {player} make their way back to the guildhouse.  
  
**Yui：**  
We're back.  
  
**Yui：**  
I'm so exhausted.  
Waving through that sea of people didn't help, either.  
  
**Yui：**  
H-huh? What's with that weird light?  
  
**Yui：**  
Wait. I'm getting deja vu.  
  
**Yui：**  
Yeah, that's right.  
Whenever this light appears, I just... feel so sleepy...

**Yui：**  
{player}? Hello!  
And happy new year,  
while I'm at it.  
  
**Yui：**  
I take it you're out shopping as well?  
  
**Yui：**  
What's wrong? Do I have something on my face?  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh. Is it the kimono?  
  
**Yui：**  
You might have noticed, but it's the same design  
as the one I have in Astrum. There's a feature that lets you  
scan in kimonos from outside the game, so I used that.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It really suits you.  
**Choice: (2)**  You look beautiful.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
Th-thanks!  
  
**Yui：**  
Ahaha. Now you've got me all flustered...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
Wha—?!  
Th-thanks...  
  
**Yui：**  
I honestly didn't expect that.  
You really caught me off guard!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Yui：**  
Hehe.  
I can't imagine this being a bad year if it's  
already off to this good of a start.  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh. Sorry, looks like my brothers need something.  
  
![108800402.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/108800402.webp)  
**Yui：**  
What's wrong?  
  
**Yui：**  
You [[lost]] it?!  
  
**Yui：**  
Wh-what now? Errr, uhhh!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Did something happen?  
`Tag 4`  
**Yui：**  
They lost the bag that had their new year's pocket money in it...  
  
**Yui：**  
Where are you right now?  
Okay.  
I'll be there right away.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Here. This should help.  
`Tag 5`  
**Yui：**  
What's this...?  
  
**Yui：**  
No way! This is your own pocket money, isn't it?!  
I can't accept that! Please take it back!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I'd hate to leave them feeling terrible.  
`Tag 6`  
**Yui：**  
And I appreciate that!  
But this is yours! I can't just take it!  
  
**Yui：**  
...But you won't listen, will you?  
You're beyond stubborn once you've decided to help someone.

**Yui：**  
*sigh*  
Thanks! I swear I'll make it up to you!  
  
**Yui：**  
I need to go meet up with them, so I'll see you later!  
And again, thank you so much!

**Narration：**  
With Yui gone, {player} makes  
his way to his local anime store to partake in the new year's sales.  
  
**Narration：**  
Once there, he notices a small paper bag.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Deliver it to the store clerk.  
`Tag 7`  
**Staff：**  
Must be someone's pocket money.  
Thankfully there's a name on it.  
Let's see... Kusano...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Phone Yui.  
`Tag 8`  
**Yui：**  
Hello? What's wrong?  
Don't worry, they've settled down now.  
We're about to go to the police station...  
  
**Choice: (9)**  There's an anime store you should be going to instead.  
`Tag 9`  
**Yui：**  
An anime store?  
Whoa! What's gotten into you all?!Calm down!  
Sorry, they went crazy the second I mentioned the store!  
  
**Yui：**  
Okay, okay! I get it! Quiet down!  
Sorry, I'll phone you back later! Bye!  
  
**Staff：**  
I take it you know who this belongs to?  
Oh! Please wait!  
  
**Narration：**  
A few days later, {player} meets Yui again  
at the beginning of the new semester.  
  
**Yui：**  
Good morning, {player}!  
Thanks so much for the other day!  
  
**Yui：**  
Guess what?  
We ended up finding my brothers' pocket money!  
  
**Yui：**  
So, here. You can have yours back.  
  
**Yui：**  
Plus, uh... Um. This as well!  
I figured I should pay you back, so I knit a scarf.  
I'm not sure if you actually need one, but please use it if you do.  
  
**Yui：**  
That's not all, though.  
  
**Yui：**  
H-here! Take this coupon, too!  
It's for my family's restaurant!  
  
**Yui：**  
Don't force yourself to come though, okay?  
Leave it until you really, [[really]] feel like eating out!  
  
**Yui：**  
Sheesh... I really can't believe Mom and Dad!  
Just because he helped me out doesn't mean  
they need to start calling him my boyfriend!  
  
**Yui：**  
Even worse, they want me to bring him along!  
No way, no way!  
  
**Yui：**  
I might actually die of embarrassment if they  
started asking him all sorts of weird questions...  
  
**Yui：**  
They forced that coupon on me though, so I didn't have a choice...  
But it'll be really awkward if he actually comes!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Something wrong?  
`Tag 10`  
**Yui：**  
N-nothing! Nothing at all!  
See you later!  
  
**Yui：**  
\"See you later?\" We sit right beside each other, you big dumbo!  
Literally all I did after that was sit down!  
  
**Yui：**  
He's gonna think I'm a weirdo, isn't he?  
Argh! This is so embarrassing!  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
And... welcome back.  
I whipped up that little dream based on your old memories.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That expression on her face when you called  
out to her sure was something, huh?  
Like she'd just had a fateful encounter with someone precious.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That'd make you the knight in shining armor, I guess?  
I wouldn't be surprised if you turned up on  
a brilliant white steed someday, if I'm being honest.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Yui needs you over there as much as she does over here.  
So take good care of her, you hear?  
  
**Ameth：**  
That said. Let's try and be a little bit selfless, okay?  
Though that's probably a tall order for you, huh?  
  
**Ameth：**  
You're just that sort of person, alas.  
  

---  
  
**Yui：**  
Mmm... Where am I...?  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh, right. I fell asleep the second I got back.  
I take it you did the same?  
  
**Yui：**  
Hey. I had this really vivid dream there.  
And well. You were in it.  
  
**Yui：**  
Everything about you was the same.  
Kind and reliable. Just like in real life.  
  
**Yui：**  
It made me realize that you'll probably never change,  
no matter the circumstances. And you know what?  
That realization made me really happy.  
  
**Yui：**  
That said.  
I must have been exhausted if I fell asleep that quickly.  
  
**Yui：**  
Do you mind if I tag along with you after this?  
You did the same for me, so it only feels right.  
  
**Choice: (11)**  I've got some pocket money to give out.  
`Tag 11`  
**Yui：**  
For Kokkoro, right?  
Well.  
We might as well bring some mochi  
for Pecorine and Karyl, while we're at it.  
  
**Yui：**  
How much should I bring? This much seems like it'd be fine...  
Huh? What's wrong?  
You don't think it'll be nearly enough?  
Really?  
  
**Narration：**  
With their preparations all done,  
{player} and Yui set out  
to deliver goodies to the rest of the Gourmet Guild.
