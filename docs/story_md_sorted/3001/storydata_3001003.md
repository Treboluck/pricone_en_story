# The Gourmet Guild Episode 3
With their gatherings growing more and more common, Pecorine, Kokkoro and Karyl agree to start picking restaurants on a rotation. Unbeknownst to the other two, though, Pecorine had included both of them in the newly formed Gourmet Guild. And thus their food adventures began for real.
  
## Subtitle: Welcome to the Gourmet Guild!
  
**Karyl：**  
...♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm?  
Hey, if it isn't {player}!  
What're you doing around here?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I could ask the same question, Miss Karyl.  
It's rare to see you here, if I'm being honest.  
Not that I'm complaining.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, hey there, squirt.  
Kind of funny how you two're always together, isn't it? ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Alas, that's not quite the case. Ideally we would be,  
of course,  
but my lord is quite the free spirit.  
He gets lost on some adventure more often than not.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What's more, there's plenty of business I must attend to on my own.  
We do keep in touch with one another,  
of course.  
Mainly so I can rush to his side should anything happen.  
  
**Karyl：**  
A bit overprotective, aren't we? You feel more  
like {player}'s guardian than anything else at this point.  
Which is funny, considering it looks like it'd be the exact opposite.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Aww, you're such a hard little worker. There, there. ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
C-can you please not pat my head...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Also, I've been meaning to say this for a while now,  
but I would appreciate it if you didn't refer to me as 'squirt.'  
I'm not that small, I believe.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You believe wrong, my tiny little friend.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But well, sure. Your name's Kokkoro, so...  
How does Koro sound? Pretty cute, if you ask me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Err, the possibility of just using my name existed...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I'm fine with that, though,  
so by all means feel free.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Cool.  
Back on topic though, what're you doing here?  
On a cheeky little date?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Not at all. Both of us are still new to Landosol,  
as you know, so we figured it would be wise to get accustomed to the  
area.  
 What better way to do that than a casual, relaxing stroll?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
How about yourself, Miss Karyl?  
You seem to be making the most of the food stalls, at the very least.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You bet I am.  
In fact, I think I bought way too much.  
How about taking some off my hands? If you don't mind, of course.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm...  
Apologies, but I'm quite the light eater.  
As much as I'd like to, I should save space for supper.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Moreso now that we eat together so frequently now.  
Not eating with everyone would be quite the waste of our quality time,  
if I'm being honest.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, on the other hand, would have no trouble helping you.  
So please, do eat away. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, so much for the mother and her child theory.  
If anything, the two of you feel more like a pet and its owner.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Buncha weirdos. In a good way, of course. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Anyway, that's a fair point.  
I dunno how it happened,  
but we have been getting together often these days.  
  
**Karyl：**  
In fact,  
I'm struggling to remember the last time  
me, you and Tiana DIDN'T have dinner together.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Tiana?  
Would that, perchance,  
  
be Pecorine you're referring to?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Uh...  
Right, yeah. Pecorine.  
That's the name she's going by.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Anyway!  
It's usually her that decides where we go,  
isn't it?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed. She's most familiar with the restaurants here,  
so it only makes sense for her to decide.  
 If anything,  
it would be more accurate to say she's introducing us to new places.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Fair enough, sure. You won't hear me judging the  
quality of the places she picks, either. Thing is, though.  
I could do without the...odder choices she has among them.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I mean really,  
getting fed bugs is the last thing I expected in my life.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If I may, they're quite delicious.  
As for that specific restaurant we went to, I have nothing but good things to say about it.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Much as I hate to admit it, you're right.  
It's just...  
the idea, you know? They're still bugs.  
  
**Karyl：**  
So I was thinking. How about we do a rotation of sorts?  
The more of us picking,  
the less chances of being subjected to culinary horrors.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Which brings us back to your question. I've been going around  
trying different places out, getting a feel for where's best.  
Gotta admit, this whole gourmet thing is pretty fun. ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
That much I understand.  
I've been learning much about the joys of food, myself.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You do make a good point, too.  
Leaving everything to Miss Pecorine doesn't feel wise...  
If anything, we may be putting a burden on her.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The more familiar we get, the more places we can recommend.  
That would be a big help for her, I believe.  
You thought the same, didn't you?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
She's done so much for us,  
so it would only be fair to repay her.  
Hehe. You're so kind, Karyl.  
  
**Karyl：**  
D-don't get ahead of yourself there!  
I'm thinking about myself here.  
  
Any more nightmare fuel and I might go insane!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You mentioned getting familiar with stuff. That part's right.  
Knowledge is power, so I'd be able to avoid any edible accidents.  
Nothing more, nothing less! Got it?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, yes.  
A very believable justification. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey there,  
I'm not deaf to sarcasm.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Anyway, you see that rundown place over there?  
The food there is like, super good,  
so how about we go there tonight?  
  
**Karyl：**  
They've got a nice and varied menu, too.  
Keeps me coming back pretty often these days. ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm...  
I see no reason not to.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
More importantly,  
though, a large foreign object seems to be approaching us.  
At its center is...Miss Pecorine, I believe?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait, what? For real?  
Shouldn't we bail?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Mmm...  
Oh, you're right.  
It's Queen Dunce herself, in the flesh.  
  
**Karyl：**  
What in the world is she up to?  
And what's with the massive bag?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, look who it is!  
Heyas, my lovely friends!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Are you dumb in the brain or something? You're carrying like a gajillion  
tons worth of stuff! I don't think it's the time for casual greetings,  
my girl.  
You need some help?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Nah, I'm good!  
You know how strong I am!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's all ingredients in here, too.  
Which'll turn into a bunch of delicious food later,  
so the weight's way worth the price.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ingredients?  
Seems more like, uh,  
a bunch of monster remains stuffed in there.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hey, monsters are delicious!  
They're tricky to cook,  
but they were my main source of sustenance when I was out of town!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Anyway!  
A certain acquaintance of mine needed ingredients,  
so I went out and got them! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Look, you see that restaurant over there?  
It's hard to tell since there's no sign,  
but it specializes in monster-based dishes!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The only one in Landosol, even!  
How crazy is that? ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
W-wait a minute...  
\"That restaurant\" as in, the run down looking one?  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're kidding, right?!  
I've...I've been going there super often lately!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, yeah. I know.  
The acquaintance I was talking about is the owner.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
He was telling me all about a certain cute beastgirl.  
Said that she always looked so happy when eating there.  
Never would have guessed that he meant you, though! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm surprised, but also really happy! Who knew you'd like  
monster cuisine so much? Don't worry, they'll have plenty of  
stock for today,  
so feel free to eat to your heart's content. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
...*gag*  
Y-you're telling me I've been eating monsters all this time?!  
I...I don't feel so good.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hey, they're great!  
I mean, just look at this juicy eyeball! It's got me drooling already. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh my god, get it away! Get it away!  
Y-you've gotta be kidding me. This can't be real...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe...  
That aside,  
myself and Miss Karyl were having a discussion just there.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We felt bad about leaving where to eat up to you all the time,  
so we decided to start something of a rotation from now on.  
Then the three of us could share the burden together.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl insisted, I should add.  
You've introduced us to plenty of places,  
so it's only fair that we give back.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aww, you shouldn't have!  
Thanks though, I appreciate it!  
It's a good idea too, so let's go with that.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm looking forward to seeing what sorts of places you two suggest,  
not gonna lie! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ehehe.  
You're all so kind, you know that?  
Honestly, I don't think I could have come across better friends.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Friends and guildmates, at that.  
Because the Gourmet Guild is ready to go!  
Where there's food, there's us! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hold up. The Gourmet Guild? That's literally the first  
time I've heard any mention of it.  
C-can you please not  
include people in your weird group without permission?!  
  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heh!  
Karyl, my dear. You don't understand.  
There's certain high-class restaurants that only allow guilds in.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's why I went ahead and registered us.  
It wasn't easy, but now I can take you to them without any issues. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
For real? You could have asked, at least...  
Well, not that I really mind.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You had me interested at the mention of 'high-class', if I'm being honest.  
But wait, it's not gonna be something revolting again, is it?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Who knows?  
We'll find out when we go, hehe. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Anyway!  
As guildmaster,  
I would like to welcome you all to the wonderful world of the gourmet!  
So long as we're together, every meal's guaranteed to be a treat! ♪
