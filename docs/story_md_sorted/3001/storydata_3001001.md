# The Gourmet Guild Episode 1
{player} and Kokkoro bump into Karyl, who they had saved earlier that afternoon while on the hunt for a restaurant. Karyl offers to treat them at one she frequents, but coincidence would have it that Pecorine was stuffing her face at that very same restaurant.
  
## Subtitle: A Table Full of Happiness
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Our accommodation is sorted,  
so perhaps it's time to fill the hole in our stomachs.  
What say you,  
my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That said, I'm not quite sure what our options would be.  
I'm rather new to the city myself, so there's still much I don't know.  
Not ideal, considering my duty to serve as your guide.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Yui was kind enough to treat us to lunch,  
so there proved to be little issue there.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It would be...unwise to rely on her at all times, though.  
If anything, it's our responsibility to provide for ourselves.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm...  
As far as our options are concerned, we can gather ingredients to cook with ourselves.  
That, or we can simply rely on eating out.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As for today, I believe we're both rather exhausted.  
If you'd like, we can find a nearby restaurant for a quick supper.  
Though that begs the question of which is best.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Judging by a quick scan around the area,  
this district has more than its fair share of restaurants lined up.  
Is there anything in particular that you fancy, my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh?  
Something seems to have caught your eye,  
at the very least.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm?  
Hey, you! You better have a good reason for staring!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ohh, now this is a pleasant surprise.  
Good day, miss.  
How are you feeling now?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Excuse me?  
Look, I'll be straight with you.  
I dunno who you are, so buzz off!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, yes. You were collapsed the entire time, now that I think about it.  
We never had the chance to introduce ourselves.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This is {player}.  
As for me, my name is Kokkoro.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That sure rings a bell...  
Ohh, now I remember.  
You helped me earlier today, right? Carried me to the  
hospital and all that. Thanks, I appreciate it.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Not at all. Troubling times call for us to help one another.  
I simply live by Ameth's teachings.  
More importantly, it's a relief to see that you're fine.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Is something the matter?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, no.  
Sorry for staring.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm, these two don't seem so special to me.  
Are they really the ones Her Majesty was talking about?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Kind of in a rough position here, though.  
I was told not to get involved with them for now.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But it's hard to just pretend nothing happened at this point.  
And the order was to keep tabs on them, so...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm...  
Sorry, I kind of spaced out there.  
Guess I'm still feeling under the weather.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Seems like you know my name already, but well,  
lemme introduce myself anyway. I'm Karyl.  
Odd circumstances aside, it's a pleasure to meet you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Likewise.  
Also, forgive me for asking,  
but would you happen to be familiar with this area at all?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We're new to these parts, you see. The plan was to find  
somewhere to eat,  
but we're not quite sure where to go.  
Any recommendations would be appreciated.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm...You two helped me out, so sure, I don't mind.  
Thing is, I don't really come around here that often, either.  
Don't expect me to know anywhere that good.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That said, you probably can't go wrong with somewhere that  
seems busy.  
Tonight's my treat, by the way.  
Even steven, just how I like it. ♪  
  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well then.  
How about that restaurant over there? It's certainly lively.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?  
That's uh, not quite where I was—

Oh?  
That voice sounds familiar. Is it Pecorine?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Pecorine, you say?  
I only know a few people that would call me that...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Err, give me a few seconds!  
This massive pile of delicious food is blocking my vision,  
so lemme get it into my stomach first!

Heyas! ☆

Heyas...?  
Odd greetings aside, you and food seem to go hand in hand.  
Does that sound right?

Hey, wait a minute.

**Pecorine：**  
Woah! You're the catlady from this afternoon!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hey hey, are you all better now?  
Feeling anemic, maybe?  
Don't worry, some good food'll fix that!  
Feel free to dig in! ☆  
  
  
**Karyl：**  
H-hey there, how about calming your jets a little?  
Phew... I really could have done without bumping into her,  
but not much I can do about it now.  
  
**Karyl：**  
G-get that plate outta my face!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No need to be shy! Eat up!  
It's all delish!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Actually, now that I think about it.  
You gave me food earlier on, didn't you?  
Sorted, then! Tonight's on me! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hehe.  
Get this! They had an eating contest here earlier.  
Did I win? You bet I did!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Completely and utterly dominated the competition. ☆  
I'm getting plenty of prize money, so yeah, tonight's all on me.  
Feel free to order anything and everything you want! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Speaking of, time to order another batch!  
Let's see here...  
Right. I'll take everything on the menu, thank you very much! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Y-you're still going at it...?  
If my eyes are to be trusted,  
then you've already made short work of that sizeable plate over there.  
Yet you're still not full...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
There wouldn't happen to be a black hole localized within the vicinity of your stomach, would there?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Regardless,  
this works out for us.  
Now there's no need to worry about tonight's supper.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As they say,  
one shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.  
You should join us, Miss Karyl. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Err... Fine, fine.  
Might as well, now that I'm here.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yup, yup!  
Dig in to your heart's content.  
Otherwise I'll gobble it all up!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Sit yourselves down and  
enjoy the grub and some good company! ♪  
Quick, while it's still nice and warm!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No need to hold back, either!  
If there's anything I want in this world,  
it's to live in a place where everyone can eat to their heart's content. ☆
