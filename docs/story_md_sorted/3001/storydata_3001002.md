# The Gourmet Guild Episode 2
A party planned by Pecorine takes on a very buggy flavor upon the arrival of its feast. Karyl's stomach rejects the very idea of eating what lays before her, prompting a lecture from Pecorine that turns the dinner table into the venue for a fierce debate. Little did they know that their bonds would grow even deeper.

**Pecorine：**  
Now then, my wonderful friends. ♪  
It's time for today's main event.  
Feast your eyes on this buggy delight!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wahey. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Whoa, hold the phone!  
Did you just say 'buggy?!'  
  
**Karyl：**  
You did, didn't you?!  
It definitely wasn't 'yummy!'  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ehehe.  
Didn't you know?  
Bug-based dishes are a delicacy. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
How can you say something so fundamentally incorrect  
with a smile on your face?!  
A- are we for real here? Bugs?  
In your MOUTH?! You're crazy!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Not quite, Miss Karyl. As a matter of fact, bug-based  
sweets are common where I'm from. Their simple taste made  
them rather popular, too.  
I take it you're not a fan?  
  
  
**Karyl：**  
Not a fan?  
That is SO not the point!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Okay, okay! Time out!  
This isn't some kind of practical joke, is it?  
Oh god, it's not. I can see the plates from hell approaching.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heh!  
Nowhere does bug-based dishes like here! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let's see... Hmm?  
Ah, I know this sour smell.  
Can't go wrong with a xxxx and xxxx salad! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Nope! Nope!  
Absolutely not!  
My brain refuses to parse what I just heard!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Right everyone. Let's calm down.  
Deep breaths.  
Okay? ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
No one, and I mean absolutely no one, would go near food with bugs in it.  
Right? I'm not crazy, am I?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Come on now, you can't just let food go to waste.  
That'd be rude to the people that put their heart into making it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aww, wittle Karyl's so fussy.  
Don't worry, I'll help you out. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hell no you won't!  
That bug doesn't even look like it's been cooked!  
Keep it away from me!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I-I swear I'm gonna kill you if you don't get that spoon out of my face!  
I mean it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Come on, what is it with you and your death threats?  
Feel free to do the deed if you want, I guess.  
Just make sure to cook me up nice and good afterwards. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If you're gonna take a life,  
then you might as well show respect by eating it.  
Right down to the bone.  
  
**Karyl：**  
What IS it with you and your weird obsession with food?!  
Look, you'll catch me dead before I even THINK any of that!  
Someone, please. Please tell me I'm not the crazy one here!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*munch*  
Hmm, I see why you would recommend this.  
Quite the delicacy, if I do say so myself.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Alas,  
the spices are a little much for me.  
Otherwise, though, it's more than edible.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You should try it too, my lord.  
Here, open wide... ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, shoot!  
I forgot {player} was here! Sorry,  
you just have like, zero presence!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Anyway!  
You're sane in the brain, right?!  
I can't trust anyone else here!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, squirt! Isn't he important to you?!  
Quit trying to feed him that awful stuff!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So you say,  
but that's precisely the point.  
I would much rather he enjoy all sorts of food.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
To eat is to live, as they say.  
One can't go on without sustenance, can they?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Exactamundo! ☆  
Oh, Kokkoro! That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.  
I almost want to frame it and hang it on my wall!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You deserve a treat,  
and I have just the thing!  
xxx, pickled in a sweet and sour sauce!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*munch, munch*  
Hmm, I'm quite fond of this as well.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
I must admit, experiencing food like this is quite the treat.  
I was brought up in a small village near the mountains,  
so we never got to experience this much.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
There's much more I'd like to be shown,  
should time and convenience permit it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Not a problem!  
Honestly, Kokkoro,  
you're such a little angel!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And cute!  
So crazily cute! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
G-get outta here, squirt!  
She's gonna eat you up!  
I can see it in her eyes!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, come on.  
You know I wouldn't!  
She certainly does look delectable, though. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, I know what it is. You want a hug as well, don't you?  
Aww, look at you being all jealous. ♪  
Come on, my dear. My arms are wide open. ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Keep those death limbs away from me!  
 Actually, I know  
the script here. You just wanna hold me down and feed me bugs!  
Too bad, buster! I'm not dumb enough to fall for that!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hey now, I've never once thought you were dumb.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, she's long gone now...  
And with that said, I'll just have to give {player}  
a big hug instead. Come on.  
*squeeze* ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm...  
If I may,  
you're quite the touchy-feely type, aren't you?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Contact with other people is my bread and butter.  
That's one of the reasons I brought you all here today.  
It's just really nice knowing you've got friends to enjoy a meal with.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That said, it didn't go down that well with Karyl.  
Which I guess is my fault for not considering her tastes.  
I should apologize...  
  
**Karyl：**  
For real...?  
H-hmph!  
At least you realize now.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Look,  
just choose a more...normal place next time.  
Then I won't have any issues with it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, really?  
Ehehe...  
That's a relief. I was scared you might hate me now.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Come on, Karyl.  
Lemme give you a nice,  
big hug. I promise I won't go too hard. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm...  
Well, I feel kind of bad myself, so sure.  
Just, you know, promise you won't make me eat any bugs.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I think I'd lose all faith in people if you did.  
I mean it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aww, but they're so delicious...  
Oh well, though.  
Different strokes, different folks.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It wouldn't be right to force you.  
Thankfully there's other stuff on the menu,  
so let's order something.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let's eat away, talk away, and laugh away.  
Tell us about yourself, Karyl.  
About the stuff you like, the stuff you dislike. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We had the fortune of meeting each other, so let's make the most of it.  
Not just for today, but for the foreseeable future as well.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Why eat alone when we can share the experience?  
That's how I see it, anyway.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
As for today, well.  
I've got plenty of room for more. ♪
