### Place: Landosol Palace Entrance
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh, come on. Let me see Jun—I mean, the captain already!  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hey, can you at least say *something*?  
This devotion to your guard duty is impressive and all...  
  
**Tomo：**  
But if all you do is stand there silently defending the gates,  
you're no better than an automated artifact.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Have a little flexibility, if you're human!  
See, I'm a knight of Nightmare, just like you.  
We may not be close friends, but we're colleagues, aren't we?  
  
**Tomo：**  
You could at least pass on a message.  
Please don't make me use force  
against a fellow guildmate serving the same calling.  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
...  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
You can keep asking, but the answer won't change.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh, so you *can* talk.  
 Well, that's nice.  
I was starting to feel like a crazy person  
ranting at a lifeless statue.  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
You have no authority to enter the palace.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'm quite aware of that.  
The palace has always clung to its outmoded feudal principles.  
It would never treat a mere commoner like a noble.  
  
**Tomo：**  
With no title to my name, I can't enter the palace.  
That's why I'm asking you to call Jun out here to the palace entrance.  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
Not possible.  
The captain is busy with an important meeting.  
  
**Tomo：**  
A meeting? Huh. That's news to me...  
What could she be discussing, exactly?  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
Nothing you need to know about.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Actually, I doubt this gatekeeper knows the answer himself.  
I'm sensing hints of hesitation in his voice.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Sticking around and interrogating him  
probably won't yield anything worthwhile.  
  
**Tomo：**  
But I'd rather not resort to kicking his ass  
and storming in uninvited, either.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I could if I needed to, but I'm still a knight of Nightmare myself.  
I don't want to make any unnecessary enemies.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmmm...  
I guess I'm just wasting my time here,  
so I'll try approaching this from a different angle.  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
What now?  
If that's all you wanted, hurry and clear out.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Yes, yes.  
Keep up the good work, soldier.  
 ...Hm?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hey, Tomo!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh! Matsuri.  
What's gotten you so out of breath?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Panicking at the drop of a hat is a bad habit of yours.  
Though I find it rather cute myself! ♪  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Mmnnghh!  
 Please don't pat me on the head!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
More importantly, I've got a report to give to Jun!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Really?  
Well, I'm sorry to say you probably won't have much luck right now.  
This mean old gatekeeper isn't letting anyone see her.  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Uhhh...?  
But, but, but, it's pretty urgent!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmm...  
Then why don't you explain the situation to me?  
I don't know what this is about, but I might be able to help.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Uhhhh...?  
 All right! I guess you'll do instead!  
I know you're an upstanding defender of justice!  
I really look up to you and stuff!

**Tomo：**  
Heheh... ♪  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Myaurgh?!  
 Like I said, hands off the head, OK?!  
Honestly, Tomo, you're a smooth talker,  
so why do you sometimes just silently toy with people?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha... Sorry.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Anyway, this is no place to stand around chatting.  
It's almost lunchtime, so let's head into town  
and grab a bite while we talk.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Matsuri, do you have any preferences?

**Matsuri：**  
Oh?!  
 Actually, uh... meat would be good!  
Plenty of meat makes a girl strong!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Meat, got it.  
I'd rather not eat anything too greasy at lunchtime...  
but I think I know just the place. C'mon, follow me.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Roger!  
 Oh, but... can I call a few other people?  
Truth is, it's not exactly me who's got business with Jun.  
It's this bunch of kids!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
They just kind of asked me to help them  
get in touch with Nightmare, y'know?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
They call themselves the Little Lyrical guild.  
I don't suppose you've heard of them?  
 Myself, I've played  
with them a few times since they're from my neighborhood.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahhh...  
 Those girls who've been causing trouble lately  
with their pretend guild. They get up to some wild antics,  
so I've had to warn them a few times.  
  
**Tomo：**  
But what would they want with us, exactly?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ahhh...  
I don't really know the details,  
so you'd better ask them directly!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
We can meet up with them on the way to the restaurant!  
Hmhmhmm~♪ Tomo's paying for dinner~! ♪  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahh... How many members do they have again?  
I'm not exactly swimming in cash myself...  
Honestly, talk about a sudden expense...  
  
**Tomo：**  
But hey, if it'll help clear up this confusing situation,  
it's worth every penny.
