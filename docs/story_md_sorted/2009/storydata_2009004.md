# Chapter 9 Episode 4
Unaware that the justice she serves has been corrupted, Jun obeys Karyl's orders without question. Octo, who had taken precautions to protect his mind from magical interference, remains coolly rational, but has his own concerns regarding strange dreams he has been having recently.

**Karyl：**  
Ugh, honestly... My head hurts.  
Somebody bring a report with good news already!  
  
**Karyl：**  
If I don't produce results soon,  
Her Majesty will be furious when she eventually wakes up!  
  
**Jun：**  
Your Excellency...  
For the time being, shall I assume our priority  
is to make the festival a success?  
  
**Jun：**  
I do intend to set some manpower aside  
to search for Labyrinth as well.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yes, go ahead and do as you see fit.  
I respect your ability and good judgment,  
Jun, Captain of Nightmare.  
  
**Karyl：**  
However,  
 be sure to report regularly to the palace...  
or rather, to me personally.  
As long as you do that, you're free to do as you please.  
  
**Jun：**  
Understood.  
Well then, I should get back to my work.  
If you will excuse me.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yes, I'm sure you have your hands full.  
The real hunt will begin after the festival... But if possible, do try to  
bring me the heads of those Labyrinth rebels sooner rather than later.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I want to lay them by Her Majesty's bedside as she sleeps... ♪

**Octo：**  
Ohhh boy, how scary...  
The palace sure does seem like a full-on nest of villainy lately.  
  
**Octo：**  
Did I go into the wrong career?  
Well, I mean, not that I can deny  
villainy's more my style than justice in the first place...  
  
**Octo：**  
But what's the point in villainy with no freedom?  
A real villain should do as he pleases,  
without a care for what the big shots in power might say.  
  
**Octo：**  
Isn't that right, Novem?

**Octo：**  
...  
  
**Octo：**  
...Hmm, I keep suddenly losing my train of thought lately.  
What's up with that? It creeps me out.  
  
**Octo：**  
Well, I do have my suspicions.  
Everyone who visits the palace has been acting strangely of late...  
  
**Octo：**  
I think there really might be  
some powerful suggestive magic covering the whole area.  
  
**Octo：**  
Of course, I'd never leave my own mind unprotected!  
  
**Octo：**  
But this spell seems too strong to fully neutralize alone...  
And I'd rather not become anyone's pawn,  
so perhaps I ought to start keeping my distance from the palace.  
  
**Octo：**  
My mind already seems to be behaving oddly,  
with those strange dreams I've been having...  
  
**Jun：**  
...?  
What's wrong, Vice-Captain Octo?  
  
**Jun：**  
We're returning to the Nightmare guard station for now.  
In order to fulfill our duties as Her Excellency wishes,  
we need to brief all the knights and review their assignments.  
  
**Octo：**  
Right, right.  
Can't argue with the big shots, can we?  
A public servant's work never ends!  
  
**Octo：**  
Hm...?  
  
**Jun：**  
What is it?  
  
**Octo：**  
Oh, ah... I just thought I saw some kind of butterfly...  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm. The palace is protected by a powerful barrier.  
Not even an insect should be able to enter uninvited.  
Perhaps you're just more tired than you realize?  
  
**Jun：**  
You're new to the job, so I'm sure it can't be easy.  
Try not to push yourself too hard, all right?  
  
**Octo：**  
Sure. I'd like nothing better than a long vacation! ♪  
  
**Jun：**  
Alas, I think not.  
We're short on manpower as it is,  
so I will need you to do what you can.  
  
**Jun：**  
As Chris's... Christina's direct successor,  
a lot is resting on your shoulders.  
  
**Octo：**  
Ehhh~?  
 I can't imagine that woman doing honest work,  
so who's going to care if I slack off a little, too?  
  
**Jun：**  
You certainly speak your mind.  
Christina was more diligent than you might think.  
  
**Jun：**  
You can't neglect your duty to the public.  
Not when your pay comes from their hard-earned taxes.  
  
**Jun：**  
We of Nightmare must always defend justice  
and do what we can for the common folk.  
  
**Octo：**  
Ahaha... That \"justice\" is what's being twisted out of shape.  
But I guess they'll never see that in their current state...
