**Pecorine：**  
Hrnnnghhhh...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Urgh... It's no good.  
I really can't do a thing without my Royal Equipment.  
I've hit and shoved these walls, but they won't budge an inch.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Who knew I was this powerless all along?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
My precious Royal Equipment  
converts heaps of calories into unbelievable strength...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But the enemy must know about it,  
because they confiscated it first thing.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Without burning all those calories,  
I don't feel nearly as hungry as usual...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But now it feels like I don't even deserve  
to be called the \"perpetually peckish Pecorine\" anymore.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm just a powerless princess who can't do a thing for herself.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Just the same old Eustiana  
who used to gaze longingly out of the window  
at a world she couldn't reach.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Hmm?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ehh? Huh? Is that a butterfly?  
H-how did it find its way in here?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
There shouldn't even be any windows  
in these tightly sealed palace dungeons...  
  
**???：**  
Step back.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? Whose voice was that?  
Did... did the butterfly just speak?  
  
**???：**  
As I said, please step back.  
If you keep on cowering there, I can't get in.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? What?  
I don't quite understand, but all right!  
I'll stand up against the back wall!  
  
**???：**  
That will be fine.  
I appreciate your cooperation, Eustiana von Astraea.  
  
**???：**  
No... Perhaps I should call you \"Pecorine\" for now.  
The tragic outcast princess,  
snatched from her throne by the whims of fate...  
  
**???：**  
I've come because I have business with you.  
Though we only have a brief time before the next jailer arrives  
to take over this station... Would you join me for a little chat?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? Ummm...  
  
**???：**  
Hmm...  
It would appear this form confuses you too greatly  
for us to converse effectively.  
  
**???：**  
Then so be it.  
I suppose it is only courteous to show my face.

**Neneka：**  
I do not know exactly  
how much information you have gathered about us...  
But does this name sound at all familiar?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The Metamorph Monarch, Neneka?  
Oh! I do know that name!  
That man in the golden armor... Masaki was talking about you!  
  
**Neneka：**  
Ah, that dolt. You encountered him somewhere?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes. One thing led to another...  
We were hoping to meet one of the Seven Crowns—well, you—  
but instead we found Masaki in a terribly beat-up state.  
  
`image display end`  
**Neneka：**  
So he actually managed to stay alive.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes. He was supposedly pretty badly injured,  
but you wouldn't know it from how he talked!  
...  
And he seemed very worried about you.  
  
**Neneka：**  
O-oh...?  
Well, he is not important to us right now.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I was not concerned about him in the least.  
Simple-minded creatures of that sort tend to be very resilient.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wow, harsh words...  
But hey, I guess this isn't the time for chitchat.  
Let's put that aside for now, and get to the important points.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Miss Neneka.  
I heard that you had been imprisoned in the palace too...  
But you're all right, huh? That's good news, at least.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I'm far from \"all right.\"  
Even as we speak, my body is attached to a magical siphon,  
being agonizingly drained of its very life force.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Y-your body?  
But then what am I looking at right now...?  
  
**Neneka：**  
A mere duplicate.  
Just before I was attached to the device,  
I severed a portion of my body and let it escape in secret.  
  
**Neneka：**  
By the by, I possess the power of transformation.  
I can become any living being that exists in this world.  
Though it takes some effort, I can even become inanimate objects.  
  
**Neneka：**  
This is why I am known as the Metamorph Monarch.  
  
**Neneka：**  
And this ability is shared by my duplicate.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Thus have I evaded watchful eyes, disguised as insects and vermin,  
occasionally becoming leaves on plants or accessories on passersby  
to navigate the palace unseen.  
  
**Neneka：**  
These underground dungeons are sealed by a great barrier  
that informs the warden of the slightest disturbance.  
Various sensors, visual and otherwise, are constantly active.  
  
**Neneka：**  
To some extent, I can deceive them with magic...  
But while I am able to infiltrate this place briefly,  
breaking you out of your cell would be difficult.  
  
**Neneka：**  
The form that you see before you is only a duplicate, after all.  
In this reduced state, I cannot exercise all of my Seven Crowns abilities.  
  
**Neneka：**  
From what I hear, It seems Rajnikanth and Christina,  
two of my fellow Crowns,  
already escaped from these cells not so long ago.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Since then, security has been redoubled.  
Escape is a near impossibility.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I have devised a variety of plans,  
but none so far have proven feasible.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Honestly...  
This is all those other Crowns' fault.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Aside from myself,  
 the Crowns seem to cause trouble  
simply by existing in this world. How deplorable.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ummm...  
I'm not sure I understood everything you just said,  
but what exactly are these \"Seven Crowns\"?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Before this all happened, we were actually investigating them.  
  
**Neneka：**  
The Seven Crowns are the seven godlike creators of this whole world.  
...Yes, that seems the simplest explanation for now.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Y-you're actually gods?!  
You seem awfully human, considering...  
  
**Neneka：**  
Well, though we have godlike powers, we are indeed human.  
Humans who ascended to the station of the divine  
and wield divine miracles. That is all.  
  
**Neneka：**  
But who we are is not important right now.  
Let us focus on solving the problems at hand.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Though I lie imprisoned,  
I am able to gather some information through this duplicate.  
However, I have yet to grasp the whole picture.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Could I ask you to fill in certain gaps in my knowledge?  
There are questions I need to answer.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Even in this medieval fantasy-styled setting,  
information is the greatest asset of all.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
R-right... Well, I don't see why not.  
It's not like I have anything better to do here,  
and it's nice to have someone to talk to!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heheh.  
We don't have much time, so I'll give you a quick rundown.
