**Nozomi：**  
Whew... That's one song down!  
Did you all enjoy it?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But we're just getting started!  
There's a whole lot more where that came from!  
  
**Chika：**  
Yes.  
There are so many songs I want to sing for you all!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Talk about enthusiasm.  
Honestly, calm down, you two.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'm only just keeping up here!  
Though I can't deny those smiles are really making my costumes shine!

**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh...  
I... I could not help but stop and stare.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This is very new to me, but these people are quite remarkable.  
What is the word for them...  
 \"Idols\"?  
There was certainly nobody like them in the village where I grew up.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What an intriguing form of culture. Eheh, my whole body  
seems to be aglow with warmth. The pleasing melody and rhythm,  
the enchanting costumes, those dazzling smiles...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Simply watching them seems to light a spark of happiness.  
  
**Chika：**  
Ah...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hm? What is it, Chika?  
Don't tell me you're running out of stamina already?  
  
**Chika：**  
No, I'm still full of energy, but...  
Look—over there.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh!  
 {player} is here!  
Eheheh... do you think he came to cheer us on?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Hmm... Did one of you give Mr. Knight a ticket?  
I thought none of us had managed to invite him  
since he hadn't been around...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hmm...  
 Looks more like he just happened to pass by.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, oopsie. Guess we're holding up the show.  
Let's forget about {player} for now,  
and start the next song!  
  
**Chika：**  
Yes...  
All these fans came to support us today.  
We can't disappoint them.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm...?  
My lord, are you acquainted with those young ladies?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I thought I just saw them glance in your direction  
and whisper amongst themselves for a moment.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  They're precious friends of mine.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm a massive Carmina fan.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see...  
 My lord, you do have a lot of friends.  
To think you even know popular idols  
who sing and dance on a stage like this...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. It is a fine talent to be able to make friends  
with anyone you meet.  
 Though I cannot help but wonder  
why your friends all seem to be female.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh...  
 Come to think of it,  
I think I have heard you humming that song while cooking.  
My lord, you have been following this group all along?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. Well, if you are a fan of theirs, I feel sure I will like them too.  
Indeed, watching their performance was a wonderful experience. ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It filled me with joy from my head to my toes.  
Ah, so this is what idols are all about...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tomo：**  
Which way did those two go?  
Urgh... Have we completely lost sight of them?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Uhhh...?  
 With all these people around,  
I can't get a hold on their scent!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
And maybe it's because the crowd is mostly men,  
but I can't see much right now, either!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Yeah... You're not exactly tall, Matsuri,  
so with all these bulky bodies around,  
your view must be almost completely blocked...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Even I can't see much through this crowd.  
I guess we might have to give up and try a different tack.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh...!  
Those two knights from Nightmare  
seem to be closing in on our location once more.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
They are too close for comfort...  
We should try to slip away through the crowd.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. If it were possible, I would have liked to stay  
and enjoy the performance...  
 It pains me that our current position  
does not permit such luxuries, my lord.
