### Place: Landosol Clinic
  
**Narration：**  
A little while later...  
  
**Narration：**  
With the arrival of reinforcements from Nightmare,  
the mystery monster has been successfully defeated.  
As soon as they got the go-ahead, Carmina resumed their concert.  
  
**Narration：**  
Despite the huge setback of a mid-concert monster attack,  
the event was a huge success,  
and the big Carmina tour kicked off as planned.  
  
**Narration：**  
But {player} only learns of all this  
when the news reaches the clinic where Kokkoro lies sleeping.  
  
**Narration：**  
Though Chika was able to heal her physical wounds,  
for some reason she has yet to awaken from her slumber,  
so {player} can only watch and wait by her bedside...

**Kokkoro：**  
...  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh, that poor girl...  
I'm so sorry. This is all my fault.  
If only I'd blocked the attack, or done a better job healing her...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
No, you did everything you could, Chika.  
Please don't blame yourself too much.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I'm the one who suggested attacking the monster  
when we should have put our safety first...

**Tsumugi：**  
I don't think anyone's really to blame...  
It was just awful luck.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
What even was that monster, anyway?  
It really pisses me off to no end!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...Hm?  
What is it, Mr. Knight?  
You look like you want to say something.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Apologize to everyone.  
**Choice: (2)**  Thank everyone.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chika：**  
Why would you apologize to us?  
You didn't do anything wrong back there. You never do.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
She's right, {player}.  
Besides, what use are apologies now?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
We can't change what's already happened,  
so let's focus on what we can do from now on.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Our fans around the world are waiting.  
This is no time to get depressed and lose our momentum.  
Not if we call ourselves idols!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Chika：**  
...Haha.  
I really don't think we've done anything to deserve your thanks.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Uh-huh.  
We just got mad at that monster and lashed out.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Looking at what happened to your friend,  
it might have been better if we'd stayed calm  
and handled things differently...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But there's no point saying that now.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Nozomi：**  
For the moment...  
This girl—Kokkoro, right? We'll at least pay for her treatment.  
After all, she did come to see us perform.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I know it's not much, and it won't be much comfort right now.  
But the least we can do  
 is support the fans who support us!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Please, don't think of it as reparations...  
Just accept this from us.  
We'll find you a good doctor, too, and help however we can.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Don't let yourself get too down, OK?  
I'm sure she'll wake up before you know it.  
  
**Producer：**  
There you are!  
What are you girls wasting time here for?  
  
**Chika：**  
Eek! P-Producer?!  
  
**Christina：**  
\"Eek\"? That's a fine welcome. What am I, a monster?  
Well, not that I mind. I'm used to being feared!  
Ahahahah! ☆  
  
**Christina：**  
Now, you three.  
Get yourselves to the transfer station at the national airport.  
We'll head to the next venue, where you can get a good night's sleep.  
  
**Christina：**  
Your transportation and accommodations  
are all being prepared by the manager on-site.  
  
**Christina：**  
Come on, get moving!  
You can leave this poor girl to me. We are... acquainted.  
I'll see she's well cared for.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
R-right!  
We'll leave that to you then, Producer.  
  
**Chika：**  
Please excuse us.  
Um, {player}... We'll be in touch.  
Once we return from our tour, we'll be sure to visit.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Well, I really hope  
that this Kokkoro girl wakes up before that happens...  
Anyway, we'll be seeing you around!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmmm. You're friends with them as well, {player}?  
I'll have you know they're set to take the world by storm,  
my Carmina girls!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hahah.  
Why the blank face?  
  
**Christina：**  
I know my beauty is stunning,  
but you don't have to stare quite that hard.  
Don't they teach manners in school these days?  
  
**Christina：**  
Haha...  
Well, I can hardly blame you for being surprised.  
  
**Christina：**  
I can still scarcely believe it myself...  
The indomitable battle vixen Christina,  
serving as the producer for a group of sweet performers?  
  
**Christina：**  
You never know where life will take you!  
Ahahahahah! ☆
