**Neneka：**  
...Hmm.  
For the moment, that should cover everything.  
The situation is better than I expected.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Only you, thanks to your reckless assault, were captured...  
All of your other allies, Labyrinth included, must have escaped safely.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
D-do you need to put it like that?  
Though I'll admit I let the blood rush to my head  
and didn't handle things perfectly...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
{player} and the others must be so worried...  
I feel bad for doing this to them.  
  
**Neneka：**  
For now, you would do better to worry about yourself.  
It seems to me that your interests align with mine.  
I would like us to work together, Princess Eustiana.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Um... Actually, could you just call me plain old Pecorine?  
I've gotten pretty attached to this nickname they gave me!  
  
**Neneka：**  
Oh...?  
 Well, one name is as good as another.  
As someone accustomed to changing my very form each day,  
I find names quite a trivial concern.  
  
**Neneka：**  
At any rate,  
our priority should be to find you a way out of this prison.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Though it seems you have yet to be harmed,  
I rather doubt that will last.

**Neneka：**  
Sooner or later, you may meet the same fate as I,  
reduced to living fuel for that despicable apparatus.  
Or worse, you may simply be executed.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Having taken your place, I cannot imagine Mana—  
the individual now using the name of Eustiana—  
would have any great desire to keep you alive.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...No, I expect not.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
For the imposter,  
the genuine princess's existence can only be a nuisance.  
Leaving me alive wouldn't seem wise at all.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Indeed.  
Your life is hanging by a fragile thread.  
  
**Neneka：**  
In fact, I have trouble understanding  
why you have not been killed already.  
If I were in their place, I would not take any chances.

**Pecorine：**  
Umm...  
Isn't it because they want to use me to power that weird device?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Hmm. At present, I think my own magic  
should be sufficient for their needs...  
  
**Neneka：**  
Incidentally, that device's function is brainwashing.  
It manipulates the minds of others to make their thoughts convenient  
to Mana's... the current Eustiana's needs.  
  
**Neneka：**  
That Karyl girl who calls herself Her Majesty's regent, along with  
the members of Nightmare, are already under its influence,  
effectively reduced to mere puppets doing Eustiana's bidding.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I see...  
So that's why Karyl was acting so strangely back there.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Thank goodness.  
So she doesn't hate me...  
We haven't lost everything we built up...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I wanted to believe, but I couldn't feel totally sure.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But now I have no doubts.  
Karyl was just being controlled, not doing that because she wanted to.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Most likely.  
By the way, the apparatus is stored in the throne room itself,  
in a magical fount concealed beneath the chamber's floor.  
  
**Neneka：**  
My body, which is attached directly to the device,  
is also imprisoned there.  
  
**Neneka：**  
It is imperative that we find a way to destroy the device.  
If possible, I would appreciate it if I could be rescued in the process.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But... how exactly?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We're both prisoners right now...  
I agree that a device like that should be destroyed,  
but there's not really a way for us to do it, is there?  
  
**Neneka：**  
It's not impossible.  
As you can see, my duplicate is able to travel relatively freely.  
Using this advantage, I can make contact with our allies outside.  
  
**Neneka：**  
If we instruct them, they can stage an operation  
to destroy the brainwashing apparatus  
and rescue us both from our plight.  
  
**Neneka：**  
To achieve this, I will need your knowledge.  
You who were born and raised in this palace...  
Eustiana von Astraea.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Any information that is closely guarded for reasons of security—  
the palace layout, the existence of any secret passages—  
will greatly improve our chances of success.  
  
**Neneka：**  
That is why I have made contact with you today.  
And at significant risk to myself.  
Are we quite clear now, Princess?  
  
**Neneka：**  
...Oh dear.  
I think the new guard is on his way. I hear footsteps.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I will transform into an ordinary stone.  
Take it and hide it somewhere for now.  
  
**Neneka：**  
When they bring food, I will become a half-eaten scrap.  
Take that piece of trash and place it surreptitiously atop your food tray.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Food scraps are disposed of within the day,  
so I will be able to leave this place and contact our allies.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ehh?! Do you have to go to all that trouble?  
If you can become a butterfly,  
can't you just slip out of a window?  
  
**Neneka：**  
That would be difficult.  
This palace's current mistress, Eustiana,  
is to some extent aware of my unique abilities.  
  
**Neneka：**  
As such, there are various traps and sensors  
stationed throughout the palace.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Without subtlety and cunning, even my duplicate cannot evade them.  
And the barrier surrounding the palace  
would also detect any ordinary attempts to leave.  
  
**Neneka：**  
To be passively discarded like so much trash  
is the most reliable route available to me now.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Though it pains me to wallow in great heaps of fetid filth,  
it is the only way.  
  
**Neneka：**  
It's a kinder fate than allowing my body  
to perish as fuel for a villain's plot.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I'll do whatever it takes to live on.  
And then I'll return to where I belong.  
  
**Neneka：**  
That is the goal I pursue.  
I hope you can understand and support it... Princess.
