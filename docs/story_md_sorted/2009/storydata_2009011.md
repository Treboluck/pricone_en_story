## Subtitle: A Vicious Blow
  
**Chika：**  
Haha.  
 I'll back you up, so let's fight carefully, everyone!  
We don't want to see any injuries on the first day of our tour!  
  
**Chika：**  
This first tour is a huge moment in our careers.  
We mustn't do anything that we'll regret later.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I know, I know!  
But uh, this monster looks like a real toughie...  
I dunno if it's realistic to hope for no injuries.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Well, if it comes down to it,  
we'll just buy time until the fans are evacuated!  
That's our way of life! Our pride as idols! ☆  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh?!  
Last I checked, idols don't usually fight at all...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Hahah. We're not like other idols!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...And for better or worse,  
Mr. Knight is somewhere around here too.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
If he can lend us his power,  
no nasty monster will be a match for us!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Mr. Knight!  
I know you can hear me! Can you come this way?!  
We could really use your help over here! ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Dash to her as fast as possible.  
**Choice: (2)**  Dash to her while waving your glowsticks.  
`Tag 1`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Aha—there you are!  
Nice going! I knew that would work!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
...?  
My lord, what are those shining rods?  
When did you purchase them?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. It is traditional to wave these  
when supporting an idol group, is it?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wh-what an interesting custom.  
Well, you certainly seem enthused, so I cannot object.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, there you are! {player}!  
Wow, you even bought our glowsticks! Thanks!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Eheheh. Chika formed a pact with light spirits  
to make ordinary rods glow like that, you know!  
They're actually more advanced technology than you'd think!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Chika：**  
{player}!  
I'm so glad you're here. Can you lend us your strength?  
  
**Chika：**  
Let's all work together to defeat that awful beast.  
All of us have been looking forward to this concert.  
We can't let that monster get away with ruining it.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Whoa, Chika's getting mad! That's a rarity!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I feel just the same way, though.  
C'mon,  
 let's go all out, guys! ♪  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
You can be pretty aggressive sometimes, Nozomi...  
I guess when you act cute all the time,  
you need the occasional battle to let off steam?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hey, girls!  
If you're planning to fight too, we'd appreciate it.  
I don't think we can hold this thing alone!  
  
**Tomo：**  
We'd rather not put any civilians in danger,  
but until backup arrives from Nightmare,  
can you help us keep the beast at bay?!

**Chika：**  
Oh no!  
Are you all right, little girl?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...  
  
**Tomo：**  
...Uh-oh. That blow to the head knocked her clean out.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Has anyone got any healing salve?  
Or if anyone can use healing magic, that works too!  
  
`image display end`  
**Chika：**  
I-I'm a Song Summoner, actually...  
Oh no... Her head has started bleeding!  
  
**Chika：**  
I'll heal her at once!  
Everyone, I can't handle defense while I do this,  
so please try to fend off the monster from a distance!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Got it!  
But is the girl okay?  
That blow sounded pretty nasty...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
If she's got open wounds, I can whip up some bandages for her!  
  
**Chika：**  
No...  
I don't see any large wounds.  
I think she has a concussion from the impact to her head.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Is there anything I can do?  
`Tag 4`  
**Chika：**  
Ahh, {player}...  
Well then, can you focus your ability on me?  
  
**Chika：**  
The more energy I can channel into my Song Summoning,  
the more effective the healing will be.  
  
**Chika：**  
I'm counting on you.  
Everyone else, please be very careful!  
  
**Chika：**  
It seems this monster  
is just as dangerous as it looks... no, even more so!  
  
**Chika：**  
Ahhh, why...  
Why did it come to this?  
  
**Chika：**  
Of all days, it just had to be the start of our big live tour...  
This was supposed to be a special day for all of us...!
