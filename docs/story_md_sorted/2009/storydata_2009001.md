## Subtitle: Pact of Recovery
  
### Place: Labyrinth Hideout
  
**Narration：**  
A day has passed since Nightmare's attack on Labyrinth. After barely  
escaping from their foes, {player} and his allies have  
taken shelter for the moment in a different Labyrinth hideout.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I'm back.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Those girls... \"Little Lyrical,\" was it?  
The three kids who're friends with {player}  
are all safely back with their families now.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, welcome back, Novem!  
You took so long, we were getting worried. Did something happen?  
Was everything OK?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah. With Rajraj fully recovered,  
his Spatial Leap made things a cinch.  
  
**Muimi：**  
As a precaution, we warped a little way from our goal  
and walked the rest on foot. We also scouted out the whole area,  
so that's what took us a while.  
  
**Muimi：**  
For now, we couldn't see anything amiss in the city.  
Although, as you'd expect after a huge military operation,  
the people did look a bit on edge.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I see...  
We've been in peacetime for so long now,  
just seeing soldiers on the march will get people asking questions.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah.  
So tell me, how are {player} and the girl doing?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Mmm... They seemed to be completely spent after yesterday,  
so they were sleeping like logs...  
But they just woke up and should be having breakfast.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
This hideout didn't have any real food supplies,  
so it's not much of a meal, though.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Well, as long as it keeps them going.  
Heck,  
 we should be thankful we even escaped with our lives.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
We can't assume we're safe, though.  
Our last hideout was carefully hidden too,  
but they tracked it down so easily...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
This is another one of the many small hideouts  
our guildmaster built with her object manipulation ability,  
but it's nowhere near as meticulously prepared as the last one...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
If the enemy search properly, it won't take long to find.  
In order to stay hidden,  
we'll have to keep moving regularly from now on.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Really feels like we've become some kind of terrorists, huh?  
Ah, man. How did we end up in this mess?

**Kokkoro：**  
Ehmm...  
Thank you for preparing us breakfast.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Oh, it's you two.  
Morning.  
Did you get plenty of sleep?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I barely feel rested at all.  
`Tag 1`  
**Muimi：**  
Uh-huh...  
Well, there's no helping that. Not after what happened.  
  
**Muimi：**  
That friend of yours—\"Pecorine,\" was it?—  
did get captured by the enemy...  
Hard to rest when you're beside yourself with worry.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed. Do you think she is all right...?  
The enemy seemed to want her taken captive,  
so I would like to think she is still alive, at least...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But I dread to think what they might do to her.  
And Miss Karyl's state also weighs terribly upon both of our minds...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh, how can this have happened?  
We were all like a happy family, sharing meals together every day.  
Yet now, we are utterly separated.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Pat Kokkoro on the head.  
**Choice: (3)**  Tell her not to give up.  
`Tag 2`

**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh...  
Are you trying to comfort me, my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I have never been entirely fond of having my head patted.  
After all, I am your attendant, not a pet for you to cherish.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But right now, the simple touch of your hand  
seems to fill me with such gentle warmth...  
It certainly helps to soothe my heart.

`Tag 3`

`image display end`  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Of course. I quite understand.  
This is no time to wallow in misery.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Though our situation is truly dire,  
both you and I, my lord, are still alive.  
We must join hands to overcome this crisis, no matter what.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Until the day the entire Gourmet Guild can eat together again.  
For that goal, I will gladly give my every effort.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Haha... Though you struggle with speech,  
you offered just the words I needed...  
My lord, it is I who am left speechless.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
It seems I am  
in a more weakened state than I realized...  
Just for a moment, would you let me take refuge in your kindness?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Uh-huh. This may sound blunt, but I need you to stay strong.  
We may have survived that one attack,  
but our situation still doesn't look good.  
  
**Muimi：**  
If we don't move fast, they'll find us and finish us off.  
Somehow, we've gotta find a plan to turn things around.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes. We are quite aware.  
However... what kind of plan might that be?  
  
**Muimi：**  
That's what we're here to figure out.  
I'm hoping the two of you will join us for a strategy meeting.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Certainly. Ah, but first...  
Would it be possible for us to send word to our kind hosts  
at the Sarendia Orphanage?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
They must be terribly worried after we failed to return.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hmmm... Right now, that might be a bad plan.  
The enemy won't miss a chance to take us out.  
They might even have told the citizenry that we're public enemies.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Any kind of direct contact with anyone at all  
could get them mixed up in this.  
  
**Muimi：**  
We're in a battle against the state itself...  
That makes us enemies of the royal palace.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes... Of course.  
It would pain me most terribly  
to cause any disturbance to our friends' peaceful lives...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Still, I'm sure there are ways to let them know you're OK.  
You could send some kind of low-key message.  
  
**Muimi：**  
That's just one of the things we need to discuss and figure out.  
  
**Muimi：**  
As long as we're alive, we haven't lost.  
If we don't give in, we can stage a comeback.  
We've gotta believe that, and just do everything we can.
