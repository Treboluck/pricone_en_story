# Interlude 10
After being knocked out by the monster's blow, Kokkoro awakens in a strange place she has never seen: the town of Tsubakigaoka. There she meets Akira Mosakuji, the woman she knows as Labyrista, who addresses her as Kokoro Natsume.

**Ameth：**  
Ahh!  
Finally, you're here! I've been waiting for you!  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's such a pain... Even if I have urgent news,  
I can only contact you inside your dreams,  
so I have to wait until you actually fall asleep.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh, but forget that.  
I know you're in quite the situation,  
standing up to the palace and all...  
  
**Ameth：**  
So I'd rather not give you more to worry about,  
but sadly, we have a new problem.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Listen. My sweet, sweet little Kokkoro was badly hurt today, right?  
Clobbered by that damn brute of a monster,  
and knocked out for the count.  
  
**Ameth：**  
All her actual injuries have been healed,  
so isn't it strange that she hasn't woken up?  
I certainly thought so, so I did some investigating.  
  
**Ameth：**  
If she's asleep, simply unconscious and dreaming,  
I thought her consciousness might be wandering  
somewhere here, in my realm of influence.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So what I did was run a big search all over...  
and, well, I found her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Where do you think that girl's.. well, her soul? Her mind?  
Whatever you call it—where do you think I found it?  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's in the real world.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And I mean the *real* real world.  
Not the world you're living in,  
all twisted by Mana Senri of the Seven Crowns.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The world you see in your dreams. The *real* world.  
That's where Kokkoro seems to have somehow ended up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's not even like she's dreaming...  
She's there, as the Kokkoro you know, yet somehow in reality.  
  
**Ameth：**  
As if she alone  
has somehow been released from this whole game world...  
  
**Ameth：**  
I can't see the logic at all,  
and I've frankly never seen anything like it before.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Could it have anything to do with what Kokkoro was saying  
when she visited the temple to consult me the other day...?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I don't really know,  
but we should be able to see what she's doing from here.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I have a few channels of my own into that reality...  
Well, not that you'll know what that means.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But the point is,  
I should be able to view where she is right now.  
So I'll let you watch her as well.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Here, take my hand...  
Just briefly, I'll connect you to the real world.

**Kokkoro：**  
...?  
 Huh? What?  
Are you... Miss Labyrista?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You *are* Miss Labyrista.  
Leader of the secret society Labyrinth, yes?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I saw your face as you slept deep inside the Labyrinth hideout!  
Though you do seem a little different in certain ways...  
  
**???：**  
Yep. Well, I'm sure you have a lot of questions...  
Actually, I have a ton of things I need to ask you too.  
  
**???：**  
But before that, would you care for a crepe?  
They're not selling at all,  
and I'd hate to let all these ingredients go to waste! ♪

**Kokkoro：**  
I... I see...  
Well, I was feeling a little hungry, so thank you...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm?  
But why would I feel hungry inside a dream?  
Are some dreams just like that, I wonder?  
  
**???：**  
This is no dream! It's reality.  
So of course you'd be hungry.  
  
**Akira：**  
Oh, and yeah...  
Since this is reality,strictly speaking, I'm not \"Labyrista.\"  
Call me Akira Mosakuji.  
  
**Akira：**  
That's my name here in this world.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh...?  
 Miss... Mosakuji?  
What a very unusual name.  
  
**Akira：**  
Yeah, I guess it's not exactly normal over there.  
It means \"seeking a path.\" Pretty labyrinth-y, right?  
That's how I wound up with \"Queen Labyrinth\" as a nickname. ♪  
  
**Akira：**  
And your real name was... Kokoro Natsume, I think?  
  
**Akira：**  
I know your father—  
he's done an awful lot for me over the years.  
I guess you'd call him a kind of mentor?  
  
**Akira：**  
And so I'd like to help you out now.  
Just my way of repaying your daddy for everything, little Kokoro! ♪
