# Suzume (New Year) Episode 2
While doing her job at the shrine, Suzume is so focused on not committing any blunders that she starts to move around awkwardly. She then reflects on the fact that she has not been able to concentrate on her work for fear of screwing up, and decides that it is best to go about things as she normally would.

**Narration：**  
One day, while {player} is working with Suzume at the shrine...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Now then, let's start sweeping from here today.  
You go left, and I'll go right.  
Let's make this place spick-and-span.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hngh...! Hrngh...!  
One-two...! Three-four...!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're gonna pull a muscle.  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzume：**  
H-hold on a sec, I'm almost done!  
Five-six...! Seven-eight...!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Whew.  
*pant, pant*...  
I'm trying to make sure that fortune slip doesn't come true.  
  
**Suzume：**  
It said my work would \"have many failures, so take extra care,\" right?  
That's why I'm focusing one-hundred percent on my work!  
  
**Suzume：**  
...A fortune slip is only a guide, so I shouldn't worry about it?  
Er, you're probably right, but...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Either way, if I can cut down on the blunders, it's a good thing, right?  
So today, I'm going to keep working like this.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  If you need help with anything, I'll get right to it.  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzume：**  
Oh no, I couldn't ask any more of you. That would just be rude.  
I appreciate the sentiment though.  
  
**Man：**  
Excuse me, can I get some amazake?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Of course! I'll be right back!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hooooooohhh...! Hooooooohhh...!  
  
**Man：**  
What's wrong?! Is that some kind of special breathing technique?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm trying... not to spill... any amazake...!  
  
**Man：**  
Wow... So this is the earnestness of the shrine maiden.  
  
**Shrine Maiden：**  
Suzume!  
Sorry to ask, but could you move that box for me?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Yes! Right away!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hngh...! Hngh...! Hngh...! Hngh...!  
  
**Shrine Maiden：**  
What's wrong?! Why are you groaning so loudly?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Every time I take a step...! If I make loud noises like this...!  
I can focus on my work...!  
  
**Shrine Maiden：**  
I had no idea such a trick existed...  
Shrine work is so profound.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I think this method might be a great success!  
I've only had a couple of failures today.  
Usually I would already be well into the double digits!  
  
**Suzume：**  
When I'm this careful, I'm not a hassle to anyone,  
and I can be all kinds of useful!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm worried you're trying too hard.  
`Tag 3`  
**Suzume：**  
I guess concentrating so much is a little exhausting...  
But I'm fine!  
I'm going to keep it up for as long as I can!  
  
**Little Girl：**  
Big Sis Suzume!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ah, it's one of the kids from the orphanage.  
All right, I'm going to show her that I don't screw up anymore!  
  
**Little Girl：**  
Big Sis Suzume, we all came to visit the shrine.  
Today I brought everyone here. Eheh!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hehe. Aren't you so grown-up!  
Seeing as you did so well, I'll give you some amazake as a reward.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hooooooohhh...! Hooooooohhh...!  
  
**Little Girl：**  
...  
What are you doing, Big Sis? You're moving all weird.  
  
**Suzume：**  
This isn't weird movement...!  
It's the motion of concentration...!  
  
**Little Girl：**  
Really?  
But you don't look like you're enjoying work  
as much as you usually do.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh...? Is that so?  
But I'm always messing up, so I have to try my best not to...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Being too self-aware isn't like you.  
`Tag 4`  
**Priest：**  
I too agree with what this young lad is saying.  
After all, the gods aren't commanding you to do this.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Mr. Priest...  
  
**Little Girl：**  
I don't know why,  
but I like it a lot better when you're smiling at work!  
When you're all \"ungh!\" like a minute ago,  
it's just weird.  
  
**Suzume：**  
...I guess I was too focused on not making mistakes  
that I wasn't doing my work properly.  
  
**Suzume：**  
From now on, I'm going to do my work the same way as always!  
After all, the result of a fortune slip is just a mindset.  
Thank you for making me realize that.  
  
**Little Girl：**  
Eheheh. You're welcome.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh yeah. As thanks, I'll give you a refill of amazake.  
I'll just be a moment while I—  
Aaaaaaaghhh!  
  
**Priest：**  
...I didn't expect she would trip on an amazake bottle  
and cause an avalanche.  
  
**Little Girl：**  
Ahahahah! You're so funny, Big Sis!  
I much prefer this version of you!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I-I'm sooo sorry! I'll clean it up right away!  
  
**Narration：**  
Suzume demonstrated one of her usual blunders, and the people  
around her helped to clean up, all with smiles on their faces.
