**???：**  
Hold it, foul criminal!  
Surrender yourself at once to my steely embrace!  
  
**Bounty：**  
What kind of idiot fugitive stops on command?!  
  
**Bounty：**  
Ugh, that hurt! Look where you're walking, dumbass!  
Outta my way!  
  
**???：**  
Hail, nameless bystander! Are you unhurt?!  
I am a bounty hunter in pursuit of that ruffian,  
but it seems I let him do you harm. A grave failing on my part...  
  
**???：**  
Ah, but forgive me. I have yet to even introduce myself.  
Feast thine ears... upon my hallowed true name!

Heheheh... Hahahah... Ahahahahah!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I am the one called Annerose von Stechpalm!  
Better known as Hecate of the Gale!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Yes, it is I, Regent of the Order of Gehenna Immortals!  
The Darkest Knight who tamed the fires of Ragnarök  
and saved a world now lost!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
This crossing of paths must too be fate!

**Stechpalm：**  
Oh, shoot! How did he get so far already?!  
I must pursue him at once!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I know! You can help me out!  
If you work with me, I'll share a portion of the bounty. How's that?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll do it.  
`Tag 2`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Really?! You would do this for me?!  
Well, then... Let's get after him!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I'll continue my pursuit and lure him to a certain location.  
You head directly there and lie in wait for his arrival!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Caught between two foes, he will have nowhere to run!  
Heh... A perfect strategy indeed!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Away we go! To seize our glory and a bounty of riches!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Hold it, foul ruffian!  
You will not escape!  
  
**Bounty：**  
Heh! If you think you can catch me, let's see you try!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Oh, shoot!  
If he turns down that alley, we won't be able to corner him!  
In that case...! Take this!  
  
**Bounty：**  
Whoa?!  
 ...Hahahah. That the best you can do?!  
Ya didn't even scratch me! See you later, loser!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Heheheh... The dimwit took the bait!  
Now I need only wait for our ambush to...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Oh no! I forgot to tell that guy the actual location!  
At this rate, our plan will be...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Grab the fugitive.  
`Tag 3`  
**Bounty：**  
Guahhh!  
Wh-why, you...!  
When the hell did you get here?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Huh...? It actually worked?  
But how...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
No, never mind that. I must hurry and secure the target!  
You there! Keep a tight grip on that villain!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...I am most grateful.  
Thanks to you, a dangerous criminal has been safely apprehended.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Please accept this reward.  
It is a full half of the bounty upon his head.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Tell me, though. How did you know where to hide?  
I was quite sure I failed to tell you the location...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I just used my instincts.  
`Tag 4`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Remarkable... So you understood my thoughts  
without the need for words...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Heheh... Hahaha... Hah hah hah!  
Of course... I see it now! There is no doubt!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
You are my archrival and comrade from that bygone age!  
Sigurd of the Fulgor!  
I never dreamed you too had been reincarnated!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
No, there can be no mistake!  
The way you read my soul's impulses in an instant  
is more than proof enough!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
How could I fail to see it until now?  
But no more! We are together again!  
Just like old times, our names will ring across the land as one!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Our day has come, Sigurd of the Fulgor!  
Isn't that right, Sigurd of the Fulgor?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  My name's not Sigurd.  
`Tag 5`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Nonsense! You alone are Sigurd of the Fulgor!  
Isn't that right, Sigurd of the Fulgor?!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I'm not Sigurd, though...  
`Tag 6`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Th... That cannot be true!  
I see you, Sigurd of the Fulgor!  
It's you, right, Sigurd of the Fulgor?!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  ...It is I, Sigurd of the Fulgor.  
`Tag 7`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Aha! I knew my soul did not lie!  
...Yet your face looks so troubled... Is something wrong?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Of course! You are taken aback by this sudden reunion.  
I completely understand. I could scarcely believe it myself!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
But this is a day for celebration!  
Fate has brought two eternal comrades together once more!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I see what we must do. Sigurd!  
The Order of Gehenna Immortals welcomes you as Vice-Regent!  
I bestow upon you the title of Darkest Knight that you once held!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Um, no thanks.  
**Choice: (9)**  'Tis an honor, my Regent!  
`Tag 8`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Don't be shy, my Zweiritter!  
How could I entrust this role to any other?!  
It is yours alone!  
  
Jump to tag 10  
`Tag 9`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Why the formalities? Are we not comrades-in-arms?!  
  
`Tag 10`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Now this lonely Order has grown its membership to two!  
Let us go forth as one to defeat the Syndicate  
and defend this brave new world!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Now, I must away! Do not forget our secret greeting!  
\"In the depths of Gehenna, a gale arises!\"  
  
**Narration：**  
And with those bizarre words,  
the self-proclaimed \"Hecate of the Gale\" dashed out of sight.
