## Subtitle: In Search of Lost Memories
  
**Narration：**  
While shopping for books, {player} happens across  
the inimitable Annerose von Stechpalm  
with her nose deep in a tome of knowledge.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Hmm, hmm...  
 I see!  
This has brought me one step closer  
to mastery of the Akashic records!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hail, Hecate of the Gale!  
`Tag 1`  
**Stechpalm：**  
S-Sigurd?!  
What are you doing here?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
You came to buy books...?  
R-right, yes... Well, of course.  
That does seem like a sensible reason for visiting a bookstore...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
And me?  
...Ahh—no! You've got it wrong!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I am both a-a-a-all-knowing and omnipotent, as you know!  
All the information these tomes contain  
has been known to me since time immemorial!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
So of course, strictly speaking, I have no need for books...  
No need at all.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...And yet! Even I desire entertainment.  
Yes! I read these not to bolster my knowledge,  
but for the sake of my own amusement! That is all!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Is that... a dictionary?  
`Tag 2`  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Ahh! Oh no!  
I forgot it was a dictionary I was reading...!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Um, no! I can explain! Uhhhh... Listen...!  
Ummm... Ahhh... It's not like that!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I... I know!  
When I was reborn into this world, I lost some of my memories!  
So I'm just reawakening my former knowledge!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Why the funny look?  
Do you not believe my words?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I speak only truth! None of this is even slightly made-up!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I was surprised, but I believe you.  
`Tag 3`  
**Stechpalm：**  
You really believe my words...?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I must confess, claiming to suffer from memory loss  
seemed a stretch, even to me...  
Could there be some reason why you find it plausible?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I've lost my memories too.  
`Tag 4`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Sigurd... Can it be? Even in this world,  
your memories have been taken from you?  
 No wonder, then...  
To an amnesiac, my tale would hardly sound far-fetched...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I see... Then we are comrades from a past life,  
and sufferers of the same affliction too...!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
But fear not!  
You have already recalled the most important thing of all!  
Namely, your identity as Sigurd of the Fulgor!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Thus proving that no memories are truly lost forever!  
What's lost can be found!  
Which means...  
 There is nothing left to fear!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
We seekers of lost memories must stick together.  
If you need to know anything, I will gladly teach you.  
And I will lend you my tomes rich with ancient wisdom!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I know! Though I only just purchased it,  
you may borrow this dictionary for starters!  
Read its contents well, and unravel your forgotten past!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
No, no... No need to thank me.  
Accumulating a base of knowledge is a necessary step  
towards saving this world from the Syndicate's dark plans!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
The day will surely come when your sealed knowledge  
will sway the world's fate.  
Until that day, study all you can to prepare for battle!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Oh, and speaking of knowledge...  
 You should take this also!  
This book records all of our exploits from our past life!  
Naturally, I penned it myself! I call it \"The Gale Chronicles\"!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I provided a few copies to the local bookstore,  
and incredibly, slowly but surely, they are selling!  
Perhaps we are not the only ones plagued by memories of a past world!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Reading these events will surely help you to recall  
who you once were.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
If I am to defeat the Syndicate, I will require your aid.  
I hope you will continue to support me.  
My finest comrade, Sigurd of the Fulgor!  
  
**Narration：**  
From that day forth, the magnanimous Annerose von Stechpalm  
insisted on lending {player} a whole host of strange  
books, including some of her own creation...
