# We're TBBs, TBH
Suzuna mentions that she does model work because she enjoys it, a feeling which Nozomi understands. Realizing how well they can get along, Suzuna declares that they're going to be TBBs, which throws Nozomi off guard.

**Suzuna：**  
How are you so darn cute, Nozomin?  
Idols sure have that special aura about them. ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Pot, meet kettle.  
You're super pretty and stylish.  
No wonder you're wildly popular.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Th-think you're giving me too much credit. Ahaha.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Not at all.  
I'd be willing to argue that there's not a single girl in  
Landsol that doesn't know who you are.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
H-hold the phone!  
You're killing me here, girl!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I'm not in it for the fame.  
I just do it 'cause it's fun.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hehe. Same as me, then.  
I love idols in general, so that makes it even more fun.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh! You totally get me!  
We're on, like, some mega same brain-lengths!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Yeah.  
I can see us getting along real well.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Right?!  
We are *so* gonna be TBBs!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? TBBs?  
Not BFFs?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hahaha!  
You mean like best fan favorites? That's rad.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
U-Uhh. TBBs. Total... best... buds?!  
Well then. First time I've heard that one.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
She's definitely on a whole other level.  
I'm gonna have to work hard to keep up!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so, thanks to her interactions with Suzuna, Nozomi found some new motivation.
