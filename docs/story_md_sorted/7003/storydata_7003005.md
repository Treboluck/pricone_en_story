**Suzuna：**  
*pant*... *pant*  
I can't. I'm done.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Good teamwork there, Suzuna.  
I'm pretty beat myself,  
but at least we managed to defeat that monster.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
And thanks for powering us up, {player}.  
Wait.  
What's that lying over ther—  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Whoa?! Why'd it start shining?!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
What's going on?!  
This is heckin' wild!  
  
**Suzuna & Nozomi：**  
Aaaahhhh!  
  

---  
  
**Nozomi：**  
One, two, three, four—  
  
**Suzuna：**  
One, two, three...  
Oops.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I messed it up again.  
Dancing is like, seriously hard, huh?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Sorry for dragging you down, Nozomin.  
Especially after asking you to help me practice in the first place.  
I think I kinda took this dancing thing too lightly...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I was like, turbo excited when I heard  
we'd be performing together for the Tsubakigaoka Collection.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Then when I told whiz-boy about it he was all like,  
\"I'm friends with Nozomin!\" So I thought it'd be a breeze  
if we could practice together,  
 but this is killing me.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Don't put yourself down like that, Suzuna.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You're not taking it lightly at all.  
If anything, I'm pretty amazed by you.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Your form when walking's always so pretty,  
and your gaze is always on point.  
It's pretty inspiring, all things considered.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
For serious?!  
Woo! Thanks!  
How's an angel like you living on the same planet as us?!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Like, you were totally angel material when whiz-boy first introduced us.  
But now you're like, *hella* angel material!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
N-now that's an oxymoron if I've ever heard one...  
Anyway, let's get this final part down!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
{player}'s helping us out as well,  
so we gotta make sure this performance is a success!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Heck yeah! ♪  
  
**Suzuna：**  
*huff, puff*  
Urgh... What's the deal? I just can't sync up with you...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
The more I think about the choreo,  
the more it throws me off...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
It's about time for us to enter the venue, too.  
What am I gonna do...?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hey, Suzuna. I've got a suggestion.  
How about we make the choreo a bit more simple?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
The less complicated it is, the easier it'll be for us to sync up.  
I'll talk things out with the stage director—  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Nope.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Suzuna?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Thanks, but no thanks.  
I'll go all out, so let's keep the choreo as is.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
It's not just us.  
Our choreographer, outfit designers and everyone else  
all worked their butts off to make sure today goes well.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
No way I'm gonna be the only one slacking off. That'd be pathetic AF.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I'm a professional, so I wanna take this seriously.  
Making excuses and stuff is just lame.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Err...  
Sorry.  
I'm the one dragging us down,  
so I guess I shouldn't talk all high and mighty.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
No, it's fine.  
I'm sorry as well.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm right here with you.  
**Choice: (2)**  Hang in there!  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzuna：**  
Whiz-boy...  
Yeah, thanks.  
Feels like I can pull anything off when you're cheering me on!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Yup. Okay, Suzuna.  
We've still got time until the show, so let's give it one more go!  
It'll definitely go well this time!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Nozomi：**  
Thanks for the support, {player}.  
It means a lot!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
All righty! Nozomin, let's give it one more shot while we've still got time!  
I'mma show you what I'm really made of!

**Nozomi：**  
I hope you're all pumped up,  
everyone!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Whattup, peeps! Let's get this party started!  
  
**Woman：**  
Squeee! How'd you get so good at dancing, Suzuna?!  
You're in perfect sync with Nozomin! I'm wilding out here!  
  
**Man：**  
Ahhhh! Nozomiiin!  
You're so cute!  
  
**Man：**  
Check out that dude over there, too.  
He's swinging those glow sticks like his life depends on it!  
We gotta follow suit!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hehe.  
{player}'s working up even more of a sweat than us. ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
He helped us with our practice without any complaints,  
and now he's cheering us on as hard as he can.  
We really can't thank him enough!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
We were able to practice this hard because we knew he was there for us.  
We knew he wanted to support us.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
He's helped us a whole bunch, hasn't he?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Ahaha. Check the look on his face! ♪  
And he's wilding out, too!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
He doesn't really need to, though.  
I'd be able to pick him out of the audience no matter what.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
There's just something so comforting about knowing that  
whiz-boy is cheering us on. I've been able to focus way  
more after realizing that he's right there for us.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
So thanks, whiz-boy!  
I'mma give it my all!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Man, though. Nozomin really is amazing.  
Her dancing and performance as a whole just scream pro idol.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Wooo! I'm all pumped up now!  
I wanna shine as brightly as she does!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I can't get over how cool Suzuna was back then.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It takes real guts to push through without changing the choreo.  
Would I have been able to do the same in her position?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Either way,  
she taught me how important it is not to give in and compromise.  
  
**Audience：**  
WOOOOOOOOO!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Thanks so much you guys!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Today was super fun!  
  
**Suzuna & Nozomi：**  
See you all again!

**Suzuna：**  
Mmm...  
*yawn*  
Whoops. Guess I fell asleep.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Same here. I had a weird dream, too.  
You and {player} were in it—  
  
**Suzuna：**  
For serious?!  
So did I!  
Whiz-boy was like, wilding out with some glowsticks.  
It was crazy! ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh?  
He was doing the same thing in my dream.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh...  
I get it. That wasn't just a dream.  
It was related to his memories, wasn't it?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
So we did a good job helping out, then?  
Hellaaa!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Seems like it.  
We might need to call it a day, though.  
I'm pretty beat.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Yeah. That's a big mood right there.  
Sorry, whiz-boy...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh? You wanna come back sometime?  
Heck to the yeah!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
How about the three of us come together again,  
then?  
There's definitely more to {player}'s  
memories than just this!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Cool beans.  
I'm always down for helping him out!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Same!  
It's a nice excuse to spend time with him, too...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hm? You say something, girl?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Nope. Not a word. ♪  
But yeah. Let's head home for today.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Sure thing.  
Let's all go on another date  
the next time we've got time off. ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Agreed!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus the trio began their journey home,  
chatting and laughing all the way.
