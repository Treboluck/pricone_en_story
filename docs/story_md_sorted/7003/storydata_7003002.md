**Suzuna：**  
So I had this fashion show a while back, you know?  
Except I felt terrible all day, so it was highkey a nightmare at first.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
But you know what? Seeing everyone's smiles and hearing  
them shout my name just made me forget all about it.  
I was strutting down that catwalk like it was nothing.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, I totally get that!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I actually had a pretty bad fever on the day of one of our concerts,  
but it ended up disappearing the second I made my way onto the stage.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Or so I thought.  
I could barely move after we were done.  
And then I was stuck in bed all day the next day.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Ahaha.  
That's rad! ♪  
We're like two peas in a pod!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh? What's up, whiz-boy?  
You're looking kinda scary...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh.  
We kinda left you out of the conversation, didn't we?  
Sorry about that.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh?  
You think we should take our health more seriously?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ph-phew.  
I thought we'd annoyed you!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But, well... Thanks.  
It's not like other people don't notice,  
but you're the only one that sounds genuinely worried when you say it.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Same here, whiz-boy!  
Thanks a bunch. I feel a lot better now!  
You're always like, super sweet. ♪  
  
**Narration：**  
The two of them couldn't wipe the  
smiles off their faces for a while following that.
