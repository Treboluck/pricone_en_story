# Misogi (Halloween) Episode 2
Following the directions of a mysterious old map and letter, Misogi and {player} get their hands on a mysterious glowing stone. At first it seems like all it does is glow, but it turns out to be an ingredient for a special firecracker that produces a noise like laughter.
  
## Subtitle: A Special Prank
  
**Narration：**  
On a request from Misogi,  
{player} heads out to the Mysterion Woods,  
only to find Misogi herself sitting at the bottom of a pitfall trap.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Mister! You gotta help me!  
I don't think I can get out of here on my own!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Rescue Misogi.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misogi：**  
Thanks for that, mister!  
Huh? I shouldn't fall into my own pitfall traps?  
Oh, please! Of course this isn't a trap *I* made!  
  
**Misogi：**  
It looks pretty old, actually. I didn't notice till it was too late!  
Oh, but look! I found these at the bottom of the hole!  
  
**Misogi：**  
A... letter?  
 And an old map!  
The letter's all faded and I can't really read it,  
but the map's still in good shape!  
  
**Misogi：**  
And there's an \"X\" on it here,  
 so that means treasure!  
This place is... a grave, I guess?  
C'mon, let's check it out!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hmm... We arrived at the grave,  
 but there's nothing here.  
Did you spot anything, mister?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? The \"X\" is a bit further that way?  
Oh, you're right! Let's keep going, then!  
  
**Misogi：**  
There's nothing here either!  
Just a bunch of boring rocks all piled up!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Was the map just showing where they store their gravestone materials?  
That's so booooring!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Wahhh?!  
A monster behind the rocks?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Look out!  
`Tag 2`  
**Misogi：**  
Mister! W-wait for me!  
I'll chase it off with one of my firecrackers!  
Yaaaahhhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Whew...  
Guess the monster ran away!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? It looks like the monster dropped something.  
A glowing... stone?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? Look in the direction the monster ran?  
Whoa! There's even more glowing stones!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Could it be...  
the \"X\" on that map was showing where to find these?  
  
**Misogi：**  
What even is this stone?  
It doesn't look like treasure...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Does the letter say anything about it?  
`Tag 3`  
**Misogi：**  
The letter?  
Hmm... It's hard to make out any words.  
Oh, but I think I can read the address!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hmm...?  
This address... Could it be...?  
  
**Misogi：**  
I knew it!  
It's the shop where I buy all my prank items!  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
What's all this now? Why the ruckus?  
Oh, if it isn't my best little customer!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hey, granny!  
 I found this weird glowing stone in the graveyard,  
but I dunno what it is,  
 so I thought you could have a look!  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
I'm not exactly sure I follow...  
 Hm? What's that, young man?  
This little miss fell into a pit in the forest, found a map and letter,  
and they ultimately led you all the way here to me?  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Well, let's see what you've brought exactly.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Sure! Here they are!  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Now this takes me back!  
This map and letter were written by my own husband.  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
That pitfall you fell into was likely his handiwork.  
When he was young, he'd dig holes here and there  
and bury all kinds of funny things.  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
I'm so sorry if his trap hurt you.  
You're not injured, are you?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh, I'm fine!  
And it was lots of fun, so I don't mind a bit!  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Really?  
 Well, thank you, little miss.  
Now, as for that glowing stone...  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
My husband used to give me one of those as a present every year.  
It's not especially valuable, but when Halloween comes around,  
it gathers magical energy and gives off this glow.  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Once Halloween's over, it's just a pebble.  
Thinking back, he sure did manage to find a cheap gift!  
Still, it's just the kind of thing that makes his eyes sparkle.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Did he give you one this year?  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Oh, no. He's off on a trip, adventuring and gathering rare materials.  
So he hasn't given me a thing.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Really?  
I'll give you this one, then!  
Since I kinda nabbed your letter and map!  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Ahaha! Thank you.  
But I've received so many of them already,  
so I think you should be the one to keep it.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Honestly, I don't really care about rocks that just glow.  
Doesn't seem much use for pranks...  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Ahahah! Well, I should've known!  
But in fact, I think that stone might be exactly what you need.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh?! How d'you mean?!  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Can I borrow that firecracker on your belt?  
And pass me the glowing stone, too.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hmm?  
 OK, sure!  
Here you go, granny!  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Wait here just a minute.  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
There, all done.  
Here's your firecracker back, little miss.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hmm?  
It doesn't look any different from before.  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Try setting it off.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ooh, OK!  
Here goes... Boom!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Wha—?!  
Ahahah! What the heck?! That's so funny!  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Wahahahah!  
You laugh just like my husband, little miss.  
I knew this was worth the trouble.  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
That glowing stone, as it happens,  
is a vital ingredient in making firecrackers that sound like laughter.  
Though they only work for as long as the stone still glows.  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
I've had enough fun with them thanks to my husband,  
so now it's your turn, little miss.  
You can ask this young man to give you one every year.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'm looking forward to next year already.  
**Choice: (5)**  Let's collect them together every year!  
`Tag 4`  
**Misogi：**  
Yeah, I can hardly wait!  
Oh, but if I stick together with you all year, it'll go by in a flash!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Misogi：**  
Every year? For real?!  
That's a promise! No backsies, you hear?!  
You'll be in big trouble if you ever break it!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Misogi：**  
Man, a present from you every year, huh?  
I so can't wait!  
  
**Narration：**  
And as Misogi looked excitedly to the future ahead,  
{player} and the old lady watched over her happily.
