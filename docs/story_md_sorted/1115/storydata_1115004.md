**Narration：**  
As decorations spring to life and light up the evening city,  
{player} and Christina's festive date  
begins to draw to a close.  
  
**Christina：**  
Night already?  
This is when the real date begins!  
  
**Christina：**  
Or so I'd be inclined to say, but...  
...  
I suppose we've had enough fun for one day.  
I'm beginning to understand what the common folk see in this season.  
  
**Christina：**  
Young lad, you have my thanks.  
  
**Christina：**  
...Why do you look so surprised?  
Is it so strange for me to express genuine gratitude?  
I'd be happy to speak with my sword instead, if you prefer!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hah... I'm just joking. ☆  
  
**Christina：**  
I'm glad I came to you today.  
I truly mean that.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Why did you choose me?  
`Tag 1`  
**Christina：**  
Dear me! You ask that *now?*  
...Well, let's see.  
  
**Christina：**  
I could just brush it off as a fickle whim,  
but that would be no fun.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hm? What's this light?  
The festive decorations?  
No, it's more like...

**Host：**  
This new product showcase is almost over, folks!  
For our final item, let's hand it over to a very special guest!  
  
**Host：**  
Everyone, please give a warm welcome  
to the one and only world-renowned—  
  
**Christina：**  
I can announce my own entrance, thank you.  
I'm sure many of you know me,  
but I'll introduce myself regardless.  
  
**Christina：**  
My name is Christina Morgan.  
I'm glad to have the privilege to address you all today.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm. I dropped by this showcase event on a whim, but...  
As expected, the audience seems confused.  
  
**Christina：**  
But of course. It's unheard-of for the CEO herself  
to appear at a local shopping mall event.  
Even my subordinates were baffled when I added it to my schedule.  
  
**Christina：**  
Of course, my real aim was to see if I could catch hold of Akira,  
but that part didn't work out...  
  
**Christina：**  
I'd hoped to spend the festive season with an old friend,  
but now my schedule is full of holes!  
Making *me* waste an entire day—she has a lot to answer for!  
  
**Christina：**  
Now, about this new product...  
...  
Hm?  
  
**Christina：**  
That boy over there looks familiar somehow.  
Isn't he the one I encountered at Akira's stall...?  
  
**Christina：**  
Aha—our eyes met.  
Did he notice me watching him?  
 He's sharper than I expected.  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh...? Is he just going to leave?  
...  
Dear me, how cold. I thought we were acquaintances.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm.  
He seemed to be in a hurry... A prior engagement, perhaps?  
  
**Host：**  
U-umm... Miss Christina?  
  
**Christina：**  
Hm? Oh, I'm sorry.  
Well then, where was I...?  
  
**Clerk：**  
Come on in!  
  
**Clerk：**  
Oh, our favorite regular! I know what you're after.  
It's right over on that shelf!  
  
**Clerk：**  
Man, you really are hardcore.  
On this of all launch days... Wait, wha—?  
  
**Christina：**  
Well, well. The latest brand-new fighting game.  
Are you buying this, lad?  
  
**Christina：**  
Buying video games on the most amorous day of the year...  
That's quite the life you lead.  
  
**Christina：**  
...Hm? What's wrong?  
You should at least remember to blink.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  W-weren't you just up on stage?  
`Tag 2`  
**Christina：**  
Yes, I already said my spiel! ♪  
There weren't as many TV cameras or reporters as I'm used to,  
but this should cause a buzz in its own way.  
  
**Christina：**  
Still, I'm hurt, young lad.  
Didn't you see me catch your eye?  
You could have at least given a little wave.  
  
**Christina：**  
Or... what?  
Are you saying you didn't remember me?  
You wouldn't forget such a glamorous beauty, would you?  
  
**Christina：**  
We met at Akira's crepe stall, did we not?  
Well, if you *have* forgotten, I'll remind you.  
  
**Christina：**  
My name is Christina Morgan.  
I serve as the CEO of a certain corporation.  
I'm an old associate and friend of Akira's.  
  
**Christina：**  
Now, since we're fully introduced, shall we proceed?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Where to?  
`Tag 3`  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah! ☆  
Well, don't let me interrupt you.  
Go and buy what you came for first! ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
I'm coming in!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah, wait. It's bad manners to wear shoes indoors in this country.  
  
**Christina：**  
The residences here are all so very compact.  
Still, I feel a strange sense of comfort, akin to nostalgia.  
  
**Christina：**  
Young lad? Why are you standing agape?  
Don't you serve guests tea in this household?  
...is what I might say, if I were less magnanimous!  
  
**Christina：**  
Now, which room is yours?  
Don't dawdle—show me the way!  
My time is a precious thing!  
  
**Christina：**  
So this is your room.  
I suppose I'd call it... minimalist in style.  
  
**Christina：**  
But you do keep it neat and tidy. Very good.  
I'd expect more of a mess from a young lad your age.  
Now, I suppose I'll take a seat on the bed.  
  
**Christina：**  
Well then!  
...Shall we begin?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Begin what?  
`Tag 4`  
**Christina：**  
What do you think?  
I came all the way to your bedroom.  
Surely that can only mean one thing!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  G-go easy on me...  
`Tag 5`  
**Christina：**  
Oh, I won't hear any of that.  
If you're a man, you must give your all to ensure my enjoyment!  
  
**Christina：**  
Now, let's prepare!  
One console, and... two controllers should suffice!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hm? Why the sudden widening of eyes?  
You strange lad.

**Christina：**  
...Another victory for me.  
  
**Christina：**  
That makes seventeen in a row.  
You really are hopeless, aren't you?  
  
**Christina：**  
I thought a friend of Akira's might pose a challenge,  
but I suppose you're not ready to thrill me yet.  
  
**Christina：**  
Still... once you saw you were outmatched,  
you began scoping me out with defensive play.  
That was rather wise.  
  
**Christina：**  
You have the ability to react to pressure.  
And you show surprising flair when cornered.  
  
**Christina：**  
There's promise in you.  
A diamond in the rough, perhaps.  
  
**Christina：**  
So listen, young lad!  
  
![111500402.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/111500402.webp)  
**Christina：**  
How would you like to join the Round Table?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Wait, isn't that...  
`Tag 6`  
**Christina：**  
As a gamer, you must know the name.  
A group of pros who enter tournaments around the world.  
  
**Christina：**  
As it happens, I'm the founder of that group.  
I gather skilled players together  
to take on a wide variety of gaming challenges.  
  
**Christina：**  
And it's been more fruitful than I expected.  
I began it on little more than a whim,  
but this side hobby has begun to pay dividends.  
  
**Christina：**  
Occasionally, I even join the tournaments myself.  
I think we make a fine team.

`image display end`  
**Christina：**  
So tell me, lad.  
Will you allow me to scout you?  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot to specify payment.  
Let's see, how does...  
 this contract suit you?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I'm having trouble counting all those zeroes...  
`Tag 7`  
**Christina：**  
How about the currency?  
Dollars? Euros? Please, take your pick.  
  
**Christina：**  
I'm sure these are better conditions  
than that crepe stall could provide.  
  
**Christina：**  
...Hmm?  
Why would I go this far, you ask?  
  
**Christina：**  
Let's see...  
 To be perfectly frank...  
{player}—I'm interested in you.  
  
**Christina：**  
If Akira keeps you close, you must hold some hidden significance.  
I'm sure she'll give me an entertaining reaction if I snatch you away.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah, and one other thing.  
  
**Christina：**  
Today is a day for giving, is it not?  
  
**Christina：**  
Since you seemed to have nothing but games for company,  
I thought I'd offer you a festive gift! ☆  
  
**Christina：**  
Now, speak your answer forthwith—  
 Oh, is that my phone?  
The emergency line, no less... Wait right there, lad.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hello? It's me.  
...  
Wait—Akira?  
  
**Christina：**  
It's been too long!  
I came looking for you today, you know!  
...  
Hmm? Don't interfere with the boy?  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmph. No secrets from you, eh?  
 But that's for him to decide, not me.  
I'm terribly sorry, but I never hold back! ♪  
I've made a generous offer, so I'm afraid he's sure to—  
 Huh?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Perhaps you'll \"have fun\"... with the Round Table's members?!  
Wait, Akira! Are you planning to demolish my Round Table?!  
What kind of childish tantrum is this?!  
  
**Christina：**  
All right, all right!  
I'll put this offer on hold! I'll leave for now!  
Hm? \"Happy holidays\"?  
 Yes... Happy holidays.  
  
**Christina：**  
...*sigh*  
It seems I stepped on the tiger's tail.  
  
**Christina：**  
I'm sorry, lad.  
We'll have to put this opportunity on hold.  
  
**Christina：**  
Still, how intriguing.  
To invite such passion from Akira...  
I'm growing even more interested in you, lad.  
  
**Christina：**  
Let's meet again.  
I very much enjoyed our little match!  
  
**Christina：**  
Well then, happy holidays! ☆  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hmm... Welcome back.  
Bet that wore you out, huh?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Christina Morgan... aka \"Regina Geas.\"  
It can't be easy to have caught such a big shot's attention.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I didn't see any signs of overt scheming from her this time,  
but with a woman like that, you can never be too sure.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The Seven Crowns operate on a different level from normal folk.  
Stay alert, and don't let her catch you off guard.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That said... inviting a bombshell like her into your own bedroom?  
Do you even *have* any guard for her to catch you off?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Honestly, sometimes I swear...  
Well, I guess that's who you've always been.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'll keep a watchful eye over you,  
so I suppose it's best if you just stay true to yourself.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, bye-b...  
 Wait, no.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Happy holidays! ♪

**Christina：**  
Oh...?  
  
**Christina：**  
I dozed off... No, it's more like my consciousness was cut off.  
Though I do seem to be lying down...  
  
**Christina：**  
Which means I was entirely defenseless. How did this happen?  
And what's this springy surface beneath my head?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  You awake now?  
`Tag 8`  
**Christina：**  
Young lad...?  
Oh... I seem to be... resting upon your lap?  
  
**Christina：**  
Hah... Ahahaha! ☆  
I've never awoken on a man's lap before!  
  
**Christina：**  
You never cease to entertain, do you, lad? ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
Now, I seem to recall  
you were asking just now why I chose you, yes?  
  
**Christina：**  
It was just a whim... or so I had been telling myself.  
But I'll revise that assessment.  
  
**Christina：**  
Tedium isn't so bad when I'm with you.  
That's the real reason! ♪  
  
**Narration：**  
And, still resting her head upon {player}'s lap,  
Christina enjoyed an empty moment for once in her life.
