# Great Journey
Uzuki, Rin and Mio awaken in their dressing room. As they reminisce about the dream they shared, they remember what really matters to them as idols. Looking over their setlist, they notice that the song they received in their dream has been added to it, and laugh happily together.
  
## Subtitle: Great Journey
  
**Narration：**  
Through the power of communication magic,  
the \"New Generations\" girls' concert is broadcast to towns  
across the land, filling the continent with passionate enthusiasm.  
  
**Narration：**  
As the crowds cheer,  
the three young Cinderellas disappear into a brightly glowing light.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...And they're gone.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Yes, they have left this world. Mr. Piña Colata also.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Uh-huh...  
Well, if they made it home, isn't that fine?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hey!  
Can't you let yourself get a bit emotional, Karyl?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, I mean...  
I can't deny it'll be a bit lonely without them around.  
But more importantly...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Is it just me, or was this job super profitable?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh?  
Was it really?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I mean, look!  
All the supplies they've left behind, and the concert proceeds...  
It's all ours now, right?! It must be!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl... While I hate to disappoint,  
the girls of \"New Generations\"  
left us with clear instructions for how to use those proceeds.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We already handed them over  
as funds for the next idol audition's prize money  
and for rebuilding Musa!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Whaaaaaa?!  
We went to all this trouble, and I made a huge fool of myself...  
If we can't make a profit, what was any of it even for?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This Sound Record of the \"New Generations\" girls' singing  
is a pretty precious treasure if you ask me! ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Hmm.  
 Miss Karyl... If you desire the prize money,  
you could receive it by prevailing in the next idol audition.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Whaaa?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, good idea! ♪  
Now, Karyl, if you'd feel a bit too lonely performing alone...  
We'd be happy to form a unit together with you! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
\"Kyaru-kyaru~n! ☆\" ...is, I believe, the phrase.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm not doing that, dummies!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
...Zzz.... ...Zzz...  
  
**Mio：**  
...Mnhh... nnhhh...  
  
**Rin：**  
...U... unhhh...?

**Rin：**  
Ah...  
  
**Mio：**  
H... huh?  
This is... our dressing room?  
  
**Rin：**  
We're in... our uniforms...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Piña Colata... isn't moving...  
And Ueki-chan's... nice and small...?  
  
**Mio：**  
...Shimamu?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Ahh!  
Umm...  
I think I had a bit of a funny dream...  
  
**Rin：**  
A dream?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
We were in this fantasy world...  
Adventuring, eating food, and performing concerts...  
  
**Mio：**  
Huh?!  
You too, Shimamu?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Both of you too?  
  
**Concert Staff：**  
Members of \"New Generations\"!  
Please get ready for the performance!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Ahhh! Of course!  
Our concert is about to start, isn't it?!  
  
**Rin：**  
...Geez.  
Falling asleep at a time like this...  
  
**Mio：**  
I shouldn't have suggested playing that free game we were given  
to relax before the event!  
  
**Concert Staff：**  
Oh—  
it looks like your producer  
was hooked on a VR game in the next room, too!  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh? Was he really...?  
  
![503600502.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/503600502.webp)  
**Mio：**  
Ahaha...  
It'd be funny if he dozed off and had a weird dream too!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Still... It was a bit odd, but it was such a curious dream...  
  
**Mio：**  
Yeah... it was.  
The excitement of standing before a crowd for the first time...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
The enjoyment of working together to improve...  
  
**Rin：**  
It was like... going back to our roots.  
Reminds me how I felt starting out.  
  
**Mio：**  
Yeah! ♪  
...It's a shame that great new song  
turned out to be a dream, though...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
...Huh?  
L-look over here, you guys!  
There's a new song included on our setlist for today...  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh?!  
Could... this really be...?!  
  
**Mio：**  
It's the song they gave us  
for winning the big audition in the dream!  
  
**Rin：**  
But what's it doing here...?  
  
**Mio：**  
I thought we were dreaming, but...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Sometimes dreams can become more than just dreams! ♪
