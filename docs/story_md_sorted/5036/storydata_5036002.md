# Cat Strike!
As Uzuki and friends move to rescue the captives from Ueki-chan, Karyl reappears, seemingly brainwashed into an idol, and attacks them with the power of song. Uzuki and friends fight back by drowning out Karyl's singing with their own, and emerge victorious.
  
## Subtitle: Cat Strike!
  
**Narration：**  
In order to rescue the captive girls,  
the group ventures closer to Ueki-chan.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Musa Town... It was so bustling and happy not long ago...  
  
**Mio：**  
Now there's not a soul to be seen, huh?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
There's no helping that.  
With Ueki-chan looming ominously over the whole town...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Our present goal  
should be to rescue the unfortunate souls  
trapped within Ueki-chan's strange body...  
  
**Rin：**  
But the problem is that pollen.  
The sneezing it causes is bad enough,  
but it also seems to have some kind of magic.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Cloth masks don't seem to block it,  
and breathing too much of it makes me feel all woozy.  
It's so frustrating!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yet it seems firing projectiles from a safe distance will achieve little.  
Its outer layer is more hardy than it appears.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's a real shame that Karyl, our best magic attacker,  
got captured first of all...  
  
**Rin：**  
But pelting that thing with magic  
would risk harming the people inside, so it's not ideal either...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm... How problematic.  
If we cannot approach it and we cannot carelessly damage it...  
what else remains for us to attempt?  
  
**Piña Colata：**  
Pinyaaa...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hmmm...  
`Tag 1`  
**Mio：**  
What if we tried singing at it instead?!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Oh—yes, I see!  
Before, it was our singing that triggered a reaction from Ueki-chan!  
  
**Rin：**  
Hold on, Mio, Uzuki.  
If our singing makes that thing grow even bigger,  
we'll just end up in an worse spot.  
  
**Mio：**  
Ahah... Yeah, of course...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Eheheh...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No...  
 Nope!  
I think that might be a great idea! ☆  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh?  
  
**Mio：**  
Peccy-o?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If singing to Ueki-chan  
really does make it grow bigger...  
Let's make it shoot up into the sky!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Huuuuhhhh?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Its body's really thin, and the flower makes it look top-heavy.  
So if it grows a lot taller...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
...Oh!  
It might lose its balance...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes!  
Ka-thump! ☆  
I'm sure it'll come crashing right down!  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh...?!  
Are you sure that will really work?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I can appreciate your reservations, Miss Rin...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
But it sounds like it might be fun! ♪  
  
**Mio：**  
Yep, yep!  
Standing around will get us nowhere, so let's give it a try!  
  
**Rin：**  
...*sigh*...  
Oh, all right.  
If we're doing this, I won't hold back.  
  
**Mio：**  
That's our Shiburin! ♪  
Well then, start the mus—  
  
**???：**  
Oh nyo you doooooon't!  
  
**Mio：**  
Huh?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This voice is...!  
  
**???：**  
Nyobody wants to hear your poor excuse for singing!  
  
**???：**  
Yeah! You tell 'em!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Huhhhh?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...!  
Everyone, up there!  
Standing close to Ueki-chan's mouth!

An idol...? You too?

Oh, but Karyl!  
I know you're a cat beastgirl,

**Mio：**  
Yeah! That's super old hat, Karyl-Karyl!  
You sound like a tryhard!

Wh-what's going on?!

It makes me feel all funny!

Karyl and her group's voices are causing a shockwave of pressure...!

What's he telling us, {player}?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  The song and the pollen... are working together?  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
The magic in the pollen resonates with the singing,  
causing it to assault us with greater force?

Karyl! Please stop this!  
Why would you want to attack us?!

**Kokkoro：**  
Look up there, everyone. Upon Miss Karyl's...  
No, upon the heads of all three members of Prosperity Cats  
is a smaller version of Ueki-chan!  
  
**Mio：**  
Ah...! You're right!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Then the reason why Karyl's acting so strangely...  
And why she keeps attacking us...  
  
**Rin：**  
It's all because they're being controlled by Ueki-chan?  
  
**Mio：**  
That's it! If she was still herself,  
there's no way Karyl-Karyl would attack her own friends!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Ummm...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Uhhh...  
`Tag 3`

W-well, for the moment...  
whatever the cause, we have to change Karyl back somehow!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If she is attacking us with song...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
We could try singing our own song to cancel out hers!  
  
**Mio：**  
Oh, yeah. We were planning to try singing anyway.  
Let's give it a go!

So this is a battle of voices, or so it would seem.
