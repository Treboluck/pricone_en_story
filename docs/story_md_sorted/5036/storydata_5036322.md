**Rin：**  
Whew.  
Ueki-chan doesn't look ready to calm down yet.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
This means our true idol hearts  
aren't managing to fulfill Ueki-chan's wishes yet, doesn't it?!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Come on, Rin! Mio!  
 We have to try even harder!  
  
**Mio：**  
I'm with you, Shimamu!  
  
**Rin：**  
Yeah. I want to see this through until Ueki-chan accepts us.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Right! Let's face Ueki-chan head-on,  
and prove what \"New Generations\" can do!
