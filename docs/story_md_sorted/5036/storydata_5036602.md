Huh? Koro, what're you looking at?  
Oh... that map we made of our adventure with \"New Generations.\"  
Are those girls doing well, I wonder?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, it was a wonderful adventure. When I look at this map,  
I feel my memories of our time with \"New Generations\"  
coming back to me as clear as day.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It really was so much fun! I hope we meet them again someday!  
...Oh, I know—you should take care of this!  
Keep this record of our memories nice and safe, OK? ♪
