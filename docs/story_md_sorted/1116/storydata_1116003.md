**Narration：**  
Nozomi and {player} are strolling through the Landosol  
streets bustling with holiday crowds.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hey, look. A toy shop!  
Even though I'm all grown up,  
seeing so many toys on display like that still gets me excited.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh! They're selling cakes over there! They look amazing!  
Just once, I'd love to eat an entire one all by myself.  
Well, someone would definitely stop me.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You sure seem to be having fun.  
`Tag 1`  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? Y-you think so?  
Eheheh...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Urgh, I think I'm getting a little overexcited.  
  
But I can't help it, because I'm on a date with {player}.  
It's impossible for me to calm down.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But I want this date to be as romantic as possible,  
so I should restrain myself a little. Deep breaths. Deep breaths.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Anyway, let's go find something warm to drink.  
Look, there are a ton of stores over yonder.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh! There's a cafe over there!  
But so many of those other shops look great too. I just can't decide.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ah! Hey, hey! Look at that!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It looks like some kind of event from a famous confectioner.  
I wonder if they're putting on a show to promote their products.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It's the perfect day to sell sweets, right?  
It seems interesting.  
Let's go take a look.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, I've worked with that event planner many times.  
I wonder if she's managing this show.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Do you mind if I go and say hello?  
Maybe she'll get us some sweets.  
Their pastries are delicious. ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hello there! How have you been?  
  
**Event Manager：**  
Huh? N-Nozomi?  
What are you doing here?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I just happened to see you, so I thought I'd come and say...  
Wait, are you okay? You look a little pale.  
  
**Event Manager：**  
Yeah, I'm fine...  
Well, actually, I'm far from it.  
Hey, is there any chance you could get on stage for me?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Event Manager：**  
The truth is, the idol who was supposed to perform today  
has suddenly fallen ill and can't make it. I just found out.  
  
**Event Manager：**  
I've tried getting a stand-in, but I can't get hold of anyone because  
they're all out of town... I know it's a big ask, but I'm begging you.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I-it's a bit sudden...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I bet a lot of fans are coming out to see that girl.  
They're bound to be disappointed if they hear she's not coming.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Carmina is an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting guild, and we do what  
we do for the sake of the people.  
So I can't just ignore a plea for help...  
If there's something I can do, I want to lend my strength.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But it doesn't matter how much I trust this event manager,  
I can't just take on random gigs without running them past Producer first.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Besides, I feel bad for {player},  
who's spending his valuable time on me.  
...It pains me to do so, but this time I'll have to refuse.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You look torn.  
`Tag 2`  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? No, not particularly.  
I can't just waltz out there  
because someone told me to.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Get out there.  
`Tag 3`  
**Nozomi：**  
!  
...*sigh* I really envy that about you.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You're able to choose the right path without hesitating.  
I feel silly now for even worrying about it.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Um, do you want to connect to my producer  using communication magic?  
  
**Event Manager：**  
Oh! Yes! Hold on a moment!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hello? Producer?  
It's me, Nozomi.  
I have a question...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? Get out there? That was fast...  
No, it's no problem. I can do this!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Whew...  
I got my producer's permission. Let's go!  
  
**Event Manager：**  
Oh...! Thank you ever so much!  
We don't have much time. I need to brief you ASAP.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
All right, {player}, I'm taking the stage!  
Make sure you're in the audience!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Good afternoon, everyone!  
Are you enjoying the holidays?!  
  
**Audience：**  
Wooooowww!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I'm here as a surprise guest for today's publicity event.  
I was asked to perform for you,  
so I'm going to sing you all a song!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
To be honest, I'm a little nervous  
to be singing in a place like this  
in front of a new audience...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But thanks to these new sweets,  
I'm totally bursting with energy!  
  
**Audience：**  
Yeahhhh!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It's rumored that eating one of these sweets will give you enough energy  
to run to the horizon and back.  
So let's stuff our faces, and enjoy the holidays to the fullest!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
All right, I have another song for you.  
  
**Audience Member 1：**  
Wow! Carmina's Nozomin  
is so darn cute! I'm in love!  
  
**Audience Member 2：**  
Right?! When I heard my fav wouldn't be here,  
I was totally bummed. But we're actually really lucky!  
I think I'm becoming a fan. Nozomin!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Thank goodness! The people in the audience look like they're having fun  
even though they're not my fans.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I was worried about how it would turn out,  
but it looks like it'll be smooth sailing from here on out.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
The fact that I could handle such a sudden situation  
proves that I'm one step closer to becoming a top idol!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But the number of customers is gradually increasing.  
...I wonder if it's because I'm performing.  
Which is great, but aren't there too many people here now?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wait, where did {player} go?  
He was watching from right there until just a minute ago...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ah! There he is!  
He was engulfed by the crowd and taken all the way to the back...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wh-what should I do...? The more the crowd rushes forward,  
the more he gets swallowed up.  
Ahh! Ahhh!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
*pant* *pant*... He's not here.  
Where the heck did {player} go?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
There's no way I can find him in this crowd...  
We finally get to go on a date, and this is how it ends?  
We haven't done anything yet. And I haven't even given him his present...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
No... I don't want that!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I won't let it end like this! This isn't the time to be wishy-washy.  
I'm not going to stop until I find him! Idols don't give up so easily!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
All right, I can't just run around aimlessly.  
I need to think carefully. Where would {player} be?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
A memorable place for {player} and me...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
That's it!  
He's definitely waiting for me there!

**Nozomi：**  
*huff, puff* *pant*... *pant*  
I finally found you, {player}!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Thank goodness... I looked all over the place, but couldn't spot you anywhere.  
I was worried that I'd never see you again...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But I thought that maybe here,  
under this tree where we both worked so hard on that event,  
we could meet again. That's why I came.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I thought so too.  
**Choice: (5)**  Sorry I got lost...  
`Tag 4`  
**Nozomi：**  
You did?  
I-it's like we know what each other is thinking.  
It's a little embarrassing, huh?  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Nozomi：**  
It's not your fault.  
Besides, you look like you were running all over the place too.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You're all sweaty, and your clothes are a mess.  
...Thank you.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Nozomi：**  
But to think that after searching high and low for each other,  
we'd be reunited under this tree. It's too good to be true, don't you think?  
Apparently, even the gods are partial to cheesy clichés.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But I don't hate tropes like that.  
Fateful, romantic turns of events  
are what the holidays are all about!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so,  
Nozomi chuckled to herself.
