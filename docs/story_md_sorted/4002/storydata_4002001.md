**Narration：**  
It was just another day.  
{player} and the other members of the Gourmet Guild  
were enjoying a stroll around Landosol.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*groan*  
I'm hungry... Starving...  
  
**Karyl：**  
............  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm wasting away! So hungry...  
Poor Pecorine is way beyond a little peckish...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, shut your pie hole!  
Quit your bellyaching before I really lose my temper!  
I'm hungry, too. Why do you think I'm so ticked off?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl, even when your belly's full,  
you're always a prickly pear.  
You act like a petty prima donna princess.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Petty prima donna princess?! Hunger's no excuse  
for calling me names.  
I think what you meant to say was  
pretty, precious, pleasant princess, right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Princesses aren't necessarily pleasant people.  
Anyways, please stop shouting at me.  
It's only gonna make you hungrier.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Good point.  
We've had zero luck today  
finding anywhere decent to eat.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm ready to just pick a random restaurant  
and blow off some steam while I'm stuffing my face.  
  
**Karyl：**  
So... Huh?  
Hey, Pecorine.  
Where'd {player} and Koro go?  
  
**Karyl：**  
They're not around here.  
Oh, no.  
Did we get separated?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wait, what?  
That's crazy bad!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Kokkoro!  
{player}!  
Where did you go? Say something if you can hear me!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm?  
Hey, I think  
I heard {player}'s voice over there!  
  
**Karyl：**  
C'mon, Pecorine.  
I've got a bad feeling about this.  
  

---  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine!  
Miss Karyl!  
We're over here!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ah! There you are!  
Shame on you two, running off on us!  
We were getting worried!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
M-my apologies.  
However, we have no idea how we ended up here, either.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We were just walking as usual.  
Then suddenly, before we knew what had happened,  
we found ourselves in this bizarre place.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?  
Where the heck are we?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wow, this place is spacious.  
Was there always an extravagant place like this in Landosol?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm.  
It feels as if we have wandered into an alternate dimension.  
What on Astrum is this place?  
  
**???：**  
This is the *Battle Arena*.  
A place where those blessed by the sun and stars  
may cross dimensions, so that they may then cross swords.  
  
**Karyl：**  
*gasp*  
Who are you?!  
  
**???：**  
I beg your pardon.  
Manners dictate I introduce myself first.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
I am Minerβ.  
I am the administrator of the Battle Arena.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Mi-Miner... Veta?  
  
**Minerβ：**  
Yes.  
My proper title is quite a bit longer,  
so for convenience, that is how I shall refer to myself.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
At any rate, don't concern yourselves with me.  
I am little more than a puppet with no soul of her own.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
I merely follow my programming  
and dutifully perform my functions.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
Moving on.  
The fact that you all find yourselves here  
means that you are qualified to enter the arena.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
If you are so inclined,  
why not consider participating in the *Arena Battles* held here?  
  
**Karyl：**  
A-Arena battles?  
What're you talking about?  
It's against the law to hold an unauthorized event!  
  
**Minerβ：**  
I assure you we have permission.  
Here, these official documents have been stamped with the royal seal.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Lemme see.  
She's right. All the paperwork's in order.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm? You're right.  
The king who gave permission is from way  
in the past... He must be a really, really distant ancestor.  
I'm not even familiar with him.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Sorry?  
Ancestor?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, uhh. It's nothing.  
Anyway, going back to these Arena Battles.  
I think we should participate.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It seems like the kinda thing  
where you get fabulous prizes just for entering.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The documents don't actually list any of the prizes, though.  
I wonder what they could be.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Personally, I'd love a big, fancy fruit platter,  
or a year's supply of rice!  
  
**Minerβ：**  
If that is what you wish, I shall arrange for it.  
I am what  
remains of a system that was designed to grant wishes. I can  
fulfill many of your desires.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
And if you think this all sounds too good to be true,  
perhaps it would help to think of it as a job?  
  
**Minerβ：**  
In exchange for performing labor,  
you'll be paid for your hard work.  
Something along those lines.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
Participation is always voluntary.  
I sincerely hope you will take part if the mood strikes you.  
I assure you, you have nothing to lose.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
I will always be here at the Battle Arena,  
eagerly waiting for you to join the fray.
