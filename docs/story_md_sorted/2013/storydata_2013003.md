**Narration：**  
As the people of Landosol struggle to cope with the chaos around them,  
Muimi and Christina arrive at the royal palace.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hold up...  
What the heck happened here?  
  
**Muimi：**  
The palace is in ruins!  
It's a huge pile of rubble down there!  
  
**Christina：**  
And what remains of the building  
seems to be submerged in that awful black sludge.  
  
**Christina：**  
I'd rather not swim through such disgusting filth,  
and I see no footholds, so we can't get any closer.  
  
**Muimi：**  
B-but...! {player} and the others went in there, right?  
They might be drowning in that black stuff right now!  
We've gotta get them outta there!  
  
**Christina：**  
I think I'll pass on that...  
I would hate to dirty my clothes.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Urgh...  
 You never change, do you?!  
Well, fine then! I'll go on my own!  
  
**Christina：**  
Now, now... Nobody likes a hothead.  
...Draw your weapon, Novem. We have a situation.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Huh?  
Wh-what is it now?  
  
**Christina：**  
Look up. An individual we know all too well  
is floating above us like some manner of god.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hmm...?  
Guehh! Isn't that...?!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Oh my.  
Both of you are still alive, are you?  
  
**Christina：**  
Indeed I am!  
 If a treasure like myself were to be lost,  
the common folk would weep!  
So although it pains me, I must continue this tedious existence!  
  
**Christina：**  
…\"Your Majesty.\"  
Tell me one thing. What is your real objective?  
  
**Christina：**  
If it seems more entertaining...  
I may yet be convinced to remain your ally when no other would.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
A touching offer indeed... But I'm sorry, Chris.  
You wouldn't understand right now if I told you,  
and I've had more than enough of relying on others at this point.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
From now on, I work alone, relying on nobody but myself.  
  
**Christina：**  
A cruel rejection? How sad.  
I was fairly serious about my offer...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Mana! I don't know what you're plotting this time,  
but I won't let you get away with it!  
  
**Muimi：**  
You just wait! I'll put an end to your evil plans,  
and return the world to how it should be!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Haha... Ahaha! I see you never change, either.  
Sweet little Novem, poor little Novem.  
You never were cut out to be the hero.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Oblivious to your own worth, seeing and hearing nothing,  
you stumble through life, achieving nothing but failure.  
And yet through it all, you never give up and you never learn.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
You really are beyond saving.  
Can't you do anything without Octo by your side?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Nghhh...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Still, I suppose every story needs a merry trickster.  
As long as you don't get in the way of the heroes and villains,  
I suppose I can leave you alive for now.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
It's not much fun to perform to an empty theater.  
You won't enjoy it, but I'll let you watch to the very end.  
You can be the sole witness  
 to the story we weave.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Huh? Wh-what d'you mean?  
I don't get a single word you're saying!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
No, I'm sure you don't.  
But no matter. I'm only talking to myself.  
Haha... Perhaps I've grown so tired, my composure is slipping...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Well then.  
I'm in a hurry, so I should be going.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hold it.  
You think I'd just let you leave?  
  
**Christina：**  
I served you faithfully, with ardent love and devotion,  
only to be cast aside.  
You tried to kill me like an insect,  
 and for that you must pay.  
  
**Christina：**  
I truly did love you once, so I won't take your life.  
But a limb or two is the least I can ask for!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Oh, how scary.  
But I'm afraid  
 I don't have time to play with you.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
You're a fellow Crown,  
so those huge reserves of power do make you a tempting meal...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
But I'm sure you'd resist if I tried to consume you.  
I would hate to waste my energy,  
so I'll seek out some more palatable morsels.  
  
**Christina：**  
\"Morsels\"? "Consume"?  
What are you saying?  
It's time you gave some proper explanations!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Why should I do that?  
Well, if you're so keen to get in my way...  
I suppose I could mutilate you to within an inch of your life.  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh?  
 You'd actually leave me alive?  
How very kind.  
  
**Christina：**  
But I've been almost killed by you once before,  
so I don't see why I should trust those words.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Oh, really?  
 That's fine by me.  
I was getting bored with being trusted without question.  
Ah, the struggles of a god...  
 Say, Chris, do you understand how I feel?  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm? What are you saying?  
Are you thinking straight, \"Majesty\"?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Christina!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hm? What now, Novem? Try to stay focused.  
Take your eyes off Her Majesty, and she'll slaughter you in an instant.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah, but... Look down there!  
That... that thing!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm?  
Oh...! Something is emerging from the sludge that infests the castle!  
But what, exactly? It looks like a black cube...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Time may be of the essence.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hey! Wait, Mana!  
 Where are you going?!  
We're not done here! Don't you dare run!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Run, me?  
 Silly girl. I'm allowing *you* to escape.  
Both of you were useful to me in a previous life,  
so as thanks, I'll let you live just this once.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Bye-bye now.  
Perhaps we'll meet again someday.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Ahhh! Hey! Stop!  
You can't just say your spiel and vanish! Why are you always like this?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Fall back, Novem!  
The black cube is moving in our direction!  
We don't want to be struck by that thing head-on!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Urgh...  
 What the heck is all this?!  
I don't get any of it! Somebody explain already!
