**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
First, let's see...  
I suppose I'll explain why I was gathering life force from others.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
To begin with, before, when I used that mass-destruction spell,  
Akira... Labyrista and I essentially defeated one another.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
It left me in a comatose state,  
and I needed a huge amount of energy to awaken from it.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Just in case I ended up in a mortal crisis,  
or was incapacitated in some way,  
I had prepared a backup plan beforehand.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I gave special orders in advance to deeply brainwashed pawns like Karyl,  
to ensure that they would  
 stop at nothing to revive me.

**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Ordinarily, using a spell of mass destruction  
wouldn't have left me unconscious,  
 but that time,  
Labyrista took the opportunity to fire an attack of her own.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Her spell hit its mark perfectly,  
and left a lethal scar on my consciousness.

**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
So I became a sleeping beauty.  
Though, at least that irritating Labyrista  
was reduced to a similarly hopeless state.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
However... The mechanism I created to drain others' life force  
wasn't *just* a failsafe for this scenario.  
That was just a bonus,  
 an extra feature that happened to pay off.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
In order to grant my own wish, I need a large reserve of life force.  
That's why I've been gathering it however I can.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
The Shadows are another of the means I set up to achieve that.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Initially, they were a random phenomenon,  
but I captured them, analyzed them, studied their structure,  
and learned to produce them for myself as necessary.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Shadows...?  
What exactly are those things?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Just one of this broken world's inevitable bugs.  
But I deliberately produced them en masse.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Inside each of this world's living beings  
lies a core mass of life energy.  
Let's call it the soul for simplicity's sake.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
When this mass of energy is removed from its human host,  
it becomes a Shadow.  
Incidentally, the empty body left behind disintegrates after a while.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Without the soul's energy, it can't maintain itself.  
So it vanishes from the world entirely.  
This results in what you may know as the phenomenon of the "Lost."  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The Lost and Shadows...  
The two mysteries everyone's been struggling with.  
So you were behind both of those as well.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I wasn't the root cause,  
 but it's true that I accelerated them.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Doesn't it make things so much easier  
if you can blame all this world's misfortunes on a single villain?  
...For people like you.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
At any rate, whenever a soul leaves its body, it becomes a Shadow.  
Strictly speaking, even a fragment—just a single memory is enough.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Such souls contain vast amounts of energy.  
So I sought them out, captured them, and made them multiply.  
Until  
 I learned to control the Shadows themselves.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Shadows have very little will of their own,  
and are sensitive to magical energy,  
so they're easy to manipulate.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I used the Shadows and Karyl with her monster-controlling ability  
to conduct experiments in manipulation, too...  
Well, not that she was much use even then.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Anyway, if I wish and give the order, I can control the Shadows.  
So I can tell them to come to me  
and offer up the life energy they've accumulated.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Just now, the Shadows fused into a black sludge  
and surged single-mindedly towards the palace, yes?  
Well, this is the reason.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Thanks to the life force the Shadows brought me,  
I was revived, and gained the power to grant my wish.  
Everything was leading up to this moment.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
And yet, it's not enough. I need so much more than this.  
Since I was unconscious for a while,  
I fell behind on multiplying the Shadows, after all.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
So there's nothing else for it.  
I just have to steal more life force for myself.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I can't wait any longer.  
While I was snoozing away, I ran out of time.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I've had enough of it all.  
Of this endless repeating cycle.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Cycle...?  
What do you mean by that?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Hmph.  
So none of you managed to uncover that part.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Not Labyrista...  
Not Novem, who for some reason retains almost all of her memories...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Not even Fio, who seems to be giving you advice.  
Does this mean the source of the cycle is operating on a level  
beyond even Ameth's perception?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Or else...  
Perhaps it's all just in my mind,  
 a silly delusion or mistake.  
Ah, but what a relief that would be.
