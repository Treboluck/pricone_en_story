**Hatsune：**  
Yep, yep!  
I'm on it! You can leave it to Hatsune! ☆  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hey, Elizabeth Park guys!  
It looks like a big group of evacuees will be arriving soon,  
so let's get all the tents and stuff set up before they arrive!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
It won't be easy with so few people,  
 but let's all do our best!  
Don't worry, it'll be easy as pie with me on the case! ☆  
  
**Rin：**  
Wahhh?! The materials are floating in the air!  
How did you do that? Magic...?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Heheh! That's a trade secret! ☆  
  
**Lima：**  
\"Trade\"...?  
 Well, it sure is a big help!  
Ummm... You're Shiori's sister, right?  
Hatsune, was it?  
 Thanks so much for helping us out with this!  
  
**Lima：**  
Here at Elizabeth Park, we don't have anyone who can use magic...  
So we wouldn't have been able to get in contact  
with the city on our own.  
  
**Lima：**  
Without knowing the situation,  
we'd never have been able to respond so quickly.  
  
**Rin：**  
Uh-huh. It's a good thing Shiorin's big sis  
happened to have dropped by for a visit!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Haha, talk about a stroke of luck, huh?  
But no need to thank me!  
I've gotta pay you back for taking care of Shiorin!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Eheheh.  
 I hope everyone at Elizabeth Park  
will keep being great friends with my sister!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
You know, she's never been healthy enough to go out much,  
so she didn't make many friends up 'til now...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I think she must be happier than she's ever been,  
living at Elizabeth Park.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
And of course, since I'm her loving sister,  
what makes Shiorin happy makes me happy too! ☆

**Shiori：**  
H-Hatsune...  
Please don't tell them such embarrassing things...  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh—Shiori! You shouldn't be up and about!  
You're still not feeling well, right?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm fine, really. You all took such good care of me,  
I'm feeling much better...  
And this is an emergency. I can't sleep while everyone's in trouble.  
  
**Lima：**  
No, you really shouldn't push yourself... It makes me worry!  
  
**Rin：**  
Lima's right.  
This time, I'll put in a little effort for once,  
so you go lie down!  
  
**Rin：**  
After days in bed, you can't be in great shape.  
You'll hurt yourself if you work too hard.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Urgh... I'm so sorry...  
I guess I'm just being selfish, really.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Haha.  
I totally get why you're all worried, but it's fine.  
Shiorin's a really strong girl.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
She'll be lonely if she can't help out at all,  
so don't force her to rest, OK?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, Hatsune...! ♪  
  
**Lima：**  
Hmm... Well... We do need plenty of help.  
If you promise you won't overdo it, I'll find some work for you!  
Let's get through this together, Shiori!  
  
**Rin：**  
Shiorin works so hard it's crazy...  
Aw man, I guess I oughtta follow her example...  
  
**Lima：**  
Haha.  
I'd say recently, you've been working harder than usual, too!  
  
**Lima：**  
Anyway, I'll handle the hard work like setting up the tents,  
so Shiori, could you start preparing some food?  
  
**Lima：**  
There should be ingredients in the storehouse—  
you can use whatever you want.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Okay.  
I'll look into that. You can count on me!  
  
**Rin：**  
Well then, I'll fetch some sleeping bags and necessities.  
Oh, I guess the materials we were using to rebuild the farm  
should come in pretty handy too.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Yup! I think that's part of the reason  
this place was chosen for the evacuation.  
  
**Shiori：**  
A smart move...  
 Things can't be easy down in the city,  
but they must be working hard to stay calm.  
I'm sure some really talented people must have taken charge.  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's amazing...  
When people join hands together and work as a group,  
there's no crisis or illness they can't handle.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I want to be like that too.  
But I can't do that much on my own,  
so guys... will you all help me?  
  
**Rin：**  
'Course I will.  
I'd never slack off on helping you, Shiorin.  
  
**Lima：**  
Right! We'll work together, and we'll get through this!  
Isn't that the most human thing to do? ♪  
  
**Hatsune：**  
...?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Wh-what's wrong, Hatsune?  
You're looking kind of pale...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, ah... I just got word from my guildmate Aoi  
who's keeping tabs on the situation in the city.  
Oh, it's Misato who's actually casting the magic to link us, though.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Anyway, it seems like something really weird's going on over there.  
Aoi's getting super flustered, so I didn't quite get the details...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
But it sounds like the city was invaded by a horde of  
 wild monsters?  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh...?!  
Things already sounded pretty bad over in the city,  
but now they've got a monster problem too?!  
  
**Rin：**  
What the heck?!  
What kind of situation is this, anyway?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I... I don't really know.  
But the evacuees might be in big trouble,  
so I've gotta go and help them!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
You can leave this to us from Forestier.  
You guys just keep setting up the tents and stuff, OK?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
We can't fall behind on that, either.  
Let's stay alert and be ready to respond to anything!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh boy...  
I wish my superpowers could wipe out evil  
and just bring about world peace!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
But nothing's ever that simple.  
Still, that's no reason to stop working hard.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I'll be back soon, Shiorin!  
We're all counting on you! ☆  
  
**Shiori：**  
O-okay?  
 I don't really get it, but leave it to me!  
You go do your thing. And stay safe, okay?!
