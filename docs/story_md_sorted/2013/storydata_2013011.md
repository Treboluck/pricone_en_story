# Chapter 13 Episode 11
Though she does battle with every fiber of her being, Illya is ultimately defeated. Just as it seems there is no hope left for Diabolos, Pecorine appears out of thin air to rescue them. Still certain of her superior power, the Omniscient Kaiser offers to explain her plans before killing them all.

**Illya：**  
You will go no further, Omniscient Kaiser!  
Haaaaaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Hmph... You make a show of defiance,  
but your spells are nothing but time-wasting diversions.  
Please try to entertain me a little more, or this meal will have no spice.  
  
**Illya：**  
Nghh...  
 Nggrrhhh...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Look, your defenses are full of holes, vampire.  
Is attacking all you can do?  
You're just as half-baked as you look.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I'm trying to use my magic and time efficiently.  
If you end up falling too quickly,  
I'll have expended my precious resources for nothing.  
 You see?  
  
**Illya：**  
Ngg... gggh... guaahhh!  
  
**Akari：**  
I-Illyaaaa!  
  
**Yori：**  
Illya!  
Illya...!  
  
**Illya：**  
You fools... Hurry and escape to safety...  
You must not hesitate.  
I forbid you to look back...!  
  
**Akari：**  
But...  
But...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Ahahaha. The vampire is right.  
If you stay there, who knows what might fly your way?  
For instance...  
 A few stray attack spells, say.  
  
**Yori：**  
Aaaahh!  
  
**Illya：**  
Not so fast, loathsome wretch!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Oh my.  
You still have the nerve to protect them?  
Your strength really is boundless.  
  
**Illya：**  
...Hah! Far from it, my strength is long since expended!  
And yet, if I do not protect them now,  
all my efforts here will have been for naught!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
*sigh*... How depressing.  
No matter how hard you struggle,  
you will never keep me from my goals.  
  
**Illya：**  
Agghhh...!  
A... aarrrrghhh!  
Aaaaaaaaaaaarrrghhhhh!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
All of you speak big words, only to fail.  
Faced with a greater power, you can't achieve a single thing.  
Honestly... At least learn to bow down to your superiors.  
  
**Illya：**  
...U-urghh...  
I'm sorry, everyone...  
It seems our promised conquest of the world... must end all too soon...  
  
**Akari & Yori：**  
Illya!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Don't go back, Akari, Yori!  
We have to do as Illya says!  
  
**Akari：**  
But... but...!  
We can't leave her back there all on her own!  
  
**Yori：**  
Right!  
Even if we can't save her now,  
let's at least stay by her side to the very end!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Hahah... That's right.  
Looks like you've realized there's nowhere to run to.  
All of you will be consumed, and become my new strength.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Now... Offer your lives  
 to me!  
  
**All：**  
Aaaaaghhhhhh!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Haha... ahahah... ♪  
Not bad at all... I like the taste of your souls!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Hm?!

**Pecorine：**  
That's enough, Omniscient Kaiser!  
I won't let you cause any more trouble in my kingdom!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Well, well, Your Highness.  
Your timing is as awful... no, as insufferable as ever.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Of course!  
Princesses don't read the room!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
By the way, I'm not the only one who's coming to help!  
We noticed someone was fighting over here,  
so Rajraj brought us over with his Spatial Leap!  
  
`image display end`  
**Rajraj：**  
Indeed. There are limits to my Spatial Leap's capacity,  
so I could not bring everyone,  
but the others are headed here on foot, so they will arrive before long.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
You are outnumbered.  
I would suggest you give in and surrender yourself.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Are you being serious?  
You certainly have changed, Rajnikanth...  
The you I remember was a battle genius who lived to fight...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Oh well. A pathetic princess, powerless without her royal toys,  
and the sad remains of one of the Seven Crowns...  
Who else have you found to fight for you?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I can't think of any candidates who could help you now.  
Unlike me, who diligently gathered energy to revive myself,  
Akira must still be lying unconscious...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hahah!♪ Well, of course, there's our ever-reliable savior!  
The dashing {player}!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Your evil deeds end here, Omniscient Kaiser!  
**Choice: (2)**  ...I'm no fancy savior.  
`Tag 1`  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Ahah. How very gallant.  
A toast to you—  
the hero to the very end.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Haha. No, you really are a savior. You poor thing...  
You used to be just an ordinary boy,  
but this world made you into a hero.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
A cruel fate.  
If it gets too hard, I'd always be happy to take over for you.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Illya：**  
{player}...!  
You came for us!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
{player}...  
I beg you, use your ability to boost Miyako's strength.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Her life has been drained from her spirit,  
and she may vanish at any moment.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'm on it!  
`Tag 4`  
**Miyako：**  
Ohhh...  
Ahh... Miyako feels a little bit better...  
  
**Miyako：**  
That's good...  
Miyako felt so close to disappearing, it was scary...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What did you do to this girl, Omniscient Kaiser?  
You \"drained her life\"...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
From what we heard earlier, you were using that weird machine  
to drain Neneka's life force as well, weren't you?  
Why would you do that?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Haha.  
Very well... Shall I explain before I kill you all?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Ahhh, the very picture of a villain...  
But if we stand around chatting,  
I'm sure many more of your friends will arrive.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
That's how you are, {player}.  
Always attracting others with the power of love.  
The dashing hero at the center of the story...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I'll let you bring them all to me, and make their life my own.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Why bother walking to a restaurant  
when the food is willing to come directly to me?  
Haha... So as payment, I'll explain a few of the things bothering you.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You're certainly confident.  
Once we're all together, you won't stand a chance.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
You think so?  
 Ah well, just hear me out.  
I want to see you all  
 despair at the truth that confronts you.
