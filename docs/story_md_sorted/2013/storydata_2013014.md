# Chapter 13 Episode 14
Monsters close in all around the group. But just then, Muimi and Christina arrive, with Caon, Yui and friends in close pursuit. Though she seems briefly shocked by Yui's presence, the Omniscient Kaiser is gleeful to see more sacrifices.
  
## Subtitle: Preparing the Feast
  
**Rajraj：**  
I am detecting monsters too great in number to count!  
  
**Rajraj：**  
They're closing in! We must defend ourselves...!  
  
**Illya：**  
Urghh...?  
But we are already at our limit...!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
If only we had an escape route...  
Ahh, it's no use.  
 The dark omens span all directions.  
There's nowhere left to run.  
  
**Yori：**  
Wh-wh-wh-what now, then?  
Is this just the end?!  
  
**Yori：**  
Aahhh, Akari!  
I swear I'll at least keep you safe!  
  
**Akari：**  
Mmghh?!  
I-it's pretty rare for *you* to start hugging *me*!  
This kinda throws me off!  
  
**Akari：**  
But... Our two lives started together,  
and they'll end together too.  
 Okay, sis?  
  
**Miyako：**  
I-i-i-it's all OK, really!  
You can live after dying!  
 Just like Miyako!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Haha. You're a quite exceptional case, Miyako...  
Still, though, it does sound like a fun notion,  
roaming the world as ghosts together.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...Oh,  
 that was just a joke.  
Of course, I have no intention of dying today.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
My little girl's jokes always sound way too serious!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Hahah. You can still joke around, eh?  
But it won't be long before none of you ever laugh again.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Hm?  
  
**Daigo：**  
Hyyyaaaarrghhhh!  
You doin' all right, Rajraj and co.?!  
 'Cause I brought backup!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Nice going! Great work, Daigo!  
You busted right through them!  
  
**Christina：**  
Indeed. I'll pat him on the head later.  
All we had to do was follow along in the big boy's wake.  
A shockingly easy journey.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Hahah.  
It seems your friends have arrived.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Everyone!  
Are you quite all right?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Kokkoro! Quick, everyone, get over here with us!  
This huge pack of monsters is no joke...  
We'll all need {player} to power us up!  
  
**Daigo：**  
Well, I don't! I'll beat those suckers up with nothin' but  
this one hundred percent natural body my parents gave me!  
That's what it means to be a brawler! Gahahahahah! ☆  
  
**Muimi：**  
Actually, would {player}'s power even work at all  
on another Princess Knight like Daigo?  
I'm not totally sure how those settings have been applied...  
  
**Daigo：**  
Hey, Novem! Quit mutterin' and get ready to fight!  
It's monsters as far as the eye can see!  
Who knows where an attack'll come flying from?!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Hahah.  
It's almost funny how you're all happily gathering to be killed.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
What clowns.  
Don't you see that I deliberately left an opening  
to guide you into the center of the trap?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I'll crush you all alive.  
Know despair! War is a game of numbers!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Well, dang! That's good to know!  
But you're taking us a bit too lightly!  
Maybe war is about numbers,  
 but we can play the numbers game too!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Come again?  
 You're a hopeless idiot,  
so at least try to explain yourself so that others can understand.  
Didn't I tell you that once already in our past life?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah! I *am* an idiot!  
But I'd be even more of an idiot if I let that stop me!  
  
**Muimi：**  
So I'll keep studying, thinking, and explaining the things that matter!  
Until one day, we get our peaceful lives back!  
  
**Muimi：**  
I'll put an end to the nasty plots of villains like you,  
and create a world where the good guys can smile and laugh!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Childish to a fault, I see.  
...Hmm?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Christina!  
It's time for you to pay for your crimes!  
I'm gonna make you say sorry to all the beastfolk you hurt!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hold it right there, Christinaaaaaa!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Don't you dare run! Not now that you've gotten me riled up!  
You can't dangle a tasty piece of meat  
and then make me \"sit\" in front of it all day!  
  
**Yui：**  
M-Makoto, try to calm down!  
Something's not quite right here! Look at all those monsters...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...!  
Could you be... Yui Kusano?  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh?  
Why are you calling me \"Yui Kusano\" as well...?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Hmmm...  
 Oh, don't worry about it.  
It doesn't have much to do with \"you,\" after all.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Haha, now this is just perfect.  
Good girl, Novem. You always have been useful.  
Did you bring all these tasty morsels just for me?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Huh?  
Wh-what d'you mean?  
  
**Rajraj：**  
This Kaiser's current goal seems to be our deaths.  
Specifically, to kill us, take our souls,  
and consume them herself,  
 apparently.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
That's right. It looks like you served as bait  
to bring the members of Caon and so forth,  
who have a grudge against Chris...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
But to me, it's all just a bonus.  
More tasty sacrifices, of the finest and most delectable quality.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ehhh? Who the hell're you?  
I don't like the sound of your crazy talk!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Try to cool the temper, Makoto.  
Our priority is to get the citizens to safety,  
and take out all these nyasty monsters in the city.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Personal grudges can wait till that's taken care of.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That's our Tama!  
 Surprisingly mature!  
It's true, there's no time for fighting!  
We've gotta protect the city and everyone's peaceful lives!  
  
**Rei：**  
I have to agree with Hiyori.  
I don't quite grasp the situation,  
 but I'd venture a guess  
that the mystery woman floating in the air is controlling these monsters.  
  
**Rei：**  
If that's the case, defeating her may solve everything.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That's our Rei!  
Always calm and collected, but her conclusions  
 are kind of extreme!  
  
**Rei：**  
Haha.  
Simple is best, that's all, Hiyori. ♪
