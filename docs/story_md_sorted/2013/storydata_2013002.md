**Akino：**  
Everyone! We are ready to begin the evacuation!  
Allow me to lead the way!  
And be sure to remember, no rushing or shoving, all right?!  
  
**Akino：**  
In fact, let's proceed with the utmost of elegance!  
 Ohohohoho! ☆  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hmm. As I thought, Akino is the ideal choice to lead the crowd.  
She draws attention and her voice travels well.  
The perfect qualities for a flag-bearing leader.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Once this is over...  
When peace returns, I should find a job like this for her.  
Smells like a business opportunity to me!  
  
**Yukari：**  
*hic* Weheheheh... ♪  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Whoa...  
Yukari, please try to hold still!  
  
**Akino：**  
Mifuyu? Are you sure you're all right carrying the drunken Yukari  
entirely on your own?  
You seem to be stumbling.  
 Would you like me to take over?  
  
**Akino：**  
With all the festival preparations you've been handling,  
you've barely slept for days, right?  
If you keep pushing yourself so hard, you'll collapse sooner or later.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
And whose fault do you think it is that I've been so overworked?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ah well. Leave Yukari to me. It's more efficient.  
You have your own job to take care of.  
...I *am* counting on you, you know,  
 \"Leader.\"  
  
**Akino：**  
Of course!  
Haha. I'll show you what a fine leader I can be!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Eheheh...  
Miffy-you's back... It feels chilly... So refreshing...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Wahh! Stop nuzzling my back!  
Sheesh, just how far gone are you...?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ummm... Ladies of the Mercurius Foundation?  
This isn't a picnic, so let's take things seriously.  
Though I do envy how close you all seem.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Our forces from Nightmare  
and the members of Caon will find a safe route,  
or open one up ourselves, so try to stick close to us.  
  
**Akino：**  
As you wish!  
But right now... the whole city is in a panic.  
Will there really be a safe route to travel?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmm... There do seem to be Shadows,  
along with the black sludge they turn into, appearing all over the city.  
We'll do our best to avoid them, but...  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'm afraid this will probably end up taking a while.  
So we mustn't rush, but we should move swiftly when we can.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
That's my speciality.  
Still, I'm surprised to hear you're working with Caon on this.  
How did that come about?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Aren't your two guilds always at each other's throats?  
  
**Maho：**  
This is an emergency. No, it's war.  
We can't be lettin' old grudges hold us back.  
  
**Maho：**  
Let bygones be ol' bygones, and let's all work together.  
Look past the ears and tails, and we're all human in the end.  
  
**Tomo：**  
...I appreciate it.  
It can't be easy, after what Christina did to you.  
  
**Maho：**  
I forgive you.  
 I'm just hopin' we'll all be able to be friends from now on.  
Even if a world where everyone's all peace and smiles  
is just somethin' out of a fairy tale.  
  
**Maho：**  
Still,  
 it's a worthy goal if you ask me.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Guildmaster, while I find your idealism inspiring,  
this may not be the time to stand around talking.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Since I've been investigating the Shadows all this time,  
I have a good idea how they behave. I can predict the movements  
of the Shadows and the black mass they've become.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's simple deduction.  
Let me calculate a safe path, and lead everyone to their goal.  
  
**Maho：**  
Thanks a bunch, Kasumi.  
 That's mighty helpful.  
You really are the smartest gal in all of Caon. ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Heheh!  
Most of our members don't bother using their heads,  
so I have to think enough for all of them!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Yaaaay~!  
I love Maho, 'cause she's always giving me compliments! ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
At any rate!  
The blackness is bursting forth from all over the city,  
and flowing towards the palace.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And as you might expect from its appearance,  
it mostly tends to behave like a liquid, or at least a heavy gas.  
In other words, it tends to flow downwards.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Agile citizens can travel on the rooftops,  
where the liquid won't reach, and observe its movements.  
Then they'll be able to lead the others to safety.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Coming up against a black flow in a dead end or enclosed space  
could prove truly fatal.  
We should proceed with plenty of caution.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Theoretically, we could use magic to divert the blackness's path,  
but with that sheer volume...  
I doubt a lone mage would make much difference. Best to avoid it if we can.  
  
**Maho：**  
Well, yes... But why is this happenin' in the first place?  
It all came outta nowhere...  
Right when we were havin' a lovely festival...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Why indeed? We can ponder that once everyone is safe.  
It's not the detective's hour yet.  
For now, we should focus on staying alive.  
  
**Maho：**  
You're right... I'm worried about the beastfolk quarter as well.  
We've lost contact with Makoto an' the others over there.  
My magic isn't gettin' through... Did somethin' happen there too?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Well, frankly, I think the whole city...  
No, perhaps even the entire world is being affected by this chaos.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I hope this is a one-time thing.  
Some incidents are too large for any detective to handle!
