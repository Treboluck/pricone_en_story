# Chapter 13 Episode 16
At Pecorine's request, Yui resuscitates Karyl. In the midst of battle, she comes face to face with Muimi, but when she earnestly expresses her feelings, Muimi's open hostility falls away, and they are able to join hands to fight together.
  
## Subtitle: The Kindness That Connects Us
  
**Pecorine：**  
Um!  
 Yui! It's been quite a while!  
Listen, one of my friends is asleep and won't wake up...  
Do you think you could help her with your healing magic?  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh?  
 Oh—\"Pecorine,\" was it?  
Thank you again for saving me from those monsters that one time!  
  
**Yui：**  
I still don't know  
 what's going on here exactly...  
But I'd like to repay you however I can.  
  
**Yui：**  
So, um... Where is this girl who won't wake up?  
I think my magic might be able to help with that,  
so let me take a look at her!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
OK—she's over there!  
The girl Kokkoro's working so hard to carry!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...  
  
**Yui：**  
Ahh... This girl again!  
She, um, always seems to be asleep, huh?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heheh.  
 I guess you would get that impression.  
This girl's name is Karyl, and she's a precious friend of mine!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It feels like it was so long ago now...  
But since that day, when we first met,  
we shared meals together every day, and got really close.  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh, I see...  
Then we really must save her.  
  
**Yui：**  
Let's see...  
At first glance, she does just seem to be asleep.  
I think I can handle this.  
  
**Yui：**  
I know how to cancel the sleep spells that monsters use,  
so if I just tweak that method...  
 Mmmmnghh~!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Mmh... ...Unnh...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ah! She woke up!  
Thank you so much, Yui! You're amazing!  
  
**Yui：**  
Eheheh...  
I'm always adventuring with my friends  
in the most mysterious of dungeons.  
  
**Yui：**  
So I've studied plenty of magic  
to make sure I can handle any emergency.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Mmnh... H-huh?  
Am I...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyyyyyyl! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Mnnuagh?! Hey, quit hugging me so tight!  
My bones! My bones! You're gonna break them!  
Stop that, Pecorine! Your raw strength is no joke!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh! I'm super sorry, Karyl!  
Huggy-huggy~! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Geez...  
Uhhh, I'm not sure how to face you right now, but...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Pecorine... Koro... {player}...  
I'm really, really sorry. And thank you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Haha. At times like this,  
perhaps \"I'm home\" is the appropriate greeting, Miss Karyl.  
  
**Karyl：**  
S-sure.  
I guess...  
 I'm home... ♪  
  
**Yui：**  
Heheh...  
That's great.  
 I was a little bit worried about forcing her awake,  
but she seems stable.  
 I guess she really was just sleeping.  
  
**Yui：**  
Somehow I feel happy just watching.  
Mr. Knight and his friends are hugging that Karyl girl so furiously...  
I wouldn't want to get in the way, so I'll stay over here.  
  
**Yui：**  
This is still a battle, after all. I can't let my guard down.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Nguaahhh?!  
  
**Yui：**  
Awahh...?  
Are you all right? You came hurtling this way really fast!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Nghh... That monster's such a brute!  
I don't exactly weigh much,  
so I'm pretty vulnerable to power plays like that!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Wait—waaagh?!  
Yui Kusano!  
  
**Yui：**  
Y-yes...  
Umm, are you OK?  
You're not hurt, right? Should I heal you?  
  
**Muimi：**  
...  
  
**Yui：**  
...Um, listen.  
I don't know who you are, or what you know about me.  
Or why you keep looking at me in that scary way.  
  
**Yui：**  
I'm sorry, I really don't know...  
But I do want to find out.  
  
**Yui：**  
Positive or negative, I don't think it's right  
to just ignore feelings like that.  
  
**Yui：**  
Expressing your feelings to others is so hard.  
Even I have some feelings I've never managed to share...  
But that's why  
 I want to properly face your feelings towards me.  
  
**Yui：**  
I mean that.  
So once this is all over, let's have a proper talk.  
  
**Yui：**  
I won't run away.  
I'll listen to anything you have to say.  
So please, just for now, could you try not to attack me?  
  
**Yui：**  
The people I care about  
 are fighting to protect this whole city.  
I want to help them fight, and I'd love it if you could help, too.  
  
**Yui：**  
We're both human, so it's too sad if all we can do is hurt each other.  
Maybe this is childish of me... Maybe it's selfish...  
But even so, I'd like to try talking instead.  
  
**Muimi：**  
...You're always like this. That's why everything...  
  
**Muimi：**  
...No. It's nothing. I get where you're coming from.  
And you're right, this isn't the time for throwing insults  
or hurting each other.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Let's fight together, Yui.  
  
**Muimi：**  
My name's Novem.  
In a story you've all forgotten,  
 I used to be an enemy of yours,  
but we became friends at the very end.  
  
**Muimi：**  
So maybe, even if it's just for this moment,  
we can be friends one more time.  
We can fight side by side.  
  
**Yui：**  
...Yes.  
I feel the same way, I think.

**Yui：**  
So Novem...  
You're still on the ground—is your body OK? Can you stand?  
Here, take my hand.  
 Up you go... ♪  
  
**Muimi：**  
Mm...  
Thanks.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Her hand's so warm...  
That's just like her. Helping me without a second thought.  
She really is a good, kind girl.  
  
**Yui：**  
Wh-what is it?  
You're kind of frowning. Does it hurt? Should I heal you?  
  
![201301602.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/201301602.webp)  
**Muimi：**  
I-I'm fine, really!  
Quit being so kind already! It makes me feel weird!  
  
`image display end`  
**Muimi：**  
...Whoa! Look out!  
  
**Yui：**  
Waahhh?!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Not good. The balance is tipping...  
The monsters are starting to close in!  
Let's double down! If we don't push back, we're all dead!  
  
**Muimi：**  
This area's swarming with the things,  
so let's get somewhere a little bit safer!  
I'll drag you along, so don't let go of my hand... Yui!  
  
**Yui：**  
O-Okay!  
Thank you, Novem!  
  
**Yui：**  
Eheh... It's kind of nice, holding hands like this...  
It shouldn't be a big deal, but it feels almost like a miracle...  
  
**Yui：**  
Someday, I hope everyone in the world  
will be able to join hands and smile together like this.  
  
**Yui：**  
That's my one wish...
