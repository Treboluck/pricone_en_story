Oh dear...  
 The ground here is terribly slippery.  
My lord, be very careful not to fall.  
A plunge into these freezing waters could cost you your life.  
  
**Karyl：**  
So this is the monster that's been ravaging the northern seas!  
Everywhere it goes, it smashes up the ice around it,  
causing total chaos for humans and animals alike!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm...  
 Then this area's monster infestation  
may be due to the loss of the icy terrain they call home.  
We must pacify the beast and restore stability to the ecosystem.
