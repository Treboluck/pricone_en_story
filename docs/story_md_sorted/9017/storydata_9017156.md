**Pecorine：**  
Another job well done!  
It feels like we've conquered every baddie in the whole continent!  
There's not a single monster left that the Gourmet Guild can't handle!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Actually, when we took on this job, Miss Karin did mention something.  
Apparently there is a special mission she would like us to handle.  
Though it seems it will take a little time to prepare.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That crafty fox...  
What no-good scheme is she planning this time?!  
She always picks us for the nastiest jobs!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Although... if it's a special job, that might mean big rewards?  
Either way, can't expect bureaucrats to get anything done quickly.  
I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
