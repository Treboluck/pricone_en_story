**Narration：**  
One day, {player} is enjoying a walk,  
when Misogi shows up carrying tons of equipment.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hey mister, hey mister!  
Let's go exploring!  
  
**Misogi：**  
No need to prepare—I already brought everything we'll need!  
I'm fully equipped!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hmm?  
Where are we going to explore?  
And what are we looking for?  
  
**Misogi：**  
C'moooon, who cares about that stuff?  
I just wanna go exploring with you, mister!  
So, you ready? Let's gooo!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Yaaay, we're going exploring!  
Awesome!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You sure seem to be having fun.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misogi：**  
Well, yeah! Exploring is always fun!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Actually, y'know...  
My dad's actually a real explorer!  
  
**Misogi：**  
He's off doing exploring stuff most of the time,  
so he hardly ever comes home...  
But I love him to bits anyway!  
  
**Misogi：**  
When I think that I'm exploring just like Dad,  
it makes me all happy!  
  
**Misogi：**  
And besides, exploring is just plain exciting!  
C'mon, mister, let's find some forgotten treasure!  
  
**Misogi：**  
...Do I know if there's really any treasure?  
N'uh-uh. Not a clue!  
  
**Misogi：**  
But if we hunt around long enough,  
we're bound to find something cool, right?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? You want to know where we're going?  
I haven't decided!  
It's more explore-y if we figure it out as we go!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ooh! There's something over there!  
Maybe it's treasure!  
C'mon mister, let's go see!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hmmmm...?  
There's nothing here...  
I coulda sworn I saw something moving...  
  
**Monster：**  
Rrrrrrraaaaargghhh!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Waaahhh!  
A-a monster?!  
  
**Monsters：**  
Rrrrrggghhhhh!  
Grrraaaarghhhh!  
  
**Misogi：**  
There's loads of them?!  
I-is this, like... totally a monster nest?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Wh-wh-what do we do?!  
They've got us completely surrounded!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  S-s-s-stay c-calm!  
**Choice: (3)**  You'll be safe with me.  
`Tag 2`  
**Misogi：**  
I think you're the one who needs to calm down...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? Actually, seeing you panicking like that  
might have helped me calm down a bit!

`Tag 3`  
**Misogi：**  
Y-yeah, we'll be OK, right?  
The two of us together can handle anything, right?!  
You're the coolest, mister!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Misogi：**  
Stuff like this is normal for explorers, anyway!  
That's why I spent ages preparing and...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ohhh! Right, I almost forgot!  
The exploring gear I brought with me!  
If I use the you-know-what...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Umm... Let's see...  
Found them!  
My smoke bombs! Take this!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Quick, mister! While they're confused!  
Run for it!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Wh... Whew...  
We ought to be safe here, right?  
  
**Misogi：**  
It doesn't look like they're chasing us...  
So I guess we lost them!  
Phew, that was close!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I think that's enough exploring...  
**Choice: (6)**  You're such a reckless kid...  
`Tag 5`  
**Misogi：**  
Whaaaa?!  
 But it was so much fun!  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Misogi：**  
Eheheh... You're such a flatterer!  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Misogi：**  
Hahaha! That was awesome!  
I can't believe we found a monster nest!  
That's like, SUPER explorer-y!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Where should we go next time?  
Hey, mister, where do you think is best?  
  
**Narration：**  
Completely unfazed by mortal danger,  
Misogi was already planning her next great adventure.
