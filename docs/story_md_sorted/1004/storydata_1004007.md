## Subtitle: Help Me, Mister!
  
**Narration：**  
Misogi is giving {player} more lessons on how to  
avoid falling for traps.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ka-thuuuuud!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahahahah! You fell into *another* pitfall!  
You're so funny, mister!  
  
**Misogi：**  
You know, I always have the most fun when I'm with you!  
You're the best, mister!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh... It's getting kinda dark.  
Oh well, I guess that's enough lessons for today!  
We can do some more tomorrow!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Tomorrow... How about you meet me here at 10 o'clock?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Eheheh!  
I'm gonna bring my best traps yet, so I hope you're ready!  
Well then, see ya 'round!  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day, at 10 o'clock...

`Tag 1`  
**Misogi：**  
Somebody!  
Anybody! Heeeeelp!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ohhhh, what am I gonna do?  
I'm trapped inside my own pitfall...  
I was so sure he was gonna love this one, too...  
  
**Misogi：**  
I didn't think there'd be a hole at the bottom,  
and the whole thing would collapse in on itself!  
Just how far down did I fall?  
  
**Misogi：**  
I can't climb all that way up,  
so I guess I gotta hope somebody passing by notices...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Somebody! Anybody!  
Aren't there any random travelers passing by?!  
Or random legendary heroes?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
What about a random Mimi?!  
Or a random Kyoka?!  
Or maybe a random {player}?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
{player}, huh...  
I said I'd meet him right in the middle of Landosol,  
so there's no way he'd be out here... Urghh... I messed up...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ah well... I guess I'll just eat the lunch I brought  
and wait patiently for someone to show up!  
Tasty food, here I come!  
  
**Misogi：**  
...  
  
**Misogi：**  
...  
  
**Misogi：**  
...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Nobody's coming...  
Wh... What am I gonna do...?  
The sun's totally gone down...  
  
**Misogi：**  
I'm so hungry...  
If I don't make it home for dinner, my mom'll be so mad...  
  
**Misogi：**  
What if I don't make it home at all...?  
Wh-what if nobody ever finds me?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Wh-what if monsters show up...  
And I get g-g-g-gobbled right up...?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Waaaaahhhhhh!  
Somebody!!!  
Anybody, heeeeelp!  
  
**Misogi：**  
M-Mister {player}!  
Please, mister!

H-hang on... Why are you even here, though? How'd you find me?  
I didn't tell anyone I was coming here...  
And this is miles from where we were s'posed to meet up...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I searched for you.  
`Tag 6`  
**Misogi：**  
S-searched for me...? Th-this is far outside of Landosol, though?  
You came all this way from our meeting point?  
Without any leads to go on?  
  
**Misogi：**  
M-mister...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Thank you! Thank you so much, mister!

Though she had the same big smile as always, somehow Misogi  
couldn't seem to look {player} in the eye that day.
