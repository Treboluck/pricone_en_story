## Subtitle: Ultra Misogi Trap!
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahahahah!  
I did it!  
  
**Misogi：**  
The awesome trap I've been planning for ages is complete!  
I call it... Ultra Misogi Trap Special Mk. 1!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Eheheh... Only one thing to do now! I'll hide over here  
and see who's the first to fall for it!  
Ooh, I can't wait!  
  
**Misogi：**  
...  
  
**Misogi：**  
...  
...  
...Uhhh...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Nobody's taking the bait...  
I guess maybe it was a bit too obvious.  
People are gonna notice if there's a banana peel just lying there...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ooh! It's that guy I saved before!  
Maybe he'll be oblivious enough to fall for it!  
  
**Misogi：**  
He slipped!  
  
**Misogi：**  
And that triggered the mechanism to drop the bucket from above!  
  

---  
  
**Misogi：**  
Water poured out of the bucket, soaking him from head to toe!  
  
**Misogi：**  
The lemons and onions and mustard I mixed into the water  
totally messed up his eyes!  
  
**Misogi：**  
And he flailed around so much, he fell straight into the pitfall!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Amazing! You're amazing, mister!  
I knew my special trap was good,  
but I didn't think anyone would fall for it THAT perfectly!  
  
**Misogi：**  
You're an inspiration!  
If I'm a master prankster,  
you're a master of getting pranked!  
  
**Misogi：**  
C'mon, mister!  
Grab onto this rope!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Heave-ho, heave-ho, heave-ho...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Whew. Hey mister, are you OK?  
You didn't get hurt down there, didja?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Seriously though, you're incredible!  
Nobody knows how to get pranked like you do! It was hilarious!  
I love you, mister!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hmm... You know, though, mister...  
It might be a bit weird for me to say this,  
  
but you should really try to watch where you're walking.  
  
**Misogi：**  
My traps are just pranks, so they're not meant to hurt anyone.  
But if some real bad guys had set up that trap,  
you might be dead right now, you know?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're worrying about me?  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll be more careful in future...  
`Tag 1`  
**Misogi：**  
Well, of course I'm worried!  
  
**Misogi：**  
If you got yourself killed by bad guys,  
I'd have one less person to prank, wouldn't I?!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Misogi：**  
Hang on... If you're more careful,  
won't that stop you falling for my traps too...?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hmmm... Still,  
 I guess it's for the best.  
I wouldn't want you getting yourself  
 killed or anything.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Misogi：**  
So, mister... Watch where you're walking from now on!  
Assume there are traps everywhere, and be ready to avoid them!  
  
**Misogi：**  
That's right!  
Make sure you look in every direction...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Yup, yup! Check your front and back, left and right...  
Up and down, round and about...  
...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Uhh....  
...  
...  
  
**Misogi：**  
...Enough looking already!  
Are you ever gonna start actually moving?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ah...  
  
**Misogi：**  
You managed to trip on the same banana peel  
and fall right back into the pit...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Maybe I skipped some important lessons you need to learn.  
\"Banana peels are slippery!\"  
 might be a good place to start...
