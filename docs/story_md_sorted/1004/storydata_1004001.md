**Narration：**  
One day, {player} is out walking in town when suddenly...  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Ugh, that hurts! Hey, dumbass!  
Ain't you ever heard of looking where you're walking?!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Hot dang, that really stings!  
I reckon you've gone and broken a bone there, mate!  
Hope you're ready to pay some proper compensation!  
  
**???：**  
Hey, guys! What're you playing?  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Who's this brat?  
This ain't none of your business!  
Now scram!  
  
**???：**  
Huh? This is totally my business!  
'Cause, y'know, uhhh...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh, yeah, I know!  
That guy's actually my big brother!  
Can't argue with that one, can you?  
  
**Ruffian：**  
You're his sister?  
 Then maybe you oughtta take responsibility too!  
Your big bro just barged into me and gave me a fracture!  
He's not going anywhere till I get compensation!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh, really?  
Well, then... I'll fork out a bunch of money  
for my big bro's sake!  
  
**Misogi：**  
I've got enough to pay up!  
I always keep plenty of cash in this treasure chest!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Well, well... That's a fine little box you've got there!  
How much have you got inside?  
Let's have a look-see...  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Guahh!  
The heck just happened?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahahah! He fell for it!  
That was my special Exploding Smoke Box!  
  
**Misogi：**  
C'mon, mister!  
Let's run for it while he's distracted!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  But I can't see anything...  
**Choice: (2)**  All right! This way!  
`Tag 1`  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? Really?  
I use smoke bombs all the time, so I'm pretty used to it...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Misogi：**  
That's not a path, that's a wall!  
Aw, sheesh... I guess the smoke got you both pretty good, huh?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Misogi：**  
Honestly, you're so hopeless.  
C'mon, grab my hand and I'll show you the way!  
It's right over here!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Whew...  
I think we've lost him now, don't you?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Seriously, mister, you oughtta be more careful  
not to get mixed up with punks like him!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Thanks for saving me.  
`Tag 4`  
**Misogi：**  
Oh, don't worry about it!  
I got to play a great prank, so it was fun!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Besides, when I see people in trouble,  
I can't help wanting to help them out, you know?  
  
**Misogi：**  
You think I'm cool?  
Aw, don't make me blush! What's your name, anyway?  
  
**Misogi：**  
{player}, huh?  
Well, {player}, you seem like a magnet for trouble,  
so try to watch yourself in future!  
  
**Misogi：**  
...Hmm?  
What're you looking around all confused for?  
  
**Misogi：**  
You don't know the way back?  
Oh, right. We ran away in a bit of a rush,  
so you lost track of where you are, huh.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Well, uhhh...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh, yeah! The road we were just on is that way,  
so you should take this path as a shortcut!  
  
**Misogi：**  
See you 'round, mister!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahahah!  
Awesome! You fell for it!  
My Super-Sneaky Pitfall finds its first victim!  
  
**Misogi：**  
I set that one up this morning! It's pretty great, right?  
I've been looking everywhere for someone who'd fall for it!  
  
**Misogi：**  
I helped you out of a sticky situation back there,  
so now we're even, yeah?  
  
**Misogi：**  
I wasn't lying when I said I like to help people in trouble...  
But when I see people who aren't in trouble,  
I love to make trouble for them!  
  
**Misogi：**  
The look on your face was totally priceless!  
Ahahah!  
  
**Narration：**  
First she helps out, then she pulls pranks...  
Is this girl a good kid, or just a cheeky little rascal? Whichever the case,  
{player} hasn't seen the last of her yet...
