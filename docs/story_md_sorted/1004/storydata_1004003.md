**Narration：**  
Today, {player} has agreed to let Misogi give  
him lessons in how to avoid falling for traps.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ah! Here he comes!  
Hey, mister! Over here!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Head over towards Misogi.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misogi：**  
You fell for it!  
C'mon, mister, have you forgotten what we're here for?  
We're s'posed to be practicing NOT falling for traps, remember?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Don't let your guard down just 'cause we haven't started yet!  
The best timing for traps is when you're least expecting them!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Anyway, I'm gonna give you lots of pointers  
to help you not fall for this stuff in future!  
So I hope you're ready to learn!  
  
**Misogi：**  
First, let's see how you handle... these cups of juice!  
One with more juice in it, the other with less.  
One of them is secretly spicy!  
 So... which are you gonna drink?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  The one with more juice.  
**Choice: (3)**  The one with less juice.  
`Tag 2`  
**{player}：**  
!!!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Spicy, huh? Too spicy for you? Well, too bad!  
The correct answer is... They're *both* spicy!  
And you went for the big one, so even more spice for you!

`Tag 3`  
**{player}：**  
!!!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Spicy, huh?  
 Ahahahah! Too bad for you!  
The correct choice was... the one with more juice!  
...Nah, just kidding. They were both spicy!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Misogi：**  
Next up is... the good old rope trick!  
One of these two ropes will drop an empty bucket on your head!  
But is it the right one? Or the left one? Which will you cut?  
  
**Misogi：**  
...You think both of them will make the bucket fall?  
Nah, I wouldn't do that twice in a row!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Cut the right one.  
**Choice: (6)**  Cut the left one.  
`Tag 5`  
**Misogi：**  
Ahahahahah! Too bad for you!  
You picked dead wrong!  
  
**Misogi：**  
It's a noisy old bucket, but it's really light, right?  
See, it doesn't hurt at all!

`Tag 6`  

---  
  
**Misogi：**  
You got it! The empty bucket was attached to the right rope!  
The left rope tips over a totally FULL bucket of water,  
ready to drench you!  
 Eheheh!  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Misogi：**  
Okay then, next up is pitfalls!  
A left path and a right path! Which one will you—  
  
**Misogi：**  
Pffft!  
Mister, you managed to fall for every single trap!  
For a prankster like me, you really are the perfect target!  
  
**Misogi：**  
...But you know, I'm really starting to get worried.  
You're way too trusting, mister.  
You gotta learn to be more suspicious of people.  
  
**Misogi：**  
I mean, I guess that's one of your strong points too...  
  
**Misogi：**  
But you gotta learn to think, \"That Misogi is a dastardly one!  
She's always out to get me!\"  
  
**Choice: (8)**  I think you're a good girl, though.  
`Tag 8`  
**Misogi：**  
Huh?! Wh-what's that s'posed to mean?!  
I'm not good at all!  
I'm always playing dumb tricks on you and stuff...  
  
**Misogi：**  
\"But you're working so hard to teach me to avoid them\"?  
Well, that's... That's just 'cause you're so innocent,  
it makes me worry...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Y'know, nobody's ever called me a good girl before...  
I-it's kinda embarrassing, huh... Eheheh...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Th... That's the end of today's lesson! School's out!  
C'mon, mister, let's head back to Landosol!  
  
**Misogi：**  
...Ahh!  
 Don't go that way, mister!  
There's a pitfall just down that path!  
You gotta turn around and go down this...  
 Wait, huh?  
  
**Misogi：**  
I think I put a trap down that way too...  
Right, we probably oughtta use the path over...  
Hm? Hang on...???  
  
**Misogi：**  
I... I don't know what's where anymore!!!  
  
**Misogi：**  
I definitely put a fake trap here, but the real one's there...  
...Is what I want you to think, but actually it's the other...  
But that would be too obvious, so really it's... But secretly...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Waaahhh! How are we gonna get home?!  
This is real bad, mister!  
  
**Narration：**  
That day, it was Misogi who learned the important lesson  
to always keep track of your own tricks.
