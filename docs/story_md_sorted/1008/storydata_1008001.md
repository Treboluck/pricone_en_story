**???：**  
Hm? What's all the commotion?  
Did something happen?  
  
**???：**  
What? Screaming? A monster?  
What are you talking about?  
  
**???：**  
I was just admiring myself in the mirror.  
Look at this face of mine! I'm so unbelievably gorgeous  
and adorable!  
  
**???：**  
Whenever I see my reflection, I'm so struck by my own  
beauty, I could be surrounded by monsters and never even  
notice!  
  
![100800102.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/100800102.webp)  
**???：**  
But you saved me, didn't you?  
Well, thank you!  
  
**???：**  
I mean, you must've felt honored to have rescued someone as  
stunning as me, right?  
  
**???：**  
What? You wanna know why I'm here all alone?  
  
**???：**  
So you wish to get to know me better?  
All right, I suppose I'll allow it.  
  
![100800101.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/100800101.webp)  
**???：**  
At first, I joined a party to defeat some monsters.  
But my party left me behind because I kept checking  
myself in the mirror once every five minutes.  
  
**???：**  
But I just can't help it. Could you, if you looked like this?  
I'm just so gorgeous! I need time to look at myself in the  
mirror, you know?  
  
![100800102.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/100800102.webp)  
**???：**  
You understand, don't you?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Yep, totally.  
**Choice: (3)**  Nope, not at all.  
`Tag 2`  
**???：**  
Right? My beauty takes precedence over all else!  
  
**???：**  
You seem like quite the aesthete.  
So just this once, I'll allow you to gaze upon me up close.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**???：**  
Don't be like that. You truly are pitiful if you can't  
appreciate how perfect I look.  
  
**???：**  
Try getting a closer look at me,  
and learn to appreciate true beauty in its most perfect form.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**???：**  
Go on. Gaze away.

**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**???：**  
Looks like more monsters are here.  
They must be drawn to my irresistible beauty.  
I swear, it's a sin to look this good.  
  
**???：**  
So, will you go defeat those monsters for me?  
  
**???：**  
I'm kind of busy here. I need to check my mirror to make  
sure I still look perfect.  
  
**Monster：**  
SKRRREEE!  
  
**???：**  
Wh-what?! Why are the monsters coming towards me?!  
Y-you gotta do something!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Pick them up and run.  
`Tag 5`  
**???：**  
Hey!  
What the heck are you doing?!  
I didn't say you could carry me!  
  
**???：**  
Phew... Safe at last.  
  
**???：**  
Thanks to you,  
I didn't have to even break a sweat.  
  
**???：**  
Though I suppose anyone would jump at the chance  
to work for such a stunning beauty as me.  
  
**???：**  
Nevertheless, you saved my life.  
As a reward, I shall grace you with my name.  
  
**Yuki：**  
I am Yuki.  
What's your name?  
  
**Yuki：**  
{player}, huh.  
Nice to meet you.  
You owe me big-time for giving you the privilege of  
carrying me.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Listen, more monsters could be headed this way. We should head  
back to t—  
  
**Yuki：**  
O-oh NO! My mirror is broken!  
It's because you weren't being careful enough when you  
carried me!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Nooo... I can't believe this!  
How could this happen...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I-I'm sorry.  
`Tag 6`  
**Yuki：**  
Wait, don't apologize!  
Take a look at this!  
My reflection is in every one of these mirror shards!  
  
**Yuki：**  
My countless reflections are gazing back at me...  
Ahh, I'm so beautiful, I can't stand it!  
  
**Yuki：**  
I never thought to use a mirror this way!  
Thanks to you, I've made a brand-new discovery.  
Thank you, {player}!  
  
**Narration：**  
Yuki continued to gaze into the broken mirror  
for some time afterward.
