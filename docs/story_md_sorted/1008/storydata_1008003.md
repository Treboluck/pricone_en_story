## Subtitle: A Mischievous Rain
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is out on a walk when he hears a familiar voice.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Stop it. Leave me alone.  
  
**Flirt：**  
C'mon, gimme a break. You're waiting around  
for someone to ask you out, right?  
  
**Yuki：**  
Not you, that's for sure.  
You've got B.O. Kindly back off.  
  
**Flirt：**  
So you like playing hard to get, huh?  
Fine. I'm cool with that.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Why would I even...  
Ugh, this guy is so persistent...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Help Yuki.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuki：**  
Hey, {player}.  
Good timing.  
  
**Flirt：**  
Who the hell are you?  
We're in the middle of a conversation.  
Butt out!  
  
**Yuki：**  
You're the one who should butt out.  
I was waiting for this guy,  
so see ya!  
  
**Flirt：**  
What?!  
Is this guy your boyfriend?!  
You're stringing men along when you're already spoken for?!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Since when was I stringing anyone along?  
You just jumped to your own conclusions.  
  
**Flirt：**  
What a waste of my time! You jerks...  
I'm gonna cast a spell that fuses your hands together!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Hey!  
What the... What have you done?!  
  
**Flirt：**  
Haha! Serves you right!  
See ya never!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Uh oh...  
I really am stuck holding your hand...  
  
**Yuki：**  
Oh, but... This spell isn't very strong.  
It probably won't last longer than a day.  
  
**Yuki：**  
I think it will fade by tomorrow morning.  
We'll just have to be patient until then.  
  
**Yuki：**  
I mean, it's inconvenient for me,  
but a treat for you, right?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I wanna let go.  
**Choice: (3)**  I wanna hold hands forever.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yuki：**  
Aww, look at you blushing. You're cute.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Yuki：**  
I knew you'd say that.  
You're really honest, {player}.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Yuki：**  
But it's inconvenient that we each can't use  
one of our hands... This is terrible.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Oh, I have an idea! There are lots of books at the  
guildhouse. Maybe we can find a way to break the spell.  
  
**Yuki：**  
You should come with me to the guild, {player}—  
  
**Yuki：**  
Huh? Was that a water drop on my cheek?  
  
**Yuki：**  
Ack, it's pouring rain all of a sudden!  
{player}, let's hurry to the guildhouse!  
It's right over there!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Gosh, we're soaking wet. I don't wanna catch a cold.  
Should we get changed?  
  
**Yuki：**  
What? Separate rooms?  
But our hands are fused together with  
magic. We'll just have to change clothes together.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Okay, I'll change first.  
This is tricky...  
  
**Yuki：**  
Ugh, my underwear is soaked, too...  
Geez, the rain got everywhere...  
  
**Yuki：**  
I guess I gotta take it all off.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Why are you getting all flustered, {player}?  
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.  
  
**Yuki：**  
We're both guys, after all.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Huh? Why are you so surprised?  
I'm a guy.  
Didn't I tell you that?  
  
**Yuki：**  
Yeah... Biologically speaking, I'm male.  
True beauty transcends even the boundaries of gender.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Look at me, {player}. Isn't my body gorgeous?  
I know you're just fascinated with me.  
  
**Yuki：**  
I don't usually show this much of myself,  
but I'll make a special exception for you, {player}.  
Go ahead, admire my beauty much as you want.  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} was so surprised that he forgot  
all about being cold and wet.
