# Yuki Episode 6
Yuki wins a beauty pageant, receiving money and a special prize—a magic mirror that creates an exact copy of the wielder. The two Yukis argue over who is more beautiful, putting {player} in the middle.
  
## Subtitle: Yuki vs. Yuki
  
**Narration：**  
Yuki is competing in a Miss Landosol beauty pageant.  
  
**Host：**  
The winner is... entry number eight!  
Miss Yuki!  
  
**Yuki：**  
I won?!  
I won!  
I guess it's to be expected  
when I'm this adorable.  
  
**Host：**  
The winner will receive the prize money  
and a bonus gift—  
  
**Yuki：**  
Hi, {player}! Did you see me up there?  
I won the beauty pageant!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Congrats. You looked pretty.  
**Choice: (2)**  You're "Miss" Landosol?  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuki：**  
Hehe, thank you. I love it when you congratulate me.  
It means more to me than when I hear it from other people.

`Tag 2`  
**Yuki：**  
{player}, don't sweat the small stuff.  
Gender doesn't matter when it comes to true beauty.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Yuki：**  
Look at what I've got. I won some prize money.  
Hehe, I'm rich!  
  
**Yuki：**  
But I did sell off my guild's possessions the other day,  
so I'll have to use this money to buy them all back.  
  
**Yuki：**  
I'll be able to buy the furniture back and then some  
with this much money, so they're bound to forgive me.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Oh, but I didn't enter the pageant for the money.  
That was just the icing on the cake.  
  
**Yuki：**  
What I *really* wanted was this bonus prize.  
It's a magic mirror!  
  
**Yuki：**  
When you use this mirror, a copy of you appears.  
That means there will be two of me at my cutest.  
  
**Yuki：**  
There are parts of me I have trouble seeing with  
a regular mirror. I need a magic mirror to fully  
appreciate how gorgeous I am.  
  
**Yuki：**  
I'm so excited! I'm gonna try it out right now!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Whoa! There really are two of me!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Ahh, just look at how adorable I am...  
Lookin' good, gorgeous.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Hmm... But a copy of myself still isn't perfect.  
Nothing can be cuter than the original.  
  
**Clone：**  
Are you insane?  
I'm way cuter than you are.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Wha?!  
Well aren't you a sassy copy...  
I'm TOTALLY the cutest one here.  
  
**Clone：**  
Nuh-uh! It's me!  
Just look at how perfect my bangs are.  
I'm clearly the winner here.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Your bangs are nothing to brag about.  
My whole hairstyle radiates charm and cuteness.  
  
**Clone：**  
If that's true, then my whole *body*  
is brimming over with cuteness!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Your whole body? Obviously, I'm much cuter than you.  
Even though you're my copy, I'm starting to doubt your  
aesthetic taste...  
  
**Clone：**  
I could say the same thing about you.  
How can you  
not comprehend true beauty, when you're supposed  
to be me?  
  
**Yuki：**  
Heh, bold of you to pick a fight with me.  
Very well, let's ask {player} what he thinks.  
  
**Clone：**  
Good idea.  
{player} can decide who the  
ultimate cutie is.  
  
**Yuki：**  
{player}! Who's cuter, me or my copy?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You're both cute.  
**Choice: (5)**  I can't choose...  
`Tag 4`  
**Yuki：**  
Well, obviously! But we're asking you  
who's *cuter* between the two of us.  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Yuki：**  
We need you to decide.  
C'mon, take a good look!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Yuki：**  
You have to choose, {player}!  
  
**Clone：**  
Me? Or me? Who is cuter?  
  
**Yuki：**  
Hurry up and answer! Just tell him that I'm the cutest!  
  
**Clone：**  
No! I'M the cutest!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Run away!  
`Tag 7`  
**Yuki：**  
Hey!  
Where are you going, {player}?!  
  
**Clone：**  
We're not letting you get away  
until you tell us who is cuter!  
  
**Narration：**  
The two Yukis chased after {player}  
until the magic finally wore off.
