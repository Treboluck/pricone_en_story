# Hug Me Softly
Maho is envious when she learns that Lima gets hugs from {player}. She tells him that he can hug her as well, but can't handle the embarrassment and flees in a red-faced fluster.
  
## Subtitle: Hug Me Softly
  
**Lima：**  
Whew! We've come quite a ways, haven't we?  
Are you two okay? Are you tired?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm fine.  
`Tag 1`  
**Lima：**  
You're always bringing us mail to Elizabeth Park,  
so your legs can handle this, right? I expected as much.  
Are you okay, Maho?If you're having trouble, I can give you a lift.  
  
**Maho：**  
Saddlin' you up sure sounds mighty fun,  
but I'm right as rain.  
I've got to work hard so I don't embarrass myself  
in front of my prince.  
But thank ya kindly for your concern.  
  
**Lima：**  
Hehehe, I'm impressed.  
Let's keep up the great work.  
  
**Maho：**  
You're really kind and reliable.  
But from what I hear about ya from Rin and Shiori, you try not to go out  
in public so much.  
It's a darn shame.  
  
**Lima：**  
Ahaha... That's just how it is.  
The way I look shocks people.  
I know you'd already heard about me, but still, you weren't scared at all.  
Thank you for that.  
  
**Maho：**  
I've met plenty of beastfolk in my time,  
so ain't nothin' much surprises me.  
  
**Maho：**  
Come to think of it, my prince, how did you meet Lima  
if she doesn't go out in public?  
  
**Lima：**  
{player} and I bumped into each other on the road.  
Most people turn tail and run when they meet me unexpectedly,  
but instead of fleeing,  
he was actually concerned about me.  
  
**Maho：**  
Well, well, well! Just as I thought,  
my prince has a big heart.  
  
**Lima：**  
That's right!  
He even sometimes embraces me, which can be a little embarrassing.  
  
**Maho：**  
What's this?  
Embraces?  
Is that true, my prince?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  She's nice and warm.  
`Tag 2`  
**Maho：**  
You ain't wrong.  
Lima's fur is so soft and snuggly,  
I suppose it's hard to resist...  
  
**Maho：**  
But you ain't never put your arms around me, now have ya?  
I-I'm rather warm myself, y'know?  
  
**Lima：**  
Maho...?!  
  
**Maho：**  
H-here.  
You're free to cuddle up to me too, if ya like.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Embrace her.  
**Choice: (4)**  Don't say anything.  
`Tag 3`  
**Maho：**  
H-hold your horses!  
You're takin' it a li'l too fast!  
  
**Maho：**  
My li'l ol' heart ain't ready!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Maho：**  
......  
  
**Maho：**  
............  
  
**Maho：**  
I-if you tease me like that, my face is gonna turn pink!  
Don't be such a meanie!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Lima：**  
Maho, wait a minute!  
It's dangerous to go alone!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus, Lima and {player} scrambled to catch up with a fleeing, scarlet-faced Maho.
