# Lima, the Flower of the Kingdom
After seeing Lima's fighting skills, Maho becomes even more set on ushering her into the Maho-Maho Kingdom as a resident (white horse). Though perplexed about the existence of this kingdom, Lima cooperates with Maho to take down monsters as they climb the tower.

**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Lima：**  
Hrrrgh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Maho：**  
Why, Lima, I knew you were lovely, but you're awful strong too.  
How splendid.  
  
**Lima：**  
Don't just stand there, lend me a hand!  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh my, I was just so utterly captivated by your fighting form.  
I do apologize.  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOOGGHHH!  
  
**Maho：**  
As princess of the Maho-Maho Kingdom, I can't allow myself to lose.  
Miracle Mahorin, twinkle twinkle hoy! ☆  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Maho：**  
For li'l ol' me, this kinda monster ain't no fuss at all.  
  
**Lima：**  
Wow!  
You're so strong!  
  
**Maho：**  
I ain't half as strong as you.  
I gotta say, I love the way you fight.  
  
**Lima：**  
H-heeey.  
Flattery won't get you anywhere.  
  
**Maho：**  
I ain't tryin' to butter you up or nothin', sugar.  
I just think it would be mighty fine if you  
became a citizen of the Maho-Maho Kingdom, is all.  
  
**Lima：**  
That's an even bigger ask than I'd imagined!  
And besides, does the Maho-Maho Kingdom even exist?!  
Either way, no way, okay?!  
  
**Maho：**  
No way, huh...?  
If only the Maho-Maho Kingdom had a lovely horse like you,  
  
it would become so beautiful...  
  
**Lima：**  
I keep telling you, I'm not a horse!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus, ignoring Lima's vehement refusals,  
Maho began to climb the tower with a spring in her step.
