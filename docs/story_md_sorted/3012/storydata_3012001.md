# Weissflügel Episode 1
Monika travels from her homeland to reconnoiter Landosol. She haphazardly forms a guild in order to take quests, but each member is so quirky, they don't work as a team. Their first quest ends in retreat and regret.

**Narration：**  
At the quest application office...  
  
**Monika：**  
What do you mean,  
I can't sign up to hunt monsters?!  
  
**Clerk：**  
I'm sorry, dear.  
But children need a parent or guardian's  
permission in order to sign up for quests that involve monster  
hunts.  
  
**Monika：**  
I am no child.  
I am a proud solider who has undergone  
intense training, dispatched to this country to—  
  
**Clerk：**  
By the way, is your mommy or daddy here?  
  
**Monika：**  
Urgh. I told you, you obstinate dimwit, I'm not a child!  
  
**Monika：**  
Enough. I'm not going to waste any more time here.  
I'll return later.  
  
**Clerk：**  
Ha ha. I'm glad you understand.  
Remember to bring mommy  
or daddy with you next time. We'll be waiting!  
  
**Monika：**  
Hrmm. I'd planned to do everything myself, including the  
initial reconnaissance. I didn't expect to be stonewalled  
at the mission application desk.  
  
**Monika：**  
Well, the best-laid plans and all that.  
I suppose I'll have to join a guild first.  
  
**Monika：**  
Besides, joining a guild in a land of unknown capability  
definitely falls under the umbrella of recon.  
I should try to stay positive.  
  
**Monika：**  
Now let's see, first I need to find a guild.  
Oh!  
  
**Monika：**  
Greetings, fellow adventurers! How about letting me join  
your guild?  
I guarantee you won't be disappointed by my sword  
skills. If you have any doubt, draw your blades and see for—  
  
**Adventurer：**  
*sigh* I got no time to play house, kid.  
Go home and take a nap or somethin'.  
  
**Monika：**  
Sir,  
I'd like to join your guild.  
  
**Adventurer：**  
Ah ha ha. Sorry, no kids allowed.  
  
**Adventurer：**  
Huh? Whoa, what gives?  
What're you so mad about?  
W-wait, wait! Wagh!  
  
**Monika：**  
My homeland has given me the critical responsibility of  
investigating this country  
and reporting back what I find.  
  
**Monika：**  
But what rotten luck. How can I be at an impasse already?  
  
**Monika：**  
At this rate, I won't be able to join a guild, which means  
I won't be able to take monster-subjugation missions.  
I'm dead in the water.  
  
**Monika：**  
I have to do something. There must be a way.  
  
**Monika：**  
Hmm...  
Eureka!  
  
**Monika：**  
There's no need for me to join a guild.  
I can just become a guildmaster  
and start my own, can't I?  
  
**Monika：**  
As long as I have others with me, I'll be able to  
get around the age limit on monster hunts.  
  
**Monika：**  
The real problem is whether or not I can recruit members  
right away.  
  
**Monika：**  
Ohh, perfect. There's a warrior and a healer over there.  
And a dancer, to boot!  
  
**Monika：**  
Judging by the way they're scattered around the seating area,  
they don't appear to have joined any particular guild yet.  
  
**Monika：**  
No harm in trying.  
Excuse me, you three!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Hmm?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hai!  
  
**Kuka：**  
H-heek!  
  
**Monika：**  
Ha ha ha! What an incredible stroke of luck. I can't believe  
we formed such a well-balanced party  
right out of the gate!  
  
**Monika：**  
Or perhaps this is a sign that a higher power is wishing for my  
success  
in this sacred duty entrusted to me by my homeland.  
  
**Yuki：**  
So, what did you want us to do?  
  
**Monika：**  
There are some monsters ravaging the fields near here.  
Our mission is to chase them off.  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Monika：**  
Speak of the devil. They're ranked at the very bottom tier,  
but they'll be perfect for us to warm up as a team.  
  
**Monika：**  
Let's go! Ninon, take point! Yuki, Kuka, support her  
from the back row!  
  
**Kuka：**  
H-heeeeeek!  
  
**Monika：**  
S-stop! Why are you charging into the fray, Kuka?!  
Follow the plan and get back here! You're in danger!  
  
**Monster：**  
SKRRREEE!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Aaah!  
  
**Monika：**  
A-are you all right?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Eh-heh... Gueheheh... I-I'm being offered up to the monsters  
as a human sacrifice.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Oh, she is looking quite happy!  
  
**Monika：**  
What? No sane human would enjoy sitting there  
being attacked.  
  
**Kuka：**  
I'll endure this humiliation in front of all my companions  
until my last breath!  
  
**Monika：**  
*gasp* She must be attempting to induce confusion!  
  
**Monika：**  
Ninon, get to the front and watch out for its attacks!  
Yuki, support her from the back row.  
  
**Ninon：**  
You can count on me!  
Ninpo: Clone Jutsu! Shapapapan!  
  
**Monika：**  
Oh ho! So the plan is to swiftly circle around the enemy,  
avoiding its attacks.  
Excellent!  
  
**Monika：**  
I sensed it when we first met, but this proves it.  
Between that gear and her dexterity,  
Ninon is clearly a  
force to be reckoned with!  
  
**Ninon：**  
S-so dizzy...  
Break time.  
  
**Monika：**  
What are you doing, you fool?!  
If you come to a dead stop right in front of the enemy...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Monika：**  
You see what happens?  
  
Yuki! Cast a defense spell on Ninon before she—  
  
**Yuki：**  
Oh, what a sight. My visage is so beautiful to behold.  
Even when under imminent attack from a monster,  
I'm still as cute as a button.  
  
**Monika：**  
Yuki, why are you preening in the middle of a battle?  
Focus on the fight!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Please don't interrupt.  
I'm trying to fully appreciate the  
true depths of my beauty.  
  
**Monika：**  
Wha?!  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Yuki：**  
So cute... I'm too cute for my own good.  
  
**Monika：**  
Ninon, dodge!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ninpo: Hidden Cloud Jutsu!  
Shapan.  
  
**Monika：**  
She made it.  
I've never seen anyone flee so fast.  
  
**Monika：**  
*gasp* Wait, what about Kuka?  
  
**Kuka：**  
I'm in ecstasy! Eh-heh... Gue-heheh... *drool*  
  
**Monika：**  
H-how can she be so composed with all those monsters  
surrounding her? I have to give her credit.  
The girl can take a  
lot of punishment.  
  
**Monika：**  
But...  
  
**Yuki：**  
Ahh, I'm the fairest in all the land.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Eh-heh... Gueheheh...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Conquer ALL the lands!  
  
**Monika：**  
...I think I may have made several critical errors in judgment.  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Monika：**  
But there's no changing the past.  
For now, we must band together and...  
  
**Monster：**  
SKRRREEE!  
  
**Monika：**  
...Retreat! Everyone, fall back!
