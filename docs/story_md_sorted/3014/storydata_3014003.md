# Diabolos Episode 3
Illya brainstorms ideas for world domination with the team, but finds their suggestions less than useful. She herself suggests marrying {player} to permanently restore her powers, but is met with frantic objections.
  
## Subtitle: Plans for Conquest!
  
**Narration：**  
Once again, Illya has called a meeting of Diabolos.  
  
**Illya：**  
Let us begin the Diabolos world domination  
brainstorming meeting!  
  
**Everyone：**  
World domination brainstorming?  
  
**Illya：**  
Indeed. I am stuck in this childlike form.  
Counting {player}, we number only six.  
Without a clear plan, our conquest will be fraught with peril.  
  
**Illya：**  
Thus, I would like to solicit ideas from my servants.  
You all have my permission to speak freely.  
First, Shinobu! What ideas have you?  
  
**Skullfather：**  
First, I suggest slaughtering every last male.  
  
**Illya：**  
I see. It is true that men tend to wield more formidable  
strength in battle.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
In which case, let's start by smashing this brat here!  
GRAAAAAGHHHH!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father, that's quite enough.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Aaargh! My daughter's a demon!  
  
**Illya：**  
Excuse me? Shinobu, that suggestion was your father's  
opinion, not your own?  
Next! Miyako!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Mmmm?  
Miyako thinks pudding is important!  
  
**Illya：**  
P-pudding?  
Why is that?  
  
**Miyako：**  
First we bring all the pudding in the world here!  
Then we tell peoples they do what we say  
or they get no pudding!  
  
**Illya：**  
Interesting.  
In other words, take control of the food supply.  
  
**Miyako：**  
But then!  
Even if they do what we says, we don't give them pudding!  
Miyako eats all the pudding!  
  
**Illya：**  
N-now that's real tyranny...  
Next! Akari!  
  
**Akari：**  
I think... to conquer the world, you need the right outfit!  
  
**Illya：**  
Outfit? As in troops? Business partners?  
Ah, you mean clothing. I see. A common uniform  
would indeed promote unity among our forces.  
  
**Akari：**  
Hey, {player}, what outfits do you like?  
Miniskirts are cutest, right? Especially with a tube top to show  
off the abs!  
Ooh, where're your eyes wandering to now?  
  
**Illya：**  
That hardly sounds like a uniform to inspire terror...  
I reject Akari's proposal!  
Next up, Yori! How would you do battle?  
  
**Yori：**  
Well, let's see... With a numerical disadvantage, long battles  
are more difficult,  
so it's best to finish things quickly.  
\"Strike first, strike hard!\" would be my tactic.  
  
**Illya：**  
Ooh! Finally, a real battle plan!  
I knew I could count on you.  
  
**Yori：**  
Oh, but defense is crucial, too.  
The best offense is a good defense!  
I'd put some defenders and healers in my deck too...  
  
**Illya：**  
I... I see? Your words do sound convincing, but...  
Um, \"deck\"?  
  
**Yori：**  
In the end, it all depends on your personal playstyle!  
You consider the card values and set up the field  
to activate a powerful combo...  
  
**Illya：**  
You're talking about how to win at a card game!  
Yori's proposal is rejected too.  
{player}! What about you?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'd leave it all to you.  
**Choice: (2)**  Leave everything to me.  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
Ohoh! You have complete faith in me, do you?  
Spoken like a true loyal servant!  
  
**Yori：**  
You just didn't wanna bother thinking of a plan, did you?  
  
**Illya：**  
What?! Is this true, {player}?  
That lazy attitude is no help at all!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
Ooh! How very manly!  
What specifically do you have in mind?  
  
**Illya：**  
No specifics at all, I see.  
You brainless dolt!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Yori：**  
You've done nothing but criticize our ideas.  
Don't you have any ideas of your own, Illya?  
  
**Illya：**  
Heh heh. Of course I do!  
Now the time is ripe, I shall reveal my ultimate plan.  
Listen carefully. My strategy is...  
  
**Illya：**  
I will take {player} and wed him  
as my lifelong companion!  
  
**Everyone：**  
Huuuh?!  
  
**Illya：**  
Do you recall how I regained my true form before?  
I have pondered long and hard upon it.  
It seems likely  
that {player}'s influence was responsible.  
  
**Illya：**  
Though I know not the precise reason nor the mechanism,  
as long as he remains close by my side,  
I believe I can reclaim my true power!  
  
**Illya：**  
And once I do, this world is as good as conquered!  
Humans, monsters, even the gods will not stop our reign!  
  
**Illya：**  
Ahahahahahah!  
How's that? 'Tis the perfect plan, yes?  
  
**Yori：**  
Absolutely not!  
  
**Akari：**  
No way!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako says no!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
No.  
  
**Illya：**  
Wh-Whyever not?  
Don't you all wish to conquer the world with me?  
  
**Yori：**  
Honestly, no, not really!  
A-and even suggesting that you and {player}  
get married is just... It's shameless!  
  
**Miyako：**  
{player} is Miyako's servant!  
His job is bringing Miyako pudding and more pudding!  
  
**Akari：**  
No way I'm letting you marry {player}!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
The marriage of Illya and {player}  
portends great tragedy and disaster. I cannot agree to it.  
  
**Illya：**  
Oh I see.  
You're all just jealous, aren't you?  
  
**Yori：**  
Absolutely not!  
  
**Akari：**  
No way!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Nuh-uh!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
No.  
  
**Narration：**  
Both world domination and a return to her true form  
still seemed far out of Illya's grasp for now.
