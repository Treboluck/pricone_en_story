## Subtitle: A Vampire Is Reborn!
  
**Narration：**  
Demonfolk girls Shinobu, Akari, and Yori have journeyed  
to the depths of a certain cave.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Yori, Akari.  
This is the place I foresaw in my divinations.  
  
**Yori：**  
S-so this is where he's sealed?  
The \"legendary vampire\" who once led the demonfolk  
and plotted to take over the world?!  
  
**Akari：**  
Ooh,  
I'm getting all hot and bothered!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Well then, I will release the seal.  
...Hahh!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Mmnh... Hmmm...? Who're you guys? What's your deal?  
Miyako's still sleepy...  
  
**Yori：**  
Is... Is this little girl the legendary vampire?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Vampire...?  
Miyako's a ghost, silly.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I'm very sorry.  
It seems I was mistaken somehow.  
  
**Yori：**  
Sh-Sh-Shinobu? How many times does this make now?  
  
**Miyako：**  
A mistake? That's why you waked me up?  
That's so mean!  
Just when I was sleeping, all nice and comfy-like!  
  
**Yori：**  
A ghost... I've never seen one before!  
She's not quite like I pictured, though.  
She's not spooky...  
She's just childish... Seems more annoying than scary.  
  
**Miyako：**  
You'll pay a big price for ruining Miyako's sleepytime!  
Hmph hmphy hmph!  
  
**Miyako：**  
I couldn't help waking up, but I still felt all snoozy,  
so I was like, \"I'mma go back to sleep!\"  
But now I'm getting more and more wakey...  
  
**Miyako：**  
\"No, don't wake up! Go back to sleepy-byes!\"  
I tells myself over and over,  
but it just wakes me up  
more and more and more, till I'm not sleepy at all!  
  
**Miyako：**  
How you gonna make it up to Miyako?!  
  
**Akari：**  
Oh, Miyako, I'm so sorry.  
Listen, I'll do anything I can to say sorry...  
Let's see... Should I get into bed with you?  
  
**Miyako：**  
That's not enough to repay Miyako!  
You're gonna have to buy Miyako... puddings!  
  
**Yori：**  
P-pudding?  
What a weird ghost.  
Well, Shinobu, give her some pudding, please.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
But... I'm only here because the two of you hired me.  
Yori, Akari, I believe you should be treating her.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Who cares who pays the moneys!  
Actually,  
all of you should pay up!  
Three peoples means three puddings!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Anyway, who'd you mistake Miyako for?  
  
**Akari：**  
Oh, well...  
Long ago, there was a legendary vampire  
who was sealed away for plotting world conquest!  
  
**Yori：**  
In ancient times, he united the demonfolk  
against humans, elves and beastfolk,  
leading them into battle as their overlord.  
  
**Yori：**  
Though defeated by the very gods in his final battle,  
the \"Rigveda,\" it's said that his body is still sealed away,  
waiting for the day of his reawakening.  
  
**Yori：**  
It's a well-known fairy tale in Landosol,  
especially among demonfolk like ourselves.  
If you're a demongirl too, surely you've heard it before?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Legendary vampire?  
Mmmm...  
I don't really remember stuffs from before I died.  
You think he's really for reals?  
  
**Yori：**  
U-ummm... M-maybe not?  
In the end, it is just a fairy tale...  
  
**Akari：**  
He's real! I know he is!  
  
**Yori：**  
So, umm, this is Akari,  
a-and I'm Yori. W-We're twins.  
Akari was the one who insisted we should go look for  
the vampire.  
  
**Akari：**  
Eheheh...  
This legendary vampire  
can do all sorts of things  
with his magic!  
  
**Yori：**  
Apparently Akari has a super-secret wish  
that she wants the vampire to grant for her.  
  
**Akari：**  
Yup!  
I wanna be the cutest cutie-pie in the world!  
  
**Yori：**  
Wasn't that supposed to be a secret?!  
  
**Akari：**  
Ack! I blurted it out!  
I swore I wasn't gonna tell anyone.  
This is so embarrassing!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
That's why we were searching this place...?  
  
**Yori：**  
Th-the truth is, I've got a secret wish of my own  
that I'd like to ask him to grant too, but...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Generally, vampires are said to possess strong powers  
in the area of allure and seduction.  
So if Akari's wish is  
for beauty, that might be well within his abilities.  
  
**Akari：**  
Really?!  
Eheheh!  
Then I won't stop looking till I find him!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hmm...  
Do you think that legendy vampire  
could even bring Miyako back to life?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Well, let's see. Another notable power vampires possess  
is mastery over the dead,  
so I'd say it's quite possible.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Really really?  
Then I'll help you look, too!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
My name is Shinobu. I'm a fortune-teller.  
Yori and Akari hired my services to divine the legendary  
vampire's location and lead them to him.  
  
**Yori：**  
She keeps failing us, though! Like right now.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I apologize.  
  
**Akari：**  
People say Shinobu's fortunes are usually on point...  
What's so different this time?  
You use that crystal skull to do the readings, right?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Yes. Unfortunately,  
motivation is a significant factor  
in the accuracy of my readings.  
  
**Yori：**  
Your mood affects your predictions?!  
Should a fortune-teller really be revealing that  
to her customers...?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Not my own motivation. The mood of the crystal is the issue.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Yeah! I don't care about telling fortunes  
unless hot babes are involved!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Weirdy skull! It talks and stuff!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Allow me to introduce him. This skull is my father.  
Due to certain reasons, he passed away,  
but due to certain reasons, he lives on as a skull.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Th-that's sort of yucky.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Yucky, you say? Tch! This is why I hate kids.  
Trust me, once you grow up a little, you'll realize  
I'm head and shoulders above the rest!  
  
**Akari：**  
Sorry, mister, you're not really my type either.  
  
**Yori：**  
M-maybe we'd be able to understand your appeal  
after we pass away and decay into skeletons ourselves...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father is quite the playboy.  
He prefers voluptuous, full-figured women in their early  
adulthood.  
Oh, and the skimpier their clothes, the better.  
  
**Yori：**  
What a pig.  
I guess men are all the same...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Mmmm... grown-up ladies with not much clothes?  
Miyako knows someone just like that!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
What? Really?!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Yup. Gimme pudding and I'll show you! ♪  
  
**Yori：**  
Umm... actually, we're looking for the legendary vampire,  
not some random lady in a skimpy outfit.  
So it's really fine if you don't—  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Wrong! A hot babe in her prime is what we're after!  
Find me that, and I'll take you to a hundred vampires!  
Miyako, lead the way!  
  
**Yori：**  
Ahh... Miyako, can you take us to her?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Okie-dokie!  
That'll be five puddings, please!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Here's the place! Us ghosts all know this spot.  
It's famous for being the most bestest place for haunting.  
  
**Yori：**  
The \"most bestest\" place to haunt...?  
It's so creepy.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Minimal sunlight exposure. Filled with an eerie silence.  
Constructed... thousands of years ago, I'd say.  
We couldn't ask for a better location.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Oh! There, over there!  
  
**Yori：**  
Th-that's...

**???：**  
...  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Whoooaaaaa!  
So hot! Bangin' body! Barely wearin' a thing!  
That's my ideal woman right there!  
  
**Yori：**  
Th-this aura is incredibly sinister...  
  
Y-you don't think this woman might be  
the legendary vampire?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
True enough, there's nothing in the legends  
to discount the possibility of a female vampire.  
At any rate, I'll remove the seal. ...Hahh!

**Everyone：**  
Wait, what?  
  
**???：**  
Hahahahah!  
Behold the Queen of Darkness!  
Your overlord, Illya Ornstein, lives once more!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hm? Who are you, mortal beings?  
Are you the ones who awoke me from my slumber?  
Very good! I shall make you my first new servants.  
  
**Yori：**  
Wh-why'd you turn into a kid?!  
  
**Illya：**  
A child? What foolishness is this?  
Gaze upon my glorious figure and...  
  
  
**Illya：**  
Waaaaghhh!  
Wh-what has become of my body?!  
I... I'm a child? I've turned into a child! But why?!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
P-preposterous!  
I... I won't stand for this! C'mon, turn back, now!  
Gimme back that perfect hourglass figure!  
  
**Illya：**  
I would do so at once if I could!  
You, mortals! Do something about this!  
  
**Akari：**  
How to become more... adult?  
Ooh, I'm still just a kid, so I wouldn't really know...  
  
**Yori：**  
D-don't say it like that!  
Oh, sheesh... What are we supposed to do?!  
  
**Narration：**  
Though they had found the legendary vampire,  
it seemed like these young demongirls weren't getting  
their wishes granted any time soon.
