## Subtitle: One and the Same
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hey there. Any luck?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Sorry for leaving her in your care so often.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
We're the first to have successfully captured a Shadow.  
All sorts of magicians and research facilities  
can hardly contain their curiosity.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I've got my hands full dealing with them,  
not to mention all the paperwork for the government.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Trust is hard earned, though, so it's been a continuous stream  
of probing each other's intentions and playing mind games.  
*sigh* I'm exhausted.  
  
**Kiri：**  
\"Detective!\"  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Whoa...  
Hey now. You can't just cling on to me like that.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
We share almost the exact same mass. In other words,  
we weigh the same.  
You could  
knock me down if you come at me like that.  
  
**Kiri：**  
\"That's a difficult issue.\"  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Indeed it is.  
...  
Hm. This is starting to feel like a proper conversation.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That's all thanks to you, you know.  
Her demeanor has changed entirely ever  
since coming into contact with you.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's still faint,  
but she's beginning to develop a sense of self.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Fascinating as it is, though, I still don't understand *why*.  
I do have some theories,  
but there's no guarantee any of them are correct.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Especially with how little we still know about Shadows.  
It's almost entirely a guessing game right now.  
  
**Kiri：**  
\"This is a difficult case.\"  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Sure is.  
...  
Hm.  
I really can't get used to hearing my voice come from another source.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's better than not being able to communicate at all,  
but something about it just disturbs me.  
Feels like I'm really conversing with myself.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And that's not healthy for people with no confidence.  
We don't do well when forced to face ourselves.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You've always seemed confident to me.  
**Choice: (2)**  Do you hate her?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kasumi：**  
That's all an act.  
A way to cover up my deficiencies. Because at my core,  
I'm always anxious. Always putting myself down.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Don't forget.  
I'm just a teenage girl.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's been this way ever since I was working solo.  
I had to put on airs to make sure people took me seriously.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'm as fragile as they come.  
But the role of detective was the perfect way to shield myself.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But Kiri, she's different.  
She's not playing that role.  
Her actions reflect my true self.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And that in and of itself is troubling.  
It's like my complexes are being laid bare for the world to see.

`Tag 2`  
**Kasumi：**  
It's not quite that simple, I'm afraid.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But let me say this.  
I don't hate her. In fact, I quite like her.  
After all, it's only natural to like oneself.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That's how people are. We relate to those we find  
similar to ourselves. It's one of our  
basic instincts, and also an essential function.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
If we didn't like ourselves, we wouldn't be able to survive.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kasumi：**  
Either way,  
Kiri and I overlap in almost every manner.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
She's me, and I'm her.  
But the \"me\" that I know is somewhat removed from reality.  
Embellished through my own personal bias.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
A fake image dressed up by the stylist known as self-esteem.  
  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But Kiri's different.  
She's an objective take on myself.  
My true self, in a sense.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And the slight differences there are painfully obvious.  
If I were to  
compare what observing her is like to something else, it would be  
the discomfort you feel when you hear a recording of your own voice.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's a hard pill to swallow.  
I'm just a weak, pathetic little girl at heart.  
  
**Kiri：**  
\"Detective?\"  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Why do you keep calling me that?  
Hm... Just being here is wearing me down.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But be that as it may,  
abandoning oneself isn't possible.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
So don't worry, Kiri.  
I'll take care of you. I'll protect you.  
  
**Kiri：**  
\"Thank you very much. ♪\"  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You're welcome.  
Just a bit of praise and acknowledgement is  
enough to make her become attached to you, huh...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That's another side to me, I suppose.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm?  
What's wrong?  
You look like you've got something to say.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Haha.  
You don't think we're that similar, you say?  
Understandable. I'm just putting on an act, after all.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That was the quickest way to reach my ideal.  
To bring myself closer to the detectives I've always admired.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That's just one side of me, of course.  
One of many, including Kiri's frail self.  
Sides of me that I have to accept and live with.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hehe.  
This has been quite the philosophical chat, hasn't it?  
  
**Kiri：**  
\"Can I...\"  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm?  
What's the matter?  
  
**Kiri：**  
\"Can I become a detective as well?\"  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You sure can.  
You can be the coolest, smartest detective there is.  
One that shines a ray of hope on those who find themselves lost.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You can become a protagonist treasured by all,  
just like in the stories I've always loved.  
I guarantee it.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And if you need proof,  
it's right here in front of you.  
I'll continue to demonstrate that for you,  
no matter how many times it takes.
