## Subtitle: A Detective by Nature
  
**Kasumi：**  
Heh.  
A little bit of deduction does the trick, my dear assistant.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Though this wasn't that complicated.  
I just drew a connection between where Shadows  
have been spotted and their individual behavior.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That, in turn, allowed to me map out a central location relevant to it all.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
In simpler terms,  
I was able to deduce where they spawn from.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It wasn't easy, though.  
Everything had to be marked out individually.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And there are limits to the imagination,  
so I had to visit each location as well.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It wasn't as bad as you might think, though.  
I'm good at that sort of stuff. Plus I enjoy it.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Granted, it did take up quite some time.  
Sorry for dragging you along.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Asking around town with me was plenty,  
but you even helped organize all my papers and brought me food.  
You're a lifesaver if there ever was one.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I know that's your job and all,  
but I still really appreciate it.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
There's only so much one can do on their own, after all.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That said,  
we can't get ahead of ourselves.  
The real fun starts from here.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'm almost positive I've figured out where the Shadows spawn from.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
*Almost* being the key word.  
Plus, there's the possibility that it might change over time.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And to make things worse,  
they seem to spawn from multiple points.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I count more than ten, just within the city itself.  
Putting the statistics together to pinpoint them was quite the struggle.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But with that done,  
I was able to figure out which one spawns the most Shadows.  
That'll be our focus.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
If all goes according to plan, then we'll capture the first Shadow that  
spawns. Keeping one under careful observation will no doubt  
help us make strides in uncovering more about them.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'm expecting one to spawn within the next few days, too.  
Which means we've got a bit of a long road ahead.  
Do feel free to prioritize anything else you've got going in the meantime.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Overnight stakeouts are tough. I'd hate to make you join me.  
Plus, I don't have the leeway to pay overtime.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And most of all...  
You've got a family waiting for you, don't you?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm?You could at least answer me.  
Heeey!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Wait.  
You're... you're not sleeping, are you?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I realize that it's late, but you're still on the job!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Whoa?!  
What's going on?! It's so bright!

Zzz... Zzz... ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
M-mmm...?  
*yawn*  
  
**Kasumi：**  
H-huh?  
When did I fall asleep?  
Feels like I had a really weird dream, too.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh. Good morning, {player}.  
I assume you woke me up.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But wait.  
This is class 1-A.  
You're in the year ahead, so why are you here?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Use those powers of deduction.  
**Choice: (2)**  Because I wanted to see you, Kasumi.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kasumi：**  
Huh?  
I mean, I *do* love theorizing and stuff,  
and I've always been a fan of the detectives that turn up in books.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But there's a reason they can do what they do, you know.  
A very simple one, in fact.  
It's because the author already holds the answer.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
They create the case,  
then guide the reader along using the detective as a proxy.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The real world has no authors, though.  
Uncovering the truth here isn't so simple.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But... I'll give it a shot.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kasumi：**  
W-what?  
Are you... implying something?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Actually,  
why are you calling me by my first name now?  
You were using my surname up until now.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh, but don't get me wrong.  
I'm not complaining.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You're always working so hard for other people's sake.  
I really look up to you in that regard.  
I-if anything, I always wanted to be friends.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh...  
I just had a eureka moment.  
I think I know why you're here now.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You're here to give me something back, aren't you?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
By which I mean the mystery novel I recommended to you.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Unlike other novels, it makes you uncover the truth yourself at the end.  
I came up with multiple theories, myself.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But I wanted to share opinions with someone else, too.  
That's why I recommended it to you.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's quite the complicated book, though.  
I'm surprised you finished reading it already.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ehehe.  
I've always wanted to share theories with someone else.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It'll feel like we're in a mystery novel of our own.  
Let's throw all our ideas out there,  
even if they're wrong or just plain weird. ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
See, I...  
I don't have any close friends I can talk to about the stuff I like.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
So I'm really happy I met you.  
It's so nice getting to talk to someone about my interests.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I wish I could bring myself to be bright and cheery.  
The sort of person that can get along with everyone else.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But, well, it turns out I'm rather shy.  
I struggle to talk to people. Except you, of course.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Hm?  
What's with that expression?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Was my theory off the mark,  
perhaps?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It was? Now this is a real mystery...  
Hm.  
Give me a hint, please!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Huh?  
You noticed me while passing by,  
so you decided to pop in and talk?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But now you feel bad about waking me up, do you?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ahaha.  
That's... fair enough.  
This is reality. Not a mystery novel.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
There's not some contrived reason for everything.  
No foreshadowing leading to a big reveal.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And as for the truth...  
It's rarely something we want it to be.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I knew that. Or, well, I *thought* I did.  
Yet here I am, left feeling upset and disappointed.  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
And that's another chapter over. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Think of what you just saw as something of a dream.  
Chances are you'll forget about it the second you wake up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
A special dream I put together for you,  
based on your old memories with Kasumi.  
Sort of like a movie, I suppose.  
  
**Ameth：**  
A movie directed by me, with the two of you as the main actors.  
Does that make sense?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I still can't work with any really significant memories,  
so there's no need to think about it too much right now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
More importantly,  
I didn't bring you here just for fun.  
There's something I need to warn you about.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ideally there would be a better way, but this is  
the only way we can meet. That's why I'm  
always turning up in your dreams.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway,  
don't get yourself too involved with Shadows.  
  
**Ameth：**  
They represent the discord this world currently faces.  
Bugs born from the forced reconstruction,  
twisted through wicked means.  
  
**Ameth：**  
There's no telling what will happen if you get in close contact with one.  
The bug itself could spread to you, leading to disastrous  
results. That would be the worst case scenario.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Not that I'd just sit by and let that happen, of course,  
but there's a limit to what I can do.  
Let sleeping dogs lie and all that.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Pass that on to Kasumi for me, will you?  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's a detective,  
so getting involved in this sort of stuff is her job.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And that was arguably her greatest wish.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But she's just going to tire herself out at this point.  
And, at worst, she might break down.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's your job to support her.  
To help her recover. To protect her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
After all,  
she looks up to you like no other.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Show her how cool you can be.  
That's exactly what she wants.

Zzz... Zzz...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
M-mmm...  
*yawn* Huh?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Wait. Did I fall asleep?  
No way!  
How could I let that happen in the middle of a stakeout?!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hey! He's asleep as well!  
Wake up!

**Kasumi：**  
Actually, why are you clinging onto me?  
I'm not your personal stuffed animal!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I-I really can't move...  
We're in big trouble if a Shadow appears now.  
It'll end up escaping if this keeps up.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But wait.  
What if one already appeared while we were asleep?  
That would be even worse.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I should search for any remaining traces of magic!

**Kasumi：**  
Oh.  
Phew...  
Looks like none have spawned yet.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
There's a unique property to the magic that envelops Shadows.  
Or rather, it'd be more accurate to say they're made up of said magic.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
As such, they leave traces of it when they spawn and move around.  
I learned that through my careful investigations, of course.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Heehee.  
We're getting closer and closer to the  
mystery behind these things.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hey.  
You could at least respond.  
Wait. You're asleep.

`image display end`  
**Kasumi：**  
Sheesh.  
That's one way to throw me off track.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
We're in the midst of an incredibly difficult case right now.  
Yet here you are,  
sleeping away peacefully.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ever heard of staying on your toes?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Not that I have the right to berate you.  
This is my case.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You're helping me out of goodwill.  
Actually, it's because you took the job on, but still...  
I can't force too much on you.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But, well...  
This is something I've always wanted.  
The two of us working together to solve a big case.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Wait...  
Huh?  
It hasn't been that long since we first met.  
Why would I feel that way?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'm not really sure.  
This is a mystery in and of itself.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
A mystery I'm somewhat afraid to solve, in all honesty.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ahh.  
The world's just full of mysteries, isn't it?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That's what keeps detectives like me busy, though.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And speaking of which... Wake up for me, will you?  
It's time we get to the bottom of this case.
