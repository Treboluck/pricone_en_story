**Kasumi：**  
Now then.  
I'm all ready. ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
My teeth are brushed,  
and my hair is too..  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Yup. I'm a cute detective if there ever was one.  
Actually, no. Make that majestic ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
My skin's not faring too well, though.  
No doubt because of my daily rhythm being thrown off balance recently.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But that's what the lotion Maho gave me is for.  
That made my skin silky smooth.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hehe.  
Thinking back, yesterday was  
over before I knew it.  
Most of it was spent  
explaining the job outline to my new faithful assistant.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But today is a new day.  
The investigation begins anew.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Urgh... I only realized *after* he went home that my  
hair was all over the place since I'd just woken up.  
That's beyond embarrassing...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
There's nothing more important than first impressions.  
Or that's what it said in that book, anyway.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's not too late, though.  
I'll show him that I can be cool.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The last thing I want is him thinking I'm some dimwitted detective.  
That would be terrible.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That said...  
He sure is taking his time.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Late on the first day?  
Is he that apathetic about the job?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That didn't seem like the case when we talked yesterday, though...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
He didn't really know what a detective does, but he said he'd do his  
best to learn,  
and that he'd give the assistant role all he's got.  
He seemed genuinely motivated.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Or maybe I just got the wrong impression?  
That seems plausible.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Urgh.  
I'm usually good at waiting thanks to all the stakeouts, but...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Something's off.  
I'm feeling really uneasy right now.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I kind of had big expectations, I guess.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I thought if the two of us worked together,  
I could live out the stories in the mystery novels I love so much.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'm not sure *why* I thought that, though.  
Especially in regards to someone I'd only just met.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Eeek?!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh! There you are!  
Making the boss wait, are we?  
You've sure got some nerve!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I hope you've got a good excuse prepared,  
because it won't be easy to convince me!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm?  
You got wrapped up in a mysterious case on your way here?  
That's what caused you to be late?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh, *please*.  
Do you think I was born yesterday?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But truth be told, you have piqued my attention.  
Give me the particulars, stat.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm... The place was the Sarendia Orphanage,  
where you currently live.  
The time was this morning, while breakfast was being prepared.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Wow.  
The knife you were using just snapped?  
Out of nowhere?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And the blade flew towards you, cutting your arm.  
Getting that treated is what caused you to be late?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm.  
Let's see your arm.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That does indeed look like a fresh wound.  
Which proves that you're not lying.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It wasn't an attempt on your life, at least.  
That's good.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm?  
Can I deduce what happened?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Come now.  
Who do you think you're talking to?  
I'm Caon's prized detective.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But alas, relying purely on your boss is cheating.  
You need to put some work in yourself.  
Let me hear your theory first, my dear assistant. ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I dunno.  
**Choice: (2)**  It was just an unfortunate accident.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kasumi：**  
That was fast.  
You ought to give it some more thought.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
We have the ability to think freely.  
It'd be a shame to put that to waste, wouldn't it?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kasumi：**  
Indeed.  
That's the smartest way to look at it.  
Particularly because it doesn't implicate anyone.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That said,  
the circumstances don't point to it being a simple accident.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But if you can chalk everything up to chance,  
then there's no harm in saying the case is closed.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
At the end of the day, a detective's job is to draw  
conclusions that leave everyone feeling satisfied.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
We work for those who desire answers,  
and the stories we piece together fulfill that desire.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
If you're satisfied with the conclusion you reached,  
then it's not my place to try and influence that.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kasumi：**  
Hehe.  
Looking a bit perplexed, aren't you?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Fine, fine.  
Let me put together the pieces that you're missing.  
That is my job, after all.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But before that, let me confirm something.  
When you say breakfast was being prepared,  
was it you that was doing the cooking?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It wasn't?  
Figures. You certainly don't look like the cooking type.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I see, I see.  
It was someone named Kokkoro, was it?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Waugh!  
You're absolutely certain she isn't the culprit?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You obviously have a lot of trust in her.  
But it's common knowledge to suspect those closest to you first, my dear.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Worry not, though.  
My theory doesn't pin her as the culprit.  
The opposite, in fact.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'll get right to the point.  
The culprit is none other than you.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You have the ability to power up those around you, correct?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh. Yes.  
I looked into your background a bit,  
so that's why I'm aware.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hehe.  
You should be able to figure out the rest,  
shouldn't you?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That's right.  
You powered her up with that ability of yours.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Most likely without realizing it.  
My assumption is that you were cheering her on,  
hoping for a delicious breakfast.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That, in turn,  
boosted her physical strength.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Of course,  
she herself was under the assumption that everything was as normal.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The knife itself couldn't handle the extra pressure, though.  
And thus it went flying towards you.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That, my friend, is the truth behind what happened.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Not that I've inspected the scene itself, of course.  
It's entirely possible that this theory is off.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
There is one undeniable fact,  
however.  
That power of yours carries more weight than you realize.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Its effects are potent. Miraculous, even.  
But you need to learn how to handle it properly.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Otherwise you may come out with more than just a slight  
injury next time.  
That should be your takeaway from this incident.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hehe.  
A handshake, is it?  
Please. You'll make me blush.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You seem plenty content, at least. That's a relief.  
Nothing makes the job feel more worth it  
than giving the client an answer they can feel satisfied with.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Enough with the games, though.  
It's about time we get to work.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
This is a case that *must* be solved.  
And solve it we will.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Follow me, my dear assistant.  
I'm truly looking forward  
to seeing how you perform.
