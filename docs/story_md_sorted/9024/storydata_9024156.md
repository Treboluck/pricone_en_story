I hope we've seen the last of him.  
Ugh, I'm covered in sweat from all that dancing.  
Forcing us to dance to its beat...  
 What a freaky ability.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I had a look around, but I couldn't see the village kids anywhere...  
Heeey, is anybody home~? We're here to rescue you!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Y-you idiot!  
Those orcs communicate using loud noises, don't they?  
If you shout like that, you'll bring the whole tribe down on us!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
R-right... Sorry, Karyl.  
Hey, Kokkoro, did you find anything?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
No, not to speak of.  
However, there is a path leading away from the settlement.  
Perhaps this is just one outpost for those creatures' tribe.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmmm...  
 Then I guess there's a lot more of them than we thought.  
I know the kids need us, but we ought to head back for now  
and report to the village guard so they're properly prepared.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
All righty!  
 In that case, let's hurry!  
I've got some dried meat I prepared along the way,  
so let's fill our bellies and head back!  
 There's enough for everyone!  
  
**Karyl：**  
\"Along the way\"?  
 Does that mean more monster meat?!
