**Kaori：**  
Aha...  
I'm real sorry, {player}!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I can't believe I took you to that barbecue restaurant,  
but then didn't have the money to pay for the food!  
After I said it was my treat, too... Really, my bad!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Thing is, I usually don't carry money around with me...  
It had totally slipped my mind!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Most of the time, you can get by without money...  
Things work out in the end!  
  
**Kaori：**  
This time, too, they said if I come here to Mount Verio  
to gather some rare charcoal and ingredients...  
  
**Kaori：**  
...they'll let me off the hook and call my debts paid!  
There's kindness everywhere if you look for it!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I did promise in the first place that I'd pay for the meal,  
so you didn't really need to come along as well, you know?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hmm?  
You want to pay for what you ate?  
You're such a stickler! I really don't mind!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Since we keep taking breaks for you to catch your breath,  
it's not like you're speeding things up! It'd probably be easier on my own.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Even so, I do appreciate the thought!  
Let's go adventuring!  
 Look out, the ground's uneven there!  
Here, take my hand a moment! Up we go!  
  
**Kaori：**  
{player}, you should work on your stamina!  
You really are pretty weak.  
D'you want me to teach you karate? Or dancing?  
  
**Kaori：**  
This Mount Verio is pretty high up, so the air's kind of thin.  
It's an active volcano too, so there are weird gases and stuff.  
Even breathing can be a struggle.  
 I ought to be careful too...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Tell me if you feel woozy, OK?  
I'd be happy to carry you back down!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm OK. Just a little tired.  
**Choice: (2)**  A piggyback ride sounds good!  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaori：**  
OK. You can't be too careful, though,  
  
so make sure you tell me if you're struggling!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Mount Verio's home to some pretty tough monsters, too!  
Let's be cautious and take care of ourselves!

`Tag 2`  
**Kaori：**  
Ohhh...?!  
You sure don't hesitate, huh?  
  
**Kaori：**  
We've barely even started the climb! You can't be that tired yet.  
C'mon, you can do it!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha! See, a little climbing isn't too hard, is it?  
C'mon, widdle baby, do you need a hug?  
You poor widdle thing. There, there, there!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kaori：**  
Oho! I think we found our target.  
 That's the charcoal  
that can only be found on Mount Verio!  
 I hear when you  
grill meat with it, it gets smoked to perfection!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Right, let's fill this bag with the stuff!  
Aha! My hands are going black with the soot!  
I could draw on your face with this! Here, have a 'stache! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha! This is so fun! It's like a picnic!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Huh? We're doing this for work, so we should  
take it seriously?  
 Ah, sorry... This is just how I am!  
I am trying to do the actual work properly, you know?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Right! Now all we need is the rare ingredient, and our  
work is done!  
 Apparently there's this boar monster that's  
totally covered in lava, and its meat is a real delicacy!  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's a pretty tough monster,and it's only found on  
this one mountain, so it's not easy to come by.  
  
**Kaori：**  
The restaurant owner can't come and get it himself,  
so he asked us for the favor!  
  
**Kaori：**  
But if this monster's covered in hot lava,  
it'll just look like part of the scenery until it moves, huh?  
  
**Kaori：**  
And the air around here stinks of sulfur,  
so my nose isn't going to be much use either...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Should we give up on the rare ingredient for now and just  
deliver the charcoal first?  
 It's not like there's any big hurry.  
We can come back and try as many times as it takes!  
  
**Kaori：**  
More to the point... My belly's rumbling like crazy!  
Is it OK if we have lunch now?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Yeah! I brought this cooler box that Maho enchanted,  
and it's full of meat, ripe for cooking!  
 I've got a basic  
grill and marinade, too, so we can cook it right here!  
  
**Kaori：**  
And look at all this premium charcoal!  
Doesn't having our own private barbecue sound like fun?!  
Of course, most things are fun in my book, but still!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'd love it if you could have a good time too! There's nothing  
to stop me from having barbecues or dancing on my own,  
but it's so much better if I share the fun with you!
