**Kaori：**  
You ready to go, {player}?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Then let's go!  
I'll toss the goya-ish veggies down from the top of the tree,  
so you get that net ready to catch them!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Yep, looks good! This'll be easy!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Thanks for coming to help, by the way!  
Once we've got a nice big haul,  
I'll use them to cook up something extra tasty for you!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Yup! Don't worry, I got permission  
from the leader of those bandit-looking guys  
who're growing these things in their territory!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Actually, the bossman said it'd be great if I could  
harvest them for him,  
 'cause he couldn't do it himself  
with his back pains.  
  
**Kaori：**  
His underlings seemed too busy with other stuff  
to handle it, too.  
 He even said he'd pay us, so this  
is good honest work!  
  
**Kaori：**  
The guys back at Caon weren't quite as impressed, mind you.  
They were all, \"Why are you picking vegetables instead of  
protecting the city?!\"  
  
**Kaori：**  
But you know, once I give them a taste of some  
delicious dishes using these,  
 they'll be all smiles!  
Can't sweat the small stuff!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Right then, let's get started!  
I'll keep the veggies coming one after another, so don't miss any!  
One, two, three, catch!  
  
**Kaori：**  
W-wha?!  
That freaky light is glowing around us again!  
Waaahhh! That was so sudden, it threw me off balance!  
  
**Kaori：**  
W-w-whoa-oa-oa!  
I-I'm gonna faaaaall!

**Kaori：**  
{player}! Haitai!  
  
**Kaori：**  
We run into each other a lot, huh?  
What're you doing out here?  
Yup, I'm still hanging around in Tokyo for now!  
  
**Kaori：**  
There's another karate tournament pretty soon,  
so I thought I'd stick around for that!  
 Easier than going  
all the way home to Okinawa and then coming back, right?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Good luck in the tournament!  
**Choice: (2)**  Were you looking for something just now?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaori：**  
Thanks! I'll give it everything I've got!  
My eyes are on the prize,  
so you should come and cheer me on!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kaori：**  
Oh! You're pretty observant today, huh?  
Is it just me, or are you usually a bit more oblivious?  
I guess they do say boys grow up fast!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kaori：**  
Aha...  
Anyway, you haven't seen a cat around here, have you?  
The little thing went and stole my pouch!  
  
**Kaori：**  
What kind of cat?  
Ehmm... It was a sort of chubby-looking calico cat.  
  
**Kaori：**  
It'll still be carrying my pouch in its mouth,  
so it should be easy to recognize!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Huh? It's right over there?  
You can see it? Where?  
Ohhh! It's up on that tree branch!  
  
**Kaori：**  
What a bad kitty! Don't you move an inch!  
Give that pouch back!  
Or else I'll make a shamisen out of you!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'm gonna climb up there and try to catch it.  
You stay on alert in case it tries to run away, OK?  
Cats are nimble little things, so catching it might be tricky!  
  
**Kaori：**  
All right, I'm off!  
Up we go, up we go!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hmm? What's wrong, {player}? Are you hurt?  
Why're you covering your face and looking away like that?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Huh? Why am I not wearing underwear?  
That's the problem! The cat took it!  
  
**Kaori：**  
It struck while I was getting changed,  
and all my underwear was in the pouch it took!  
Ooh, it feels so weird climbing trees like this!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oh... Were you looking away to avoid seeing anything, then?  
I guess you're a gentleman after all! Aha!  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's fine, really! I don't mind if you...  
 Uwahh?!  
Oh no, the cat spotted me coming!  
It's gonna get away!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hey, wait! Give back my panties!  
W-wah? Awahh! I rushed too much and lost my balance!  
I'm gonna faaaall!

**Kaori：**  
Urghh...  
S-sorry, {player}!  
Thanks a bunch for catching me... You're not hurt, are you?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Eheheh...  
At least I managed to grab the pouch back!  
Now I can finally dress like a civilized human being again!  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's not like I *wanted* to go running around in this state!  
Uweh? {player}?  
What's wrong? Are you passed out?!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I guess you did just catch me... Did the impact knock you out?  
Wait, is that blood coming from your nose?  
Oh no, oh no! I should wipe it with something!  
  
**Kaori：**  
These panties would be... a bad idea, right?  
I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Even I can't wave this one off  
with a \"don't sweat the small stuff\"!

**Ameth：**  
Hmmm... Now I'm starting to feel worried  
about our Kaori's current state of dress, too...  
You had a rough time there, huh, {player}?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Or perhaps you enjoyed that last part?  
I know you have amnesia, but how much do you  
remember about \"that\" sort of thing?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Did I see a smile creep onto your face?  
Come on, tell me all the juicy details!  
You little pervert! Eheheheh...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ah, but this is no time to be teasing you, is it?  
It looks like I picked a bad time for this,  
and our Kaori is about to take a bit of a tumble too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You'd better wake up and try to catch her a second time!  
Who knows, there might even be a little something  
in it for you...  
 Right?  
  

---  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aughh...  
H-huh?  
Was I passed out just now?  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'm real sorry, {player}!  
Looks like you caught me as I fell out of the tree, huh?  
You're not hurt, right?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha!  
I guess I was so busy trying to protect the veggies I picked,  
I forgot to protect my own head, and knocked myself out!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'm such an idiot!  
But hey, at least these goya thingies do seem to be safe!  
  
**Kaori：**  
It looks like we were both out cold for a fair while,  
so we'd better hurry and gather the rest!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Can you stand up, {player}?  
There there, looks like you're fine!  
Let's get back to our little harvesting job then, shall we?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hm?  
What is it, {player}?  
Huh? Panties? What about them?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Well, yes, I'm wearing them.  
Yeah... I forget them occasionally, but today I'm fine!  
See, see? They're right here!  
  
**Kaori：**  
But {player}, why would you suddenly ask  
that?  
 That's kinda weird. I guess you're a boy after all!  
Interested in that sort of thing, are you?  
  
**Kaori：**  
...Hey, {player}...  
Can you climb trees?  
If you can't, then learn! I can teach you!  
  
**Kaori：**  
So listen, it's your turn to go up there  
and pick the veggies this time!  
  
**Kaori：**  
You've got some funny ideas in your head today,  
so if I climb up there, you'll probably stare, won't you?  
  
**Kaori：**  
You won't? Really...?  
Well, um, it's not like this is a skirt, so I guess  
you wouldn't be able to see anything either way...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hmmm....  
But for some reason I feel all self-conscious today!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Why's that, I wonder?  
If it was anyone but you, I don't think I'd be bothered  
if they saw anything...
