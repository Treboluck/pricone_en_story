# Kaori Episode 4
Ameth uses her power to show {player} and Kaori a dream of another world. In the dream, Kaori arrives in Tokyo from Okinawa to enter a national karate tournament. She's quite particular about her local cuisine, so she brought her grandma's family sauce.

**Kaori：**  
*munch munch*  
*munch...*  
 Ahhh... It's still not quite right...  
  
**Kaori：**  
I used the goya-ish veggies you and me picked together  
to make some recipes from back home,  
but they still  
only taste like an imitation...  
  
**Kaori：**  
They're similar, but not the same...  
The flavor is really close, but there's something still missing...  
Seasoning? Texture? Appearance? Ahhh... I just don't know!  
  
**Kaori：**  
As thanks for your help gathering them,  
I really wanted to let you feast on the real deal...  
  
**Kaori：**  
But at this rate, it's not good enough...  
It won't get across even a fraction of my gratitude...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hmm?  
It's really good?  
  
**Kaori：**  
I appreciate you saying that, but...  
You really don't have to force yourself to eat it!  
I'll give any leftovers to the other guys at Caon!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'm on guild cooking duty today, you know!  
So actually, it's better if you don't eat it all,  
since I'd just have to make even more for the guys later!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Gueh?!  
What's this? There's light all around us?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oopsie...? Did I step on a sneaky magic circle or something?  
I do make silly mistakes like that a lot!  
  

---  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hey, {player}!  
Haitai! ☆  
  
**Kaori：**  
What a fluke! Didn't think I'd run into you here. What's up?  
Huh...? That's not much of a reaction...  
You didn't forget all about me, did you?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha! Well, if you did, I can always just make friends  
with you all over again!  
It's no big deal!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's good to see you, Kaori Kyan.  
**Choice: (2)**  ...  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaori：**  
Um...? Why are you suddenly using my full name?  
You sound weirdly formal, too...  
Almost like we're not friends...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kaori：**  
Oh? {player}... Don't tell me  
you can't talk 'cause your mouth's full of hamburgers?  
Or maybe you ate so many, you're choking on them?!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oh no!  
Let me whack you on the back! Ka-thwack!  
That feel better?!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kaori：**  
Aha!  
Good, looks like you remember me after all!  
That's a relief!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I know I act all friendly with pretty much anyone,  
but it's not like I just want superficial relationships!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I really do want to get to know you better!  
If you don't mind, of course!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hmm?  
 Oh, I came to Tokyo for the national karate  
tournament! The tournament's over now,  
 but it seemed a  
shame to head straight home, so I'm just hanging around!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha!  
There's so much to see here in the city!  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's like an early summer vacation!  
Grandpa and Grandma said I should widen my horizons, too!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I don't have much money left, so I'm having a bit of trouble  
with where to stay and what to eat...  
But hey, can't sweat the small stuff!  
  
**Kaori：**  
The big city's pretty different from Okinawa,  
but we're all human, right?  
 As long as I stay friendly  
and honest, we can all get along!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hmm? If I'm hungry, I can have a hamburger?  
I'd rather not help myself to someone else's food!  
...You're sure?  
 You ordered too much, and you can't eat it all?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Eheheh...  
I didn't say hi to you  
so I could beg you for food, but...  
  
**Kaori：**  
That's really nice of you! Thanks!  
You're always so helpful!  
 You're the best! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Time to dig in! *munch munch*  
Aha...! ☆  
American foods like burgers remind me of home, too!  
  
**Kaori：**  
This takes me back...  
Though I feel like it's kind of missing something?  
Oh, maybe it's the seasoning.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Let me use my grandma's special sauce!  
As long as I have this, I can enjoy the taste of home anywhere!  
I always bring it with me! Ahaha!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Thanks a bunch though, {player}! Thanks to  
the meal we shared, my belly and my heart are both full now!  
If you'd like, let's hang out again! In real life and in Astrum!

**Ameth：**  
Her grandma's special sauce...?  
What could it be like? I am curious.  
Flavors are a bit of a mystery for me, you know.  
  
**Ameth：**  
How about those burgers, though?  
Did the taste of fast food remind you of home, too?  
Maybe you understand how Kaori feels a little better now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You may not always appreciate it,  
but you're a long way from home too, after all.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, at any rate...  
Everything you saw just now was something like a dream.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you see in the dream  
depends on the person you've forged connections with...  
  
**Ameth：**  
But perhaps having a dream like this suggests that you  
miss your home too, somewhere deep down.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It might be cruel of me to grant that wish  
in such an ephemeral form...  
  
**Ameth：**  
But there's little else I can do right now.  
So enjoy the foods you knew, and hang in there until  
the time is ripe. Just like your friend Kaori is doing.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, that's enough for today.  
Bye-bye! See you around!  
  

---  
  
**Kaori：**  
{player}?  
What's up? You look pretty spaced out...  
  
**Kaori：**  
I guess the food really wasn't great, huh?  
You seem kind of down...  
Like you're sad about something?  
  
**Kaori：**  
...Huh? I look the same way?  
You think so...?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Maybe I do feel a bit lonely.  
Spending so long away from home and all.  
But you know, can't sweat the small stuff!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I can't go back to my original home right now,  
but I can make Landosol like a new home to me!  
The more precious places I have, the richer my life gets! ☆  
  
**Kaori：**  
So for the time being...  
Even if I get a little sad sometimes,  
I think I can keep on smiling!  
  
**Kaori：**  
'Cause I'm surrounded by people I love,  
singing and dancing and having plenty of fun!
