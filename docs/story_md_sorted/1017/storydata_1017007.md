# Kaori Episode 7
{player} is injured fighting the monsters on Mount Verio, so Kaori carries him down to safety. It's a long way to the city, so they have to camp outdoors, but Kaori doesn't seem to mind at all, and starts happily humming a lullaby from her homeland.
  
## Subtitle: An Open-Air Lullaby
  
**Kaori：**  
{player}?  
Wake up, {player}!  
  
**Kaori：**  
There—haitai!  
Morning! You slept like a log!  
  
**Kaori：**  
So, um...  
Do you remember where we are?  
Still a bit sleepy, huh? Your face is totally blank!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Let's see... You remember we went hiking up Mount Verio  
to fetch charcoal and meat for that barbecue restaurant, right?  
And on the way, we had ourselves a barbecue picnic?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Well, the thing is, I guess the monsters were hungry too,  
because we ended up surrounded! We had to fight them!  
And that's when you got knocked out by one of their attacks.  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'm really sorry... There were just so many of them,  
I couldn't keep you safe enough...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Does it still hurt anywhere?  
 Let me rub it better! There, there!  
I already gave you basic first aid, and the wounds didn't seem  
too bad...  
  
**Kaori：**  
But just to be totally safe, I thought I should take you  
to get proper treatment...  
So I headed down toward the city.  
  
**Kaori：**  
But it's a pretty long trip, y'know?  
I carried you a fair way down, but then sunset came along!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Mountain trails are dangerous after dark,  
so I thought we'd camp out here for tonight.  
  
**Kaori：**  
I didn't really bring any camping equipment,  
so we'll just have to make do with what nature offers...  
  
**Kaori：**  
But I did at least find a cave to shelter in,  
so we should be safe from the elements.  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'm used to this kind of thing.  
Before I joined up with Caon, I spent a lot of nights  
sleeping in the grass or under bridges!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Did I mention this before?  
I originally came to Landosol just to visit, as a tourist,  
  
but then I got stuck here and couldn't go back home.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Problem is, I came here using the warp gate system, but then  
its use was forbidden for some reason. I've applied to go home  
a bunch of times, but they just won't give me permission.  
  
**Kaori：**  
I don't really get why this happened...  
But anyway, until I find a way back home,  
I'm living in this city!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Since the guys at Caon took me in,  
life here isn't too bad either, you know?  
  
**Kaori：**  
So anyway, I don't mind camping out in the open,  
but you're pretty weak, so I'm worried you might catch a cold.  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's not too chilly, is it?  
I'll lie down and warm you up!  
Ahaha! Kidding, kidding!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oh, by the way, among the monsters that attacked us  
was the rare boar we were looking for!  
  
I managed to get some of its meat, so our job's a success after all!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Now all we need to do is get home safely!  
So you just rest and recover your energy.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You should rest too.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm sorry for the trouble...  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaori：**  
Mm...  
Thanks a bunch for worrying about me!  
  
**Kaori：**  
But I'm just fine!  
You know me, always healthy and full of energy!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kaori：**  
Trouble?  
Oh, I don't mind that at all!  
I'm the one who should say sorry!  
  
**Kaori：**  
It was my fault in the first place  
that you got mixed up in all this, remember?  
  
**Kaori：**  
So there's no reason for you to feel bad at all!  
I'd've been lonely coming out here alone,  
so I'm really glad to have you for company, too!  
  
**Kaori：**  
You see...  
Somehow I really can't stand  
lonely places where it's all quiet.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kaori：**  
Aha... I guess it's to be expected on a volcano,  
but our faces are all covered in soot!  
 There's a spring  
not far from here, so shall we go have a wash?  
  
**Kaori：**  
I didn't bring any spare clothes,  
 but if we wash these ones  
and hang them up, they'll be dry by morning!  
Until then, we can just go without, I guess!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Huh? That's a problem?  
It'd be fine by me! Would you be too embarrassed?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Huh, I see... I'm not very sensitive to these things...  
Kasumi always says I've got no delicacy!  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's fine, though! No point trying to change the person I am!  
Right? Why worry about my weaknesses when I can just  
play to my strengths? Can't sweat the small stuff!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oopsie...  
I'm making too much of a fuss, aren't I?  
  
**Kaori：**  
You still look pretty sleepy, and it's getting really dark outside.  
Better go back to sleep, I think!  
I'll go take a wash while you rest.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha! You find it tricky to go to sleep outdoors?  
Then I'll sing you a little lullaby!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Back in my old home, we all loved this song.  
We'd always sing it together every night!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Here in Landosol, people get mad if you're noisy at night,  
so it's hard to do that.  
But right now, there's only me and you here, so it's fine!  
  
**Kaori：**  
We're a long way from my homeland,  
but I'll always have the Uchina blood in my veins!  
  
**Kaori：**  
No matter where I go or what happens,  
I'm still my grandma and grandpa's little Typhoon Girl!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Now, lullaby time!  
Tell me if my singing bothers you, OK?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Good night and sweet dreams, {player}.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hmmhmhmhmhmmm~ ♪
