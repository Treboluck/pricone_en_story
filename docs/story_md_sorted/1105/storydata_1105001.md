# Kaori (Summer) Episode 1
Kaori is invited to perform at a seaside dance party. One of the strings on her instrument snaps beforehand, but she's able to speak to a monster through the universal language of music and procure one of its whiskers to use as a replacement.

**Narration：**  
{player} is taking a stroll  
through Landosol's plaza on a certain summer's day.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oh! There you are!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I've been looking for you!  
I thought it'd be easy,  
but I forgot how elusive you can be!  
Running all over the city made for good exercise, though! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hm? You'll wipe the sweat off for me?  
Aha! You're super thoughtful. ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Let's get going!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Where to?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaori：**  
You'll see when we get there!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Huh?  
`Tag 2`  
**Kaori：**  
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aaand we're here!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hm? What's up?  
You look super surprised.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oh, did you think I was gonna drag you to a volcano again?  
Nah. Volcanoes are way too hot in the summer.  
  
**Kaori：**  
There's gonna be a dance party at that stage over there today.  
Everyone's gonna feast, go wild and dance like they've never danced before!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Truth is... they asked me to perform, too!  
I'm gonna be using an instrument from my homeland! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
That's why I brought you here.  
I want you to hear me perform as well. ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Actually, did you have any other plans today?  
Sorry.  
I was just so happy when I found you that  
I kinda forced you into coming along.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  It's fine.  
**Choice: (4)**  I've never had plans in my life.  
`Tag 3`  
**Kaori：**  
Great!  
Kasumi's always yelling at me about stopping to think before I act.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Kaori：**  
Really?  
Then I'll bring you along whenever something comes up! ♪  
Not a problem if you're free,  
right?  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Kaori：**  
Man, that's a relief!  
Okay, okay. I'm gonna go get changed!  
No point in being at the beach if you're not in a swimsuit! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Sorry for the wait!  
  
**Kaori：**  
The sunlight feels so nice on my skin! ♪  
Hm? You look kinda puzzled.  
  
**Kaori：**  
There's not that much difference?  
Hey, that's not true!  
  
**Kaori：**  
There's less fabric, plus the material's different.  
Come on, give it a touch! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Totally different, right?  
Yup, yup. Glad you agree. ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hm. Feels like I can hear the sea calling for me now.  
Listen close. It's begging me to go for a swim!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I won't, though. I've gotta hold back the urge.  
The party's tonight, so I need to get to practicing!  
  
**Kaori：**  
This is the instrument I'll be using.  
It's called a sanshin. Funny shape, right?  
  
**Kaori：**  
All the kids back home are taught how to play it by their grandparents.  
People, animals  
and even monsters'll start dancing if I play it!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Lemme give it a test run!  
  
**Kaori：**  
♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oh!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oops.  
I didn't expect one of the strings to break.  
  
**Kaori：**  
I replace them pretty frequently, y'know.  
Sucky timing.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hm? Then again, it could have broken in the middle of the performance,  
so I guess it was good timing?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ahhh... I forgot that I didn't bring any spare strings.  
Hm... Now I'm in a pickle.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Think anyone else would have a spare?  
`Tag 6`  
**Kaori：**  
Anyone...  
else?  
  
**Kaori：**  
That's it!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Should be around here somewhere!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Kaori：**  
There it is!  
  
**Kaori：**  
This critter's whiskers are real strong and durable.  
They're the perfect replacement for an instrument's strings! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Look how bushy it is, too.  
It's so adorable.  
  
**Monster：**  
SKRRREEE!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hm? You think I'm in danger?  
Don't worry!  
It's just wary of people. It won't actually harm anyone. ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Definitely doesn't seem like it'll happily give me  
one of its whiskers if I ask politely, though.  
  
**Kaori：**  
But that's where  
this comes in!  
Ta-da! Sanshin time! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's missing a string,  
but it should still do the trick. ♪  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Look. It's nice and docile now.  
Seems like these types of monsters can feel sounds through their whiskers.  
  
**Kaori：**  
You can communicate with them by playing music like this. ♪  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha! That tickles! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
So, mind if I take one of your whiskers?  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Thanks so much!  
I'll get this strung up in a jiffy.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Just gotta twist these parts around,  
wrap and tie it all up,  
set the bridge up, and then do some tuning.  
  
**Kaori：**  
There we go!  
Back to normal!  
Actually, it sounds even better than it used to!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Lemme give it a test run. ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Makes your body wanna dance on its own, doesn't it?  
Don't fight it. Just let it happen. ♪  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Look. That's how you do it! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
♪  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus a comforting melody resounded through  
the forest for a brief period of time.
