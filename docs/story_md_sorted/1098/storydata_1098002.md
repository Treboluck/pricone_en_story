**Narration：**  
One peaceful afternoon...  
  
**Ram：**  
...Oh, look at the time.  
Rem should be back from her shopping trip soon.  
  
**Ram：**  
She's doing all the chores so well.  
I'll have to tell her she's almost as great as I am.  
  
**Ram：**  
Whew... A big sister's work is never done.  
  
**Ram：**  
Still, she blushes so cutely when I praise her.  
Just picturing it fills me with motivation.  
  
**Ram：**  
I really couldn't ask for a sweeter little sister...  
  
**Ram：**  
...  
  
**???：**  
...Oh, just leave me alone!  
  
**Ram：**  
...Hm? What's all this ruckus?  
  
**???：**  
I hate you so much, Big Sis!  
  
**Ram：**  
Well, well. This sounds like quite the ugly squabble.  
  
**Girl 1：**  
You're such a big bully!  
Can't you tell I'm trying to do my best here?!  
  
**Girl 2：**  
A-all I wanted to do was help...  
  
**Girl 1：**  
I told you I don't need help!  
Ugh, you're always like this...  
  
**Girl 1：**  
You never even have to try,  
so you'll never understand how I feel!  
  
**Girl 2：**  
...!  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Ah...  
  
**Girl 1：**  
...H-hmph!  
  
**Ram：**  
...  
  
**Ram：**  
Well, she certainly spoke her mind.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Those poor sisters...  
`Tag 1`  
**Ram：**  
You were watching? What a peeping Tom.  
Still, those two usually get along so well...  
  
**Ram：**  
\"You'll never understand how I feel,\" huh...  
  
**Ram：**  
That actually hits home.  
It's enough to make my poor little heart burst.  
  
**Ram：**  
Huh?  
You don't think hearts are that small?  
  
**Ram：**  
Are you calling me an idiot?  
Of course I know how big hearts are.  
  
**Ram：**  
Anyway...  
You there, girl. Tell me what happened.  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Huh?  
Oh... Hi there, Ram...  
  
**Ram：**  
That spat wasn't a pretty sight.  
...First time you've fought with your sister?  
  
**Girl 2：**  
How did you know...?  
  
**Ram：**  
That's simple.  
When I had my first fight with Rem,  
it was over something very similar.  
  
**Ram：**  
It's hard to hear those words from your sister.  
It feels like you're being torn apart.  
  
**Girl 2：**  
...Yeah.  
  
**Girl 2：**  
I just wanted to help her out, that's all.  
  
**Girl 2：**  
But I guess I was a nuisance...  
  
**Ram：**  
Of course you weren't.  
You just can't keep holding her hand forever.  
  
**Ram：**  
Everyone wants to stand firm  
and walk on their own two feet once in a while.  
  
**Ram：**  
If you want to make up with her,  
it might be hard, but you'll have to wait a little.  
  
**Ram：**  
I'll go and have a word with her.  
  
**Girl 2：**  
You'll talk to her?  
Why would you do that for us?  
  
**Ram：**  
Isn't that obvious?  
  
**Ram：**  
It's because I'm the adorable Rem's perfect big sister.  
  
**Ram：**  
...  
  
**Ram：**  
Well? Why are you just standing there?  
Get a move on and come with me.  
  
**Ram：**  
Do you really think I know where that girl's room is?  
  
**Girl 1：**  
*sigh* Big Sis...  
  
**Ram：**  
I'm coming in.  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Wahhh?!  
Huh? Huh? Ram? Why're you—?!  
  
**Ram：**  
Oh yes, I'm here.  
And I even brought this dolt along for the ride.  
  
**Ram：**  
Now then, about your fight just now...  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Ahhh...  
  
**Ram：**  
You regret it, don't you?  
You didn't mean to say those spiteful things.  
  
**Girl 1：**  
I didn't... mean it?  
  
**Ram：**  
No, of course you didn't.  
You love your big sister, don't you?  
Even if she gets on your nerves now and then.  
  
**Girl 1：**  
I said... some really nasty things to her...  
  
**Ram：**  
Were you jealous that she can do things better than you?  
  
**Girl 1：**  
...  
  
**Ram：**  
Of course not.  
You were just angry at yourself for not doing better.  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Big Sis didn't do anything wrong...  
  
**Ram：**  
That's right, she didn't.  
Besides, she's not as strong as you think.  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Ram：**  
All the world's big sisters try to act tough in front of their little sisters.  
  
**Ram：**  
Because they want to be the reliable big sisters they deserve.  
  
**Girl 1：**  
...What, even you?  
  
**Ram：**  
Oh no, I'm the exception.  
Being perfect just comes naturally to me.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Way to ruin the whole spiel.  
`Tag 2`  
**Ram：**  
Oh? You're still here?  
Don't just stand there.  
Wave your arms and get the air circulating or something.  
  
**Ram：**  
...Wow, he actually did it.  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Eheh... Ahaha! You're so funny!  
  
**Ram：**  
Finally, a smile on your face.  
  
**Girl 1：**  
...Thanks a whole lot, Ram.  
But... how should I say sorry to my big sis...?  
  
**Ram：**  
A single word of apology  
should be enough for her to forgive you.  
  
**Girl 1：**  
...  
  
**Ram：**  
But... let's see.  
If that's not enough to satisfy you...  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Then...?  
  
**Ram：**  
There's only one thing for it.  
  
**Ram：**  
I bet you didn't know,  
but I'm a master at making steamed taters.  
  
**Girl 2：**  
...  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Ah... Big Sis...!  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Oh!  
Um, listen, I really didn't mean to...  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Wait!  
Listen, I, um... Take this!  
  
**Girl 2：**  
This is... a potato?  
  
**Girl 1：**  
A-a steamed tater...  
Ram taught me how to cook it...  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Ram taught you...?  
  
**Girl 2：**  
...  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Can I eat it?  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Y-yeah!  
I'd really... like you to eat it...  
  
**Girl 2：**  
*munch*... *munch munch*  
  
**Girl 1：**  
...  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Mm... it's really good!  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Really?!  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Yes, really!  
Like, wow... I don't think I could make it this good!  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Will you make it for me again?  
  
**Girl 1：**  
...No, I don't wanna.  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Next time,  
 I want to make some *with* you, Big Sis!  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Ah...  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Yeah! Let's do that!

**Choice: (4)**  Those steamed taters look tasty.  
`Tag 3`  
**Ram：**  
The little sister apologized.  
What kind of big sister wouldn't forgive her?  
  
Jump to tag 5

**Ram：**  
Well, of course.  
They're the second-tastiest steamed taters in the world.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Ram：**  
Thanks for your help, too.  
Not that you did much but stand around.  
  
**Ram：**  
And besides...

**Rem：**  
Phew, that took longer than I thought.  
I got caught up chatting with the Gourmet Guild on the way...  
  
**Ram：**  
...Rem.  
  
**Rem：**  
Dear sister!  
I just returned from my errand.  
  
**Rem：**  
...Oh?  
What's this...  
 delicious scent in the air?  
  
**Rem：**  
And dear sister...  
 You look so pleased with yourself!  
  
**Ram：**  
Do I really?  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes, you really do!  
When you're happy,  
 it makes me happy too!  
  
**Ram：**  
...  
  
**Ram：**  
Well, yes.  
I suppose that's right.  
  
**Rem：**  
What is it, dear sister?  
  
**Ram：**  
No, it's nothing.  
I just reaffirmed that I'm the world's greatest big sister.  
  
**Rem：**  
...  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes, of course you are!  
Nobody else could beat my big sister!  
  
**Ram：**  
Hah!
