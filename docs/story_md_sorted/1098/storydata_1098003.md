## Subtitle: A Servant's Role
  
**Narration：**  
Another lazy afternoon in Landosol...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, turn your head this way for a moment.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, hold still while I wipe your mouth.  
...  
Wipe... wipe... There.  
Good, your face is all clean once more.  
  
**Ram：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Now, allow me to remove your napkin.  
Can you raise your arms high for me, please?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, very well done!  
I must say you have become a regular professional at arm-raising.  
  
**Ram：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Now then, what shall we do next?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see... You feel very full?  
In that case, perhaps you would like to rest on my lap...  
  
**Ram：**  
Hold it right there.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes?  
Is something the matter, Miss Ram?  
  
**Ram：**  
Don't you \"Is something the matter?\" me.  
  
**Ram：**  
Where do you think we are?  
This is a public eatery, for heaven's sake.  
  
**Ram：**  
How in the world can he bear to be babied like this in public?  
  
**Ram：**  
Even I'm not this bad, and I've never once resisted  
my sweet sister's constant efforts to please.  
  
**Ram：**  
Surely you can see all this pampering is beyond excessive?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
N-no, I do not see any issue.  
Besides, to care for my lord is my life's singular calling.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Of course, it is a personal matter,  
so I may not be officially employed as his servant...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But Miss Ram, you are a maid, yes?  
Can you not appreciate the desire to serve a master faithfully?  
  
**Ram：**  
...Well, yes, I can understand that.  
I too have sworn my loyalty to Master Roswaal.  
  
**Ram：**  
But Master Roswaal is a magnificent fellow  
who takes care of most matters himself.  
  
**Ram：**  
The thought of treating him  
like you treat {player} is laughable.  
There is no comparison.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I can appreciate your perspective,  
but my lord requires more time to reach that stage.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As such, would you allow us  
to continue as we are for the time being?  
  
**Ram：**  
Why must you be so...  
No, I suppose this is none of my business to begin with.  
  
**Ram：**  
Still, I will at least say this.  
Spoiling him too much won't do either of you any good.  
  
**Ram：**  
If you're not careful,  
you'll only end up standing in the way of his growth.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Ram...  
  
**Ram：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I can stand on my own feet!  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
M-my lord...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Though he clearly longs to nap,  
he is rubbing his sleepy eyes and standing up!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
How noble, my lord!  
My heart, it swells with pride and admiration!  
  
**Ram：**  
Ugh, they're way too far gone...  
  
**Man：**  
Hey, little missus and pals.  
Would you happen to be from the Gourmet Guild?  
  
**Ram：**  
Hm...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, we do happen to be members of that guild.  
Do you have business with us?  
  
**Man：**  
Well, there's some admin stuff  
we need to quickly clear up about your guildhouse.  
  
**Man：**  
It won't take all that long,  
so would you be able to spare a few minutes?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Admin, you say.  
Very well, then. I will attend to it.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine and Miss Karyl are away,  
and my lord should not need to worry about such things.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I will take care  
 of whatever duties you require us to fulfill.  
  
**Man：**  
O-oh...?  
 That right?  
Then if you could come along to the guildhouse...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As you wish.  
...  
Well then, my lord, if you will excuse me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I must excuse myself, but...  
  
**Ram：**  
...What? If you're going, then go.  
Why are you staring in my direction?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Ram, this may be a presumptuous request,  
but might I ask you to take care of my lord until I return?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You are a responsible individual,  
so I would find it most reassuring to know that you are with him.  
  
**Ram：**  
You're asking me?  
Right after I told you to stop babying him?  
  
**Ram：**  
If you think I'll gladly accept, you're crazy.  
I'm no model of benevolence like Miss Emilia, you know.  
  
**Ram：**  
And I'm not a perfect sweetheart who can't say no like Rem, either.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I understand what you are saying.  
However, I beg you to do this, just this once.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord is more precious to me than anything.  
It pains me to leave him unattended for any measure of time.  
  
**Ram：**  
...  
  
**Ram：**  
You don't want to expose him to any chance of danger, huh.  
  
**Ram：**  
...  
  
**Ram：**  
Don't expect me to baby him.  
I'll watch him, and that's all. Understood?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, that will certainly do.  
Miss Ram, thank you ever so much!  
  
**Ram：**  
I hardly think it's worthy of thanks.  
I'm really not going to do anything but watch.  
  
**Ram：**  
So, make sure you don't expect anything more.  
  
**Ram：**  
Hold it, you utter fool.  
Carriages use this street too. Stick to the edges.  
  
**Ram：**  
You can't just walk across!  
Get over... Ugh. Just stay close by my side.  
  
**Ram：**  
Why would you go along with those people?  
Anyone could see they were up to no good.  
  
**Ram：**  
Can't you think of your own safety?  
If anything happened to you, Kokkoro would cry, you know.  
  
**Ram：**  
Nothing wrong with carrying an old lady's shopping.  
That's a fine gesture. I won't deny it.  
  
**Ram：**  
But going all the way out of Landosol with her is just crazy.  
  
**Ram：**  
Hours of walking, just to have a cup of tea and head back?  
Value your time a little.  
  
**Ram：**  
Look how dark it's gotten...  
I was only supposed to be watching you briefly...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  That old lady seemed so happy.  
**Choice: (3)**  It feels good to do nice things for people.  
`Tag 2`  
**Ram：**  
Yes, she certainly was over the moon.  
I'd hope so, after wasting three hours of our time.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Ram：**  
After a two-hour trek with all those bags,  
I don't doubt any tea would taste heavenly.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Ram：**  
It feels like I'm going mad.  
Do you live like this every day?  
  
**Ram：**  
...I see now.  
It's hard to take your eyes off such a hopeless case.  
  
**Ram：**  
No wonder you have friends all over the city.  
You attract attention through sheer force of ineptitude.  
  
**Ram：**  
And all of them kind people predisposed to take care of others.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  People like you?  
`Tag 5`  
**Ram：**  
Hah!  
  
**Ram：**  
Me, a kind person?  
Please don't make me laugh.  
  
**Ram：**  
I'm only here because Kokkoro roped me into that promise.  
  
**Ram：**  
To prove it, I'll abandon you the moment we get back.  
  
**Ram：**  
In fact, we're almost...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Ah!  
My lord! Miss Ram!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wherever have the two of you been all this time?  
I was terribly worried when you did not return.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
When I asked after you in town,  
I heard that you had left the city carrying many bags...  
  
**Ram：**  
We were just having tea with an old lady in trouble.  
  
**Ram：**  
But enough about that...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Hm?  
Miss Ram, are you patting my head? What brought this on?  
  
**Ram：**  
Kokkoro, I take back what I said earlier.  
  
**Ram：**  
{player} does still need someone to take care of him.  
  
**Ram：**  
And there's only one person for the job.  
No one but you could handle it.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Ram!  
So you finally understand...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Just how happy and thankful I am  
for the privilege of being able to serve my lord each day!  
  
**Ram：**  
I don't know about any of that.  
I just had a taste of how tough your work really is.  
  
**Ram：**  
Anyway, that's all over now.  
I'll leave everything to you and...  
  
**Ram：**  
...  
  
**Ram：**  
Hold on, {player}.  
Why are you clinging to the hem of my dress?  
  
**Ram：**  
We had a great time today,  
so you'd like to hang out again sometime?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It is rare for my lord to get so attached...  
You must have taken especially good care of him, Miss Ram.  
  
**Ram：**  
I don't recall anything but trouble, myself.  
  
**Ram：**  
...  
  
**Ram：**  
...  
  
**Ram：**  
...Ugh, honestly.  
No need to make those eyes like an abandoned puppy.  
  
**Ram：**  
Fine, then.  
If we have the chance, I might go along with you if I feel like it.  
  
**Ram：**  
However, Kokkoro had better join us next time.  
  
**Ram：**  
This is the last time I take over carrying an old lady's heavy bags  
to make sure *someone* doesn't smash every last egg inside.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, what *have* you been getting up to today?!  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} could only scratch his head in embarrassment.  
Helping people out can prove to be quite a challenge at times.
