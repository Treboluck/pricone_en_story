## Subtitle: Self-Determination
  
**Narration：**  
Kasumi caught a criminal who transformed using a mysterious ring.  
Days later, she meets up with {player}  
at their rendezvous point.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...All right.  
Time to reopen the investigation, my dear assistant!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Transformation time, right?!  
`Tag 1`  
**Kasumi：**  
No, it is not!  
I already told you! I'm going to seal the magical girl away!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I only transformed last time because you were in danger.  
I had no choice...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Anyway!  
As a detective, I solve cases using knowledge and logic!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Whoops. I shoudn't speak so loudly, should I?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Why a restaurant, you ask?  
Unfortunately, we're not here to eat.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Remember when that man transformed into a monster the other day?  
It seems as though it was caused by the ring he put on.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
\"Release your hidden power.\"  
It was likely a magical tool that's currently being advertised on the  
market using such a promo slogan.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
After that I did some digging into his actions before and after the  
incident, and it turns out he obtained that ring right here.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Meaning, this is the place where those magical tools are sold.  
My dear assistant, try not to act too suspicious.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You can count on me!  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm good at being inconspicuous.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kasumi：**  
You're already being too loud!  
Um, well.  
It's a good thing you're so enthusiastic.  
I'm depending on you, my faithful assistant.

`Tag 3`  
**Kasumi：**  
...You're simply zoning out, aren't you?  
Well, it is true that your presence has diminished... Can you hear me?  
My dear assistant? Caaan you heeear meee?!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Kasumi：**  
Anyway,  
the task of solving this case rests firmly on our shoulders.  
So let's hurry up and get to it.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Whoa there, my dear assistant.  
I know I said we should hurry,  
but it's not very detective-like to rush in.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
In fact, since we entered this place,  
I've been observing our surroundings carefully.  
And already... I've spotted something suspicious.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Heheh. Are you curious?  
Well then, let me exhibit my keen observation skills.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Look at the table in the corner, diagonally behind me.  
Don't let him notice you—act natural.  
  
**Man 1：**  
...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
So...?  
Anything grab your attention?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Nope. Nothing.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kasumi：**  
You gave up on thinking without hesitation...  
Honesty is one of your good points, but you could at least show a little  
more effort when it comes to thinking, you know?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
On the table where the man is seated  
there are two cups of coffee, and two cakes, am I correct?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
At first glance, we can assume he's here with someone else.  
However, when he came into the restaurant, there wasn't anybody  
with him.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Maybe he's waiting for someone.  
`Tag 6`  
**Kasumi：**  
He could be. That possibility can certainly be considered.  
He may have ordered in advance for someone who is yet to arrive—  
the person he's here to meet.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But if that's the case, isn't it a little inconsiderate  
to order a hot drink so far in advance?  
In fact, you can no longer even see the steam rising from the coffee.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
In addition to that, he's been hanging his head for a while now, not  
moving a single muscle. It's like he's even holding his breath so as  
not to be noticed by anyone.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
If you're waiting for someone,  
isn't it normal to frequently check the restaurant's entrance?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
In other words... he's waiting for someone he's never met before.  
And the extra coffee and cake that he ordered...  
are actually a sign.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...For the transaction, of course.  
He's waiting quietly for someone to come and make the trade.  
  
**Staff：**  
Welcome!  
Table for one?  
  
**Man 2：**  
No... I'm here to meet somebody.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh, look... It seems like it's time to confirm my deductions.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Remember, my dear assistant, inconspicuous observation.  
Don't go getting yourself noticed!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Hey. Sorry for the wait.  
  
**Man 1：**  
...! You're...  
Um, i-is this okay...?  
  
**Man 2：**  
Hey, hey, take it easy.  
At least let me drink my coffee first.  
  
**Man 2：**  
...Ahhh, the perfect temperature.  
I ain't good with hot drinks.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Inconspicuously straighten your back.  
**Choice: (8)**  Inconspicuously jump.  
`Tag 7`  
**Kasumi：**  
Good, good. Motionless observation is more likely to get you noticed.  
Hold on, you're stretching too much!  
Your chair! You're going to fall off your chair!  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Kasumi：**  
Don't overdo it!  
My dear assistant, your actions are far too unnatural!  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Man 2：**  
Huh? What's all the fuss about...?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh no!  
My d—...  
D-darling, say \"ah!\" ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ugh, i-is it too forced to be a viable deception...?  
  
Ah! He actually ate it...  
Eh? But this is my spoon... Does that mean...?  
  
**Man 2：**  
...Oh, it's just a dumb couple.  
Tch. Can't they go somewhere else? Where do they think they are?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Says the fellow who's making dodgy deals in the same place...!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Hey, come on!  
Hurry up and show me the goods!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Okay, fine.  
Here. Take it.  
  
**Man 1：**  
So this is what will release my hidden power!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Looks like I was right.  
  
**Man 2：**  
See ya around.  
Thanks for the warm coffee.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
My dear assistant, on his tail, now!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'll let my friend from Caon deal with that customer.  
Heheh... Just to be safe, I had her on standby inside the restaurant.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'll leave the rest to you.  
  
**Staff：**  
...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
All right, let's go.  
\"Shadowing\" is synonymous with detective!  
  
**Smuggler：**  
Mwahahah! Such a lucrative business.  
So many people want these things even though they ain't got a clue  
what they are.  
  
**Smuggler：**  
But I'm bound to be found out at some point.  
Best make as much profit as I can before then─  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Too bad.  
You misjudged the timing to pull out.  
  
**Smuggler：**  
What?!  
Who's there?!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Seeing as you asked so nicely, I'll tell you.  
I'm Magical Detec...  
Er...  
I'm the detective in this town! My name is Kasumi!  
  
**Smuggler：**  
A detective...?  
Lame. I was half-expecting you to be one of those magical girls who's  
become the talk of the town.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I feel like I'm going to let slip that I *am* one of those girls.  
But I must resist.  
For today, I am but a humble detective!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Sorry to disappoint you.  
But either way, your fate isn't going to change.  
...Mr. Magical Dealer.  
  
**Smuggler：**  
Ohh... I recognize you. You were at the restaurant earlier.  
I see. So you saw the deal go down.  
I'm guessing the other guy's already been caught, huh?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You're absolutely right.  
...I'd appreciate it if you surrendered peacefully.  
  
**Smuggler：**  
Ha! Stupid little girl.  
Detective or not, I couldn't care less, but facing me alone?  
I'll show you what this thing's capable of!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I knew he would try to use a magical item!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Now, my dear assistant!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Swipe the magical item.  
`Tag 10`  
**Smuggler：**  
What?!  
There was another one of you hiding the whole time?!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
This dumb couple's other half.  
Seems like you remembered me, but forgot about him completely.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Good job, my dear assistant.  
It seems your inconspicuous act  
actually worked rather well.  
  
**Smuggler：**  
Little brat! Give that back!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
We can't allow that.  
You're under arrest─Binding Route!  
  
**Smuggler：**  
D-dammit...!  
Caught by a mere detective...!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Heheh.  
This is also part of a mere detective's job.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Nice work, my dear assistant.  
I'm glad we caught the culprit safely.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
He'll be undergoing interrogation for a while.  
They need to squeeze more details out of him about those magical  
trinkets.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...*sigh*  
  
**Choice: (11)**  What's wrong?  
`Tag 11`  
**Kasumi：**  
Ah, um...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
In your opinion, how did I do today?  
  
**Choice: (12)**  You were a splendid detective.  
`Tag 12`  
**Kasumi：**  
!  
R-really?  
This time... No, you aren't lying.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Wh-what's with that face? Your expression is strange.  
You might not have noticed, but this also bothers me.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I really hate it  
when people think I'm not like a detective.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I know many young children  
dream of becoming a magical girl...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But for me, I wanted to be a great detective.  
Even now, I'm still dreaming of becoming one.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Therefore... that's the one thing I won't yield on.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But you praising me for being a splendid detective  
feels like a weight has been lifted off my chest.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Thank you, my dear assistant.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And today, you too  
were a splendid assistant detective.  
  
**Narration：**  
After solving another case,  
Kasumi reaffirmed her childhood dream of becoming a great detective.
