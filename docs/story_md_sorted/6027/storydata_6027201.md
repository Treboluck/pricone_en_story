## Subtitle: What Kind of Girl Is Inori?
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey, tell me, have you seen Inori anywhere?  
Honestly... every time the boss wants her...  
Where's she run off to this time...?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's she like?  
**Choice: (2)**  Sounds awkward.  
**Choice: (3)**  You actually get along pretty well, right?

What, Inori...?  
 Well, what you see's what you get.  
She's a hopeless midget with no concept of respect.  
But y'know, she's a good kid really. Be nice to her, OK?

**Kaya：**  
Yeah, you're telling me!  
 She's got these big... ambitions?  
Like, it's cool how she always tries to get one over on the boss,  
but I wish she'd pull herself together a bit more.

**Kaya：**  
I just can't take my eyes off her. I'd worry, y'know?  
She's a bit like you in that way.  
 I bet you two get along.  
And it's definitely never boring around her. That's like you, too!
