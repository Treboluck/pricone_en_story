## Subtitle: How About That Pseudo-Dragon?
  
**Kaya：**  
The Pseudo-Dragon, huh... Sure was a weird beast, wasn't it?  
Can't believe its wings and breath were fake. Kinda funny, looking back!  
So, what's your take on the big lunk?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It reminds me of someone.  
**Choice: (2)**  It's so cool.  
**Choice: (3)**  It was a tough opponent.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaya：**  
Ahhh...  
 Yeah. I get ya. It was kind of like Inori, wasn't it?  
Maybe from that angle, it could even be cute...  
No, strike that. Cute's a no.

`Tag 2`  
**Kaya：**  
Eh?  
 Huh? That's the kinda thing you find cool?  
I mean, everyone's taste is different, but...  
It was working so hard to be a dragon? Well, I guess you're not wrong...

`Tag 3`  
**Kaya：**  
Yeah, for a lizard, it did put up a fight.  
Never seen anything like it back home!  
Even made me lose my cool.  
 Sure was an impressive dragon act.  
  
`Tag 4`
