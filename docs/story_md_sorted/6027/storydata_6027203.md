## Subtitle: What Do Gangsters Do?
  
**Kaya：**  
Our gangster work?  
 What, you wanna help out?  
Honestly, I can't recommend it. Staffing stores, patrolling our turf...  
It's all deathly boring stuff. You really want in?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sounds like a breeze.  
**Choice: (2)**  Sounds like a pain.  
**Choice: (3)**  Sounds like fun.

That's the thing, though. The boss only gives me and Inori  
all the easiest jobs.  
 'Cause she cares about us, or so she says.  
Even she's got a kind side, if you know where to look.

Well, I've got my brawler work too, so it can be tough.  
But hey, there aren't many other jobs you can hold while being a brawler!  
And the boss sorts out all the paperwork,  
 so it's a pretty sweet deal!

Hmmm, I wouldn't say that.  
Most of what we do's no different from a normal part-time job.  
Shame, really.  
 Wish the boss would trust us with tougher tasks.
