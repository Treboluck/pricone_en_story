## Subtitle: What Kind of Girl Is Kaya?
  
**Inori：**  
Honestly, Kaya-P's such a handful.  
I don't know how she's survived in life  
with that irrepressible urge to brawl.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Have you known her long?  
**Choice: (2)**  Which of you is stronger?  
**Choice: (3)**  You're such good friends.  
`Tag 1`  
**Inori：**  
Me and Kaya-P joined the guild at the same time.  
So I guess  
 our history together is longer than this tail!  
Us dragonfolk need to stick together!

**Inori：**  
I-if you account for all factors, I'd say we're about equal?  
I mean, forget brawling! Nobody can beat her at that!  
Well, um, someday... I'll be that strong too... I think...

**Inori：**  
Hahah! Kaya-P's a musclebrained battle addict!  
Who knows what she'd get up to without me to keep her in check?  
In a fight, nobody's stronger, but I wish she'd learn some self-control.
