As Halloween approaches, the city of Landosol is filled with excitement.  
{player} is on his way to a new part-time job  
when a certain pudding-hungry ghost swoops down to greet him.  
  
**Miyako：**  
{player}! This is the bestest timing!  
You know what day is very, very soon?  
  
**Miyako：**  
That's right! Halloween! Miyako is a real haunty-ghost,

 Thank you again!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Yaaaay! Hooraaay! Miyako wins!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hmm? You thought Miyako would ask for pudding?  
Don't be silly! Giving pudding is your job!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Now Miyako gets pudding *and* a scary costume too!  
Halloween really is the bestest!  
  
**Narration：**
