# Everlasting Endeavor
To live up to the expectations of Mahiru and the others, Rin renews her determination to protect the cheese. She then finds a mouse hole in the storehouse, out from which the pests start pouring, raising the curtain on a never-ending battle between squirrel and mouse.

**Rin：**  
*pant*... *pant*... What the heck...?  
Man, I feel like I'm dying...  
But I got that mouse to scram, so that's good...  
  
**Rin：**  
It was super huge. I wonder if it was the mouse boss.  
If I got rid of their leader, then that's that, right?  
That's what I wanna believe.  
  
**Rin：**  
How's my cherished cheese...?  
What a relief.  
Not a scratch.  
Hm? In fact, it looks even glossier than before.  
  
**Rin：**  
Is it supposed to mature that quickly?  
Well, I've gotten good at mouse mashing in such a short time,  
so it's not a stretch to think cheese could ripen so fast.  
  
**Rin：**  
It seems to smell even tastier now too... somehow.  
How weird is that? It was nothing compared to acorns before.  
  
**Rin：**  
Well, it's understandable, considering it's a popular Elizabeth Park  
brand product.  
Mahy's really something, huh? My opinion of her keeps changing.  
  
**Rin：**  
To live up to her expectations, I gotta keep protecting the cheese...  
Huh? Is that a hole in the wall over there? Don't tell me, it's a  
mouse den?! Is that where they've been flooding in from?  
  
**Rin：**  
Aw, come on! They're just not gonna stop, are they?!  
Fine! I'll keep repelling you rodents!  
Come get some!
