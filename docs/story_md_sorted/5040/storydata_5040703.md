# Budding Affection?
Having chased off all the mice, Rin calmly observes the cheese. Bewildered by a sudden curious sense of affection for it, she convinces herself that everything she is doing is for Mahiru's sake. Rin is then confronted by a giant mouse.

**Mouse：**  
Squeak!  
  
**Rin：**  
*sigh* Finally got rid of them.  
It feels as if they're getting more and more desperate...  
Is it all in my head?  
  
**Rin：**  
Whatever, I'm just glad I managed to protect the cheese.  
Those dirty rats won't be sinking their teeth into you...  
Wait.  
Why the heck am I talking to cheese?  
  
**Rin：**  
Maybe I'm growing attached to my treasured cheese because I've been  
fighting to protect it...?  
Huh? Wait, \"treasured\"...?  
Just what is wrong  
with me? Either way, it'll eventually be eaten, so it makes no difference.  
  
**Rin：**  
If the cheese gets chomped by vermin, Mahy'll get real sad. That's why.  
Yeah. That's the only reason I feel this way.  
  
**Mouse：**  
Squeak!  
  
**Rin：**  
Another one?  
Will they ever learn their lesson...?  
Huh?!  
This one's massive! Is it really a mouse?!  
  
**Mouse：**  
Squeak!  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh, it squeaked, so it's definitely a mouse.  
Argh, come on. Try as much as you want, it's useless!  
I'm not letting you past!  
  
**Rin：**  
I'll defend this cheese until the bitter end!
