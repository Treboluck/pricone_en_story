## Subtitle: One Last Job
  
**Shiori：**  
It's been a lot of work,  
but it looks like we're almost done.  
  
**Rin：**  
Really, it's been absolutely non-stop.  
I've already worked enough for a lifetime.  
So I think it's about time I retired.  
  
**Lima：**  
No one's denying that you worked reeeally hard,  
but I don't think it was a lifetime's worth of effort.  
  
**Rin：**  
I wasn't looking for a serious response, you know.  
But I think I will force Mahy to keep the promise she made to me.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I ain't forgot.  
You'll get the chance to properly be lazy, so don't ya worry.  
  
**Shiori：**  
\"Properly be lazy,\" is a weird thing to say...  
But this time, I suppose we can ignore it.  
  
**Lima：**  
Or maybe you'll get so used to working hard that it becomes a habit,  
and you won't be able to slack off anymore.  
  
**Shiori & Mahiru：**  
Not a chance.  
Ain't no way.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hahah. I'm so glad you trust me, you know.  
Man.
