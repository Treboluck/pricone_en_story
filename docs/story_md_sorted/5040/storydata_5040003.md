# Open for Business!
The ranch spa is a hit, and just when it looks like Mahiru will be able to properly pay her taxes, the ranch itself is confiscated by the tax inspector for concealing the hot spring's existence. Mahiru is about to give up on it all, but Rin gives her a stern talking to, which encourages her to look towards the future.
  
## Subtitle: Open for Business!
  
**Narration：**  
Several days have passed since the grand opening of the ranch hot  
spring. Thanks to the efforts of Mahiru and co., business is booming  
day after day.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Mahiru, I've brought extra towels.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Go restock the rest area, would ya?  
There oughtta be a pile of used ones, so could ya take 'em 'round the  
back to Limalima?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Understood.  
  
By the way, have you seen Rin?  
There's something I'd like her to help me with...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Rinrin's with {player} out fetchin' customers.  
I reckon they'll be back pretty soon. Why, is it urgent?  
  
**Rin：**  
Mahy... new guests.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Speak of the devil, huh?  
  
**Saren：**  
Good afternoon. We've come for a nice soak in the hot spring.  
  
**Girl：**  
Wow! So this is Big Sis Mahiru's ranch!  
Moo-moos! Where are the moo-moos?!  
  
**Rin：**  
The cows are on holiday.  
So for now, just imagine Mahy is a cow.  
  
**Saren：**  
Ahahah... Sorry about that.  
No matter how many times I explain the situation to them,  
the kids just don't get it.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey, don't worry about it.  
As long as they enjoy the hot spring, that's all that matters.  
  
**Boy：**  
You haven't been to visit us lately, so we came to you!  
Teach me that joke you told me about the other day!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Huh?! Ya came for my gags, an' not the hot spring?  
I'm thrilled to hear it!  
  
**Girl：**  
Oh yeah! We wanted to go in the big bath!  
  
**Boy：**  
Huh? But I wanna hang out with Big Sis Mahiru.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ain't ya tired from walkin' all the way here?  
Once you've had a nice soak, I'll tell ya the joke.  
But it can wait 'til you're outta the hot spring.  
  
**Boy：**  
Hmph. Yeah, okay.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm taking some towels over there now, so I'll show you the way.  
  
**Saren：**  
Much appreciated.  
Come on, children.  
  
**Children：**  
Okay!  
  
**Rin：**  
*sigh*...  
Walking all the way to the orphanage and back sure takes it outta you.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Thanks for guidin' 'em here.  
But ya didn't actually have to go do that, y'know?  
  
**Rin：**  
Yeah, well...  
I just thought it must be tough for Saren to bring the kids here  
all on her own.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  We also did some promoting on the way.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rin：**  
Hey, you don't need to tell her that!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Rinrin...  
  
**Rin：**  
Aw man, don't look at me like that.  
You know, you can never have enough publicity. I just did what needed  
to be done.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Thanks a bunch.  
I think ya oughtta take the rest of the day off.  
I'll take over whatever work ya have to do.  
  
**Rin：**  
But you've got your hands full.  
You're the only one working the hot spring, and you're selling  
souvenirs alone, too.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm already used to peddlin' our wares, so it's a walk in the ranch.  
Besides, it's mighty fun sellin' things we've never sold before.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Like those ripe walnuts of yours.  
The older gents can't get 'nuff of 'em.  
They say they go perfect with cheese.  
  
**Rin：**  
You mean my secret stash that I've been stockpiling for ages!  
Well, I guess it's okay if they're making us money.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I really am grateful.  
We sure got a lot on our plate right now,  
but it's so much fun 'cause we're workin' together.  
  
Does that make me weird?  
  
**Rin：**  
Yeah, it does.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Darn, that was a quick response.  
  
**Rin：**  
I'm only putting in the effort now so that I can slack off later.  
Once the cows come home, I'm gonna put all my energy into doing  
nothing.  
My labor doesn't come cheap, you know, so prepare yourself.  
  
**Rin：**  
I'll go down in history as the sovereign of sedentariness.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ahahah!  
Then we oughtta be doin' our darndest so that you can start  
slackin' off ASAP!  
  
**Rin：**  
Even after hearing all that, you won't tell me to work?  
You've gone mad.  
  
**Rin：**  
Well, it's nice to have so many customers  
that we're able to talk  
optimistically like this. It's a bit unexpected.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
It's all thanks to your hard work givin' out flyers in town.  
  
**Rin：**  
It's hard for me to say, but I don't think the flyers alone had such  
an effect.  
The people coming here were already Mahy fans in the  
first place.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You sure about that?!  
Jus' when did I become such a hit comedian?!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Mahiru!  
You suddenly stopped bringing your produce to town, so I was really  
worried!  
I can't believe something so horrible happened here!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, you're a regular customer!  
I'm so sorry for lettin' you down.  
It was all so sudden...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
I hear the same fate has befallen lots of other ranches and farms in  
the region. Because of that, food prices have risen across the board,  
so things are getting tough.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Golly, I sure am sorry for causin' you trouble...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
You've nothing to be sorry for!  
I just look forward to the day you bring your products back to town.  
Anyway, I'm off to rest my weary body in the hot spring!  
  
**Rin：**  
Remember when Landosol was in bad shape, so loads of people came  
to Elizabeth Park seeking refuge?  
Looks like those people have come  
back.  
  
**Rin：**  
Even back then, people realized what a great place Elizabeth Park is.  
  
**Rin：**  
Putting aside whether or not you're a popular comedian,  
you're a popular person.  
Again, regardless of your sense of humor.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Do ya really need to repeat that part?!  
But if what you're sayin's true,  
it makes me real happy.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Even though the cows are all gone, I really hope  
that folks can enjoy  
Elizabeth Park as it is now.  
  
**Inspector：**  
My, my, my.  
The ranch is awfully lively today.  
  
**Hanzo：**  
...  
  
**Rin：**  
Uh-oh...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ohhh, afternoon, Mr. Inspector.  
Have ya come to take a dip?  
You're very welcome to.  
  
**Inspector：**  
You can't seriously believe I would bathe with commoners.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Y-yeah, how silly of me...  
Well then, whatcha doin' here?  
I coulda sworn the payment due date wasn't for a while yet.  
  
**Inspector：**  
You're awfully brazen, aren't you?  
Do you have any idea what you're doing?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Pardon? All this hot spring business is so we can pay our taxes...  
  
**Inspector：**  
That hot spring.  
You didn't declare it as income, did you?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Seriously?! We need to declare it?!  
It burst from the ground under strange circumstances,  
  
so I jus' didn't even consider it...  
  
**Inspector：**  
Oh my, we have a problem on our hands.  
The tax assessment value of a ranch with a spa vastly differs from that  
without.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ya tellin' me we gotta pay even more?  
But it ain't an issue!  
The folks are absolutely lovin' our hot spring.  
At this rate, we'll have the cash to cover our debts in no—  
  
**Inspector：**  
Seize everything!  
  
**Hanzo：**  
Understood.  
  
**Ninja 1：**  
...!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Everything?! Even the hot spring?!  
H-hold your horses! We still got guests relaxin' in there!  
At least wait 'til they've all gone home!  
  
**Hanzo：**  
Resistance is futile.  
Force all the customers out.  
  
**Ninja 1：**  
Sir!  
  
**Rin：**  
H-hold it...!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
No way! That's the one thing I won't let happen!  
  
**Ninja 2：**  
You dare to defy us?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I-it ain't my intention to defy ya.  
I jus' don't want ya frightenin' our guests!  
S-so 'cause of that, I ain't budgin' an inch!  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey, Mr. Inspector.  
  
**Inspector：**  
What is it?  
  
**Rin：**  
If we force out all the guests right now, they'll make us pay 'em back,  
right?  
Then why is it that, even though you're supposed to be collecting  
money, you don't actually seem to want it?  
  
**Inspector：**  
Hah! Such is chicken feed to me...  
  
**Rin：**  
Sure, to a rich aristocrat like you, that might be the case,  
but not for all  
these normal folks who've come to spend their hard-earned time and  
cash.  
I wonder what would happen to your approval rating.  
  
**Inspector：**  
...  
Well, for their sake, let's wait until nightfall.  
In the meantime, I'll be taking all your hot spring earnings as payment,  
right down to the last rupie.  
  
**Rin：**  
Well, if that's how it's gonna be...  
Fine, do what you want.  
Right, Mahy?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Our guests are our top priority.  
If they're fine, then so am I.  
  
**Rin：**  
We're done with our patrol.  
  
**Shiori：**  
All of the guests left without noticing any of the commotion.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Thanks gals for doin' your final round.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
It's a darn shame that we put our all into this hot spring, jus' for it to  
lead to naught.  
Hahahah. Well, as long as our guests are safe, that's all that matters.  
  
**Lima：**  
Mahiru...  
  
**Boy：**  
Big Sis Mahiru! The hot spring was super relaxing!  
I'll definitely come back!  
Oh, and you better teach me that joke then, okay?!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...!  
O-ohhh, you're still here!  
Sure thing! I'll write a whole  
ton of jokes for the next time we meet!  
  
**Saren：**  
Sorry about that.  
We got halfway home when he suddenly decided he wanted to see you  
and threw a tantrum, so we had to come back.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I don't mind at all.  
I'm pleased as punch that he wanted to see me again.  
  
**Girl：**  
Big Sis Mahiru! Let us see the moo-moos next time!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Uh, sure!  
I'll introduce ya to my prize-winnin' pageant cows!  
I'll even let ya milk 'em!  
  
**Saren：**  
...I'm so, so sorry.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
No need for apologies. The kids are havin' a blast, and that's all that  
matters.  
How 'bout yourself? Did ya get to relax even jus' a li'l?  
  
**Saren：**  
I did. I was actually surprised at how good the hot spring is.  
I don't think I'll be able to make time in the near future, but I'll definitely  
be back.  
And I can have Suzume bring the children, if need be.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
C-can you now?  
I look forward to it.  
  
**Saren：**  
Mahiru? Is something the matter?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
N-not at all! I'm jus' a li'l tired.  
Don't fret yourself.  
  
**Saren：**  
Really...?  
Well then, I'll be off.  
  
**Children：**  
See you later!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Right, take care now!  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm so glad nothing bad happened in front of those children.  
  
**Rin：**  
Right...? *sigh*...  
I just can't get my head around that inspector's actions.  
  
**Hanzo：**  
All done?  
  
**Rin：**  
Whoa! Which hole did you pop out of?!  
  
**Hanzo：**  
It's now nightfall. As discussed, this place is no longer yours.  
Gather your things and get lost.  
  
**Shiori：**  
No longer ours?  
Y-you're taking the guildhouse as well? Not just the hot spring?!  
  
**Hanzo：**  
I seem to remember the inspector telling you he'd confiscate everything.  
  
**Lima：**  
No way, that's going too far!  
You can't just tell us to leave out of nowhere!  
  
**Rin：**  
If you force us out, where do you expect us to go?!  
  
**Hanzo：**  
If you know what's good for you, leave.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
W-we get it!  
We'll get outta your hair.  
  
We're leaving, so please don't hurt anyone!  
  
**Lima：**  
I can't believe they kicked us off the ranch...  
What are we supposed to do now?  
  
**Rin：**  
We made a pile of cash from hot spring tickets,  
  
so I'm sure we'll figure something out.  
  
**Shiori：**  
You're right! If we all work together, we're bound to find a solution!  
  
**Lima：**  
I'll work really, really hard!  
There's no physical labor I can't handle!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hey, y'all...  
  
**Lima：**  
What is it, Mahiru?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Jus' let it go.  
  
**All：**  
Huh?  
  
**Rin：**  
Sorry, let what go?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Gettin' Elizabeth Park back.  
There jus' ain't no use. We ain't got no cows. We ain't got no spa...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Besides, I'm the only member of Elizabeth Park, anyhow.  
Rinrin and Shioshio are on transfer from Caon,  
an' Limalima's jus' working for us outta the kindness of her heart...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
There ain't no need to go through any more trouble for me.  
Rinrin and Shioshio oughtta return to Caon,  
an' I'm sure Limalima can find a much better place elsewhere.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'll help her look for somewhere to live.  
In fact, {player}, you're familiar with a lotta folks,  
so you might be the better choice...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Rinrin's always complainin'.  
But now she can slack off to her heart's content. Ain't that great?  
  
**Rin：**  
...Are you serious?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Uh, yeah...  
  
**Rin：**  
Mahy, have you forgotten?  
You told those Sarendia kids you'd see them at the ranch again.  
And let them milk the cows, no? Or was it all just lies?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I-it could...  
It could be at a different ranch...

**Mahiru：**  
...?!  
  
**Lima & Shiori：**  
Rin...?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Quit messing around!  
Do you have any idea how much trouble I went through to hand out  
those flyers?  
  
**Rin：**  
Everything I did was for you!  
You're always nagging me for slacking off, but you're still kind to me  
in every way. And, and...  
  
**Rin：**  
Even though we had no money, you kept donating cheese and milk to  
Sarendia. And in the end, because of some dumb tax, your guild is being  
destroyed. You're such a great person, Mahy! That's why I did it for you!  
  
**Rin：**  
Even if the ranch goes under, I'll just laze around at home.  
No skin off my nose.  
But I can't stand to see you looking like that!  
  
**Rin：**  
If you're gonna end the guild, do it with a smile on your face!  
If this is one of your jokes, it's terrible in a different kind of way!  
I'm not laughing at all!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
R-Rinrin...  
  
**Rin：**  
I'm not gonna give up.  
Even if Shiorin and Lima do, I'll just keep on persisting.  
  
**Shiori：**  
How could you think so little of me? I won't give up either.  
  
**Lima：**  
I'll persevere too!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wh-why would ya go to such lengths jus' for me...?  
  
**Lima：**  
Because of the way I look, I can't go anywhere without being  
mistaken for a monster.  
But despite that, you always tell me how pretty I am.  
  
**Lima：**  
I'm glad that you said you'd help me search for a new home,  
but my home will always be Elizabeth Park!  
  
**Shiori：**  
I was sickly and couldn't work enough. I wasn't much help,  
and all I did was rest after having transferred in name only.  
But none of that stopped you from kindly accepting me  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'll never forget how when I first arrived, you comforted me  
when I was crying overmy own inadequacy.  
  
Please let me do my best for you.

`image display end`  
**Rin：**  
...There you have it.  
Whew, if these two had given up here, I dunno what I'd have done.  
Getting all fired up on my own would've been embarrassing.  
  
**Lima：**  
Heheh, surely you knew how we felt right from the beginning.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Rin, you really pay attention to others, don't you?  
  
**Rin：**  
Shut up! Don't say things like that.  
You'll make this corny scene even worse.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...  
  
**Rin：**  
Mahy... Are you mad at me for slapping you?  
S-sorry. I got caught in the moment...  
H-here, take a free shot at me. Put some strength into it.  
  
**Rin：**  
...  
  
**Rin：**  
Ouch! That...  
doesn't hurt? Huh?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Thanks a bunch, Rinrin!  
You've opened my eyes!  
  
**Rin：**  
Uh, yeah,  
if I slapped myself so hard that my cheek turned as red as  
yours, I think my eyes would be open too. Yeah.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I won't give up on Elizabeth Park!  
I know there's a lot of work ahead, and I'm askin' a lot of y'all,  
but will y'all stick with me 'til the end?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Absolutely!  
  
**Lima：**  
That was always the plan. ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
I mean, we've said it so many times now.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I don't wanna lie to the kids, an' I don't wanna lie to you, Rinrin!  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh? Me? Did you promise me something?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I said I'd try my best so you can hurry up an' start slackin' off again.  
That's a promise I intend to keep!  
  
**Rin：**  
...Uh, Mahy.  
Won't it be harder to slack off this way...?  
  
**Narration：**  
Despite all that was lost, the bonds between friends remained.  
With these friendships in her heart, Mahiru renewed her resolve.  
  
**Inspector：**  
Tell me you've appropriated the ranch.  
  
**Hanzo：**  
There were no setbacks.  
  
**Inspector：**  
Very good.  
But to think Elizabeth Park even had a hot spring.  
Heheh, what a delightful windfall.  
  
**Inspector：**  
I know!  
I want you to knock down this guildhouse and build me a luxurious  
cottage.  
It shall serve as a retreat for the Council of Nobles!  
  
**Inspector：**  
If I offer up Elizabeth Park produce in addition to a health spa,  
my social position will surely be solidified...  
  
**Ninja 1：**  
About that, Inspector.  
Apparently, the people at Elizabeth Park have yet to give up on trying to  
raise funds...  
  
**Inspector：**  
Excuse me?  
What can they do when they've had everything taken away from them?  
More importantly, have you prepared the gifts?  
  
**Ninja 2：**  
Yes sir.  
Production is complete. Couriers are transporting them to the prominent  
noble lords as we speak.  
  
**Inspector：**  
All's good then.  
  
**Ninja 2：**  
However, the cows are no longer producing milk as expected...  
  
**Inspector：**  
We've already sent gifts to the most important people, correct?  
  
**Ninja 2：**  
Yes sir.  
  
**Inspector：**  
Hmmm...  
In that case, the cows are no longer of use to us.  
We have the hot spring now, after all.  
Dispose of the cows as you wish.  
  
**Hanzo：**  
Are you sure about that...?  
  
**Inspector：**  
Is there something you want to say to me?  
  
**Hanzo：**  
Such is not the case.  
  
**Inspector：**  
Of course. I beg your pardon.  
I picked you up after you were cast aside by your former master,  
so naturally you'll do as my orders dictate, won't you?  
  
**Inspector：**  
Because if you don't, you'll find yourself on the trash heap once again.  
Hahahahahah!  
  
**Hanzo：**  
...
