The members of Elizabeth Park come together to fight against the sudden takeover of their guild!
  
**Mahiru：**  
Today's Elizabeth Park brand goods are all sold out.  
When I see so many happy customers,  
I can't help bein' pleased as pie myself.  
  
**Rin：**  
Day in, day out, you're hard at work.  
I can't do that. I'd rather just play my new game.  
I hope it gets here soon.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Mahiru, Rin.  
I've finished my patrol of the ranch.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
As usual, Shioshio's the only one who's workin'...  
  
**Rin：**  
It's no big deal.  
On the days she's not feeling too great,  
I do my share of the work, you know?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But it's normal to work *every* day!  
  
**Rin：**  
Define \"normal.\"  
I just wanna do my own thing.  
In fact, isn't *that* more normal?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Rin, has anyone ever told you how smart you are  
when it comes to these things?  
  
**Rin：**  
Yeah, when it comes to...  
  
Wait, Shiorin. That's not a compliment, is it?  
I'm real smart  
when it comes to everything. I just limit how I use my brain.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Well I'd much appreciate it if ya removed those limits.  
By the way, I ain't seen Limalima all day. Do ya know where is she?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I spotted her in the forest earlier...  
  
**???：**  
We're requisitioning your livestock.  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh? Requisitioning... livestock?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wh-who the heck are you guys?!  
Where did ya appear from?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Mahiru! Over there!  
The cows are being loaded into wagons!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Stop! Please stop...!  
Where are ya takin' my precious cows?!
