# Heaps of Affection
The efforts of Mahiru and friends are in vain, and the ranch is about to be lost. But just when it seems that they have run out of options, donations arrive from fans of the ranch, and they reach their funding target. However, they encounter an unexpected obstacle on their way to pay the money.
  
## Subtitle: Heaps of Affection
  
**Narration：**  
Mahiru and Rin, who unexpectedly earned extra income by capturing  
wanted bandits, arrive back at Sarendia Orphanage with smiles on  
their faces.  
  
**Mahiru & Rin：**  
We're back!  
  
**Saren：**  
Welcome home.  
By the looks on your faces, I'd say work went smoothly.  
  
**Rin：**  
Not bad. We managed to hook a bounty on our first job,  
so people got talking, and now the requests are flying in.  
We've earned a fair bit.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
If we keep up this pace, the day we take back the ranch  
won't be so far away.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm back.  
  
**Rin：**  
Welcome home, Shiorin.  
Why the long face? You okay?  
Don't tell me, did something happen?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, no.  
Nothing happened as such...  
How should I put it...?  
  
**Farmer 1：**  
Hey, how's it going?  
  
**Farmer 2：**  
Sorry to intrude.  
  
**Rin：**  
...Who're you?  
  
**Shiori：**  
These two men had their farm and ranch seized by the tax inspector,  
just like Elizabeth Park.  
  
**Farmer 1：**  
In the end, I couldn't raise enough money, and my ranch was ruined.  
  
**Farmer 2：**  
After my orchard was closed down, it was turned into a villa for a  
noble I've never heard of.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
That's...  
I dunno what to say...  
  
**Farmer 1：**  
It's all done. There's nothing left to say.  
  
**Farmer 2：**  
Instead, you can put this to good use.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
What is it...?  
  
**Farmer 1：**  
It's all the money we saved up to get our guilds back.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I-I can't!  
Ain't no way I can accept this many rupies!  
  
**Farmer 1：**  
It's not a donation. Just a loan.  
You can return it once you get your ranch back.  
  
**Farmer 2：**  
You guys seem to be loved by all sorts of people.  
That's why we're lending you this money.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
B-but...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Mahiru.  
This actually isn't nearly all the money we received.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Whaddya mean?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Here...  
`Tag 1`  
**Mahiru：**  
I-is this also y'all's?  
  
**Farmer 2：**  
No, this isn't our money.  
But once we saw how much you meant to the community,  
we decided to add ours to the pot.  
  
**Shiori：**  
While we were out delivering mail, one villager after another  
stopped us and asked what happened to the ranch.  
And when I told them...  
  
**Rin：**  
What happened...?  
  
**Shiori：**  
They all kindly made donations...  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh? Wh-why would they do that?  
  
**Shiori：**  
The people from the distant villages where Mahiru goes to sell produce  
and the people who took refuge at the ranch during that big battle  
wanted to express their gratitude...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I ain't done anythin' for folks to be that thankful...  
I can't accept this kinda money...  
  
**Shiori：**  
I told them that it would be best to ask you about it first, but they  
said it's fine  
because each person only made a small donation.  
  
**Rin：**  
We made this much from \"small donations\"...?  
  
**Farmer 1：**  
You shoulda seen how many people there were.  
  
**Farmer 2：**  
There were so many, you wouldn't believe.  
  
**Saren：**  
Awww, look, you two.  
You were so hesitant to contribute that you were beaten to it.  
  
**All：**  
...?  
  
**Girl：**  
You know, Big Sis Mahiru.  
The two of us wanted to help...  
it's really just a little, but...  
  
**Boy：**  
Here!  
  
**Girl：**  
You and your friends need money, right?  
Well, we saved up a whole bunch to help you!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Err, I...  
  
**Boy：**  
Rin, you're always teaching me how to play cool games,  
  
so this is payback!  
  
**Rin：**  
I'm glad you wanna pay me back for that,  
but it doesn't have to be  
in money, you know.  
I'd rather you just called me Big Sis Rin.  
  
**Saren：**  
When I explained to them the reason you can't be here all the time,  
they decided they  
wanted to pitch in, and that was that.  
  
**Girl：**  
Now I know the reason your moo-moos were gone.  
I'm sorry...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wh-what're ya sayin'?!  
I'm the one who oughtta be apologizin'!  
You ain't got nothin' to be sorry for!  
It's all 'cause I'm a good-for-nothin'...  
  
**Saren：**  
I know it must be hard to take their money, but please do.  
I'm guessing all the other people felt the same way.  
  
**Rin：**  
Then I suppose...  
we'll just have to graciously accept.  
Right, Mahy?

**Mahiru：**  
...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Mahiru...?  
  
**Rin：**  
Mahy, don't tell me...  
  
**Girl：**  
Big Sis Mahiru, why are you crying?  
D-did we do something wrong?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Th-that ain't it! That ain't it at all!  
I'm jus' wellin' up 'cause I'm happy 'bout everyone's feelings toward us.  
It doesn't mean anythin' bad!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I-I'm over the moon that y'all are doin' so much for me...  
Even though I didn't do anythin' special...  
  
**Saren：**  
You're the only one who thinks that.  
If it were true, neither the children nor anyone else would want to help you.  
  
**Shiori：**  
She's right. You're pretty amazing.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Thanks, y'all...

**Rin：**  
You know, Mahy.  
I think we might have just enough money to pay our outstanding taxes.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Why don't we count it up and see?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Th-there's 'nuff...  
We really have 'nuff!  
W-with this,  
we can get back the ranch an' all the cows to go with it!  
  
**Rin：**  
Let's bag this up and take it to the inspector right now!  
  
**Farmer 1：**  
Don't just give it to him. Smack that horrible taxman right in the snout  
with it!  
  
**Lima：**  
BAD NEWS!  
  
**Rin：**  
Lima? What's got you all worked up like that?  
  
**Lima：**  
Elizabeth Park's gonna be destroyed!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Destroyed? What do you mean?  
  
**Lima：**  
The ranch is going to be turned into a health resort for the aristocracy!  
They're already filling the place with building blocks!  
If we don't hurry, the pastures will be torn to shreds!  
  
**Rin：**  
It looks like we'll have to get the money over there more urgently  
than we thought.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Right. Let's get a move on!  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh? G-get the money there...?  
Oh?! You guys earned that much in a day?!  
That's amazing!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
We'll tell ya the details on the way. Let's go!  
  
**Rin：**  
*huff*... *puff*...  
Running like this has made me realize how far from town  
Elizabeth Park... really is...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ya ain't wrong.  
An' to think all those folks came this far for our hot spring.  
We're truly blessed.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Um... Lima, running with me on your back isn't wearing you out, is it?  
  
**Lima：**  
No problems here! Don't worry about it. ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
*pant*... *pant*... *pant*...  
  
**Lima：**  
Rin, are you all right?  
  
**Rin：**  
I thought giving out flyers with {player}  
was physically demanding, but running with this armor on  
is much worse...  
But I'm fine.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Persevere jus' a li'l longer.  
Ya can do it, Rinrin.  
  
**Cow：**  
Moo.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Listen, even my cows're rootin' for ya...  
Huh?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Why can we hear the lowing of cows...?  
  
**Ninja 1：**  
Get moving!  
  
**Cow：**  
Moo.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ah! They really are my cows!  
What are ya doin' to my cows?!  
  
**Ninja 1：**  
Oh, it's you...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
What are ya doin' to my cows?!  
  
**Ninja 2：**  
These cows belong to the nobility.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ain't no way I'd mistake my own family.  
Sure, they're still in foreclosure,  
but that ain't no reason to  
treat 'em like crap!  
  
**Ninja 1：**  
Either way, they're useless animals headed to the burger factory.  
I'll treat them how I please.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wha?! J-jus' hold on a minute!  
We got your darn money, every penny!  
So I'll be takin' my cows back now!  
  
**Ninja 1：**  
...Oh? You got the money?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Thank gosh, you understood...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wah!  
What's the big idea?!  
  
**Ninja 1：**  
You having the money presents a big problem.  
  
**Ninja 2：**  
You're all no longer welcome in this world.  
  
**Rin：**  
So you never intended to give us back Elizabeth Park in the first place...?  
  
**Lima：**  
How could you?! Then we tried so hard for nothing...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Which means that even if we do hand over the money, it's pointless.  
  
**Rin：**  
If we give them it, they'll cover it up and snuff us out.  
  
**Ninja 1：**  
So you finally understand. But we're not monsters.  
If you simply accept this defeat and disappear of your own accord,  
we'll forget we ever saw you.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh yeah? So that's how it is...  
You're sure talkin' mighty strange.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
'Cause through the kindness of many others,  
we saved up the money exactly as asked.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But y'all weren't ever plannin' to return my ranch, right from the  
beginnin'.  
If I tell ya that we refuse to back down, I'd sure like to  
know... what will y'all do?  
  
**Ninja 2：**  
Do you even need to ask?  
  
**Ninja 1：**  
We'll send you to another dimension.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I see... In that case...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Listen, gals.  
I know I've selfishly dragged y'all along with me all this way...  
  
**Lima：**  
M-Mahiru...?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Don't tell me...  
  
**Rin：**  
...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But will y'all see my selfishness through 'til the end?  
  
**All：**  
...!  
  
**Rin：**  
We already came this far.  
Don't you think it's obvious?  
  
**Lima：**  
Yeah!  
We're with you right to the very end!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes, we are.  
Well then, first things first...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
We'll be takin' back our cows!  
  
**Narration：**  
More resolute than ever, the members of Elizabeth Park  
valiantly raised their weapons as the final battle for the ranch began.
