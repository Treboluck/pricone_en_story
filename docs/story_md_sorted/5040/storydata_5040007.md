## Subtitle: A Place That Warms the Heart
  
**Narration：**  
After an investigation into the tax inspector's fraud scandal sees  
everything put to rights, Elizabeth Park is back to... a routine a little  
more hectic than before.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey, Mahy!  
The kids from Sarendia are here to see the cows. Is now a good time?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Awww! Right now they're in the cow shed,  
  
so show the young'uns around.  
  
**Rin：**  
Aw man, since we got the ranch back, you haven't let me slack off at all.  
You're not keeping your promises, Inspector Mahy!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Whaddya mean...?  
Ah, you're callin' me a liar!  
Sorry, I'm a li'l slow on the uptake.  
Things are just too darn busy lately.  
My comedy ain't in top form right now.  
  
**Rin：**  
That's never not the case...  
  
**Boy：**  
Big Sis Mahiru! We came to see you!  
You can finally teach me that joke today!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, nice to see ya! All right!  
Today I'm gonna teach ya  
so many gags that your head'll fall off with  
laughter!  
  
**Rin：**  
...She might not have the sharpest wit, but I guess she is a proper  
comedian 'cause she does have fans.  
  
**Girl：**  
Hey, Rin.  
Where are the moo-moos?  
  
**Rin：**  
Ah, yeah. This way. Let's get going.  
  
**Boy：**  
Ah! I wanna see them too!  
See ya later, Big Sis Mahiru!  
Rin, let's go!  
  
**Rin：**  
All right, all right!  
*Big Sis* Rin's gonna show you the way, so just hold your horses, okay?  
  
**Saren：**  
Good afternoon, Mahiru.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, Saren.  
Welcome.  
Thanks a bunch for fetchin' the kids.  
  
**Saren：**  
I actually wanted to bring them sooner,  
but you all seemed so busy.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
An investigation found no blame on our part, so a settlement was  
reached.  
But I'm still a little concerned 'bout all the other guilds  
that fell victim to the former inspector.  
  
**Saren：**  
You and {player} searched all over the place  
for those victims, didn't you?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Some of 'em seemed like they were tryin' to disappear without a trace,  
so when we found 'em, we had a hard time convincin' 'em  
we weren't debt collectors.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
We had to explain to each of 'em that they could keep their guilds going.  
But still, their land an' facilities were in such a state that none of 'em had  
the money for proper maintenance, an' in the end, it was unsustainable.  
  
**Saren：**  
So you decided to lend your hot spring profits to those guilds.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But it ain't jus' that.  
As it turns out, I was fortunately able to use the donations the village  
folks gave to us.  
  
**Saren：**  
I don't mean to sound rude, but you're a bit of a soft touch...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ya think so?  
But I was helped outta my situation by the good grace of a loada folks.  
I was just returnin' the favor.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Throughout the recent fiasco, none of the farming guilds were  
closely connected, so we decided  
to take this opportunity to start  
helpin' each other out.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
An' the hot spring's a natural phenomenon anyway,  
so I reckon it's best to make use of it as such.  
  
**Saren：**  
I was going to refuse your donations to the orphanage, but now that  
you've informed me of the true state of Elizabeth Park,  
I think I might  
just take advantage of your good-naturedness.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Go right ahead!  
Even if ya said ya didn't want 'em, I'd keep on sendin' 'em anyway!  
I want y'all to look forward to 'em!  
  
**Saren：**  
Heheh. Yes, we always wait with enthusiasm.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, and despite all the damage caused by the former inspector,  
something good came of it too. It turns out that he gifted tons  
of Elizabeth Park produce to some rich folks.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
His intention was bribery,  
but they got a taste for our stuff  
an' became some of our biggest clients.  
So now, we're way better off than we were before it all started.  
  
**Lima：**  
Mahiru!  
The new cows are here!  
  
**Farmer 1：**  
Hey, Mahiru.  
I've fetched you some prize-winning dairy cows!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ohhh, thank ya kindly!  
Limalima, show him where to take 'em.  
  
**Lima：**  
You got it. ♪  
Please follow me.  
  
**Farmer 2：**  
Mahiru, I picked the finest apples in my orchard for you.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wooow, those sure are some shiny apples.  
Limalima's gonna be real happy.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Mahiru, they're to sell to our hot spring guests.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
O-okay, okay.  
I'll be sure to pay for 'em later, so forgive me.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Goodness.  
Oh, would you mind carrying the apples over here for me?  
  
**Farmer 2：**  
Sure thing!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
We've made a lotta new relationships through our little tax issue.  
For a while I was worried about how it would turn out,  
but now that we're over that tax hurdle,  
it's all upward from here.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I have to keep everyone in Elizabeth Park busy for a while,  
but I did say I'd selfishly have them stick with me right 'til the end.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
We're actually in a position now for Rinrin to be able to slack off,  
but let's keep it a secret for jus' a li'l while longer.  
  
**Rin：**  
Mahy... You know I can hear you, right?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Urk! Rinrin!  
  
**Rin：**  
Aaarrrgh!  
Fine then, I'll make slacking off my entire personality!  
  
**Narration：**  
Listening to Rin's protests and the accompanying laughter echoing  
throughout the ranch, Mahiru knew that no matter what the future  
may bring, she would overcome anything with the help of her friends.
