**Shiori：**  
Wh-what's going on?  
Something about the ranch feels different from usual...  
  
**Rin：**  
Hanzo must've done something.  
We should move ahead with caution.  
  
**Lima：**  
He's ruining the tranquility of the ranch!  
I'll make him pay dearly!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
We'll jus' have to take him down  
an' return the ranch to how it oughtta be!
