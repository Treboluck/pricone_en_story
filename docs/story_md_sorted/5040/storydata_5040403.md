He makes for a pretty tough opponent.  
But still, it's going to be a piece of cake.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I can still fight as well.  
Today I'm feeling well enough to take on anyone.  
  
**Lima：**  
That's promising,

Only when everyone's safe will the ranch return to how it should be.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Thanks a lot.  
I'll try not to strain myself, but I will see this fight through to the end.  
Let's go, Lima.  
  
**Lima：**  
You've got this!  
And my back is yours for the riding! ♪
