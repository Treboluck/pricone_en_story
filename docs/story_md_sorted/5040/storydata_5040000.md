# Unwelcome Guests
While Mahiru and the members of Elizabeth Park are enjoying peaceful times at the ranch, a mysterious group shows up and silently loads the ranch's cattle onto wagons. When a panicked Mahiru inquires as to why, they reply by telling her that it is a seizure, leaving her utterly helpless.
  
## Subtitle: Unwelcome Guests
  
**Narration：**  
At the ever-tranquil Elizabeth Park, Mahiru has returned home after a  
productive day of peddling goods.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm home!  
  
**Rin：**  
Welcome back.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Huh? It sure is unusual havin' you come greet me, Rinrin.  
Were ya really that eager for me to get home?  
  
**Rin：**  
It's not like I was waiting for you, Mahy.  
This game I ordered is gonna arrive soon, so I'm out here waiting for it,  
is all.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
If ya got too much time on your hands, you oughtta come on into town  
with me sometime an' help me sell our produce.  
It's a real hoot.  
  
**Rin：**  
Yeah, I'll give it a pass.  
I dunno how you can carry all that heavy stuff to the city  
nearly every day.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
When I picture the townsfolk's faces all happy,  
the weight of the goods jus' stops matterin'.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
An' then, 'cause everyone buys loadsa stuff, comin' home's easy-peasy!  
I'd wager even you can pull that there cart.  
  
**Rin：**  
Wouldn't Lima be better suited for that job?  
It'd make things easier for you too, you know.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Limalima's already doin' 'nuff work elsewhere.  
An' besides, I can't be draggin' her to places chock-full of people now,  
can I?  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey, if we're okay with her, I'm sure everyone else will be.  
They'll learn, for sure.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I've finished my rounds, Rin...  
Oh, Mahiru.  
You're home quite early today, aren't you?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm home, Shioshio.  
Ya know, lately, Elizabeth Park brand produce has  
been flyin' off the cart.  
The amount of stuff I can pull by myself totally  
sells out in a matter of minutes.  
  
**Shiori：**  
If there's anything I can do to help, I'd be happy to lend a hand...  
But I just can't see a future that doesn't involve heavy lifting.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Shioshio, you're already workin' more than your share, so don't you  
worry yourself.  
Rinrin's the one who's gonna help me go peddlin'.  
  
**Rin：**  
I never agreed to that. Get Lima to do it.  
She and I are basically the same, so it's no problem.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I ain't got a clue what you're yammerin' on about.  
Well, if Limalima says she wants to go into town,  
then havin' her help me out ain't a bad thing...  
  
**Rin：**  
All right, I'll go ask her!  
Where is she?  
  
**Shiori：**  
If you're talking about Lima, I spotted her in the forest earlier enjoying  
what looked like a really comfortable nap.  
  
**Rin：**  
She's slacking off without me?!  
I'll never forgive her, damn alpaca.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Are you in a position to say that...?  
Limalima's always doin' all sorts of manual work, so it stands to reason  
that she'll doze off here an' there.  
  
**Rin：**  
Awww man, that's so unfair.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Yeah, sure, it is unfair—for her, not for you...  
  
**Rin：**  
Ah! I think my game's here!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hey! We ain't done here!  
Geez, Rinrin sure can be a pain in the udder.  
  
**Rin：**  
Game time! ♪ Game time! ♪ I'm gonna pull an all-nighter!  
  
**???：**  
...  
  
**Rin：**  
You're not here to deliver my game...  
are you?  
  
**???：**  
We're requisitioning your livestock.  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh? Requisitioning... livestock?  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey, wait!  
  
**???：**  
...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wh-who the heck are you guys?!  
Where did ya appear from?  
  
**Shiori：**  
They have us surrounded!  
  
**???：**  
Are you Elizabeth Park's guildmaster?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Uh, yeah. I'm the guildmaster. Do ya need me for somethin'?  
  
**Rin：**  
Mahy.  
These guys are saying they're here to requisition our livestock!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
What now...? Requisition? You've come to commandeer my cows?  
What for?!  
  
**???：**  
Best not resist if you don't want to get hurt.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I ain't resistin', I jus' dunno what's going on...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Mahiru! Over there!  
The cows are being loaded into wagons!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Whoa! You're right!  
Stop it! Please stop...!  
  
**???：**  
I told you, no objections.  
Get her.  
  
**???：**  
Sir!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wah!  
  
**Rin：**  
Watch out!  
  
**Rin：**  
That's dangerous, you know.  
What's your problem?  
  
**???：**  
She blocked it...?  
  
**Rin：**  
I'm totally fine, so lower your bow, Shiorin.  
  
**Shiori：**  
But...!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Just do as Rinrin says.  
I dunno what I'd do if ya got hurt.  
  
**Shiori：**  
...Understood.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Well, what's the reason?  
Why've ya suddenly come to take my cattle away?  
Explain the situation.  
  
**???：**  
Foreclosure.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...Foreclosure?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Foreclosure...  
  
**Rin：**  
Foreclosure...?  
  
**All：**  
Foreclosure?!
