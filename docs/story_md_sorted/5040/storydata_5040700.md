# Guard the Cheese!
The members of the ranch find some aged cheese in the warehouse that could be used as souvenirs for guests coming to the ranch hot spring, but they are plagued by mice that are also after it. Rin, who happens to have a lot of spare time on her hands, comes forward to guard the cheese.

**Narration：**  
As preparations to open the ranch hot spring for business progress  
smoothly, something has the members of Elizabeth Park at wits' end.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hmmm. I'm at a loss. What should we do?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Maybe if I can squeeze this into my schedule...  
  
**Lima：**  
But Shiori, you still have a lot of flyers to make, haven't you?  
I can finish off my work quickly, so I'll do it.  
  
**Rin：**  
What's got you all looking so serious?  
Did something happen?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Rinrin! Perfect timing!  
  
**Rin：**  
Wh-what now?  
If it involves effort, I'm out.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I see... So it's up to us to solve it after all.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes, it is.  
Rin must be tired from days of handing out flyers.  
  
**Rin：**  
Argh, man! What is it?  
I won't know if it's too much work if you don't tell me!  
Just try me!  
  
**Lima：**  
Really? You see, when I was cleaning out the storehouse, I found some  
aged cheese that would make really good souvenirs for our hot spring  
guests.  
The thing is, the smell of cheese has attracted a ton of mice.  
  
**Shiori：**  
So we need someone to guard the cheese so that it doesn't get eaten.  
But we're all far too busy doing other work.  
  
**Rin：**  
Ah, I guess I have run out of flyers to distribute, so I've got a little time.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Rinrin, I know ya must be tuckered out,  
but could ya watch the cheese for us?  
  
**Rin：**  
...  
  
**Lima：**  
You don't have to if you're too tired though!  
Guarding the cheese is pretty demanding.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes, it is. All I'm doing is making flyers, so I can guard it—  
  
**Rin：**  
You don't have to coddle me, you know.  
I'll do it. I'll protect the cheese.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You will?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Yup. Even if you call it guard duty, it's just mice, right?  
How difficult could it be?  
  
**Lima：**  
Are you sure you're up to it?  
You don't need to push yourself.  
  
**Shiori：**  
She's right.  
I'm sure walking around all day has tired you out.  
  
**Rin：**  
I'm fine!  
Yeah, of course it's not the most fun thing to do,  
but you're short of hands, and I have two of them!  
Let me handle it. You all should get back to your own work.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Rinrin, thanks a million.  
  
**Lima：**  
We'll help you whenever we get a minute!  
  
**Shiori：**  
So you don't have to overdo it, okay?  
  
**Rin：**  
...Really, what do you all think of me?  
Well, I will take all the help I can get.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
All right then.  
We're countin' on ya.  
  
**Rin：**  
Yeah, yeah. Don't worry, I got this.  
Even I can be a cheese guardian.
