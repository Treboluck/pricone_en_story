**Suzume：**  
Ummmm, milady?  
Do you remember the day the two of us first met?  
  
**Suzume：**  
It was your twelfth birthday, wasn't it?  
You were still such a young girl at the time...  
Yet you were giving a big speech to a room full of grown-ups.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Then I managed to mess up like I always do...  
I tripped over and fell right into your birthday cake.  
You remember that, don't you, milady?
