## Subtitle: For Milady's Pride
  
### Place: Outside Sarendia Orphanage
  
**Suzume：**  
Aaahhh...  
I acted all cool and insisted on coming out here alone, but...  
This is way too scary!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Milady...  
Please lend me your protection...!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I-I sure hope it isn't ghosts...  
B-but monsters or intruders don't sound like great options either...  
P-please tell me the kids were just seeing things after all!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ummm...  
Let's see...  
The window to Ayane's room should be over here, right?  
  
**Suzume：**  
She said she saw someone right outside the window, so...  
If I just make sure there's nothing suspicious around here...  
  
**???：**  
...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wahhh?!  
Huh? ...Ayane...?  
  
**Suzume：**  
No...  
Ayane's still inside the Orphanage building, I know she is.  
She's not the kind of girl who would just run off.  
  
**Ayane?：**  
...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Aahhh, now that I look closer, her eyes are the wrong color!  
And it looks like they're sort of glowing?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
It's exactly like Ayane said... Who is this girl?!  
Wh-wh-what's going on?!  
  
**Ayane?：**  
\"...to.........play...\"  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh?  
Wh-what was that?  
Something about playing?  
  
**Ayane?：**  
\"No, silly! I just wanted to play with you!\"  
  
**Suzume：**  
Um, what?  
  
**Ayane?：**  
\"C'mon, let's start already!\"  
\"Awww, what a cute mole!\"  
\"Do your best, mister!\"  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh? Uhhh...?  
  
**???：**  
Aaaaaahhh!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wha...?!  
That scream... Was that Kurumi's voice?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Has something happened to the kids?!  
What do I do now?! Um... Um...!  
  
**Ayane?：**  
\"Ahahaha!\"  
\"This is fun!\"  
\"Ahahaha!\"  
  
**Suzume：**  
That... thing that looks like Ayane...  
doesn't seem to be doing any harm right now...  
Let's leave it for the moment, and go check on the others!  
  
**Suzume：**  
They could be in danger...  
What if some weird apparition has appeared inside, as well?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Guys!  
I-i-is something the matter?!  
I thought I heard a scream just now!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
W-waaaahhh!  
Stop, please! Mama Saren...!  
  
**Saren?：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Protect Kurumi.  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzume：**  
Wahh! That was close!  
Huhhh?! Milady?  
  
**Suzume：**  
What do you think you're doing?!  
You just swung your sword at Kurumi... didn't you?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Look out, Suzume!  
That's not Mama Saren! It's another fake!  
It's just like the \"me\" I saw outside the window!  
  
**Ayane：**  
See, its eyes are glowing!  
And anyway, the real Mama Saren  
would never do anything to hurt us!  
  
**Ayane：**  
So this one's gotta be a fake!  
Get back, you faker! Waahhhh!  
Take this! Pukichi Fullswing!  
  
**Suzume：**  
H-hang on a minute, Ayane!  
Don't attack wildly!  
You'll damage the Orphanage building itself!  
  
**Saren?：**  
\"You seem awfully confident.\"  
\"Well then, let's see what you can do.\"  
  
**Suzume：**  
Waaahhhh?!  
M-m-m-milady?  
Did you just try to attack me?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
That's so mean... Don't you want me anymore?!  
Are you trying to get rid of me?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I knew this day would come!  
I'm such a klutz...  
I never cause you anything but trouble!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please try to remain calm, Miss Suzume.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It would appear that as the young lady...  
...Miss Ayane, was it? As Miss Ayane says...  
This cannot possibly be the real Miss Saren.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This Miss Saren's movements  
are unusually simple and repetitive.  
As long as we stay calm, she should not pose a major threat.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
She does not fight like Miss Saren... Or rather,  
her movements are not those of a trained fighter at all.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If I were to speculate,  
I would surmise that this is a mere monster of some sort.  
One that disguises itself in human form.  
  
**Suzume：**  
A monster...?  
Now that you mention it, it does seem sort of... lifeless?  
There's something not very human about it...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Let me give it a little test.

**Kokkoro：**  
Yes...  
Thanks to your help, we are all unharmed.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Aside, I suppose, from any injuries you may have sustained  
from your spontaneous dive into the floor.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ahahah... Well, that was my own silly fault...  
I'm just glad everyone seems to be safe!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Whatever was that thing that looked like milady, though?  
When we defeated it,  
it vanished into thin air, like it had all been a dream...  
  
**Suzume：**  
And attacking it felt really weird, too...  
It didn't bleed or anything, right?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Do you think it wasn't alive at all?  
Something like a gh-ghost...?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It seemed to get sucked into my sword...  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzume：**  
Oh yes! It did look like that, didn't it?  
What was all that about? I've never seen anything like it...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am afraid I am not aware of the details myself...  
But my lord's blade is a treasure bestowed upon him  
by Lady Ameth herself.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It seems to have the ability to absorb all kinds of monsters,  
exactly like it did to the mysterious apparition just now.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I cannot claim to fully understand it...  
But I will ask Lady Ameth during my next prayer for guidance.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Uh-oh.  
It appears  
 we may not have time to stand around talking...  
  
`image display end`  
**Ayane?：**  
...  
  
**Saren?：**  
...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wahh! They're popping up all over the place!  
It's not even just milady and Ayane...  
There's so many of them!  
  
**Suzume：**  
It looks like the whole Orphanage building  
is surrounded by a pack of impostors?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmmm...  
Neither our stamina nor our magical energy is unlimited.  
If we try to fight all of these creatures, we will be overwhelmed.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Perhaps we should break through their ranks while we can,  
and retreat to a more secure location.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Y-yes, you're right.  
Let's head for the place where milady is holding her meeting,  
and ask her for backup!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Listen closely, everyone!  
I need you all to stay close together,  
and follow me very carefully!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ahhhh...  
How did I end up facing this many perils in a single day?!
