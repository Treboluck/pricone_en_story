# Chapter 3 Episode 2
After putting the children to bed, {player} talks to Saren over dinner. She explains that one reason he and Kokkoro have been asked to stay here is to monitor them after the incident, but that they are free to stay as long as they like, as long as they earn their own keep.
  
## Subtitle: A New Family
  
**Narration：**  
After the events in the bedroom,  
{player} decided to stay up and have dinner  
with Suzume and the others.  
  
**Narration：**  
But first, there was a little something that needed taking care of...

**Kurumi：**  
Zzzzz...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ahaha...  
Thank you for the help, {player}.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Taking little Kurumi to her bedroom for me...  
I would have struggled to carry her all that way on my own.  
There's something to be said for having a man in the house!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  No problem.  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzume：**  
Thanks.  
We really would be happy to have you here at the Orphanage  
for as long as you want to stay, you know?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I can always use a little help with the chores!  
And I know I can trust you with anything.

**Ayane：**  
Hmm?  
Oh, hey, Suzume!  
I didn't know you were back!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, yes.  
We just returned a little while ago.  
It's good to see you too, Ayane!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Uh-huh! Welcome home!  
  
**Ayane：**  
You shouldn't stay out so long, you know.  
I mean, I'm a big girl, so I don't mind...  
But Kurumi gets lonely without you!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ahaha...  
Sorry for leaving you alone, Ayane.  
  
**Suzume：**  
We ran into a little bit of trouble this time,  
so we got back later than expected...  
But I'll try to spend as much time here as I can.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Unhh... Uhh...?  
H-huh...?  
Did I... fall asleep?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, I'm sorry! Did we wake you?  
It's okay, you can go back to sleep, Kurumi!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Wait, huh...?  
{player}, is that you?  
Why're you here carrying Kurumi?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Umm...?  
Ayane, you know {player} too?  
I didn't know you were friends...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Well, yeah.  
You too?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ahaha...  
You really do seem to know everyone,  
don't you, {player}?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Actually, girls, a bunch of stuff happened...  
And {player}  
 is going to be staying here  
at the Orphanage for a while!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I hope you'll make him feel nice and welcome!  
Kurumi, Ayane!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Sure, you got it!  
Leave it to me!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Mister {player}!  
You can ask me anything about life here at the Orphanage!  
Just call me Master Ayane!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"I guess that would make me Master Pukichi!  
Nice to meetcha, greenhorn!\"

**Kurumi：**  
Umm...?  
Does that mean I'm Master Kurumi?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
It would feel kinda weird to be called that  
by Mister {player}...  
Eheheh...  
  
`image display end`  
**Suzume：**  
Ahaha...  
Are you all having a group hug?  
What a cute little bunch you are!  
  
**Suzume：**  
But I think that's enough for now.  
It's getting pretty late, so you two should really get some sleep.  
If you stay up late, the nasty monsters will gobble you up!  
  
![200300202.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/200300202.webp)  
**Saren：**  
There we go, all ready!  
I'm afraid it's only leftovers, but eat as much as you like!  
  
**Saren：**  
You really are a magnet for trouble, {player}.  
At least for tonight, try to have a hearty meal and a good night's sleep.  
All's well that ends well, wouldn't you say?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wait, huh...?  
Milady, could it be that you're already acquainted  
with {player} as well?  
  
**Saren：**  
Well, yes.  
We've met a few times before.  
He helped me out with some work once or twice.  
  
**Saren：**  
I hear you've helped Suzume out before as well, {player}?  
You certainly do get around.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ahaha...  
Did you know that Ayane and Kurumi  
are already friends with him, too?  
  
**Suzume：**  
You should have seen Kurumi just now!  
She and Ayane looked so happy to see him,  
it was like they were one big family!  
  
**Suzume：**  
The both of them even started calling him \"big bro.\"  
It was quite the little reunion!  
  
`image display end`  
**Saren：**  
Oh...?  
Just so we're clear on this, {player},  
I won't forgive you if you try anything funny with my kids.  
  
**Saren：**  
Of course, I know what a good-hearted soul you are,  
so I'm sure there's nothing to worry about there.  
  
**Saren：**  
But it's my duty to keep all the Sarendia Orphanage children safe.  
If any unsavory individuals lay a finger on them,  
they'll be tasting the sharp edge of my blade!  
  
**Saren：**  
Dear me, though, I really am tired.  
  
**Saren：**  
I rushed all the way from my mansion in the mountains  
to find those Nightmare goons attacking Caon,  
and had to stop them all on my own...  
  
**Saren：**  
And it's not even over. I have to head out soon for the inquiry!  
I might not be getting any sleep tonight...  
Ohhh, this is going to play havoc with my skin.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ahaha...  
We're all grateful for your hard work, milady.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Actually, though...  
If there's an inquiry, shouldn't we go along too?  
We were far more involved in the whole thing than milady was...  
  
**Saren：**  
No, no.  
For tonight's discussion,  
we're just going to talk things over guildmaster-to-guildmaster.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'll be representing the Sarendia Orphanage,  
and there'll be Jun from Nightmare,  
as well as, ehm, Maho from Caon?  
  
**Saren：**  
The three of us will be discussing how to proceed.  
  
**Saren：**  
It's getting pretty late already,  
so I imagine your questioning won't be until tomorrow.  
We'll need to hear from all of you in due time, so be prepared for that.  
  
**Saren：**  
Until then, I hope our two guests  
will be happy to stay here at the Orphanage?  
We won't charge you anything for room and board.  
  
**Saren：**  
If you don't have anywhere else to go,  
you're free to stay here for as long as you like.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  That sounds great, but are you sure?  
`Tag 2`  
**Saren：**  
Well, yes.  
We'll expect you to at least earn your keep, of course.  
I can help you find work if you need it.  
  
**Saren：**  
And just so we're clear, don't go running off anywhere.  
We didn't *just* take you in out of the goodness of our hearts.  
I also need to keep an eye on you until the questioning is over.  
  
**Saren：**  
You see, somebody needed to take you into custody.  
Caon's guildhouse was in a pretty awful state  
after the chaos of the attack...  
  
**Saren：**  
And Nightmare's base of operations is the palace,  
so they can't let just anyone inside.  
  
**Saren：**  
So really, letting you stay with us was the only option.  
We were basically a neutral third party in this incident,  
so it made a lot of sense from that angle, too.  
  
**Saren：**  
Though technically, we're on the same side as Nightmare,  
seeing as we're both Princess Knight guilds.  
So we can't call ourselves completely impartial...  
  
**Suzume：**  
What an awkward situation...  
It's all so messy.  
How did a peaceful guild like ours get mixed up in all this?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I-it's probably all my fault, isn't it?!  
I'm so sorry!  
  
**Saren：**  
Why would you even think that, Suzume?  
  
**Saren：**  
None of us did anything wrong here. We're just victims!  
So act a little more confident!  
Showing weakness will only get you taken advantage of.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, wait...  
You haven't been in Landosol very long,  
have you, {player}?  
So you're probably not too clear on all this inter-guild politics.  
  
**Saren：**  
You basically have \"I'm lost\" written all over your face...  
Well, don't worry, I'll explain what you need to know.  
Let's go over the basics while we eat, shall we?
