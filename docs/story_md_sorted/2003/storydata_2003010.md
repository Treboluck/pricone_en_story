## Subtitle: Interlude 4
  
**Ameth：**  
And that’s the end of that chapter.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You certainly are keeping busy today, aren't you?  
But I'm glad you managed to make it out of there, at least.  
  
**Ameth：**  
...It can be frustrating, you know, being able to do nothing but watch.  
  
**Ameth：**  
At any rate...  
You encountered  
 a nasty little phenomenon this time, didn't you?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Just to put your mind at ease...  
Let me reassure you that everyone made it out in one piece,  
and you managed to regroup with Saren at the meeting venue.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You can finally catch your breath and rest after a long day.  
About time too, I'd say.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Though while you're sorting out a place to stay,  
it looks like Saren is going to make a little request of you,  
sending you on a hiking trip up into the mountains...  
  
**Ameth：**  
But let's not worry about that right now.  
That's for later. You can look forward to it after you wake up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Right now,  
 what I want to talk about  
is that mysterious phenomenon you encountered.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Recently in this world, there have been a number of  
mysterious happenings that ordinary logic can't explain.  
And they're putting the lives of ordinary citizens at risk.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm sure you've heard about some of them already.  
Of the various strange phenomena at large right now,  
two of the most notable are \"Shadows\" and \"Lost.\"  
  
**Ameth：**  
\"Shadows\" are beings like the ones you just met.  
Strange creatures they are, too. A little like ghosts.  
Most people seem to consider them a type of monster.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Whatever they are, sightings of them have been on the rise.  
They creep people out, but usually don't do any actual harm.  
Occasionally, though, they've been known to attack people.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Just like the ones you met tonight.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Nobody knows where they came from, and they don't seem to really be  
alive.  
 They don't bleed when you slice them, don't eat or sleep...  
All they really seem to do is endlessly wander about.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But, well, they *are* pretty creepy...  
And the worst part is, every last one of them seems to have  
the same appearance as a real living person.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Nobody's going to be very happy knowing  
that a copy of themselves is lurking out there.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The Shadows you met tonight, of course,  
looked just like Ayane and Saren, didn't they?  
Even their voices were identical.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, the same goes for all the other Shadows that have appeared.  
They clearly aren't beings that should exist in this world,  
but more and more of them are showing up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Meanwhile, things that should exist seem to be going missing.  
I'm talking about the mysterious phenomenon of the \"Lost.\"  
  
**Ameth：**  
Normally, you can't have a child without parents, right?  
A man and a woman fall in love, and they have a child.  
That's the way of nature for humans... for all mammals, even.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But lately...  
Cases have been popping up where children exist,  
but there's no sign of the parents anywhere.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Those missing people have come to be known as \"Lost.\"  
They simply disappear, like they were never around to begin with.  
  
**Ameth：**  
They aren't in the guild registry that keeps track of citizens,  
and they can't be found in anyone's memories, either.  
  
**Ameth：**  
If it was just the records missing, we could write them off  
as administrative errors or something of the sort.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But it's people's memories, too.  
It shouldn't be possible to have a child without parents,  
but nobody remembers them ever having any.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The parents must exist, but they don't.  
That paradox is why people first realized this phenomenon was a thing.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Despite having no parents, and no sign of ever having had them,  
these children had somehow been living normal lives.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyone can see that's strange, right?  
And yet nobody thought anything of it until recently.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Only once people became aware of the phenomenon,  
and started to investigate the \"Lost\" more closely...  
  
**Ameth：**  
...did they start to find signs that many more people  
might have vanished from the world without a trace.  
  
**Ameth：**  
If it was only one or two cases, you could explain it away.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Perhaps the parents abandoned their child and ran off,  
deliberately hiding their tracks from the world.  
Perhaps the child suppressed their memories because of trauma.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But when it happens hundreds of times, there has to be more to it.  
So that's the mystery of the \"Lost.\"  
  
**Ameth：**  
Looks like that Kurumi girl who you've befriended  
is one of the many victims who have lost their parents.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What Shadows and the Lost have in common  
is that nobody can explain what's causing them.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And I'm sure there are other mysterious phenomena out there  
that people just haven't noticed yet.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You see, I know the root cause behind all of this.  
Something has infected this world, twisting it all out of shape.  
Shadows and Lost are bugs resulting from those distortions.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Like nasty side-effects of the world's current unnatural state.  
So if nobody fixes the problems with the world itself,  
neither Shadows nor Lost will ever truly be solved.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Kurumi will never be able to see her parents again...  
Or even remember that she ever had any.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You wouldn't want her to be stuck like that forever, would you?  
A cruel fate for such a sweet and kind-hearted girl.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, if you feel sorry for her,  
you can go fix this world's distortions.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The keys to solving this mystery are lying all around you.  
You just have to pick them up, one by one.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Unravel the world's secrets, and eliminate the source of the problems.  
Or should I say... Go and save the world.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You're probably the only one with the power to do this, you know.  
And I know you *can* do it. That's why I'm cheering you on.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Good luck out there, Mr. Hero...  
You've saved the world once, and you can do it again.
