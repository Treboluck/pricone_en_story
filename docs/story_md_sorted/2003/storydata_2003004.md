**Ayane：**  
Kurumi...  
Hey, Kurumi...!  
W-wake up, please!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Unhhh...?  
What's the matter, Ayane...?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Umm...  
Can you hear a weird noise?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
A noise...?  
I dunno...  
Maybe Mama Saren and the others are still awake?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
What time is it...?  
Ahhh...  
I stayed up later than usual tonight, so I'm really sleepy...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yeah, I know...  
I'm sorry I woke you up...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
That's OK...  
 You always keep me company in bed  
when I have nightmares and stuff...  
If you're feeling scared,  
 I wanna help you out too...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
C'mon, Ayane, why don't you get in my bed?  
It won't be scary if we're together, right?  
Then we can both get a good night's sleep...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ahh... When you say it like that, it sounds like I'm a baby...  
I'm still older than you are, you know?  
  
**Ayane：**  
But, umm...  
If you really want...  
I guess I could sleep in your bed this one time...  
 Huh?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
...

**Ayane：**  
A... Aaaaaaghhhhh!  
  
`image display end`  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord.  
Please awaken, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah good, you are awake.  
I am sorry to disturb you at this hour.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I do understand you need your rest, but...  
Could I ask you something?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
N-no, you misunderstand...  
It is not that I became lonely  
and decided I could not sleep apart from you after all...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
After those thorough explanations from Miss Suzume,  
I am willing to accept that our sleeping situation was improper.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And she was kind enough to ensure  
that my room is the closest in the building to your own.  
If anything is amiss, I will be able to find you immediately.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So please, if you notice anything untoward during the night,  
simply shout as loud as you can, so that I may be informed.  
I promise that I will be with you in mere seconds.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh!  
But at any rate... Did you hear a scream just now?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  A scream...?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed.  
I thought I heard the shrill sound of a young girl crying out.  
Though I hope it was only my imagination...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You're probably just on edge.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed. But our lives have been endangered many times today.  
It seems quite reasonable to be on our guard.  
We cannot rule out the possibility of yet another attack.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As a precaution against just such a turn of events,  
I was staying awake to keep watch.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As the night progressed, I may have begun to nod off...  
But that was when I heard the scream.  
So my first thought was to come and confirm your safety.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Haha...  
Of course, when I got here, you were sleeping like a baby,  
so I must say I was relieved.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank goodness you are all right.  
Despite everything Miss Suzume said,  
it does worry me to leave you all alone at night.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, my lord...  
My one and only, most very precious lord...  
  
**???：**  
Aaaaaahhh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah! Another scream, just like before!  
Clearly it was not my imagination after all.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm.  
It sounded like it came from the direction of the main hall.  
I think I shall go and investigate.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please wait here until I return.  
No, actually... We cannot be sure it is safe here.  
Perhaps you should accompany me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If we truly are under attack...  
I will ensure that you, at least, are able to escape.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It does not seem ideal for you to go out in your pajamas,  
so here, you should wear this cloak.  
Aside from that... Your sword should suffice.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Now let us go forth, my lord.  
We should take care and move slowly.  
Try to stay as close to me as you can.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Waaaahhh!  
I'm scared!  
  
![200300402.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/200300402.webp)  
**Ayane：**  
Too creepy! That was way too creepy!  
I-it looked just like me!  
I was standing right there, outside the window!  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'm not making it up! Please believe me!  
I'm a good girl—I wouldn't tell lies!  
  
**Ayane：**  
I knew it... I knew this would happen...  
It's just like Papa and Mama... I must not be \"real\"...  
  
**Ayane：**  
The \"real me\" must be the one outside the window!  
So... So... Waaaahhhhh!  
  
`image display end`  
**Suzume：**  
P-please try to get a hold of yourself, Ayane!  
It's all right, you're safe now! Don't cry!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Excuse us.  
Miss Suzume, what seems to be the matter here?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ahh, Kokkoro! And {player} too!  
I'm sorry, did the girls wake you up?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ehm, I only just woke up and rushed over here myself,  
so I'm not sure what's going on either...  
But it sounds like Ayane had a nasty dream or something?  
  
**Ayane：**  
I-it wasn't a dream!  
I really saw it! It was another me!  
Y-you believe me, don't you, Kurumi?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Aahhh...  
I-I don't know what happened, but...  
  
![200300403.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/200300403.webp)  
**Kurumi：**  
Ayane was lying right here next to me...  
But she was out there too... Standing outside the window...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ummm... What does this mean, then?  
Kurumi, you're saying you also saw this... um...  
This \"other Ayane\"?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I don't think either of you girls would lie to me, but...  
Umm...  
Maybe you just saw Ayane's reflection in the glass?  
  
**Suzume：**  
You saw her face in the window,  
and it looked like a scary ghost or something outside?  
That's what scared you?  
 That must be it, right?  
  
**Ayane：**  
It wasn't like that! It was me out there, but it wasn't me!  
Her eyes were glowing! They weren't the same color as mine!  
And it looked like she laughed at me and said something!  
  
`image display end`  
**Suzume：**  
Um, ummmm...  
I really don't know what to think... What should we do?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Let me go outside and see if I can find anything strange.  
Just in case it was an intruder you saw, or a monster.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm.  
If it was a monster, might it not be dangerous to search alone?  
You do not appear to be highly prepared for battle...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, no...  
I'll be fine.  
 I'm only going to have a quick look.  
  
**Suzume：**  
As for the two of you...  
You should stay here and keep the girls company.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'll give a shout if anything looks bad,  
so if you hear me call, get them somewhere safe.  
The least I can do is buy time for everyone to escape.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Milady is out at her meeting with the other guildmasters...  
So the duty of protecting the Sarendia Orphanage  
falls to me right now!
