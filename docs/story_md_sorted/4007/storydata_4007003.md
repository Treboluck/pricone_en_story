# Return of the Colossus
Pecorine and Lima launch into outer space and succeed in finding Karyl. As the L-Fighter rockets forth to mount an attack on the mystery mothership, its intrepid pilots behold the shape of what appears to be a gigantic Lima. Though the mystery deepens, the course of action is clear, and our heroes mount an all-out attack upon the Lima mothership.
  
## Subtitle: Return of the Colossus
  
**Narration：**  
Our intrepid pilots Lima and Pecorine leave the surface behind,  
braving overwhelming G-forces until their L-Fighter craft  
finally makes it into the vast expanse of outer space.  
  
**Lima：**  
So this is what it's like in the world beyond the sky...  
It's beautiful...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You're right...  
 But we can't let our guard down.  
There's no telling what might happen here!  
  
**Lima：**  
Agreed! Let's find Karyl and get back home safely!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We've traveled a long way... but where's the mothership?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Pecorine! Lima! Can you hear me?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
This thing just started sucking up food, and I think I'm gonna get—  
Urghh... uerlghh!  
Drowning in... food... I can't... talk...!  
 Aurgh... aurlghh!  
  
**Lima：**  
Karyl?! Are you OK?! Are you still alive?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait... Wh-what?! Uerghh?!  
The food's... all turning into apples!  
What the heck?! Is it gonna do the same thing to me?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
S-stoooop! I don't wanna be an apple! I don't wanna!  
Aaaarghhhh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
N-now it's shaking?!  
 Wait—I'm gonna throw up!  
Don't turn me upside down! Waaaghhhh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Huh? Suddenly it sent me down a different chute?  
Where am I going?  
 ...Huh?! H-hey, wait!  
Aurghh! Uergh... W-wai—aurlghh—!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Aurlgghhhh?!  
Awawawaurghhhh...  
Stop! Aughh... where are you—  
awawawaghhh...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl...?! What's going on over there?!  
Karyl?!  
  
**Lima：**  
Karyl...? Karyl...?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Looks like we've... lost all contact...  
  
**Lima & Pecorine：**  
...\"Plop\"?

**Karyl：**  
Uh, you guys... Can you hear me?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, you're all right! Thank goodness!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm not all right, but I'm out of the mothership...  
I'm floating in outer space, so come get me...  
I'll send a magic signal... so please... try to be quick...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Over there! I see something shining! Let's go!  
  
`image display end`  
**Karyl：**  
*huff*... *puff*...  
That was the absolute worst...  
  
**Lima：**  
What even happened? Your whole body's all sticky...  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Don't wanna talk about it.  
Hey, more importantly, does this thing have weapons?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, yes, I suppose it does.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Great!  
 Putting me through all that... They're gonna pay!  
I'm blowing that mothership to smithereens!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Do I just press this button here?  
 Eat this!  
  
**???：**  
,[*LL;I:|;☆'_-^MA^#+(!^;_  
  
**Karyl：**  
Bah... I missed...  
  
**Lima：**  
I glimpsed something in the light of the beam...  
Is that the mothership?! It's gigantic...  
  
**???：**  
#._M;A''♪^,,$★ ?LL|-I^?L  
  
**Lima：**  
Now it's coming this way really fast?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That just saves us the trouble!  
Let's take this chance to shoot it down!  
  
**Karyl：**  
This time you're so dead!  
Hyper-Condensed Ultra-Magic Cannon, fire!  
  
**Robo-Lima：**  
LLIMA-LLIMA-LLIMAAAA!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? That looks like...  
  
**Lima, Pecorine & Karyl：**  
Lima?!  
Me?!  
  
**Lima：**  
Wh-why does the mothership look like me?!  
And... why do I feel like I've seen it before?  
  
**Lima：**  
What *is* this...? This uneasy sensation in my chest...  
It makes me feel sick...  
  
**Robo-Lima：**  
LLIMA-LLIMA-LLIMAAAA!  
  
**Karyl：**  
No time to worry about details!  
We've gotta destroy it before it destroys us!  
  
**Lima：**  
...You're right.  
I do need to pay it back for stealing my apples!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The price for stealing Landosol's food  
and tormenting our sweet Karyl won't come cheap!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Let's do it! Try this on for size! Take everything we've got!  
  
**Lima, Pecorine & Karyl：**  
Yaaaahhhhhhhh!  
  
**Robo-Lima：**  
LLIMA... LLIMA-LLIMAAAA?!

And amongst the countless twinkling stars in the void,  
a new light briefly gleamed brighter than any other...
