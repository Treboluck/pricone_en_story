{player} and the Gourmet Guild are enjoying the harvest festival when Landosol is suddenly assaulted by strange noises and strong winds. Karin enlists their help to investigate, but when they arrive on the scene, a mysterious flying saucer appears and abducts Karyl.

How's that?! Surely you can see you're no match for us!

**Kokkoro：**  
Is the object... growing angry with us?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That must mean our attacks are working!  
Let's keep piling on the pressure!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-what now?! I'm being sucked towards the saucer!  
H-help me, guys!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl! Try to grab on to me!  
  
**Karyl：**  
M-my body won't move—  
  
**Karyl：**  
Aaaaghhhh?!

**Kokkoro：**  
She has been sucked inside the great saucer!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Give her back! Give us back our Karyyyyl!
