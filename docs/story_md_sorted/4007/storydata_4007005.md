**Karyl：**  
How's that?! Surely you're ready to give up the ghost by now!  
  
**Robo-Lima：**  
LI-LI-MA-MA VITALS SEVERELY DEPLETED.  
LIMACTOR FULLY ACTUATED. PROTECTING TRADE SECRETS  
BY INITIATING SELF-DESTRUCT SEQUENCE.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?!  
Is that thing still planning to take us down no matter what?!  
You've gotta be kidding me!  
  
**Robo-Lima：**  
CONVERTING ALL ORGANIC MATTER INTO APPLE FUEL.  
APPLE ENERGY FULLY CHARGED.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What shall we do now?! The enemy's Limactor has begun to glow!  
  
**Lima：**  
We can't just give up now!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Lima?! What are you doing?!  
  
**Lima：**  
Let the guys at Elizabeth Park know that I love them!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Lima?!  
  
**Lima：**  
I won't let you do this, you monster!

**Narration：**  
Lima runs without looking back.  
In the instant that her blade strikes the reactor,  
a blinding light envelops the area.  
  

---  
  
**Narration：**  
And when the blinding light disappears,  
there is no sign of the mothership... or of Lima.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh no... Miss Lima...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
What's the point in winning if we're not all together?  
You're such a dummy...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Kokkoro! Karyl!  
Look up there! High up in the sky!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The sky...? Please don't say something is still...? Ahhh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-what the heck?  
There are tons and tons of apples raining down...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Could that be what's left of all the food they stole?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Such a great volume of apples...  
If only Miss Lima were still here, how happy she would be...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Lima... Can you really be...  
 Hm?  
Over there! Hidden among the apples, there's something white...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I do believe you're right.  
It is... Miss Lima!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We have to go and help her!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Lima, Miss Lima! Please open your eyes for us...!  
  
**Lima：**  
Mmnhh... Mmm...  
Apples... so yummy...  
So much fun... Apples...  
  
**Lima：**  
...Ahh?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, great! You're all right!  
  
**Lima：**  
H-huh? I was totally surrounded by apples, and...  
  
**Karyl：**  
What kind of weird dream is that?  
...Wait, it's not even a dream!  
There really are apples as far as the eye can see!  
  
**Lima：**  
Apples? Whoa—you're right! How come?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
All the converted stolen food came raining down from the mothership!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Converting all that food into apples...  
What was even the point of that...?  
And actually, why did it abduct me in the first place?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Hm? Apples? Apples...  
I-it couldn't be because I had that candy apple?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh well! Everyone's safe now,  
so who cares about the details?  
All's well that ends well, you know! Right, Karyl? ☆  
  
**Lima：**  
That's true! Let's forget about details  
and feast on these lovely apples!  
 Mm...  
Yep, delicious! ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
These really are the sweetest and most delicious apples.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So many apples I could keep eating all day!  
It's the best! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Uh, how can you eat those  
when you don't even know what they used to... be...  
  
**Lima：**  
Karyl? Aren't you gonna eat?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Gahhh... Fine! All right already!  
If it'll shut you up, I'll eat some!  
*munch*...  
 Oh no... They really are good...  
  
**Lima：**  
Haha. That's great!  
Let's turn this into a big apple party! ♪  
  

---  
  
**Lima：**  
Mmnhh... Mmm...  
Apples... so yummy...  
So much fun... Apples...  
  
**Lima：**  
...Ahh?!  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh?! Huh?!  
Where are the apples?! The apple party?!  
  
**Lima：**  
Where did everybody go?  
Didn't we promise to feast on apples together?  
Where are you guys?!  
  
**Lima：**  
Guys?! Where are you?!  
  
**Lima：**  
Don't tell me the saucers got them all?!  
No, surely it couldn't be...  
  
**Lima：**  
Pecorine! Karyl! Kokkoro!  
  
**Lima：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
In the end, I came all the way to their guildhouse...  
Will they be home, I wonder...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ughhh... Who's knocking at this hour...?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Could they have some manner of urgent business...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We're coming...!  
  
**Lima：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
Thank goodness...  
You're all... here...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Lima...?  
Whaddaya want in the middle of the night?  
  
**Lima：**  
Our apple party!  
  
**Pecorine, Kokkoro & Karyl：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hahahaha!  
So what, you ran here all the way from the farm half asleep?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl...! It is not... nice to laugh...  
This must have been very... difficult for Miss Lima...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's right! You mustn't laugh at her!  
Chasing after delicious food in her dreams... I totally get that!  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh? Huh? I'm half asleep?  
A-a dream? But the L-Fighter? The end of Landosol?  
The giant flying saucers?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sounds a bit like the dream I told you about.  
`Tag 1`  
**Lima：**  
...Oh...  
  
**Lima：**  
Now that you mention it, you did tell me before  
about the heroic Lima defeating an evil Robo-Lima...  
Is that why I had such a weird dream...?  
  
**Lima：**  
It all seemed so real...  
I'm sorry, guys! For barging in at this ridiculous hour!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't worry about it! This stuff happens a lot!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Does it really...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It happens all the time, Miss Karyl.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But after hearing about all those yummy apples,  
I'm starting to feel hungry!  
Lima, let's hold a great big apple party today! ☆  
  
**Lima：**  
...Really?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Of course!  
  
**Lima：**  
Thank you! I'll go and fetch the yummiest apples I've got!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, why don't you stay and catch your breath...  
Welp, she's already gone.  
  
**Narration：**  
Later that day, Lima returned with a huge pile of apples  
and enjoyed a most wonderful apple party with the Gourmet Guild.  
  
**Narration：**  
So... all's well that ends well?
