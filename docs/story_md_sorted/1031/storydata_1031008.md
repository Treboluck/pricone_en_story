**Narration：**  
Shinobu and {player} are out for a stroll  
when suddenly, a familiar light engulfs them.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
This strange light again?! I-it's so bright...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Aahhh!  
  

---  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh, {player}, hello there.  
What was I doing? Just reading a magazine.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
This \"Spooks & Spirits Weekly\" is very entertaining.  
Right, Father?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...Father?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...How awful. It would appear  
my father has been replaced with a counterfeit.  
I fear he has been stolen.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  An overenthusiastic fan, perhaps?  
**Choice: (2)**  Is someone holding him for ransom?!  
`Tag 1`  
**Shinobu：**  
Ah, no.  
My father doesn't have any fans at all, so that's impossible.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Shinobu：**  
I don't think that's likely.  
I've only ever met a handful of people  
who believe my claims that this skull is my father.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shinobu：**  
I think it must have been an antiques broker  
hoping to sell him for a high price.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Lately among enthusiasts, his skull has come under suspicion  
of being the legendary \"Crystal Skull of Tsubakigaoka.\"  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Though in reality, it's just a cheap prop he bought  
at a flea market.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'll find the culprit for you!  
**Choice: (5)**  Let's go to the police.  
`Tag 4`  
**Shinobu：**  
Ahh... {player}! Hold on a second!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
{player}... Please... wait a moment...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
{player}... P-please wait...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
Ahhhhh... I finally caught up with you...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
{player}... How do you plan to catch the thief  
when you don't even know what he looks like?  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Shinobu：**  
Ah, no... In this case, it should be quicker  
for me to track down the culprit myself, I believe.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Shinobu：**  
Please leave this to me.  
There are plenty of witnesses here who only I can consult.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
You see? That woman floating right behind you  
is saying she saw the whole thing happen.  
  
**Thief：**  
Heheheh...  
This creepy old skull's gonna  
make me the big bucks!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
There you are.  
You're the thief who stole my father, yes?  
Give him back at once.  
  
**Thief：**  
Tch... The girl found me?!  
This thing's mine now! Outta my way!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Ahhh...!  
  
**Thief：**  
Heh! Not so cocky with your ass in the dirt, are ya?!  
Later, loser!  
  
**Thief：**  
...Huh? Was this skull always red...?  
  
**Thief：**  
Owowowowow!  
Wh-what's going on?! This thing's scorching hot!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Ah, your rough treatment of me must have angered my father.  
  
**Thief：**  
Th-this skull's too creepy!  
Forget it! You can have it!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh, he got away...  
But we've recovered my father, so I suppose this will do.

**Shinobu：**  
It's good to see you, Father.  
{player} helped me search for you, you know.  
You should probably thank him.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I see, I see...  
\"I told you to stay away from my Shinobu!  
You're dead meat!\"  
 ...is what he's saying.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Honestly, Father, you can be so insincere!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
You know, {player},  
I was only able to track my father down thanks to  
the plethora of lively spirits hovering in the vicinity.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I could never have assembled so many myself...  
It's all down to your fortitude of character.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
You are a wonderful fellow, {player}.

**Ameth：**  
Her father was switched with a fake, and she didn't notice?  
Shinobu can be a bit spacey, can't she?  
Well, at least she got him back in the end, I suppose...  
  
**Ameth：**  
So... How'd you like my little present?  
Did you have a nice dream?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I created that dream based on your past memories with Shinobu,  
but your actions this time around were interesting.  
It was entertaining to watch.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway,  I'll see you around!  
  

---  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...Oh, {player}.  
Are you awake now?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I was asleep myself until just now.  
Just like before, I dreamed of a strange other world.  
You saw it too, did you?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...I see, I see.  
These dreams really are mysterious.  
I wonder if there's a spiritual explanation.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh, but, {player}...  
Thank you for helping me find my father, even in my dreams.  
You're a kind soul in any world, aren't you?  
  
**Narration：**  
Shinobu and {player} reminisced together  
over their mysterious, yet somehow nostalgic,  
shared experience.
