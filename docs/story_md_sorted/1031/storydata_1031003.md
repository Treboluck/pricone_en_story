## Subtitle: Fortune-Telling Fun
  
**Narration：**  
One day while walking through Landosol,  
{player} runs into Shinobu.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh, {player}. Hello there. Are you out for a walk?  
The weather is lovely, so I suppose it's a perfect day for it.  
...What about me?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh, I was doing some readings for passers-by.  
I'm a fortune-teller by trade, so I often do business  
out here on the street.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's fortune-telling?  
**Choice: (2)**  Can you tell my fortune?  
`Tag 1`  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh? You've never heard of fortune-telling?  
That's quite unusual.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Fortune-telling is... the art of inspecting a person's future  
through various methods, and relaying it to them as advice  
that might help them with their worries. I suppose.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
It's a little difficult to explain.  
 If you'd like,  
I could demonstrate by reading your fortune for you.  
It might be easier to understand that way.

`Tag 2`  
**Shinobu：**  
But of course. In that case, why don't you take a seat here?  
I usually perform readings using my own spiritual senses  
with the aid of this crystal skull.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shinobu：**  
Well, then... I will begin.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Your luck is absolutely awful. Only pain lies in your future.  
You'll be burned, drowned, impoverished, abandoned by  
those closest to you, and finally die a lonely, depressing death.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
If you wish to avoid this fate, you should make yourself scarce  
with the utmost of haste. So get lost, you filthy brat!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father. I think that's quite enough.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Aaargh! My daughter's a demon!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I'm very sorry. All of that was just my father's ravings,  
not a real fortune reading.  
Please don't worry about it.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
My father was a celebrated spirit medium,  
and reading fortunes was among his talents.  
So in theory, his predictions should be extremely accurate...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
But no matter what results he sees, he only tells male customers  
the worst of them, and female customers the best.  
So he's not cut out for fortune-telling work.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Now then, allow me to give you a proper reading of my own.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Your fate... is most unusual.  
I've never seen results quite like this before.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Your past is clouded in a deep blackness,  
so it is difficult for me to discern  
what kind of path you have taken...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
And when I look to your future, I see all kinds of calamity  
awaiting you. I fear you will suffer in many ways.  
The trials you must face may even lead you to despair.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...Oh... I'm so sorry.  
This is not the kind of result  
I had hoped to be able to give you...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
From now on, if you're ever unsure how best to proceed,  
please feel free to consult with me.  
My readings may be able to show you the way forward.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Also...  
There is one particular fate  
that I saw manifest in both your past and future.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
\"Romantic troubles.\" And in incredible volume.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
It seems your fate is bound with an extraordinary number of  
women, and they hold great sway over your inner balance.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...Um... I'm not sure I approve.  
I think you should exercise a little more moderation  
in your relations with women.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I think your attitude... may tend to invite misunderstandings.  
How should I put this...  
You are altogether too kind to others.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Even pure kindness can have awkward effects  
when taken to excess...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
In other words... What I mean to say is...  
Well... ahhh...  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Hmm? What's up, Shinobu?  
You've gone bright red. Have you got a fever?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I-it's nothing, Father!  
{player}! I think I'll be going now! Goodbye!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Sh-Shinobu...?!  
  
**Narration：**  
The one most taken aback by this fortune reading  
seemed to be the fortune-teller herself.
