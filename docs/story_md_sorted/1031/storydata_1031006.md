## Subtitle: The End is Nigh
  
**Narration：**  
Today, {player} is taking a stroll through Landosol.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
{player}!  
F-finally, I found you... It's terrible!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
The world is going to end today!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Huh?  
`Tag 1`  
**Shinobu：**  
This morning, my father saw it in his fortune reading.  
\"Today, the world will perish\"...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
As a celebrated spirit medium, my father's talents are  
unmatched.  
 Father, you're sure about this, aren't you?  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Yes... When I aligned my astrological vertices to analyze  
the tremors in the Akashic record, the unified karmic principle  
was diverting the cycle of samsara to the primal spirit cradle...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
At any rate, it seems the world is going to end today.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
So this is our last day in this world...  
Shinobu... Brat... Thank you both for everything.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father...  
 I should be thanking you  
for looking after me all these years.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
*sigh* I wish I could've met a cute girl before the end...  
Shinobu. Brat. This is my final wish.  
You gotta help me get together with a bodacious beauty!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
More importantly, {player}, you should  
do something special before it's too late.  
There won't be another chance, after all.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Sh-Shinobu?  
We were talking about my final wish...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It's hard to choose...  
**Choice: (3)**  I'll help with whatever you want to do.  
`Tag 2`  
**Shinobu：**  
Yes, of course... This is all so sudden...  
You must have hundreds of things you still want to do  
before everything comes crashing down...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Huh? You can't think of anything? Really?  
I... I see... Actually, in a way,  
I suppose that's very like you, {player}.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Shinobu：**  
Whatever... I want to do...?  
Actually, I don't have anything in particular...  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Skullfather：**  
Can we get back to my final wish already?!  
You gotta find me a bodacious babe with absolutely massive—  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh,  
 are you feeling a little hungry? Actually, I think I am too.  
For starters, then, shall we go and have a meal?  
We can decide how to spend our final day over lunch.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
It's our final lunch ever, so let's have something delicious.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Sh-Shinobu...?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Thank you for the meal. It was very good, wasn't it?  
Haha... I went for something more expensive than usual,  
but it is our last day ever, so that seems fair, right?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...You're feeling pretty stuffed now, so you'd like to rest?  
Well then, shall we head out to the plains?  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Shinobu! When are you gonna grant my final wish?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Such a cool breeze... It feels lovely!  
It's like we're out for a picnic.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Actually, I've never been on a picnic before...  
So this is so fresh and new to me!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...Oh, are you awake?  
You've been asleep all afternoon.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
What? Oh, my lap? Yes, I'm sorry about that...  
I thought you'd be more comfortable there than  
lying on the grass... Was that presumptuous of me?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I appreciate it.  
`Tag 5`  
**Shinobu：**  
Thank goodness...!  
You looked so sweet and peaceful in your sleep.  
Eheheh...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
The sun is setting... I suppose today is coming to a close.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Um... How would you like to stay here and look at the stars?  
It's the final night of the world, so rather than go back to the  
city, I thought it might be nicerto spend it somewhere quiet.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Wow... The stars are so beautiful!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Well then, shall we lie here and enjoy the view  
as we wait for the world to collapse?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Today was almost like... um... like a date, wasn't it?  
I enjoyed it a lot.  
Eheheh... Maybe the end of the world isn't so bad after all!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
No... It's not just today.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Since I met you, {player},  
every day has been a joy.  
I feel so lucky to spend my final moments by your side.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
But, {player}...  
Are you sure you should have spent your final day  
here with me?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...Th-thank you very much!  
Hearing that makes me... ever so happy.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I don't even mind if the world ends right now...  
My life... was all worthwhile.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...Ah... It looks like the sun has risen.  
Father, wasn't the world supposed to end yesterday?  
Weren't the Akashic records returning to the primal cradle...?  
  
**Skullfather：**  
I... made it up.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Huh? You... what?! What do you mean?!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
I thought with the world ending, you'd both be willing  
to give me a hand with granting one final wish! So... yeah.  
But you two... Neither of you listened to a word I...!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
\"So, yeah\"?! That's horrible, Father!  
Did you really want to flirt with \"bodacious babes\"  
that much?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
There are some things you don't joke about!  
Now I've made {player}  
waste a whole day with me for nothing!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
A-a whole day... together with...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...Aaaahhh...!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father... I've decided I won't get mad at you for yesterday.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Hmm? Wh-why not?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
{player}, I'm so sorry for all this.  
A-and, um... Everything I said yesterday...  
P-please forget it all!  
  
**Narration：**  
In the end, {player} had whiled away  
an entire day for no reason whatsoever.
