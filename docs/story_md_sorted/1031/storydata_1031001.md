**Narration：**  
While on a stroll through Landosol,  
{player} happens upon a girl being attacked  
by a floating skull monster.  
  
**???：**  
...Please stop. That's really quite enough.  
  
**Skull：**  
I can't hold back any more! Nguooohhhhh!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Defeat the monster.  
`Tag 1`  
**Skull：**  
Owwww! Why, you! Suddenly slashing at an old man!  
Whaddaya think you're playing at?!  
  
**???：**  
Um... Did this skull do something to bother you?  
  
**???：**  
...You saw me being attacked by a monster and tried to help?  
Come to think of it, I suppose it would look that way.  
  
**???：**  
My apologies for any worry I may have caused you.  
This skull is not actually a monster.  
  
**???：**  
It is my father.  
  
**???：**  
Due to certain circumstances, he takes the form of a floating skull,  
but his mind is my father's, I am quite sure.  
  
**???：**  
Father, apologize to the nice man.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
What are you saying, Shinobu?!  
This brat's the one who attacked me over a misunderstanding!  
He's the one who should apologize!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...Father.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
I-I'm very sorry for the trouble...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
So, as you can see...  
This skull is not about to cause harm to anyone.  
Please don't worry.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Hmph. Well, whatever!  
More importantly, where'd that girl just now go...?  
Ah! There she is!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Hey there, little lady!  
Aren't you a cutie!  
How's about we have us a romantic dinner?!  
  
**Woman：**  
Aaaghhh! What's this skull?!  
It's so creepy!  
Get it away from me!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
He doesn't cause anyone physical harm, but...  
He can be a significant nuisance.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...Father.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
What now, Shinobu?  
Don't interrupt me when I'm having a good—  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Oww! S-stop that, Shinobu!  
Stop! Stop, please! Stop, I beg you!  
Owwww! You'll kill me! You're literally killing me!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
...Hey, brat! Don't just stand there, help me out here!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Ignore him.  
**Choice: (3)**  Join in attacking.  
`Tag 2`  
**Skullfather：**  
S-seriously?! You're more monster than human!  
Not that I'm exactly one to talk...  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Skullfather：**  
Arghh! Gueghh!  
Sh-Shinobu, stop that!  
A-and you! What's the big idea, brat?!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Skullfather：**  
Why, you... You've gone too far this time!  
Take this!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
*CHOMP!*  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh... My father seems to have bitten you...  
Are you all right?  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Gahahahahah! That'll learn ya!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
My deepest apologies.  
There is a clinic not too far from here, so let's go there together.  
Ehm... May I ask your name?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
{player}, is it?  
My name is Shinobu.  
Is it hard to walk like that? Here, let me support you.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Sh-Shinobu!  
Don't you get so close to that dirty brat!  
I won't allow it!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father... I think you've said enough.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Aaargh! My daughter's a demon!
