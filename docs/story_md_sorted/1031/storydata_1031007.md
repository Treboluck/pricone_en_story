One day, {player} finds himself afflicted by a deadly curse. Shinobu attempts to give her own life to lift it, but her father intervenes and lifts it himself—because he was the one who cursed {player} in the first place.
  
## Subtitle: A Terrible Curse
  
**Narration：**  
One day, while hanging out with Shinobu,  
{player} suddenly collapses on the ground.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Ahhh!  
What's wrong, {player}?!  
Are you all right?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Ahh... There's dark miasma emanating from your body...  
This is no ordinary illness.  
I'll see what I can perceive.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Wha...?! B-but this is...!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
{player},  
it pains me to have to tell you this,  
but I'm afraid...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
You are on the verge of death.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
A terrible curse has been placed upon you.  
At this rate, you won't survive to the end of the day...  
I must lift the curse at once...  
  
**Skullfather：**  
No... This curse is an advanced bit of sorcery. The medium  
who cast it must've had some seriously impressive skills.  
Lifting it would take much longer than a single day.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
N-no way...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Hmm?  
What's up, Shinobu?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
No... It's nothing, Father.  
{player}, I know you must be in pain,  
but please hang in there a little longer.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
{player}, thank you for waiting.  
I'm ready to lift the curse now.  
  

---  
  
**Shinobu：**  
This is a ritual called the Dance of Souls.  
It has the power to lift any curse, so please don't worry.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
How do you feel, {player}?  
Is the pain beginning to lessen?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Ah, the color is returning to your face!  
The curse must be receding from your body.  
Thank goodness...  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Th-this ritual is news even to me...  
Shinobu, where the heck did you learn it?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Heheh... I've been doing some research.  
I thought it might come in useful someday,  
so I learned it just in case... I'm so glad I did.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Your dancing is beautiful.  
**Choice: (2)**  Thank you, Shinobu.  
`Tag 1`  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh, it's not! ...But... thank you for saying that.  
Compliments from you make me feel so embarrassed...  
But they make me happy, too.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Shinobu：**  
Please, think nothing of it.  
You've helped me so many times now,  
this is the least I can do.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shinobu：**  
Um... Do you remember, I wonder? A little while ago,  
I promised that next time, I'd be the one  
to protect you.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Now that I have the chance to make myself useful to you,  
it makes me a little happy.  
I always wanted to find some way to repay you.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
But really, that's awful of me.  
Finding pleasure in your suffering... I'm sorry.  
Let me continue the ritual.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Grrrrr....  
Shinobu and the brat are getting all lovey-dovey...  
I won't allow it!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
*pant*... *pant*... *pant*...  
  

---  
  
**Shinobu：**  
*pant*... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*...  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Wh-what's wrong, Shinobu?!  
Your face is pale as a ghost!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
I-I'm all right...  
I have to continue the ritual...  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Hang on... Don't tell me this Dance of Souls...  
is a ritual to transfer the brat's curse into you instead?!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Idiot daughter! Can't you see how potent this curse is?!  
It's utterly fatal! Are you going to throw your own life away  
for some worthless brat?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
No, Father...  
If my life is what it takes to save {player},  
I don't mind at all...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
After all, if it weren't for him...  
I would probably have been killed by those Shadows anyway...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
And besides, I... I think I've fallen in...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You have to stop the ritual.  
`Tag 4`  
**Shinobu：**  
Thank you for your concern. But please, let me continue.  
If I were to let you die from this curse,  
I don't think I could...  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Gahhhhh! All right, all right!  
I'll lift the damn curse for you!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father...  
 You can really do that?  
Didn't you say it was advanced sorcery  
cast by an incredible medium?  
  
**Skullfather：**  
*CHOMP!*  
  
**Skullfather：**  
There, brat! I put all my spiritual energy into that bite.  
No measly curse could survive it.  
So... feeling better?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
A-are you all right, {player}?  
...Thank goodness... The curse really has vanished!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Thank you, Father! You're amazing!  
Destroying a potent curse like that,  
cast by an incredibly powerful medium!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Yeah! Nobody could've lifted a curse of that caliber  
but a medium as incredibly powerful as me!  
Wahahahah!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
A potent curse...  
An incredibly powerful medium...  
Nobody but you...?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father...  
Might I ask who it was that cast that curse...?  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Urk!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I knew it... *Father...!*  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Aaargh! My daughter's a demon!  
  
**Narration：**  
That entire evening and long into the night,  
the Skullfather's wails echoed throughout all of Landosol.
