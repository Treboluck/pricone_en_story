**Narration：**  
The silhouettes of a boy and a woman stand by a shrine that  
leads to the Tower of Luna.  
The woman reaches out a hand toward the boy's head—  
  
**Misato：**  
You've done well walking all this way. We've really come quite far.  
You're such a good boy.  
  
**Misato：**  
That aside, what a mysterious place this is.  
Even the plants here look different to the ones in the Elven Village.  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. Who could that be in a place like this?  
  
**Io：**  
Ahhh! That tickles!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's wrong, Io?  
`Tag 1`  
**Io：**  
...Oh! {player}, perfect timing!  
A leaf got stuck inside my shirt... Could you get it out for me?  
  
**Io：**  
Ahhh! Not there!  
I think it went a little farther down.  
  
**Io：**  
Goodness, your hand is tickling me too! I can't stand it!  
Get it out already!  
  
**Misato：**  
My, my.  
What are you two doing? We're in the middle of the forest in broad  
daylight...  
  
**Io：**  
Thank goodness! I think you got it. You're a lifesaver!  
...  
By the way, what are you doing here?  
And who might this be?  
  
**Misato：**  
Pleased to meet you. I'm Misato, a nursery teacher from the Elven  
Village.  
We heard that we can find clues here about regaining his  
memory, so we came here while out on a stroll.  
  
**Io：**  
Oh, is that so?  
I didn't know this place was so special...  
  
**Io：**  
I'm Io. I teach at Lucent Academy.  
I'm {player}'s homeroom teacher.  
  
**Io：**  
I'm out here searching for a place to give my extracurricular classes.  
It's a bit embarrassing to admit, but I got kind of lost...  
  
**Io：**  
This edifice looks exceptionally old.  
It would be the perfect place for a history lesson.  
Miss Misato, would you mind if I tag along?  
  
**Io：**  
But not only for that reason.  
If it's for {player}'s sake,  
then as his teacher, I want to do as much as I can to help...  
  
**Misato：**  
The more the merrier.  
I'm sure {player} finds it heartening to have  
two teachers guiding him.  
  
**Io：**  
...? Come to think of it, Miss Misato, you're a nursery teacher, right?  
Then how did you come to be {player}'s teacher too?  
  
**Misato：**  
I'm looking after him along with the other children at the village nursery  
school.  
Since he's the eldest, he's a very good boy, and he doesn't  
cause any trouble!  
  
**Io：**  
Huh? You're going to preschool, too?  
{player}, how old are you again?  
  
**Misato：**  
Well now, instead of standing around idly chatting, let's get going.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  It's a dangerous place, so be careful.  
`Tag 3`  
**Misato：**  
{player}, you don't have anything to worry about.  
Come. Miss Io, shall we?  
  
**Io：**  
Huuuh?! Wait up, you two!
