# Until He Flies the Coop
Io and Misato realize that the return of {player}'s memory means that he will leave them. They accept that, as teachers, it is their job to send him out into the world, but they are determined to educate him to the best of their abilities until then.
  
## Subtitle: Until He Flies the Coop
  
**Io：**  
Is that true? Did you really become paralyzed by eating a poisonous  
mushroom, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Yeah, something like that.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misato：**  
That's right.  
He really took me by surprise!  
  
**Misato：**  
Yet even though his limbs were still numb from the poison,  
he tried to stand up and protect me  
when a little monster came  
to say hello.  
  
**Io：**  
He did that?  
  
**Misato：**  
Miss Io, how did you and {player} meet?  
  
**Io：**  
Well... He came to my rescue when I got tangled up in some monster  
vines in the forest.  
It's not as bad as a poisonous mushroom, but it sure was embarrassing.  
  
**Misato：**  
My, my.  
It seems you've always been kindhearted.  
What a good boy.  
  
**Io：**  
The next time we met, he was reading books far too easy for someone his age, and that's when I found out he had amnesia. So I suggested that he enroll at Lucent Academy.  
  
**Io：**  
At first, he couldn't solve even the simplest of problems,  
but in no time at all, he became so reliable.  
{player} is absolutely full of surprises.  
  
**Misato：**  
I really hope he grows up to be as kind as he is now.  
  
**Io：**  
Yes. I wish that for him as well.  
I really hope to see him flourish at Lucent Academy.  
  
**Io：**  
...Oh, that's right,  
you'll graduate from the academy one day,  
won't you, {player}?  
  
**Misato：**  
Yes, he will.  
And he'll become a wonderful adult who doesn't need us anymore.  
  
**Io：**  
But if... {player} gets his memory back today  
and doesn't need the academy anymore…  
  
**Misato：**  
No doubt it will be sad, but sending students out into the world  
is also part of our job.  
  
**Io：**  
I've only recently been assigned to my role, so I haven't sent out any  
students yet.  
But to have {player} be the first to go...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Even if I graduate, you two will always be my teachers.  
`Tag 2`  
**Io：**  
...{player}!  
You're right. Even after you graduate,  
our student-teacher bond will never change.  
  
**Io：**  
I'll educate you to the best of my ability so that when the time comes,  
I'll be able to send you out into the world without any regrets.  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh dear!  
I'd best up my teaching game so that I won't be beaten!  
  
**Io：**  
M-Miss Misato?  
Why do you need to hug him?  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh?  
I do this with all the children.  
  
**Io：**  
Hey, {player}... Could you possibly tell me...  
what the elven nursery school is like...?
