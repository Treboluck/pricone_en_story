**Io：**  
Whaaat?!  
You're telling me that I'm older than you?  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh dear, it seems that way.  
  
**Io：**  
You're much more dependable than me,  
so I totally thought you were older...  
But to hear that I'm two years your elder? I'm shocked.  
  
**Io：**  
But even though you're younger than me, there's no doubt that you're a  
proper teacher.  
I should follow your example.  
  
**Io：**  
{player}, are you feeling tired yet?  
Let's take a break over here─  
Ahhh!!  
  
**Io：**  
Owww! I tripped!  
I'm so sorry, {player}!  
  
**Misato：**  
Are you both okay?!  
Ah, Miss Io! Your knee is bleeding!  
  
**Io：**  
Oh, 'tis but a scratch.  
More importantly, are you injured, {player}?  
  
**Io：**  
Phew...  
What a relief.  
But even if it feels okay now, it might start to hurt later.  
So let me take a proper look.  
  
**Io：**  
...  
Great! It really does seem like nothing. Thank goodness.  
  
**Io：**  
Ouch!  
Now that I know you're fine, my leg suddenly...  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh dear. Miss Io,  
please stay still.  
I'll take care of it in a jiffy.  
  
**Io：**  
M-Miss Misato?  
  
**Misato：**  
{player}, since you've been examined by Miss Io,  
I trust that you're okay.  
And besides, I know you're a strong boy.  
  
**Misato：**  
Here we go, Miss Io. You'll be better in no time at all.  
Pain, pain, go away! ♪  
  
**Io：**  
Wow... That really was no time at all...  
Thank you so much!  
  
**Io：**  
I'm often carelessly tripping over my own feet like this...  
And just as I was saying that I should follow your example...  
I'm such an embarrassment.  
  
**Misato：**  
My, my.  
Even we teachers are only human.  
We're bound to experience failure sometimes.  
  
**Misato：**  
That aside, it's so nice that you see to your student's injuries before your  
own.  
I'm so moved.  
To be able to put your students first is the most  
important quality for a teacher to have.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Io is a good teacher who cares about her students.  
`Tag 1`  
**Io：**  
{player}, you feel that way too?  
  
**Io：**  
I'm still fairly new to being a teacher, so my constant fumbling makes  
me unsure of myself. But hearing these words from you two has made  
me feel a little more confident!  
  
**Io：**  
All right! I feel bad for having you stay put for my sake in a place like this.  
So let's keep moving forward!  
  
**Io：**  
Eeek!  
  
**Io：**  
Wh-whoaaa...  
  
Be careful here, the ground is really uneven.  
  
**Misato：**  
Okay!  
Heheheh. We really can count on Miss Io.  
  
**Misato：**  
Come, {player}, let's try to keep up with her!
