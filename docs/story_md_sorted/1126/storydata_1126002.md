## Subtitle: Chasing the Dream
  
**Narration：**  
Having accepted the \"New Generations\" girls' job request,  
{player} and friends are on their way to the town of Musa...  
  
**Mio：**  
...Hm?  
Hey, I think I see a girl waving to us over there.  
D'you guys know her, Korokoro?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
No, her face does not look familiar.  
Even my lord seems to agree.  
I presume this must be what is known as a hitchhiker.  
  
**Mio：**  
Oh, I see.  
 Umm... Hey there~!  
Are you looking for a ride to somewhere?  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Yes! I'm on my way to the town of Musa.  
If you happen to have any room...  
  
**Mio：**  
Oh! Is that right?!  
 Truth is, we're heading to Musa ourselves!  
If we're going the same way, why don't we let her join us?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sure—the more the merrier!  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Companionship makes the journey, or so the saying goes.  
I should expect no less from my kindhearted lord.  
  
**Mio：**  
Well then, we'll take you straight to Musa—  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
No, I can't ask you to take me that far. Just a little way will do.  
Thank you for offering.  
  
**Mio：**  
Huh, so you're going to Musa for work!  
It's a long way from Landosol, though. Isn't that pretty tough?  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
It's a job I'm interested in, so I volunteered.  
What brings all of you to Musa?  
  
**Mio：**  
Heh heh heh... The truth is...  
We're going to join an audition to become real idols! Right~?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes. Our current job is to aid Miss Mio and her friends  
in beginning their idol careers.  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Oh... You guys too, huh?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah... Did you say \"too\"?  
Are you also aiming to become an idol, by any chance?  
  
**Mio：**  
Oh, right! Then by \"job,\" you meant the audition?!  
What a crazy coincidence, running into another idol in the making! ♪  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Um, becoming an idol... *is* something I hoped to do, a long time ago.  
But I failed my big audition, and that was the end of that.  
  
**Mio：**  
Oh... I had no idea...  
Sorry for getting all excited over a misunderstanding.  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
No, don't worry about it.  
I've already made my peace with the fact that I wasn't cut out for it.  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Well, my job this time *is* still related to idols, though.  
I'll be organizing paperwork and the like for the audition.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, you are participating as a staff member?  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Yes. I may have failed to become an idol myself...  
but I'd still like to be involved with idols in some capacity.  
  
**Mio：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It is time that we gave the horses a little rest,  
so perhaps this would be a good spot for a break.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  How long until we set off again?  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Let me see... Thirty minutes should suffice.  
My lord, Miss Mio, please sit back and relax until then.  
  
**Mio：**  
Half an hour of nothing, huh? Hmm, what to do...  
Oh—I know!  
Hey, there's something I wanted to ask. Do you mind?  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
N-not at all. What is it?  
  
**Mio：**  
This might be a bit out of nowhere,  
but have you ever seen a Carmina concert?!  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Oh, of course I've seen them!  
That was what inspired me to become an idol.  
  
**Mio：**  
Ooh, I'm glad you know them! ♪  
Truth is, I wanna learn to dance like that!  
Or so I've been thinking lately, but it hasn't been going well.  
  
**Mio：**  
Like, at the chorus, I can never figure out how to keep my balance.  
I don't s'pose you've got any tips that might help me out?  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Let's see... The Carmina girls' dance is like...  
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
...So, as you can see, it features a lot of foot twists.  
If you focus on those, it might help you to keep your balance.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Wow, you looked just like Carmina!  
`Tag 3`  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Th-that's not true at all.  
My dancing is really just imitation...  
  
**Mio：**  
No, no, you really were super good!  
I could tell at a glance just how hard you've worked on Carmina's moves!  
  
**Mio：**  
...You still... want to become an idol, really... don't you?  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
...!  
  
**Mio：**  
Sorry for testing you like that!  
But ever since we started talking about idols, it's been bugging me.  
  
**Mio：**  
It felt like you've still got regrets,  
or, y'know, like you don't want to give up...  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Um, I...  
  
**Mio：**  
Maybe I shouldn't stick my nose in your business,  
but I just wanted to make sure.  
Especially as someone who's going down the same path.  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
...I don't even know anymore. How I feel, I mean.  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
I still want to be involved with idols, so I know I must have regrets.  
If I'd really lost interest, I'm sure I wouldn't care this much.  
  
**Mio：**  
...Yeah. That's what I thought.  
If you'd really put idols behind you,  
you wouldn't be on your way to Musa.  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
But when I think back to my audition, it scares me.  
If only I had as much strength as you, I could find my own answer...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  We're not all that strong.  
`Tag 4`  
**Mio：**  
Yeah. He's right.  
Even I get all nervous about failing the audition,  
and if it really happened, I bet I'd be heartbroken.  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
...And yet you're still going?  
Doesn't it scare you?  
The thought of being told you don't have what it takes?  
  
**Mio：**  
Ahaha... For all the big talk I'm talking... yeah, it's scary.  
Rejection's a tough thing, and it'd be super depressing.  
  
**Mio：**  
But even if I fail at first, it might go better next time, right?  
Or maybe the tenth time could be the charm!  
  
**Mio：**  
So right now, I want to try for as long as it takes.  
I mean, how could I give up when I love it so much?!  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Are you sure you do not want us to take you further?  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Yes, this is enough.  
You've helped me a long way already. Thank you.  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Um... Mio.  
I still haven't fully decided whether to try becoming an idol...  
but I'm going to give it some serious thought. Well then, I'll be going!  
  
**Mio：**  
Right! If you do decide to give it another go, let's both do our best!  
Bye-bye!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ehm, Miss Mio. May I ask one thing?  
I noticed you were encouraging that young lady to become an idol...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But surely that would make her another rival for you to face.  
Is that really such a good idea?  
  
**Mio：**  
Hmm... I guess you're not wrong there, Korokoro.  
But regardless of all that, my heart tells me to support her.  
  
**Mio：**  
After all, she's a fellow chaser of the same dream!  
  
**Narration：**  
And gazing in the direction that their new friend had walked off in,  
Mio gave a bright, if slightly embarrassed, smile.
