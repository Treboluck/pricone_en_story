**Narration：**  
{player} is staying at the village with \"New Generations.\"  
After the day's lessons are over...  
  
**Mio：**  
Hey—  
nice work today! You resting up?  
I was just chatting with my cheer squad over there!  
  
**Mio：**  
I'm planning to do a bit of solo practice,  
then probably get some proper rest myself.  
It's getting late, after all...  
  
**Mio：**  
...Although isn't it kind of bright?  
 Huh? Is that you shining?!  
What's the trick here?!  
 Hey, how are you... Waaaghhh!

**Mio：**  
Okay, you guys! Watch closely, and do as I do!  
First up, let's do some stretches before we dance!  
  
**Girls：**  
Yes, coach!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Call out to Mio.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mio：**  
Oh—hey there!  
 ...What am I doing?  
Right now, I'm teaching these girls what it means to be an idol!  
  
**Mio：**  
They came up to me when I was practicing my dancing.  
Asked me if I could help out with their idol games. Right?

**Girls：**  
Right!  
  
**Mio：**  
...I know! If you're not busy or anything, can you lend us a hand too?  
I bet you'd make this even more fun!  
  
**Mio：**  
Besides, we could use your...  
 uh, amateur input, would you call it?  
When the girls have questions, you can give us a different perspective!  
Okay? Go on!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Sure, I'll help out.  
`Tag 2`  
**Mio：**  
Thanks!  
Well then, you guys, this nice guy's gonna join our lessons,  
so let's work hard to become great idols! ☆

**Mio：**  
One, two, three, four! Five, six, seven, eight!  
Yep, yep! You're all doing a great job dancing!  
 ...Hm?  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Aughh... One, two, three, four...  
  
**Mio：**  
Wait, wait, wait. No need to get so tense, you know!  
What's up?  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Well, um... I keep trying really hard to do  
everything you've been teaching us...  
  
**Girl 1：**  
But when I do, I get worried about messing it up.  
Ahhh... I dunno what to do...  
  
**Mio：**  
Ohhh, I see. You get too focused on doing it right, huh?  
Hey, guys! How do you feel when you practice dancing?  
  
**Girl 2：**  
I just... kinda go all out!  
Once I get in the rhythm, I dunno what's going on!  
  
**Mio：**  
Ahaha, I get that!  
When you really get into it, it can be like that, huh?  
  
**Girl 3：**  
When I dance... I try not to work too hard.  
'Cause if I do, it tires me out.  
  
**Mio：**  
Ooh! Understanding the value of moderation at your age!  
We might have a future big shot in our midst...  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Huh?  
Coach girl, aren't you gonna tell me to work harder?  
  
**Mio：**  
Why would I do that?  
 Just dance however you like!  
There's no need to follow all my instructions perfectly.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Yeah, just do it like I do.  
`Tag 3`  
**Mio：**  
Ahaha! When you dance, it looks a little bit surreal.  
But that's the deal. What matters is that you have fun!  
  
**Girl 1：**  
I don't have to do it properly?  
But idols always do it properly!  
  
**Mio：**  
Well... that's true.  
 Even as a game, if you wanna be idols,  
it's not wrong to focus on doing a good job.  
  
**Mio：**  
But if you focus on that part too much,  
you might forget about enjoying yourself, and isn't that a shame?  
  
**Mio：**  
It's better to enjoy yourself first,  
and then try to do the best you can while doing that.  
Both you and the audience should have fun! That's the best way! ♪  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Uhhh... Then how do I start doing that?  
  
**Mio：**  
Well, let's see...  
 Okay!  
First, take everything I taught you and forget about all of it!  
  
**Mio：**  
Then, listen to the music and do your own dance!  
Just try to move however feels good!  
 Ready? Let's get dancing!  
  
**Girls：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Mio：**  
...Well then, that'll do for today's idol lesson!  
How did you like the session, girls?  
  
**Girl 2：**  
I felt like I could become an amazing idol!  
I'm gonna tell Mom and Dad all about it!  
  
**Girl 3：**  
It was actually pretty fun. I wouldn't mind forming a unit.  
With the three of us, we might be able to make it big.  
  
**Girl 1：**  
...Yeah, I'd love to try!  
The three of us, idols together!  
  
**Mio：**  
Yep, yep! That's the spirit! See if you can become real idols! ☆  
Well then, take care on your way home! Bye-bye!  
  
**Girls：**  
Bye-bye!  
  
**Mio：**  
Whew... I'm so glad they had fun!  
Thanks for agreeing to help out so suddenly.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You were an awesome teacher.  
`Tag 4`  
**Mio：**  
Ahaha.  
 Truth is, I was just copying what our producer says!  
Back when we started out, I wasn't so much different from them.  
  
**Mio：**  
If you aren't enjoying yourself, you can't pass it on to the audience.  
When I'm an idol, I want to make sure everyone's smiling together.  
  
**Mio：**  
...Well, not that I'm any big expert either!  
I've gotta work hard to get bigger and better  
while holding on to that feeling!  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
...And welcome back.  
I ended up showing you that dream, but it's all a bit mysterious.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Are these memories really yours from the other side?  
Those girls come from somewhere else,  
so I'm not sure where they stand.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But it doesn't seem like a memory born from your wishes, either.  
...  
Well, as long as you had fun, I guess that's what matters.  
  

---  
  
**Mio：**  
Huh...? Did we fall asleep right here...?  
Wait, the sun's totally gone down!  
 No time left for practice now, huh...?  
  
**Mio：**  
...You know, I had a funny dream.  
I was being, like, an idol teacher, telling these girls to  
\"have fun along with the audience\"  
 and stuff like that.  
  
**Mio：**  
It's so strange that I'd dream that now, of all times.  
Could it be a premonition, telling me what I've gotta do myself?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I think you might be right.  
`Tag 5`  
**Mio：**  
I see... Yeah, that makes sense.  
  
**Mio：**  
Well then, I'll make sure my cheer squad...  
and all the people at the audition have fun,  
so we can have the time of our lives together! You just wait! ☆  
  
**Narration：**  
So saying, Mio gave a smile that sparkled with delight,  
and {player} resolved to cheer as hard as he could for her.
