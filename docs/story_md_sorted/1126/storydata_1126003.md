# Mio (IM@S CG) Episode 3
One day during their stay at the village, Mio trains hard to make up for her failures in the guerilla concert. She struggles to figure out how to get out of her funk, but a group of visitors from Landosol show her the support she needs to recover her natural cheer and confidence.

**Narration：**  
On the way to Musa,  
{player} and friends are staying at a village  
while the \"New Generations\" girls work hard at their lessons.  
  
**Mio：**  
...Good, nobody's looking.  
 Lemme take this chance...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Why all the sneaking around?  
`Tag 1`  
**Mio：**  
Waaaaaghhhh?! Oh, it's you...!  
Don't just pop out of nowhere! You totally scared me!  
  
**Mio：**  
...Huh? You were curious why I was acting sneaky?  
U-uh, I dunno what you mean!  
I'm not doing anything weird at all, no sirree!  
  
**Mio：**  
I just... how to put it...  
 just kinda felt like taking a walk, that's all!  
So don't worry about me! Later!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, my lord. So this is where you were.  
The bath is warm and ready for you, so please—  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm going for a walk in the forest.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wait a moment. It is dangerous to go alone, my lord.  
Whatever could this be about?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Miss Mio went into the forest?  
There should be little reason to do so at this hour, so that is concerning.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Very well. In that case, allow me to accompany you.  
Come, my lord—please take my hand.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...I can still see no sign of Miss Mio.  
If we go further, we will reach the forest depths...  
  
**Mio：**  
One, two, three, four!  
Five, six, seven, eight!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This voice... It came from that way.  
Let us investigate, my lord.  
  
**Mio：**  
A—e—i—u—e—o—a—o!  
Ka—ke—ki—ku—ke—ko—ka—ko!  
  
**Mio：**  
...Good! Now, one more time from the top!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  What're you doing out here?  
`Tag 3`  
**Mio：**  
Bweaggghhhhh?!  
...Huh?  
 What're you two here for?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am sorry. We took the liberty of following you.  
My lord was concerned about you heading into the forest alone.  
  
**Mio：**  
Aw, man. You spotted that, huh?  
I thought I'd thrown you off the trail...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It seems you were continuing your lessons,  
but why do so in the forest, away from the others?  
  
**Mio：**  
Oh... Ummm,  
 well...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If you wish to practice, it is safer to do so in the village,  
so I can understand why my lord would be concerned.  
  
**Mio：**  
...I was kinda embarrassed to explain this,  
 but I guess I gotta.  
Truth is, I've been doing a bit of extra training in secret.  
  
**Mio：**  
I mean, the guerilla concert was a total mess, right?  
It made me so mad at myself,  
 I've been dying to practice harder.  
  
**Mio：**  
I want to make sure I know I can do better next time.  
But I don't wanna push Shimamu and Shiburin too hard...  
So I've been doing it out here instead.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Aren't you pushing yourself too hard?  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord is most correct.  
While your enthusiasm is admirable, it is not good to pressure yourself.  
  
**Mio：**  
Ahaha...  
 Yeah, I do understand that.  
But I didn't know how else to deal with this frustration, y'know?  
  
**Mio：**  
I thought practicing would make these feelings go away,  
but it didn't work... What am I supposed to do...?  
  
**Husband：**  
Hey! Mio~! Where've you run off to?!  
  
**Mio：**  
Huh?! What's this voice...?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It would seem that somebody is searching for you...  
My lord, Miss Mio. Let us return to the village.  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Ohhh, where could she have gotten to?  
After we came all this way...  
  
**Wife：**  
You see? I'm always saying you're too slow to act!  
  
**Husband：**  
As if you can talk! You're the one who got sidetracked!  
  
**Mio：**  
Huh...? You guys from Landosol?!  
  
**Husband：**  
Oh—there she is! Good to see you're looking lively, Mio.  
Is your idol training going smoothly?  
  
**Mio：**  
Huh? You know about that?  
And how come you're here...?  
  
**Store Owner：**  
\"How come\"? Well, why the heck else?  
We heard all about your big audition, so we came to cheer you on!  
  
**Husband：**  
The guys in the shopping district  
mentioned that you guys were off to Musa.  
As soon as we heard, we came as fast as we could.  
  
**Wife：**  
Look—we made these to cheer you on with!  
Big signs... paper fans...!  
We even thought up a few chants to use!  
  
**Mio：**  
...  
  
**Mio：**  
You guys... Why would you do all that for me?  
We don't even know if we'll pass the audition yet...  
  
**Husband：**  
Pass or fail, who cares? This is our poster girl's' big moment!  
No matter the result, we're with you all the way!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  With all this support, you'll be fine.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kokkoro：**  
I wholeheartedly agree.  
You and your friends have such fine supporters, Miss Mio.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I can appreciate that you may feel nervous.  
However, with all these people standing by you,  
does it not bring you courage?  
  
**Mio：**  
{player}... Korokoro...  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Mio!  
  
**Mio：**  
Huh...? You're that girl from before!  
You came to this village too?!  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Yes! I had a lot of thinking to do,  
so it took me a little while to get here.  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
But I've decided. I can't participate this time because I have work,  
but next time, I'm going to take another shot at becoming an idol!  
  
**Mio：**  
Really?!  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Yes. I'm done with hesitating.  
And I'll repay the courage you gave me by cheering you on!  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Oh! Then you should join our Mio support squad!  
There's plenty of signs and fans to go around!  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Are you sure?  
 I'd love to join in!  
  
**Mio：**  
You guys...  
  
**Mio：**  
...All right! I'm suddenly feeling full of motivation!  
You're not gonna believe just how amazing I can be  
with everyone's support behind me!  
  
**Mio：**  
\"New Generations\" is gonna win this audition no problem,  
so you'd better cheer hard!  
 We're counting on ya~! ☆  
  
**Wife：**  
Well well, bold words indeed!  
Then we'd better work extra hard to keep up with you!  
  
**Store Owner：**  
That's right! This cheer squad's holding nothing back!  
  
**All：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Mio：**  
...Thank you so much, you guys.  
 I'll do my best out there!  
  
**Narration：**  
Spurred on by the support of all the people she had met,  
Mio's eyes were glistening with tears of happiness.
