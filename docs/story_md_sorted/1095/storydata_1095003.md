# Kuka (Oedo) Episode 3
Kuka asks a bard for permission to dance along to his music. As she performs, she becomes more and more excited, until, deaf to {player}'s warnings, she lets her belt come loose and spins wildly in front of everyone watching.

**Narration：**  
Continuing their walk through the streets of Landosol,  
{player} and Kuka reach the outskirts of the city.  
  
**Kuka：**  
We've come so far now, there aren't nearly as many people.  
I haven't felt any intense gazes upon me  
for a while now...  
  
**Kuka：**  
I suppose this isn't much use as an advertisement,  
so shall we turn back? Mr. Sadist?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Oh, there's a little crowd of people over there.  
What are they looking at? Let's go over and see.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Looks like... a musical performance.  
I must say, that bard seems very talented...  
  
**Kuka：**  
...Huh? I should try dancing? Out here?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ahhh... Such a request can only mean one thing!  
M-Mr. Sadist, are you ordering me to...?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
...V-very well.  
I'll submit to your demands...  
  
**Kuka：**  
I'll take off my clothes!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Don't do that!  
**Choice: (2)**  Why would you even think that?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kuka：**  
That's... not what you wanted?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ahh!  
 Do you mean...  
just removing my clothes isn't enough to satisfy you?!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kuka：**  
W-well, the kind of dance you'd want to see  
would surely be a lascivious display of open sensuality...!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kuka：**  
...Huh? You meant, to advertise the kimono?  
  
**Kuka：**  
O-oh... I got the wrong idea again...  
I-I'm so sorry!  
  
**Kuka：**  
That *would* be a good way to show off the outfit, wouldn't it?  
Okay, I'll go ask the bard if he's all right with it!  
  
**Kuka：**  
U-um, excuse me, Mr. Bard!  
  
**Bard：**  
Yes? Is there something the matter?  
  
**Kuka：**  
W-well... I was wondering—assuming you wouldn't mind, of course—  
if I could do a little dancing alongside your performance...  
  
**Bard：**  
Oh, by all means.  
Let me play something to match your lovely outfit.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Th-thank you very much!  
  
**Kuka：**  
But will I be able to dance in this unfamiliar clothing?  
What if I mess up, and make a fool of myself in front of everyone?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ahhh! Mr. Sadist is staring at me and smiling!  
I knew it! He's savoring the prospect of my failure!  
  
**Kuka：**  
...No. You wouldn't do anything to hurt me like that.  
I know that's not really who you are.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Sometimes you can be fiercely assertive,  
but that's only because you're trying to make me happy, right?  
  
**Kuka：**  
You toy with me as a kind of cruel reward,  
because you know I love it...  
 Huh? That's not right?  
  
**Bard：**  
Um, is it all right if I start now?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ahhh! I-I-I-I'm so sorry! Please go ahead!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Hey, over there... Is that a dancer?  
  
**Man 2：**  
That fancy, exotic garb...  
It's rather racy, but I think it's a kimono!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ahhh... All these eyes are on me...  
So many gazes filled with passion...  
 piercing my body... *drool*  
  
**Kuka：**  
W-well then... Allow me to dance!

**Man 1：**  
Whoa... Amazing! She's so beautiful!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Dancing in a kimono... What an entrancing sight...  
  
**Kuka：**  
I'm doing it... I'm really dancing!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Even though the melody is unfamiliar,  
it's like my body knows the moves...  
  
![109500102.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/109500102.webp)  
**Kuka：**  
This feels so good!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Mr. Sadist is watching, too...  
Staring intently at every move I make...!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Even pointing frantically at me with his fingers...  
That must be a sign that he wants to touch me all over!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I feel so wild and elated! I'll just have to dance harder...  
H-huh? My kimono feels loose...?!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Behind you! Behind you!  
`Tag 4`  
**Kuka：**  
Huh? Awaahhh!  
Why is there an inconveniently-placed rod-like object right here?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
And as expected, my belt is catching on it...  
 Aaahhh....

**Kuka：**  
I-I knew this would happen!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ohhhhhhhhh myyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy! ...*drool*  
  
**Narration：**  
As she spun wildly out of control yet again,  
Kuka seemed to have developed a liking for the experience.
