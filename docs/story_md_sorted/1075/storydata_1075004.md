**Narration：**  
A little over an hour later.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Right! I'm all rested up now!  
Which means it's time for another swim! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
How about joining me, {player}?  
It'll be a blast! Pushing through the waves  
towards the horizon gives you such a rush! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha...  
That expression tells me everything.  
You still don't remember how to swim properly, do you?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I guess that's amnesia for you.  
Chances are you did know how to swim before, though.  
Especially with how much of an improvement you made today.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You were barely able to put your face under the water  
this morning, but now you can swim to an extent  
and even dive a little bit.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I bet you'll be able to match me by tomorrow,  
so I'll just take a little dip on my own and look  
forward to that. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hehe.  
It is a bit lonely not being able to swim with anything,  
considering Karyl and Kokkoro can't either...  
But oh well.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Karyl can't swim either?  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Yup. She's been trying to hide it of course,  
but it's obvious with how attached she is to her float.  
Plus, she gets really angry if I try to knock her into the water.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
She's a cat-based beastfolk, from what I can tell.  
And cats hate water, so it's only fair that she can't swim.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Though that just makes me even happier that she  
agreed to come in spite of of all that, hehe.  
I just wish we could all swim together. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I used to do that all the time back ho—  
Wait. Huh?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That was... a weird thing to say, considering I'm  
from Landosol. This is odd. It's like someone else's  
memories are popping into my head...  
Hmmm?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whoa!  
D-did you just start shining, {player}?

**Pecorine：**  
\"Hey, {player}!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"I knew it. It really was you!  
Heyas! ☆!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Hehe.  
Our lifestyles being so different makes it  
hard to meet, so I've been feeling kind of lonely!  
Mind if I ask what you're doing here?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Oh... The break on your bike stopped working,  
so you went flying into the river?  
That's why you're all soaked and depressed?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Talk about misfortune!  
Oh, you poor little thing!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"I might need to have a word with this country's deity!  
Letting someone as nice as you suffer is a big sign of neglicence!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Hehe. Does what I'm saying make any sense?  
Sorry. The translator function on my mimi still isn't that good.  
I hope it's not making me talk silly.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Oh, it's perfectly fine?  
That's a relief!  
It's never a good feeling when the language barrier  
makes communication an issue.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Oh well.  
Give me a second, will you?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Down we go...  
Phew! Nothing like a cold dip into the water on a summer's day!\"  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Wh-what're you doing?  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Hm?  
Getting your bike out of the water, of course!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"We're pretty far from your house, aren't we?  
You'll need your bike to get back!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"It doesn't look broke, at the very least...  
I guess that's the power of being made in Japan!  
Make sure you ride it back home once I pick it out, okay?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Here we go.  
Oh, nice. I should be able to lift this myself.\"  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Rush into the river.  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Well, hello there!  
It's a pleasure to employ your services!\"

**Pecorine：**  
\"Right then. Let's work together to get this out!  
It's kind of stuck at the bottom, so we'll need to pull it hard.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"On the count of three, okay?  
One, two, three! ♪\"

\"Great, this should work.  
Let's lift it up and get it out of here. ♪\"

\"Hm...?  
What's with that look, {player}?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"My undies might be on full display after getting soaked.  
It's only good manners to avert your eyes.\"  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Sorry.

\"No worries!  
I won't blame you for taking an interest,  
but times like this you need to be a gentleman!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Hm...? That isn't what you were concerned about?  
Now I'm confused!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Ohh. You're worried about my clothes getting wet  
in the first place?  
Don't worry! The water here's  
nice and clean, plus it's easy to wash and dry them!\"

**Pecorine：**  
\"You've helped me out a lot while I'm still getting  
used to this country. So I've secretly been  
looking for an opportunity to pay you back!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"And here you were today, pained by unfortunate events.  
Being able to turn that frown upside down means a lot to me!  
Though you might not have needed it in the first place.\"

\"Heave-ho!  
Phew. We finally made it back to the riverbank!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"A good day's work, if you ask me.  
Crazy good, even!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Which means it's time for a break.  
Ahaha. Look at us. We're both soaked.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Hee hee. Thanks, {player}.  
I'll be honest. I was feeling a bit down suffocated after  
dealing with politicians, interviewers and the like.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"I don't have any say in politics at all,  
but they kept bombarding me with questions...  
So I tried to find a way to get out of it.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"And that's when you passed by.  
I saw that as my lucky break.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"...  
Oops.  
I've got official business after this, so I need to head back.  
I'd rather not, but alas. Thanks for your time.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Here's to seeing each other again!  
Have a good day! ♪\"

**Ameth：**  
And there we have it. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Think of what you just saw as something of a dream.  
Chances are you'll forget about it the second you wake up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Pecorine really is the definition of a nice person, isn't she?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Not many other people can put their time and body on the line  
to help out someone else like that, you know.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's kind of like one of those princesses out of a fairy tale.  
She even mentioned politics and stuff,  
so maybe she really is one. ♪  
  
**Ameth：**  
That said, she doesn't seem all too comfortable with her position.  
So do what you can and stick by her, okay?  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's finally found a friend around the same age as her.  
Spending time with you should mean a lot to her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oops. That's enough chit-chat for today.  
Things kind of took an unexpected turn,  
so I'm a bit busy myself this time.  
  
**Ameth：**  
A certain program activated on its own once summer rolled around.  
Now all the summer-related events have started running.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Not that you'd understand, of course...  
But well. That's led to monsters spawning all over the beach.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'd rather deal with it and avoid any issues for you guys,  
but it's kind of hard with most of my privileges gone.  
Sheesh. You sure chose the worst time to come to the beach.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Things might get a bit out of hand,  
so prepare yourself for that at the very least.  
Wait. No real point in telling you that, is there?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh well.  
See you some other time, {player}.  
Try to make the most of the beach while it's still safe.  
  

---  
  
**Pecorine：**  
{player}...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh!  
You finally came to!  
I'm not sure what happened, but you were kind of out of it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It might even be sunstroke,  
so get some water in you and rest in the shade.  
As for me, I'm staying here for a bit... ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh... The rays just feel so nice. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hm...?  
What's with the look, {player}?  
Is there something on my face?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh?  
You feel like we've rested together like this before?  
What a coincidence, haha. I get the same feeling.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wait, how come you're thanking me out of the blue?  
I'm the one that should be thanking you,  
you know!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You don't need to do anything special. You don't even need to  
force yourself to swim or play with me.  
Just being able to  
spend time with you like this is special enough on its own.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If anything, this is something I've always wanted.  
And now my dream's come true.  
You can't imagine just how happy I've been lately.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So yeah.  
Allow me to thank you too, {player}. ♪
