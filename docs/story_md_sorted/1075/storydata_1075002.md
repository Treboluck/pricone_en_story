# Pecorine (Summer) Episode 2
The Gourmet Guild are enjoying their vacation at the Marjan Coast, when suddenly {player} has to catch Pecorine as she's about to collapse. Realizing she's being a bit too unattentive, she settles on taking a more relaxed approach to having fun.
  
## Subtitle: Our First Vacation
  
**Narration：**  
A few days later,  
the Gourmet Guild make their way to the location where  
the Tantalizing Tropical Tour is being held.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Come on, {player}!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Look at all the fish swimming around here!  
I got a real fright when one just went straight between my legs!  
  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No, no, not that red one!  
The yellow one over there!  
Can you see it?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's really pretty, too. You gotta see it!  
Come on, bring your face in a little closer... ♪

**Pecorine：**  
...Hah! Got you!  
Splash! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha! Sorry. You kept trying to stay away from the water,  
so I couldn't help but give you a little splash.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And hey. The second you get soaked,  
you're pretty much fine with whatever comes after that.  
Let's get wet and enjoy the beach to its fullest!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hehe.  
I guess your amnesia might be making  
you a bit afraid of the ocean...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But there's nothing to worry about!  
If anything, it feels great to soak in the water  
after bathing in the sunlight. ♪  
  

---  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And that combination make for such a pretty sigh—  
Buwargh?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wow! You actually went and splashed me  
while I was in the middle of talking!  
Not that I mind,  
considering I'm the one that started it...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But now, you must pay with your life!  
Splash, splash! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hehe.  
Sure is a lot of fun, isn't it? ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahaha. Check those two acting like kids.  
Good to see they're having fun, but they're gonna be  
exhausted by the time the sun sets at this rate.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well. The walking ball of energy known as Pecorine'll probably be  
fine.  
It's {player} that I'm worried about. Kind of  
rare to see him get this hyped up when he's usually pretty chill.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Haha. If anything, I would argue that this is him being himself.  
He and Miss Pecorine are very much cut from the same cloth.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The quiet, gentle person we knew is gradually  
regaining his true self... A reality that,  
in all honesty, did leave me feeling a little bit scared.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But when I see him enjoying himself so much like this, his  
childlike innocence on full display, that fear stops being an issue.  
Change as he may,  
he will always be my lord at his core.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Come on. You say that like you're not a kid yourself.  
You gotta stop thinking so hard and let yourself go sometimes.  
Especially now, while we're on vacation. ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That is a fair point.  
Thank you, Miss Karyl.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl! Kokkoro!  
Quit flirting and get over here! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll toss a starfish right into your face if you don't!  
Like this! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Holy!  
That thing's alive, you know! Where'd your empathy go?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Man. She's supposed to be the oldest one here,  
but she keeps whining about wanting everyone together  
and stuff like a big, dumb kid.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, yes. Sometimes I forget that she and my lord are close in age.  
Her looks are befitting of a splendid lady, after all.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Gorgeous and refined... It's almost dazzling.  
She's the very ideal of the perfect lady.  
A fact I'm much jealous of.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, she definitely *is* pretty.  
Too bad she ruins it when she opens her mouth.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hey! You're bad-mouthing me again, aren't you?  
I'd be careful if I were you.  
You're gonna make enemies like that.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I, for one, will forever love you though!  
So come! Let us embrace! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
God no.  
You're gonna crush my bones to pieces with that gorilla strength.  
Last thing I want is serious injuries while I'm on vacation.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't worry, don't worry.  
I'm a fragile maiden today.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh!  
You musn't embrace my lord like that, Miss Pecorine...  
Please don't forget you're both wearing swimsuits.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ah...  
You're right. We shouldn't be in this close contact.  
Sorry, {player}. I'll let go. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Waugh?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
O-oh no!  
Did get her feet caught in the waves...?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Catch and pull her in.  
**Choice: (2)**  Grab her hand.  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Whoa?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Th-thanks, {player}!  
You really saved me there!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Whoaaa?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Phew... That was a close one! Almost fell right over!  
Thanks for grabbing my hand, {player}! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Do you mind pulling me up, too?  
I dunno if I'll be able to get myself up like this!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Okay, thanks!  
A one, a two, a skiddly diddly doo! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wew! You're a lot stronger than you look!  
Makes sense, though, considering you're a boy. ♪  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Hehe. There's a bunch of corals around here,  
so it'd have been pretty crazy if I hurt them while falling.  
I could have cut myself on some shells or something, too.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So thanks again, {player}.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl was right.  
No one wants to get hurt while on vacation,  
so I'll be more attentive from now on.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Not only is it my first time at the beach, it's my  
first time with all of you! I definitely don't want  
any lingering regrets when I think back on it. ♪
