# Pecorine (Summer) Episode 1
{player} bumps into Pecorine after a late shift at work. They agree to go out for sushi, where they spend the time fantasizing about their upcoming Tantalizing Tropical Tour.
  
## Subtitle: In Anticipation of the Tour
  
**Narration：**  
A few days after the Gourmet Guild win  
tickets to the Tantalizing Tropical Tour.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
{player}!  
Heyas! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Talk about a coincidence!  
And hey. It's not everyday that you're not with Kokkoro.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I had to work a bit late today.  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Well then.  
Makes sense that you'd tell her to have dinner  
and sleep first if you knew you'd be late.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, you told her that you'd be eating out tonight?  
Does that mean you haven't had any dinner yet?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Perfect!  
How about joining me, then?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The place I'm working at right now is a seafood-based restaurant.  
They're kind of struggling right now, though,  
so I wanna help out a bit.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Sounds good to me.  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Wahey! Glad I asked!  
Let's get going, then!  
Do you mind if we go arm-in-arm?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ehehe. It's this way!  
Let's eat a whole bunch of good stuff!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And here we are!  
Hello! Are we still open for business?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Great, thanks!  
Table for two...  
Wait. I don't need to do that when I'm off work.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hm?  
Hey, {player}!  
Check out that thing over there!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Sure looks like a conveyor belt.  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
A... conveyor belt?  
What does that do?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You don't know either?  
Hm... Wonder why you knew about it, then.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Maybe it's a leftover fragment of your lost memories?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh. I've seen this in other stores.  
It's rotation sushi.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The plates sit on that thing and get carried around in a loop.  
Then customers can pick and choose what they want as it comes.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhh... Now I get it. The manager got this installed because the  
store's been struggling recently. Probably to bring in more  
people that would usually avoid this kind of fancy restaurant.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wow! The sushi just keeps coming!  
Let's see here. A hundred rupies per plate, huh...  
That's super cheap. I always thought of sushi as expensive food!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The sushi business will never be the same again!  
Now I'm really excited! But where do I start? ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Anything that picks your interest, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  The fish-based sushi.  
**Choice: (5)**  The meat-based sushi.  
`Tag 4`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha. That's most sushi, you know.  
This place always has a pretty  
wide variety of stuff. The shellfish and octopus are delicious.  
And let's not forget the sea urchin! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You can't go wrong, no matter what you pick!  
Ehehe. I'm really looking forward to this. ♪

`Tag 5`  
**Pecorine：**  
M-meat-based?  
Sushi's kind of a niche product around here,  
so I'm not that familiar with it myself.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Is meat-based sushi really a thing?  
Though maybe it makes sense,  
considering rice balls and stuff can have meat in them.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hehe.  
We'll be eating plenty of seafood during our vacation  
in a few days, now that I think about it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So I guess it makes sense that you'd want to  
enjoy the delicious taste of meat while you can.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I should have chose a different restaurant, huh?  
But well. You won't find me getting sick of any sort of food. ♪  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Pecorine：**  
Hee hee!  
Honestly, it all looks so good.  
I'm just gonna eat as much as I can!  
Plate one, plate two, plate three... ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hehe...  
And now we have a bunch of plates lined up.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But where to start?  
This is such a treasure trove of deliciousness that  
I'd almost feel bad for eating it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Emphasis on almost!  
I'm practically starving here,  
so it's time to dig in  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*munch, munch*  
Mmm! Gotta love that wasabi!  
It's crazy good!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Hm?  
Is something wrong? Don't hesitate to have some.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  You really do make the food seem delicious.  
`Tag 7`  
**Pecorine：**  
I mean, it *is* delicious! The second I take a bite,  
I just can't stop!  
It's one big wave of happiness!  
Wait. I'm not making a dumb face right now, am I?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ehehe.  
You should focus less on me and more on the food!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You gotta eat fish while it's fresh.  
Otherwise you're just letting a precious life go to waste!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*munch, munch* ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Mmm... Food like this really makes me glad I'm alive. ♪  
I guess that's what they mean by the circle of life?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ehehe. The tour's so soon now.  
Here's to all the delicious food we'll enjoy during it.
