**Narration：**  
After the initial trial of assembling a group,  
the BB Brigade's joint lesson is going smoothly.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ha... haha...  
To think I could face the terror of a group lesson  
in such a clear and refreshing state of mind...  
  
**Aoi：**  
This is all thanks to the BB Brigade...!  
All thanks to the encouragement you gave me, {player}!  
  
**Aoi：**  
At this rate, even the legendary  
\"Everyone find a partner to pair up with!\"  
might be within my power to face!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Uergh... No, it's still much too soon for that...  
Just saying the words makes me feel sick...!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh?  
Not only am I feeling woozy, I'm seeing a strange light...?!  
  

---  
  
**Aoi：**  
U-urghh... What now? What now...?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I came all the way here, but I don't think I can...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Something wrong?  
`Tag 1`  
**Aoi：**  
Waaaaghh?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh... It's you, {player}...!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Wh-what a coincidence.  
I wasn't expecting a BB Brigade meetup here!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ummm, I came here for this high school's open house...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  In your first year of middle school? Impressive!  
`Tag 2`  
**Aoi：**  
It's not impressive at all!  
I mean, I didn't even make it through the school gate...!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I just thought this was a good chance  
to scope out the social challenges in my future...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? You'll show me around?  
Ah! Th-that's my hand—!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I-I came all the way inside...!  
  
**Aoi：**  
S-so this is your classroom...  
Urgh...! Such overwhelming vibes of cameraderie!  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Oh...?  
Who's this girl?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Eeek?!  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Friend of yours, {player}?  
Aw, how cute! How old is she?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Yeeargh?!  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
No need to get so jumpy, kid!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Awah... Waaahhh...!  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Hey, what's with the watering can?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Th-this is... my w... w...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Watery Wartleby Wallington Wharf!  
  
**Female Students 1 & 2：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
  
**Aoi：**  
I'm sorry... I think I panicked a little...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Being pelted with greetings from friendly people...  
High school really is a scary place...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  It's OK. You've got me.  
**Choice: (4)**  I'll protect you.  
`Tag 3`  
**Aoi：**  
Oh, {player}...  
You're like my guardian angel...!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Aoi：**  
Oh, no! I couldn't leave you to handle these trials alone!  
I-I have to do my best too...!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Aoi：**  
I really can't thank you enough...  
  
**Aoi：**  
But... When I enter high school for real,  
you won't be around to help me...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Still, I'm starting to feel like it'll work out!  
  
**Aoi：**  
If I'm at the same school where the BB Brigade's captain went,  
maybe even I...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Even I... can say goodbye to my loner ways.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh, yes!  
There was a little thing bothering me,  
so do you mind if I check it out?

**Aoi：**  
I spotted this flower bed while I was running away.  
When I see flowers wilting, I just have to help them...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Eheh.  
Drink up, flowers, and grow big and strong!  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
Ah...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Wha—?!Oh! You're holding a... watering can...  
  
**Aoi：**  
I'm sorry! It wasn't my place at all  
to randomly give water to these flowers, was it?!  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
Oh no, don't apologize!  
It actually makes me happy to see someone else  
who cares about the flowers!  
  
**Aoi：**  
U-um, I...  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
Ahhh, ehm...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Th-the nerves are making me dizzy...!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  You can do it!  
`Tag 6`  
**Aoi：**  
...R-right...!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Deep breaths, deep breaths...!  
It'll be fine... {player} is watching over you...!  
  
**Aoi：**  
In... out...  
  
![110700402.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/110700402.webp)  
**Aoi：**  
U-um...!  
D-do you... like flowers...?

**Ameth：**  
Aaaand welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That was a big moment of courage for Aoi,  
so I hope you appreciated it!  
  
**Ameth：**  
At first I wasn't sure what to make of your BB Brigade,  
but it looks like it's actually become a pretty big deal for her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Maybe it really will be the support she needs  
to say bye-bye to her bashfulness.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, I'll see you later! ♪

**Aoi：**  
Mn... mnhhh...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ah! D-did I fall asleep in class?!  
Huh?! The group lesson's already over?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh, but that's terrible!  
After I managed to join a group, too!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? You were just dreaming as well, {player}?  
Ehh?! The same dream as me?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
That's the BB Brigade for you...  
Even the world of dreams can't separate us...!  
  
**Female Student 4：**  
Aoi!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Eek! S-sorry! I'm awake now!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh... You're... the girl from...  
  
**Female Student 4：**  
Listen, Aoi.  
There's something I need to give you!  
  
**Aoi：**  
S-s-something for me?!  
You mean... an Annulment of Friendship?!  
  
**Female Student 4：**  
O-of course not!  
Here, you can see for yourself!  
  
**Aoi：**  
This is... a card full of signatures...?  
  
**Female Student 4：**  
Your transfer period is ending pretty soon, right?  
So the whole class made a goodbye card for you.  
  
**Aoi：**  
A-all this... for me...?!  
  
**Female Student 5：**  
Aoi! I didn't get to talk to you much,  
but I liked having you around!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Yeaargh?!  
  
**Female Student 6：**  
I always thought you seemed like a fun person!  
We should talk properly sometime!  
  
**Aoi：**  
A-aahh...!  
Everyone in the class is gathering around...?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
So many people... all looking at me...!  
  
**Female Student 4：**  
Aoi!  
You're always welcome to come back and visit!  
  
**Aoi：**  
T...  
  
**Female Student 4：**  
Aoi...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Too... too mu...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Too munchable mulberry muchness!!!  
  
**Female Student 5：**  
Oh... my... She ran off at incredible speed.  
  
**Female Student 6：**  
Haha... Silly old Aoi.  
She really is such a shy girl.  
  
**Narration：**  
So Aoi fled the classroom as fast as her legs would carry her.  
Her path to making friends was still fraught with hardships...
