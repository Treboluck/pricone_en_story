# Aoi (Student) Episode 3
When the teacher asks the class to form groups, Aoi flees in terror, but ends up bonding with a fellow loner who did the same. Returning to class, they see a group looking for an extra member, and Aoi encourages her new acquaintance to join. Her kindness inspires the other girl to work up her own newfound courage.

**Narration：**  
As the end of Aoi's special transfer period approaches,  
she takes her seat for another day's lessons.  
  
**Teacher：**  
In today's class, you'll be working with students  
from the high school division.  
Together you will study the city structure of Landosol.  
  
**Aoi：**  
City structure...  
 I've lived my life cooped up in the forest,  
so that might be interesting...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh! That's {player} over there!  
We're sharing the same lesson even though we're in different years...  
This is such a strange feeling!  
  
**Teacher：**  
For this special lesson, you will be preparing group assignments.  
To begin with, I'd like you to divide yourselves into groups.  
  
**Aoi：**  
...  
  
**Aoi：**  
.........  
  
**Aoi：**  
...................................................................  
............................................................  
Wha.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Form... groups...?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are you OK?  
`Tag 1`  
**Aoi：**  
Ah! I'm sorry, did you come over to check on me?!  
I think I almost passed out from sheer shock!  
  
**Aoi：**  
She said  we have to form g-groups, right?  
It wasn't just my imagination, was it?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh, how terrible...!  
To think the day would come when I would hear those words!  
  
**Aoi：**  
This is no time to be looking quizzical!  
Forming groups is the most terrible trial any loner can face!  
The higher one's Loner Level, the more potent its terror!  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Hey, let's group up together!  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Oh yes, let's!  
 Hey, you should join us too!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Aaahhh... It's too late...  
Groups are forming all around us...!  
  
**Aoi：**  
B-b-but... nobody would want to group with me...  
If I asked permission to join them, I'd just make things awkward!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I-I'll have to resort to the ultimate loner technique!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  What are you doing?  
`Tag 2`  
**Aoi：**  
Reading. If I bury myself deep in these pages,  
I can avoid facing the harsh truths of reality...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Hahaha... I hear nothing... I see nothing...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  That's no good at all.  
`Tag 3`  
**Aoi：**  
Huh?!  
B-but then what can I possibly...?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? What's the BB Brigade's objective?  
  
**Aoi：**  
To say bye-bye... to this lonely, bashful existence...  
You're right, of course...  
  
**Aoi：**  
But this situation is far too high level for me to face!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Why don't we suggest drawing straws?  
`Tag 4`  
**Aoi：**  
Drawing straws!  
That might be a good plan!  
It's a surefire method to ensure nobody gets left out!  
  
**Aoi：**  
OK, we should ask right away!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Hey, guys! Let's draw straws to decide!  
`Tag 5`  
**Female Student 1：**  
Huh~? Drawing straws?  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
But then who knows who we'll end up with...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Urk...!  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
It's a bit late for that, isn't it?  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Isn't it more fun if everyone gets to be with their friends?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Uuurgh...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Waaaaaaaagghhh!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I knew it was no use...  
  
**Aoi：**  
I ran out into the corridor without thinking,  
but I guess I might as well...  
  
**Aoi：**  
...Huh?  
There's someone else out here...  
  
**Aoi：**  
I think she's in the same class as me...  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
Oh! You're... Aoi, aren't you?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Eek! She talked to me?!  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
Eek! I talked to her!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Th-this reaction...  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
Could it be... Are you...?  
  
**Aoi & Female Student 3：**  
A loner just like me?  
  
**Aoi：**  
...  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Have a little courage.  
`Tag 6`  
**Aoi：**  
Ahh!  
 Y-y-you're right!  
  
**Aoi：**  
E-excuse me...  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
Wahh! Y-yes?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Would you  
 l-like to form a group with me?!  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
...!  
I... I'd love... to...!  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
I, um, I felt so sick when I heard the word \"groups,\"  
I sort of ran out here in a blind panic...  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
But if you'd really form a group with me,  
it would make me so happy!  
  
**Aoi：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
I did it! I really did it!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I can't believe I managed to invite a member to our group!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Thank you so much, {player}!  
This is all thanks to your emotional support!  
  
**Aoi：**  
W-well then, shall we all go back to the classroom now?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Heheh... It may only be a small one,  
but I actually formed a group of my own!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I'm so happy, I'm so happy!  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Anyone still need to find a group?  
We've got a space left in ours!  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Oh, how about you? You wanna join us?  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
...!  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
N-no, um, I'm already...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Y...  
 you should join them.  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
A-Aoi?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I-I'll be fine by myself.  
I won't be at this school much longer anyway.  
  
**Aoi：**  
But you should take this chance to m-make some friends.  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
N-no way...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Congratulations... You're a loner no more!  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
...!  
I-I'm sorry...  
 Thank you!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Whew...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Aoi... Are you sure?  
**Choice: (8)**  That was very brave.  
`Tag 7`  
**Aoi：**  
To be honest, I regret it a little.  
But I... I can understand exactly how she feels, so...  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Aoi：**  
Thank you for saying that...  
I'm sorry. I threw my big chance away...  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Aoi：**  
Still, I'm totally fine. Finer than a fine thing in finery!  
  
**Aoi：**  
After all, I still have you, {player}!  
The ever-reliable captain of the BB Brigade!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Even if we're just a lonely group of two now...  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
Aoi!  
  
**Aoi：**  
You again...? What's the matter?  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
U-um, listen!  
I-I, um... I asked them if you could join the group with us as well!  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
And they... they said you could!  
So, um...  
  
**Aoi：**  
R-really...?! T-to propose something like that  
takes incredible courage for a loner...  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
Y-yeah. But I...  
 After seeing you just now,  
I thought I needed to be brave too...!  
  
**Aoi：**  
S-seeing me...?  
Oh, no, no, no! I'm just a plain old loner...  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
That's not true!  
You were the one who came and invited me first!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I-I didn't really...  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
Let's do this together, Aoi!  
  
**Aoi：**  
A-all right...!  
  
**Narration：**  
Having given the gift of courage to a fellow loner,  
Aoi joined her new group with a huge smile on her face.  
  
**Narration：**  
As {player} watched the two of them depart,  
he found himself standing all alone in the classroom.  
  
**Aoi：**  
U-um, {player}!  
  
**Aoi：**  
We asked them if you could be in our group too!  
Come with us!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I-I didn't forget about you, honest...
