## Subtitle: High Society
  
**Narration：**  
Not long after her transfer to St. Theresa's Academy,  
Aoi seeks out {player}.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Have you ever heard of the notion of \"school castes\"?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Looks like you haven't.  
Well then, allow me to explain!  
  
**Aoi：**  
School castes are a form of social hierarchy.  
A class-based society that is said to exist  
in each and every school!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Even St. Theresa's Academy is said to have an unspoken system  
where those of low status can't even speak to upper-class students!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Meanwhile those in the upper class are idolized and envied by all  
as paragons of elite culture!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  So you want to join this upper class?  
`Tag 1`  
**Aoi：**  
O-oh, of course not!  
There's no place in high society for a miserable worm like me!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I just thought, for people in that elite class,  
it must be so much easier to make friends...  
  
**Aoi：**  
I haven't made a single f-friend since I arrived here...  
So I couldn't help thinking about it, that's all.  
  
**Aoi：**  
But life in the upper classes  
is a dream far beyond my reach...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Lunch break is finally here!  
Today, I thought I'd buy my lunch from the school shop!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I've observed it from afar before,  
but I still haven't actually bought anything...  
  
**Aoi：**  
What's that?! You'll come along with me?!  
 H-how wonderful!  
Taunts of \"What a loser, visiting the school shop alone!\"  
won't plague me after all!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Let's see, the shop should be right down...  
 Wait.  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Hello?! Did you just push me?!  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
You're the one who was getting in my way.  
  
**Aoi：**  
What's this huge crowd of people...?!  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
Oh... Are you the new transfer student?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Eek! Someone talked to me?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Stay calm and answer her!  
`Tag 2`  
**Aoi：**  
U-u-u-understood!  
Th-that's right! I am the loner who just transferred here!  
  
**Aoi：**  
D-did that sound kind of strange at all?!  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
Haha. You're rather unique, aren't you?  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
These people are all hoping to buy today's Limited Sandwich.  
  
**Aoi：**  
I-is this sandwich really all that delicious...?!  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
Well, yes...  
The Limited Sandwich is a bit of a legend among the students here.  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
Eating it is a rare and coveted privilege.  
Some people even say that to obtain it is the mark of a true lady.  
  
**Aoi：**  
A true lady...!  
Did you hear that?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Could this mean that if I obtained it for myself,  
I'd be accepted into the esteemed ranks of high society?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
With that status, I'd surely be able to make friends!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Let's get that sandwich!  
`Tag 3`  
**Aoi：**  
A mission for the BB Brigade!  
Well then, let's make our move!  
  
**Aoi：**  
...Still, this really is a huge crowd.  
Do I have to weave my way through this whole sea of people?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? I feel alive with power...!  
Could this be... your ability, {player}...?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Thank you so much!  
I won't fail you!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I feel so light!  
With this strength, if I use a little force...!  
Yes, yes, yes! I'm making progress!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Great, I'm almost halfway there!  
If I carry on like this, friendship will be mine...!  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Are you sure about that?  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Hahah. Not so fast!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Hyeaagh?!  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
I won't let you take that sandwich!  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
The Limited Sandwich will be mine!  
  
**Aoi：**  
A-a wall of bodies is blocking my way?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
O-oh no, what now...? This is too much for me...!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I knew it was impossible... Someone like me  
could never reach the Limited Sandwich... or the upper class...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Let alone make friends...!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You mustn't give up!  
`Tag 4`  
**Aoi：**  
Huh?! {player}?!  
Did you come all this way by yourself?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Are you here to protect me...?  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Wh-wha? A boy?!  
Why is there a boy here?!  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
So this is a gentleman...!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Incredible!  
The wall of bodies is parting before our eyes...!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Now go!  
`Tag 5`  
**Aoi：**  
Ahh! Very well!  
I won't let this chance you created go to waste!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Excuse me!  
I'd like one Limited Sandwich!  
  
**Female Student 3：**  
Haha.  
That girl's got some guts...  
  
**Lunch Lady：**  
Here—a Limited Sandwich.  
Congratulations, this is the very last one.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Wahoo! I really did it!  
Now I too will be—  
  
**Lunch Lady：**  
That'll be 3000 rupies.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Eh?  
Whaaaaaaaaaaaa?!  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Is that girl staring at her purse and crying...?  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
D-did getting the sandwich make her *that* happy?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Urghhh... 3000 rupies...  
The upper class is a scary place!  
  
**Aoi：**  
And worse, instead of admiring gazes,  
I feel like everyone was looking at me weirdly...  
  
**Aoi：**  
That used up almost all the food money I had...  
What am I going to eat from now on...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
I knew this was...  
 No, I mustn't give up!  
You just taught me that, didn't you, {player}?  
  
**Aoi：**  
I know!  
Here, you should have half of our spoils!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Don't be shy, now.  
This victory belongs to the whole BB Brigade!  
  
**Aoi：**  
This isn't the mark of a lady,  
it's the mark of our pride as a team!

**Aoi：**  
Now, let's both dig in!  
*chomp*  
  
**Aoi：**  
Th-this flavor...!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Wow, it's really good.  
**Choice: (7)**  Tastes like high society.  
`Tag 6`  
**Aoi：**  
Yes!  
I've never tasted anything like it in my life!  
  
Jump to tag 8  
`Tag 7`  
**Aoi：**  
Even if it's only for a moment, this special experience...  
It's worth all the trouble we went to!  
  
`Tag 8`  
**Aoi：**  
The flavor is certainly wonderful,  
but I think there's something more important than that.  
  
**Aoi：**  
I feel like eating it here, together with you,  
makes it much more delicious than it would usually be.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Which means if I made lots of friends,  
it would taste even better than this, right?!  
  
**Narration：**  
The flavor of the exclusive sandwich they shared that day  
was more than worth the hefty sum it had cost them.
