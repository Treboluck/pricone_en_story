**Narration：**  
After making sure that all her animals are fine,  
Mahiru returns to the guildhouse with {player}.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hoo-wee, it's been one heck of a day, huh?  
Sorry for draggin' ya all over the place with me.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It was fun.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mahiru：**  
You really gotta be someone special to be talkin' like that.  
Still, you must be tired. Get a good night's rest.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I can't stay awake any longer.  
I'm gonna stay here and sleep until mornin'...  
Ain't it strangely light in here? I can't sleep like this.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wh-why the heck's the lamp so bright?  
It's gettin' even brighter... Uh, eeek! It's hurtin' my eyes!

**Mahiru：**  
Hey, cousin! Imagine meetin' you here.  
What're ya up to today?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I heard there was a Hokkaido Product Fair at this here mall today,  
and I couldn't stop myself from checkin' it out.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Huh? New material? O-of course I'm writin' new material.  
I ain't got much time 'til my consolation match.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I dunno if it's 'cause I'm away from Hokkaido,  
but I ain't had too much inspiration...  
But then I heard 'bout this product fair!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
If I feel the breath of Hokkaido in this concrete jungle,  
I'm certain I'll be able to escape this feelin' of hopelessness!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Whaddya say we go there together?!  
Today, let's eat, drink, an' be merry! If we both absorb lots of  
Hokkaido power, I'll be able to write the best jokes ever!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wooow, what a fine selection. Even the most basic stuff from back  
home sparkles like diamonds  
when it's on display in a place like this!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
What'll ya have, cousin? Everythin' from the candy to the  
seafood's a real treat! Oh, there's an eat-in area over there!  
My heart jus' won't stop racin'!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I wonder if I have enough cash...  
`Tag 2`  
**Mahiru：**  
Don't worry yourself, 'cause I got ya covered!  
Ah, well, so long as ya lay off the crab and melon...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Huh? Cousin, lemme step away for a sec.  
  
**Woman：**  
Hmmm, what I'd expect from a fair.  
Everything looks so delicious. It's hard to choose.  
  
**Man：**  
Yeah. Even the candy alone has a wide selection.  
Ah, the curry soup looks pretty tasty too. Argh, I can't decide!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Pardon me. If ya like, I can give ya some top-tier advice.  
  
**Woman：**  
Uh, who are you?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Why, I'm jus' a regular ol' Hokkaido gal.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
First, if ya ain't sure 'bout candy, this one here's the best choice.  
It's a classic Hokkaido souvenir that'll get anyone jumpin' for joy.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
An' then, if you're lookin' for sweet potato snacks, this here's the one!  
The firm sweet potato texture is addictive.  
Ya don't usually find this  
stuff outside of Hokkaido, so now's the chance to buy it!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ah, as for soup curry, this is definitely the best.  
It tastes jus' like the stuff from the original restaurant,  
so it's an authentic experience!  
  
**Woman：**  
Heheh, you really know your stuff.  
Thank you. We'll definitely buy your recommendations.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Eheheh, thank ya kindly!  
  
**Man：**  
By the way, the milk here's way more expensive than the supermarket.  
Is there any difference?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
It's 'cause of the length of the pasteurization process.  
Most supermarket milk is boiled quickly, but in contrast,  
this here milk's heated slowly at a low temperature.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
The price goes up 'cause of the time an' effort required,  
but it doesn't lose its fresh, creamy, just-squeezed flavor.  
But the downside is it spoils faster, so bear that in mind.  
  
**Man：**  
Oh, so that's why. Thanks.  
What a great chance to drink some fresh, tasty milk.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You're more'n welcome.  
I'll be real happy if ya take a shinin' to Hokkaido thanks to my advice.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
My, that was fun. We bought a bunch of local specialties, filled our  
bellies with delicious food, an' I got the chance to upsell Hokkaido  
to some city folks. I'm real happy right now...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Come up with any jokes?  
`Tag 3`  
**Mahiru：**  
Urk... A-ain't got nothin' yet.  
But it does have me feelin' refreshed.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Now that I  
got that outta my system, I oughtta prepare myself to  
  
take things as they come!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
By the way, can we stop by that store too?  
Since I've come all this way, I wanna peruse some normal stores too.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wow! Take a gander at that! Over there on that shelf!  
That cool li'l bell would look real cute on Elizabeth!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm gonna buy it. Yo, ho,  
nghhh... I-I can't quite reach...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Should I get it for you?  
**Choice: (5)**  Wanna hop on my shoulders?  
`Tag 4`  
**Mahiru：**  
No need at all. I can manage. Haaa!  
Just a li'l moooore!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Mahiru：**  
No, however ya look at it, it's way too embarrassin' to do that here.  
Ya treat me like a child a li'l too much.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Mahiru：**  
Lemme show ya the power of these legs,  
forged in the wilderness of the Hokkaido tundra!  
Hyaaaah!

**Mahiru：**  
Got it, finally...  
Wah! M-my bag strap's caught on the shelf!

**Mahiru：**  
Oh gosh, m-my belly button's in full view!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I'll get you down!  
`Tag 7`  
**Mahiru：**  
Eek! Wh-where the heck are ya puttin' your hand?!  
Lift me up from below! Ahhh!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh no!  
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to kick ya...  
  
**Woman：**  
Oh, you're the girl from earlier...  
  
**Man：**  
Huh? What's this? What happened here?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, you're the couple from Hokkaido fair!  
I'm afraid I have to ask y'all to lend me a hand.  
  
**Woman：**  
O-of course! Right away.  
Oh my, it's really knotted tightly...  
  
**Man：**  
This is quite a mess, huh?  
Let's see, if the knot's here, then doing this should loosen it.  
  
**Woman：**  
Here, hold on to me. I'll get you free in a minute.  
Young man, be ready to catch her, okay?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I-I'm countin' on ya, cousin!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Catch Mahiru.  
`Tag 8`

**Mahiru：**  
Whoa! *sigh* I-I'm saved...  
That was awful.  
  
**Man：**  
Whew, thank goodness. You're not hurt, are you?  
  
**Woman：**  
Hm?  
My, my, you look cute together, you two. ♪  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Huh? Ah, this is a bridal carry...?  
Uhhh, h-how embarrassin'...  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, hello there.  
So? It was a pretty fun dream, right?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Mahiru has been through a lot lately,  
yet she's still so determined.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So I wanted her to at least enjoy a dream.  
I really do hope it was a nice break for her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But she's overcome many great difficulties, and strengthened the bonds  
with her friends, so she'll be fine.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's why you have to do your best to help her, okay?  
Good luck with that, pardner. ♪

**Mahiru：**  
...Mm. *yawn*...  
Huh? It's already mornin'? I guess I was more tired'n I thought.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Nghhh. But thanks to that, my fatigue's all gone,  
I had a real nice dream,  
an' I'm feelin' refreshed.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Huh? Ya had the same dream?  
Ugh, i-it was real embarrassin' though. I caused a whole heap of trouble.  
I jus' wanna crawl in a hole an' die...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But thanks to that, now I understand.  
I can't do anythin' on my own, right?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
There ain't no point in me try'na be all master-like.  
I jus' gotta do the things I can do,  
and accept help from others for the  
things I can't!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
We all help each other out.  
That's how it's done at Elizabeth Park!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, that sound...  
Looks like everyone's come home.  
Let's go say hi!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hey, y'all, welcome home!  
  
**Narration：**  
Mahiru welcomed everyone with a smile  
just a little bit bigger and brighter than before.
