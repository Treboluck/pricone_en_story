## Subtitle: Leading the Lost
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is walking down the highway on his way home from a delivery.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Howdy!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I said \"howdy\"! Hey, cousin!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I knew it was you!  
Hold on a minute, would ya?!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Are ya on your way to Landosol too?  
Perfect! Let's walk there together!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Everyone's out today, so I'm takin' a break from farm work.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Shioshio's stayin' over at her sister's place in the Elven Forest.  
Limalima took some gifts to Sarendia an' is spendin' the night.  
An' Rinrin's on vacation, so she's at her folks' place.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
So I was thinkin' of attendin' a beginner's combat training course  
that the Guild Association's currently holdin' in Landsol.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Lately, there's been a lot of trouble around the ranch. I'm always findin'  
monster footprints,  
so I'm frightened my animals are gonna be attacked.  
  
So I gotta get stronger so I can protect Elizabeth Park!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...Well, to tell the truth, I don't wanna fight.  
Instead of battle smarts, I'd much rather have comedic sense an'  
knowledge of dairy farmin'.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Nevertheless, I'm a guildmaster after all.  
It's my duty to protect everyone's safety.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
If push comes to shove, I need to be the guild's sword an' shield,  
so it's important that I'm prepared.  
Better safe than silly, right?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That explains your getup.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mahiru：**  
Darn it, my wordplay went right over your head.  
Was it a li'l too subtle for ya?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
And you're just now mentionin' that?  
You had the perfect topic for small talk handed right to ya.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It looks really cool.  
**Choice: (3)**  Isn't it a bit big?  
`Tag 2`  
**Mahiru：**  
Heheh, thank ya kindly.  
It's curious how it makes me look a whole  
lot stronger, huh? I can understand why comedians an' actors are  
so particular 'bout their costumes.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Mahiru：**  
Uh-huh, I was hopin' that would slip past ya too.  
It leaves a real hollow feelin' deep inside my chest...  
Yeah... almost as hollow as my chest leaves this outfit!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
*sigh* That was a pretty good one, but somehow I jus' feel empty...  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Mahiru：**  
Anyway, let's cut that short and head into town.  
I'm gonna go straight to trainin'. How 'bout you, cousin?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'll go with you.  
`Tag 5`  
**Mahiru：**  
Y-ya really will?!  
I know I talked big,  
but to be honest, I was feelin' a li'l lonesome.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But with you there with me, I couldn't be more reassured!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I'm gonna get strong so I can protect you.  
`Tag 6`  
**Mahiru：**  
Wh-what're ya sayin'?  
Th-that kinda talk's reserved for people ya really care 'bout...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
No, he probably means he wants to protect me from direct attacks.  
I doubt there's any romantic meanin' behind it.  
Well, even that's got me feelin' real happy.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
All right, let's get goin'—  
ngh!  
I-it's dangerous to suddenly yank a person's collar like that!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Something's headed right for us.  
`Tag 7`  
**Mahiru：**  
Huh? Oh yeah.  
  
Something's comin' straight at us *before* I go learn how to be strong.  
The timing's downright awful.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But for a monster, it sure is movin' slow.  
Ah! Hold on, that ain't no monster—it's a cow!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Such a powerful build, an' what a beautiful coat.  
This cow wasn't raised in the wild.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I guess it escaped from its farm. Or maybe it strayed from the herd  
while it was out grazin'.  
Poor thing...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...Cousin, sorry to ask this of ya, but could ya forget 'bout the whole  
trainin' thing?  
I jus' can't leave this li'l darlin' here. I gotta find the owner.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  I'll help you.  
`Tag 8`  
**Mahiru：**  
Goodness...  
Anytime I need ya, you're always there by my side, ain't ya.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
That's great for you too. With him helpin' us, you'll definitely  
get home to your master!  
  
**Cow：**  
Moo.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Good, she's happy.  
All right, first things first—let's take her to Landosol.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I have a merchant friend therewho might have some info. Plus, the  
town's full of people who might know somethin' that can help us.

**Mahiru：**  
Excuse me, has anyone misplaced a cow?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Any clues 'bout her owner would be appreciated..  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...*sigh* No luck. Can't find out nothin'.  
Hey, cousin! Didja get any leads?  
...Ahhh, your face says it all.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ain't no point gettin' down 'bout it. Let's try somewhere else.  
And if we still come up dry, I'll take her back to the ranch.  
  
**Cow：**  
Moo.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Huh?  
Heheh. Don't ya worry yourself.  
I promise we'll get ya back to your owner eventually.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Why're you so desperate?  
`Tag 9`  
**Mahiru：**  
Ain't it obvious?  
If one of my herd got lost, I'd be beside myself!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Take a good look. See this calm, gentle face?  
No doubt 'bout it,  
her owner takes real good care of her.  
I bet they're havin' a real  
hard time right now.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I understand the feelin' well...  
I'd never wish it upon my worst enemy!

**Boy：**  
Ah! It's the cow lady!  
  
**Housewife：**  
Oh, Mahiru? Today isn't a market day. What's up?  
You look different. And what's with the cow...?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, a regular. Ya see...  
  
**Housewife：**  
So that's what happened. I know, I'll ask the other housewives.  
Don't underestimate our information network.  
  
**Boy：**  
I'll ask my friends too!  
  
**Merchant：**  
Hey, cow girl. I heard you're looking for the owner of that cow.  
I'll try asking a dairy wholesaler I know for clues.  
  
**Adventurer：**  
Have you checked the guild noticeboard?  
Maybe someone posted a cow retrieval request. I'll go take a look.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wh-why's... everyone...?  
  
**Housewife：**  
Because all the townsfolk know that you're trying really hard.  
We help each other in times of need.  
  
**Merchant：**  
We always look forward to you visiting town.  
But I reckon you could put a little more effort into your stand-up.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Everyone...  
I'm truly grateful!  
Then I humbly request all y'all's help!  
  
**Dairy Farmer：**  
Ah, Schneider!  
I'm sorry you had to go through that...  
But I'm glad you got back to me safe.  
  
**Cow：**  
Moo.  
  
**Dairy Farmer：**  
Thank you. I don't know how to repay you...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Jus' be thankful to the townsfolk for their help.  
More importantly, keep a closer eye on your herd, ya hear?  
  
**Dairy Farmer：**  
Yes! Thank you so, so much!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...There they go.  
Both the cow an' the owner looked real happy, huh?  
What a relief...  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Pat Mahiru on the head.  
`Tag 10`  
**Mahiru：**  
Wh-what're ya doin' all of a sudden?  
Despite the way I look, I'm older'n ya! Have ya forgotten that?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Well, I don't have the dignity of an adult  
when you're makin' a fuss over me.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...Heh, thanks. I'm totally fine.  
Elizabeth'll surely come home. I believe that with all my bein'.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...Ah, the trainin' course. We can still make it!  
Let's get a move on, cousin!  
  
**Narration：**  
With a heart warmed by the kindness of others,  
Mahiru took a step forward with a clear mind.
