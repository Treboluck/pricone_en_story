**Narration：**  
Tamaki and {player} have arrived on the Marjan Coast  
to join the celebrations for the start of beach season.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Look at this purr-fect weather!  
Let's get started with the preparations!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  First, let's do some stretches.  
**Choice: (2)**  Need any help putting on sunscreen?  
`Tag 1`  
**Tamaki：**  
You knyow it! Gotta get warmed up when you come to the beach!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Tamaki：**  
Sure, I'll let you stroke my back...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tamaki：**  
...Wait, nyo! We didn't come here to play around!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It's nyot the beach season without delicious snyacks for sale!  
I'm here to set up my taiyaki stand by the sea!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'll get the beachgoers purring with my tasty treats,  
and make a purr-fect profit while I'm at it!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
If I sell enough, I'll treat you to some nyice fat taiyaki  
too, {player}!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
So lend me a paw while I set things up, okay?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hmm? The director of the event is saying something.  
It's nyot time for things to kick off yet... Is something up?  
  
**Director：**  
Hold the preparations for the beach event!  
Something terrible has happened!  
  
**Director：**  
The net for our beach volleyball tournament  
has been missing since this morning!  
  
**Director：**  
There were signs of disturbance around where it was stored,  
so it seems it must have been stolen!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myehhh?! Who would steal a thing like that...?  
  
**Director：**  
In past years, this tournament has been enormously popular.  
It was set to be the very centerpiece of our celebrations!  
  
**Director：**  
At this rate, we may have to cancel the whole event...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Th-that's nyot good at all!  
I've invested a lot of time and money in this venture!  
  
**Director：**  
Precisely! For the sake of everyone who was looking forward  
to the event, I beg of you all, help me to recover our lost volleyball net!  
  
**Director：**  
To whomsoever recovers the net before the start of the event,  
I promise a handsome reward!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
A-a reward?!  
 This sounds like a profit opportunity!  
Let's you and me together sniff out the culprit and get that net!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
First of all, let's ask around here for information!  
C'mon, there's gotta be useful intel to be found!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Of everything we found, I think the likeliest lead we heard about  
is that local gang of hoodlums.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I bet they're a bunch of knyuckleheads who stole the net on a dare  
to prove their machismo or something!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Eh? The hell'd you just say, girlie?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ahh... What an aggressive-looking guy...  
Is this one of the hoodlums we heard about?  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Who you callin' a hoodlum?! Eh?!  
An outsider like you, actin' like such a big shot!  
I'll kick your ass out of our town!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Hey! What're you starin' at, scrawny dude?!  
I'm talkin' to the girlie! Move it!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ah! Are you OK?!  
Hey, hoodlum! What did this guy do to deserve that?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh, you've done it now! I'm gonna string you up good,  
then find out what you knyow about the net!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myah! Myamyah!  
Get too cocky and you'll feel my claws!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Th-this girl... She's tough!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
You're nyot getting away!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Guehh...! I-I'm sorry, all right?! You win this round!  
So please, quit tryin' to twist my arm off!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Before I do, answer me something.  
This morning, did you steal the beach volleyball net?  
  
**Ruffian：**  
I-I ain't been stealin' no net!  
I bet that's the work of the monster  
that's been showing up near the coast lately!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
After all, I saw it crawling around the coast  
on the morning when the net went missing!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Really...? Is that the truth? You're nyot making it up?  
  
**Ruffian：**  
I swear I wouldn't lie to you! So please, lemme go already!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'm nyot sure whether to trust this guy...  
But I guess it's worth a try.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
If there really was a monster...  
the question is where it's gone nyow.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
My instincts tell me with all these crowds gathering,  
it'd probably try to hide itself during the day.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh—what about the tall grass nyear here?  
A monster could hide pretty well there!  
Let's go take a peek!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myurghh... There's so much tall grass, just searching  
through it's an ordeal...  
 Oh, {player}!  
Look over there—is that the volleyball net we're after?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
What's it doing out in a place like this...?  
It's so scrunched up, it'll be a pain to untangle.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh! Do you think the monster  
rolled up the net to use it as a nest...?  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAAGGHHHHH!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myaaahhh?! Looks like the nest's owner just got home!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
But this net isn't for building nests, you knyow! We're taking it back!  
Myah! Myamyah!  
  
**Monster：**  
GREEOOOUGHHHH!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Whew... Good thing it wasn't a strong monster.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ahhh! What time is it nyow?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It's almost time for the event to start!  
We've gotta untangle this net, and get it back to its owner!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
Th-they've started the opening ceremony! Hold on a minute!  
  
**Director：**  
Hmm?  
 Could that be the stolen net you're holding?!  
You really tracked it down for us!  
  
**Woman：**  
All right! Now we can hold the tournament!  
  
**Man：**  
Thank goodness... The beach season celebrations are saved!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myahh... All this applause makes my fur stand on end! ♪  
  
**Tamaki：**  
{player}, thanks for helping me search!  
  
**Narration：**  
Basking in the applause, Tamaki and {player}  
turned to one another and laughed.
