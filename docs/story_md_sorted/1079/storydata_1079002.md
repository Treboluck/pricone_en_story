As the celebrations get underway on the Marjan Coast,  
{player} is wandering lazily along the beach.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hey! {player}!  
Talk about purr-fect timing!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hey—why are you running?!  
 Hold on a minute!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hahh! I caught ya!  
If I let go, you'll probably run off again, so let's talk like this!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
We're going hunting for a cat-shaped shell!  
  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Shells aren't shaped like cats, silly.

The stand can wait—I need that shell!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tamaki：**  
One of the customers who bought my taiyaki  
had a seashell accessory that looked just like a cat!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
And what's more, that shell's said to bring happiness!  
The perfect shape, and lucky too?!  
Isn't that just the cat's pajamas?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ohhh no, I'm not letting you get away.  
I've got you firmly in my paws!  
You're coming with me to find that shell!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It's my policy to surround myself with all my favorite things!  
And I can't miss out on a shell like this!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyow, let's get down to the beach and hunt!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Come out, come out, kitty cat shell!  
I'm gonna give you a loving home! ♪  
  
**Tamaki：**  
C'mon, you've gotta search too, {player}!  
My nine lives' happiness is on the line here!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Pretty little kitty shell...  
Shall I make a pendant of you? Or a nyice brooch?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
With that lucky shell, my taiyaki stand  
will be flooded with hungry customers,  
and I'll be a rich kitty in nyo time!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh, and don't worry, I'll reward you too!  
How about a special discount on my world-famous taiyaki?  
  
**Girl：**  
Oh! It's the taiyaki lady!  
 What're you doing?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oho, if it isn't one of my best little customers!  
We're on the hunt for a cat-shaped seashell!  
  
**Girl：**  
Huh? A kitty seashell?!  
  
That sounds like fun! I wanna help too!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh, really?! What a nyice little girl!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Searching's always easier with friends to help!  
  
**Girl：**  
OK then! I'll go look over that way!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Good luck!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hmmmm, there's nyo sign of the shell anywhere...  
  
**Girl：**  
I don't think I've ever seen a kitty seashell before...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
All we've uncovered so far are little pink shells and spiky sea snails,  
squidgy sea urchins, and a pearl oyster...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Some of them are pretty or valuable,  
but nyot one of them's what I'm looking for!  
  
**Girl：**  
Huh? Doesn't that shell over there on those rocks  
look sort of like a kitty cat?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Huh?! Where?!  
  
**Girl：**  
I'll go and get it for you!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Watch where you step, nyow!  
  
**Girl：**  
Uh-huh! These rocks are a bit wobbly, but I'm OK!  
  
**Girl：**  
Got it!  
 It really does look like a kitty, too!  
  
**???：**  
CRAAAAAB...  
  
**Girl：**  
Huh?!  
 Wh-what was that nois—  
  
**Girl：**  
Aaaaaghhhh! What is this thing?! I thought it was just a rock!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
That's no rock... It must be a cleverly camouflaged Spike Crab!  
  
**Spike Crab：**  
CRAAAAAB...  
  
**Girl：**  
Aahhh...! There are so many of them!  
  
**Girl：**  
Ah... Where did the shell go?!  
Oh no, oh no, did I drop it?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Forget the shell! Leave this to me and get out of there!  
  
**Spike Crab：**  
*blurble blurble*

**Tamaki：**  
Myaaaahhh?! What nyow?!  
 They sprayed something at me!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
A-are these bubbles?! Myamyaahh! Get them oooooff!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'm all wet! I can't stand water! It's all wet and slippery!  
  
**Spike Crab：**  
CRAAAAAB!  
  
**Girl：**  
No way! She's gone into a frenzy,  
and she's sending monsters flying everywhere!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Get off meeee! Stay baaack! Don't get me weeeeet!

**Tamaki：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
S-somehow all the monsters are out for the count...  
  
**Girl：**  
Taiyaki lady! Are you OK?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'm all right...  
  
And look, the shell you found is safe too!  
  
**Girl：**  
Wow, awesome! You found the shell after I dropped it!  
I guess you got your prize, taiyaki lady!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Yes...  
 But I think this belongs to you.  
  
**Girl：**  
Huh?  
 But... you really wanted this shell, didn't you?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Don't worry about it. You're the one who spotted it first.  
Hold onto this shell and you'll be blessed with happiness.  
  
**Girl：**  
Th-thank you... It's a really cute shell, too!  
I'm gonna go show it to my mommy!  
Bye-bye, nice taiyaki lady!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Bye-bye! Drop by my stand again sometime!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Are you sure you don't regret that?  
**Choice: (5)**  Are you... crying?  
`Tag 4`  
**Tamaki：**  
Sh-shut up! I can always find anyother shell!

`Tag 5`  
**Tamaki：**  
I-I'm nyot crying at all!  
I just... got some of those bubbles in my eyes!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Tamaki：**  
That girl just had a nyasty scare, so she's earned it.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Besides, when she eats my taiyaki with a smile,  
that makes me happiest of all!  
  
**Narration：**  
Though she'd given away the precious shell she was looking for,  
Tamaki looked surprisingly satisfied in the end.
