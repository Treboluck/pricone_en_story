## Subtitle: Beachside Business
  
**Narration：**  
At the end of their treasure hunt, {player} and Tamaki  
are resting on the beach, laughing and gazing at the stars.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It's like the whole sky is raining down!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I can't believe there was such a purr-fect view  
waiting at the end of that nyasty cave...  
  
**Security Guard：**  
Hey... You two over there.  
It's dangerous to wander around these parts at night!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Huh...? Oh, is this old guy on patrol?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
After all that time in the dark, the lantern's blinding my eyes...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
In fact... The lantern light's getting brighter and brighter...?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I can't keep my eyes open!

**Tamaki：**  
{player}!  
Thanks for coming to help me out with the beach cafe!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'm only here myself 'cause a friend asked me to help out.  
But I heard there's a special bonus for the cafes that make  
the most profits!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
So I figured if you help me out,  
we might be able to aim for the number one spot!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyow! Let's sell and sell and sell some more!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh, but... I think this cafe's menu is too ordinary right nyow.  
We need to come up with some new items.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
You know what that means!  
Let's add my specialty, taiyaki, to the lineup!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
We're all ready!  
 Let's open up shop!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Something's wrong. Nobody's buying the taiyaki I made.  
Don't they appreciate my golden ratio of outer cake and  
sweet bean filling?!  
  
**Woman：**  
Look, this cafe's selling taiyaki!  
Talk about out-of-season!  
Who wants to eat taiyaki at the beach?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nghhh... I don't want to accept it, but... It's true...  
Steaming hot taiyaki isn't a great match for the summer heat...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
But there's no point selling the same stuff as everyone else!  
Isn't there anything we can use to make our cafe stand out?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's make an original dessert.  
**Choice: (2)**  Why limit ourselves to existing recipes?  
`Tag 1`  
**Tamaki：**  
Ohhh!  
 That does sound like fun!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Tamaki：**  
Y-you're right!  
There's nyo rule against thinking outside the box a little!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tamaki：**  
All righty then! Let's come up with a tasty snack  
that'll take this beach by storm!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Personally, I'd like to make something with a nyice catty theme...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
And if possible, I don't want to give up on the taiyaki!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
But... Steaming hot taiyaki on a hot summer's day  
just sounds like some kind of punishment...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
That's why I just had an idea!  
What if we went for a salty taste instead?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Taiyaki you can eat as a savory snack, like a rice ball!  
I call it... Mackerel-Stuffed Taiyaki!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
This'll set any cat purring! The customers'll be all over it!  
Go on, give it a taste!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Huh...? Humanity isn't ready for this flavor?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hmmm... I guess humans won't go for the same bait as cats...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
F-fine then! Time for Plan B!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Summer treats have gotta be cold!  
And what's colder than shaved ice?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
However... Shaved ice is usually a sweet treat.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
So I thought I'd mix things up with a flavor everyone in Japan knyows!  
A dash of soy sauce and fish flakes...  
It's my \"Kitty-Rice-Style Shaved Ice\"!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
This dish varies a lot depending on the region,  
so I thought I'd let the customers season it themselves!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
This one's a winner! It'll sell like hotcakes!  
When I tasted it, the delicious flavor blew me away!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myah? Why're you going pale just looking at it?  
\"It might be to some people's tastes, but the color's no good\"?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Y-you're right! It looks all brown and muddy!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
But... But...! I want to share my catty tastes with everyone!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I need a flavor that'll stick in everyone's hearts,  
making this kitty cafe a memory they'll hold onto forever!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Huh? Let's go back to basics and make the taiyaki work?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
But we already tried taiyaki! Nyobody wants it!  
Steaming-hot taiyaki and summer don't mix!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh, b-but... If we combined it with something cold...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
If we could create a sweet treat  
that uses hot and cold together...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
After all, the traditional Uji-Kintoki uses bean paste!  
So actually, it's a great match for shaved ice!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
That's it! I'll serve shaved ice with taiyaki on top...!  
It's a simple idea, but it has a totally unique impact!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
And the flavors match!  
Taiyaki and shaved ice—a harmony of hot and cold!  
The sweet taste of bean paste will wash away the summer sweat!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'm gonna add it to the menu right nyow!  
  
**Boy：**  
Excuse me! I want a Taiyaki Shaved Ice!  
  
**Girl：**  
Can I get two of them, please?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Coming right up, everyone!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Amazing! It's a total hit!  
Let's keep up this momentum right to the end!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Still, it's great that we're busy, but the weather's so hot!

**Tamaki：**  
This *is* a beach cafe, so I'll work in my swimsuit!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  That'll help our popularity for sure!  
**Choice: (5)**  Let's go a step further!  
`Tag 4`  
**Tamaki：**  
Hm? You think it'll attract more customers?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Then I guess I'll stick with this look!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Tamaki：**  
H-huhhhh?! What're you saying?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Well, I guess I could take off...  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Tamaki：**  
Wait, nyo time for talking! The customers are lining up!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Look—even the normal taiyaki is starting to sell!  
We need to make more, and quick!  
  
`image display end`  
**Tamaki：**  
This is the final day of the profits contest!  
Lately the customers have even started cheering us on!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Feels like these last few days went by in a flash...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyow, how did we do in the cafe rankings?  
  
**Man：**  
The beach cafe with the top sales this summer is...Miss Tamaki's Kitty Treats!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
W-we did it! It's all thanks to your advice, {player}!  
This was the best summer ever!  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
And... welcome back!  
Congrats on the cafe's big success!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Was that all a dream, you ask?  
Well, something like that, yes.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But trust me, the victory you won is real.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, until next time. I'll see you again soon.  
  

---  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Unhhhh... What was that weird dream...?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Huh? You just had a funny dream too?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Still, I gotta say, selling mountains of taiyaki even in my dreams?  
I really am the top cat!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyow, I guess this is the end of our little adventure!  
Tomorrow I need to get back to selling my wares,  
so let's head home for today!  
  
**Narration：**  
And with that, Tamaki skipped off along the beach  
with a new spring in her step.
