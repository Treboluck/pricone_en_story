## Subtitle: The Great Mayonnaise Quest
  
**Rem：**  
We're all out of mayonnaise!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wh-whatever is the matter, Miss Rem?  
That was a most sudden exclamation...  
  
**Rem：**  
Ah!  
 I'm very sorry for the outburst...  
I lost my composure for a moment.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's \"mayonnaise\"?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rem：**  
It is a form of condiment.  
I learned of it myself from Subaru...  
  
**Rem：**  
It is one of his favorite flavors,  
so at the mansion, we always make sure to have some on hand.  
  
**Rem：**  
But you see, I have yet to make any in this world,  
so I suddenly realized we will not have any when he desires it.  
  
**Rem：**  
As such, we must make haste  
and prepare a batch as soon as humanly possible!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see...  
I think I understand how you feel now.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Tell me, is there anything we can do?  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes. This is a rare opportunity,  
so rather than ordinary mayonnaise,  
I would like to make a special batch using this world's specialities.  
  
**Rem：**  
To that end,  
I would like you to accompany me on a shopping trip...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A shopping trip...  
I *would* be  
 perfectly happy to accompany you...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But unfortunately,  
I have some business to attend to today...  
My lord, did you not also have a delivery job?  
  
**Rem：**  
A delivery job, you say?  
Um,  
 would it be possible for me to accompany you, then?  
  
**Rem：**  
If it's all right, we could make the delivery  
and then purchase the ingredients on our way back home.  
  
**Rem：**  
I know this is very sudden,  
so don't worry if it's too much trouble...  
Huh? You'd love that?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, I agree.  
If the two of you went together,  
I would also find it most reassuring.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well then, Miss Rem.  
May I leave my lord in your capable hands?  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes, certainly!  
You can count on me!  
 Thank you both very much!  
  
**Rem：**  
So, this is the destination of your delivery...  
Let's see...  
 a farm by the name of \"Elizabeth Park.\"  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You betcha!  
Now who's this fresh face with ya today?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm Mahiru, the owner o' this here farm.  
Thanks for bringin' our stuff all this way! ♪  
  
**Rem：**  
Oh, how very kind of you.  
My name is Rem.  
  
**Rem：**  
Master {player} and the Gourmet Guild  
have been taking good care of me.  
It's a pleasure to meet you.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Takin' care of you?  
Looks to me more like you're a-takin' care o' him.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Carryin' him on your back, fannin' his li'l cheeks...  
Why, he's like a proper pampered prince!  
  
**Rem：**  
The mountain trail was rather arduous,  
and he fell and grazed his knee on the way.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, I get ya. You gotta be careful out there.  
Still, good thing he wasn't on his lonesome!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Me, I wouldna've had time to help him out today.  
I'm strugglin' to keep up with my own work!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Things are busy right now?  
`Tag 2`  
**Mahiru：**  
Hmm, more like the timin' worked out bad.  
Everyone else is busy with other stuff, see.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Limalima and Shioshio ain't home,  
plus even Rinrin's got some kinda Caon meeting.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
An' me, I've got my hands full takin' care of our cows.  
Tell the truth, I was wantin' to give Rinrin's room  
a good tidyin'-up while she's away, but...  
  
**Rem：**  
No time for cleaning,  
 you say...  
  
**Rem：**  
Ahh... I would love to offer my services,  
but I have my mayonnaise mission to fulfill...!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Let's offer to help!  
`Tag 3`  
**Rem：**  
Ahh, please,  
don't look at me with those puppy-dog eyes...  
It weighs a little... just a little, extremely a little, on my conscience.  
  
**Rem：**  
Very well, then.  
Miss Mahiru, if you wouldn't mind, might we offer to help with that task?  
  
**Rem：**  
I am a maid by profession,  
so the tidying of rooms is among my strongest skills.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ohhh, is that right?  
Well, ain't that just perfect!  
I'll hafta thank you somehow afterwards!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Well then, I'll show y'all straight to Rinrin's room now! ♪  
  
**Rem：**  
O-oh my...!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  What an... incredible room!  
**Choice: (5)**  What an... incredible dump!  
`Tag 4`  
**Rem：**  
That's a kind way of putting it, but it is indeed incredible!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Rem：**  
That's a blunt way of putting it, but I cannot deny I agree!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Mahiru：**  
I feel kinda bad lettin' guests like you see this mess...  
But no matter how many times I ask her, Rinrin never cleans it up.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
So, I'd really appreciate your help here.  
  
**Rem：**  
Oh no,  
 please, you need say no more.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Miss Rem...?  
  
**Rem：**  
As I just told you, I am a maid.  
I could never allow this plight to go unremedied.  
  
**Rem：**  
I will take this as the ultimate test of the skills  
I have honed in my lifetime!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Whoa... Rem's gettin' fired up!  
I can almost see the flames roarin' around her!  
  
**Rem：**  
To rid this world of heinous squalor,  
allow me to unleash my cleaning talents!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...\"Heinous squalor\" is goin' a bit far!  
  
**Rem：**  
Master {player}, refill the buckets for me!  
I will take care of this!  
  
**Rem：**  
Master {player}, I will mop up the spillage myself!  
I need you to carry these sacks of trash outside!  
  
**Rem：**  
Master {player}, here are more sacks to carry!  
If any scraps of filth burst free from their bonds, I will retrieve them!  
  
**Rem：**  
There, I think that should do it.  
This place looks much cleaner now.  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes, this is a grand team achievement.  
Look outside; the rays of the setting sun are so...  
 Oh.  
  
**Rem：**  
...Look what we've done.  
We got so caught up in this work, we lost track of time.  
  
**Rem：**  
Even if we make it back to the city, the shops will be long shut...  
  
**Rem：**  
...  
  
**Rem：**  
No, this is no time to grow despondent.  
Let's be happy that we achieved such a momentous feat...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wh... wh... whooooaaaa!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
N-no way!  
 Is this really the room I left you in?!  
It's makin' my eyes pop clean outta my head!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm so floored,  
I made a clever pun on \"clean\" without even thinkin' about it!  
  
**Rem：**  
Miss Mahiru.  
It took us some time, but we finished the task.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Yep, yep! You two sure are lifesavers!  
I couldn't thank you enough if I stood here all day an' night! ♪  
  
**Mahiru：**  
That said, I ain't aboutta let you leave empty-handed!  
  
**Rem：**  
Huh...?  
Um, Miss Mahiru, what is all this...?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
A whole batch of our finest eggs an' milk!  
You won't find any fresher  
 in the city or beyond!  
  
**Rem：**  
Th-that's wonderful!  
But how did you know just what I wanted...?  
  
**Rem：**  
Did Master {player} tell you  
I was planning to make mayonnaise...?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You got it!  
An' now you got Landosol's finest ingredients!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I bet that mayonnaise of yours'll turn out just heavenly!  
  
**Rem：**  
Th...  
 thank you ever so much!  
  
**Rem：**  
I will not fail to live up to your expectations!  
Once the batch is complete, I'll send you a bottle as well!  
  
**Rem：**  
Full of Landosol's finest demonically inspired mayonnaise!
