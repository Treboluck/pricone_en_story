# Chika (Holiday) Episode 3
The children performing in a concert together with Chika are overwhelmed by the size of the venue, finding themselves unable to sing. Chika takes the lead and motivates them, only to fall victim to similar pressure, but is able to sing to her heart's content after kind words from {player}.

**Narration：**  
The sun is setting by the time Chika and  
{player} make it back to Landosol  
following their cake delivery.  
  
**Chika：**  
Um... It's almost time for rehearsals,  
so I'll be on my way.  
  
**Chika：**  
Huh? I helped you out a lot today,  
so you'll come with me to the venue? I'd say we're even, though...  
  
**Chika：**  
But well, thank you.  
Having you by my side is more than reassuring.  
Let's get going, then.  
  
**Chika：**  
Wow...  
I'd heard the venue was huge, but this is bigger than I anticipated.  
  
**Chika：**  
I can't let that get to me, though.  
I need to bring the festive spirit to the audience.  
  
**Girl：**  
Urgh... Chika...  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh, hello there.  
Let's sing as best as we can today.  
  
**Girl：**  
U-um... Are we really gonna sing in a venue this big?  
  
**Boy：**  
Th-this is bad... My legs feel like jelly...  
  
**Chika：**  
Okay, let's get started with the rehearsal.  
Follow my lead. One, two, three!  
  
**Children：**  
Lah-lah-lah. ♪  
  
**Chika：**  
They're even more nervous than I thought.  
Their voices aren't nearly as confident as they were during practice.  
  
**Girl：**  
O-oh no... We ran out of rehearsal time...  
This isn't going to go well, is it?  
  
**Boy：**  
I can't sing in a venue this big. I wanna go home...  
  
**Chika：**  
S-settle down, everyone.  
Don't worry.  
You all practiced hard up until today.  
I'm sure it'll all go fine.  
  
**Boy：**  
After how badly that went? No way. We're screwed...  
  
**Chika：**  
Everyone...  
  
**Chika：**  
I can't get flustered. I need to console them.  
But I... I don't know what to do!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's practice.  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's do a dance to cheer them up.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chika：**  
Huh?! Right now?!  
Then again...  
There is still some time until the concert starts.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Chika：**  
A-a dance?  
I can't see that working... Well, it might.  
But if we've got time for that, we should practice instead!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Chika：**  
Oh. B-but we need a place to do it...  
  
**Chika：**  
Huh? The Guild Association?  
That's a good idea, actually.  
I do feel a bit bad because we were there this afternoon,  
but let's ask them anyway.  
  
**Chika：**  
That went easier than expected. Thank goodness.  
Now then, everyone. Let's practice until it's time.  
Follow my lead!  
  
**Chika：**  
We'll start from the top.  
One, two, three!  
  
**Children：**  
Lah-lah-lah. ♪  
  
**Chika：**  
Good, good. You're sounding more confident now!  
Let's do it one more time!  
  
**Children：**  
Lah-lah-lah. ♪  
  
**Chika：**  
Yup! That's the lovely tone I was expecting! As for the final part,  
try your best to make it feel joyous!  
Don't worry—you'll be fine.  
Just remember this feeling when you're on sta—  
  
**Girl：**  
I can't do it, Chika... I don't wanna be on stage...  
  
**Chika：**  
Huh?  
  
**Boy：**  
Same here... There's no way I can sing on a stage like that...  
I'm not even singing well right now.  
I don't wanna mess up during the actual concert.  
  
**Chika：**  
So that's how you all feel...  
  
**Chika：**  
Don't worry. I understand.  
All too well, in fact.  
  
**Girl：**  
You're a popular idol. You'd never understand.  
  
**Chika：**  
That's not true at all.  
I'm always panicking, always fretting.  
I know exactly how it feels.  
  
**Boy：**  
Huh...? How come?  
  
**Chika：**  
Because I'm the same as you all.  
I'm just a girl that's afraid to sing in front of an audience.  
Nothing more, nothing less.  
  
**Chika：**  
That's why I have a little trick.  
I always think about the people that  
believe in me when I'm singing.  
  
**Chika：**  
How about you all?  
Are there people looking forward to seeing you on stage today?  
  
**Girl：**  
My mom...  
  
**Boy：**  
My friends...  
  
**Chika：**  
That makes things simpler, then. You can sing for their sake.  
You can express your gratitude to them through song.  
How does that sound? I know for a fact that you can do it.  
  
**Boy：**  
But I... I'm too afraid...  
  
**Chika：**  
If you're afraid, then you can all hold hands.  
There's nothing to be scared of if you're all together, right?  
  
**Chika：**  
If that's not enough, then...  
Focus your eyes on me.  
  
**Chika：**  
I'll be right up front, guiding you all.  
You don't need to worry about anything else.  
Just think about getting your feelings across.  
  
**Chika：**  
I'll bear the brunt of it all. Not just your fears,  
but the audience's expectations as well. Trust in me.  
  
**Chika：**  
Well, they're all changed and ready to go.  
They seem to have settled down, too.  
Things should go well now.  
  
**Chika：**  
...  
  
**Chika：**  
Huh? My hands are shaking?  
There really is no hiding anything from you, is there?  
  
**Chika：**  
Perhaps it was a bit too brash of me to play the motivational role.  
  
**Chika：**  
Um...  
Do you mind if I... ask you to hold my hand?  
  
**Chika：**  
I'm sorry. Now I'm the one that's paranoid.  
I've gone right back to my old self.  
The girl who's afraid to be on stage...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Hold Chika's hand.  
`Tag 4`  
**Chika：**  
Ah...  
Thank you.  
Your hand's so warm.  
  
**Chika：**  
Even if we mess up on stage, the audience will eventually  
forget about it. But the same doesn't hold true for the  
performers.  
That reality stays with us forever.  
  
**Chika：**  
Doubly so for the children, too.  
Once could be enough to make them never want to sing again.  
  
**Chika：**  
It's entirely possibly that my actions will impact their future.  
That reality is far too terrifying for me to face.  
  
**Chika：**  
Huh? I haven't gone back to my old self...?  
In fact, I'm stronger than ever?  
Singing for their sake makes me a splendid Song Summoner...?  
  
**Chika：**  
I have to admit,  
I didn't realize that you saw me in that light.  
  
**Chika：**  
Thank you.  
You've helped me settle down.  
  
**Chika：**  
Do you mind if I ask you for a favor, actually?  
  
**Chika：**  
Don't take your eyes off the stage. Off of me.  
I'll be up there singing—not just for Landosol,  
but for you as well.  
I'll pour everything I have into it.  
  
**Chika：**  
I'm more nervous than I've ever been.  
Nervous, but not afraid.  
  
**Chika：**  
{player}'s voice. His support.  
It's reverberating in my very soul!  
  

---  
  
**Man：**  
Woooooo! Chikaaa!  
  
**Woman：**  
Don't let her show you up, kids!  
  
**Chika：**  
Telling the children to focus on me helped me realize something.  
That {player} has always been  
right there, supporting me every step of the way.  
  
**Chika：**  
And that includes today.  
  
**Chika：**  
I thought I had gotten used to singing in front of others  
thanks to my time in Carmina, but that's not the case at all.  
  
**Chika：**  
I'm still as weak as ever.  
I still need someone to cling onto.  
  
**Chika：**  
I can't be like this forever, though.  
The children behind me aren't the  
only ones seeking encouragement.  
  
**Chika：**  
I'll shoulder their worries. Protect them.  
After all, ensuring they have a bright future  
is part of being a Song Summoner.  
  
**Chika：**  
Watch me, {player}.  
This is a present from me to you.  
No—from all of us performing today!  
  
**Woman：**  
You all sound so lovely! What an incredible performance!  
  
**Audience：**  
Happy holidays!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus, having poured everything they had into their performance,  
Chika and the children received the biggest applause of the day.
