# Yuni Episode 7
When Yuni strays too close to uncovering the world's secrets, its mental interference assaults her mind more strongly. Unwilling to compromise on the integrity of her conclusions, Yuni is forced to abandon the topic entirely. But she relishes the victory of having uncovered such deep mysteries, however briefly.
  
## Subtitle: On the Relative Value of Secrets and Friendship
  
**Narration：**  
Today, Yuni has called {player} to the Ivory Tower  
to discuss something particularly serious.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, my compatriot.  
Sorry to call you all the way out here.  
  
**Yuni：**  
You've given me a great deal of help.  
So I think you have a right to hear this report.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Now, I have two pieces of news to share.  
One good and one not so good.  
Which would you like to hear first?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Tell me the good news.  
**Choice: (2)**  Hit me with the bad news.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuni：**  
Making the positive choice without hesitation.  
I don't dislike that about you, my friend.

`Tag 2`  
**Yuni：**  
Young man, aren't you familiar with the standard formula?  
For future reference: in jokes of this format,  
you're expected to request the good news first.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Yuni：**  
So without further ado, I'll give you the good tidings.  
Here I go.  
Be prepared to raise your hands and cheer wildly.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ehm... Shockingly, I've recovered the notebook I lost.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Really?  
`Tag 4`  
**Yuni：**  
Yes. See, it's here.  
Brought by a member of staff whose name I know not.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, thank you, compatriot.  
Your hopping exuberance is appreciated. I'm overjoyed too.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Where was it in the end?  
`Tag 5`  
**Yuni：**  
In the furnace, apparently.  
It seems that a janitor noticed it and took it to the school office  
in case it had been discarded by mistake.  
  
**Yuni：**  
As soon as I heard the tale, a chill ran down my spine.  
Because I remembered. Which is to say, I'd forgotten.  
It was I who'd cast the notebook into those fiery depths.  
  
**Yuni：**  
This is no joke.  
It had entirely slipped my mind.  
To think I was an unreliable narrator.  
  
**Yuni：**  
This can't be brushed off as a mere mental block.  
It's tantamount to memory manipulation.  
The system maintaining this world must have upgraded my threat level.  
  
**Yuni：**  
It's a frankly sickening realization,  
 but no matter.  
I'm sure this nausea too will be forgotten before long.  
I've decided to take this as a warning from the powers that be.  
  
**Yuni：**  
It's time to accept my fate.  
I'm on the verge of adulthood.  
Sometimes we must choose our own safety over justice.  
  
**Yuni：**  
It's frustrating, but I'll survive.  
From now on, I'll live in ignorance without questioning the divine.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Though I've always considered myself an atheist.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well, at any rate, I have my notes.  
That happily concludes this particular incident.  
  
**Yuni：**  
All's well with the world.  
We can live happily ever after. Yay.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Now you can finish your thesis!  
`Tag 6`  
**Yuni：**  
Hmm...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes, I see. You still haven't quite grasped our situation.  
No, maybe that's for the best.  
I wouldn't want the heavens to take issue with you as well.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well then, let's move on to the bad news.  
That thesis you speak of—I've decided to abandon it.  
  
**Yuni：**  
My reasons? They're simple.  
\"The Primordial Deceits of This World\"...  
That theme turned out to be too much for me to handle.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Or rather, too dangerous for me to share with the world.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  What do you mean?  
`Tag 7`  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. Let me give a mundane explanation.  
The academy requested that I adjust my report's conclusions.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Or rather...  
They were pressured to do so by the academic community.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well, in the terms of the layfolk,  
the entry I submitted was rejected by the judges.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I feel bad for our poor Mother Hilda.  
This was very confusing for her.  
She was mocked; asked what nonsense she was teaching students.  
  
**Yuni：**  
To wit, my research was deemed to have no academic value.  
Leave such wild fantasies for opera and fiction, they told her.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Though my insights fell on deaf ears,  
 hah...  
I can't honestly claim I expected much better.  
  
**Yuni：**  
After all... the world always seeks to silence  
those who interfere in matters above their station.  
  
**Yuni：**  
So these supposed intellectuals were no different in that respect.  
I'd harbored a faint hope that my thesis would be the trigger  
to push them past their mental blocks...  
  
**Yuni：**  
But alas, no such luck.  
  
**Yuni：**  
So here we are, my compatriot.  
Just as the world wishes, I'll cast this research aside.  
From tomorrow, let's return to the frivolities of local archeology.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Now, to fully recover our spirits,  
let's retire from work and rest for today.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Are you sure you're OK with this?  
`Tag 8`  
**Yuni：**  
With what, exactly?  
Starting over on my thesis is a bother, but aside from that,  
my intellectual curiosity has been thoroughly fulfilled.  
  
**Yuni：**  
...What now?  
No, I'm not lying.  
Don't fix me with such a perturbed expression.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm...  
It seems you're misunderstanding a little, so let me clarify.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Now listen. This retreat isn't what you'd call a total compromise.  
If anything, I was defeated in battle but won the war.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Let me confess.  
 I'm frankly elated.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Just think about it.  
The world turned on me.  
In other words, a divine entity stepped in to foil my plans.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Surely this proves that the insights I pursued were correct.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well, doesn't it?  
The world wouldn't need to obstruct me  
if I wasn't a danger to its secrets.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Do you see?  
These outlandish hypotheses of mine  
have been validated by the heavens themselves!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  I don't get it.  
`Tag 9`  
**Yuni：**  
You don't?  
 Then try this paradigm shift.  
I believe I told you this once.  
My objective is the act of learning itself.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I don't need to expose conspiracies to the world.  
My goal's much simpler.  
I'm satisfied just to find new answers.  
  
**Yuni：**  
In short, once I confirmed the truth that the world itself is a liar,  
the game I'm playing  
 was already won.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I may have received no prize, but my victory can't be denied.  
Come, my compatriot—raise your glass with me in a toast.  
Let's relish this triumph that the world can never know.  
  
**Yuni：**  
It's fine. I'm not a hero or a savior.  
Seeing that justice is done or truth is returned to the world  
are ambitions I've never had the high-mindedness to harbor.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I'll just live out my life in thoughtful peace.  
Stepping out of this tower to pursue the rosy life I once dreamed of  
will be as pleasant a challenge as any.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Normal lessons, club activities, after-school girl talk...  
Will I find a second friend, or even a third?  
Hrm. Tempting dreams indeed! I crave the magic of youth.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I do believe I heard about a scholarship program in the works.  
I can't rely on the village elders' financial support forever.  
Perhaps I'll try attending the initial briefing...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Thus, the game is ended.  
Only the heavens can say what lies ahead.  
  
**Yuni：**  
If I know how divine minds work,  
I doubt I'll fall victim to any lightning strikes  
as long as I leave well enough alone.  
  
**Yuni：**  
So let's embrace these primordial deceits,  
including the forces that conceal them,  
so that we can enjoy life's simple pleasures as the layfolk do.  
  
**Yuni：**  
If that's what this world offers me, let the world do as it likes.  
  
**Yuni：**  
But for this one game...  
I know in my heart that I won.  
 Cheers to that.  
  
**Narration：**  
Yuni beamed with a triumphant smile.  
{player} still wasn't sure he understood,  
but accepting Yuni's decision, he headed home satisfied.  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Hrm.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes, that should do  
to quell young {player}'s worries.  
  
**Yuni：**  
He's pure of mind.  
If I don't put on a convincing act of satisfaction,  
he might paddle in dangerous waters.  
  
**Yuni：**  
...And I bet he can't keep a secret.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Still, on the whole, the things I told him weren't untrue.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I won't expose the world's secrets.  
I'm no great hero or savior,  
so I'll sit back and enjoy this quiet sense of superiority.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Just know this, world.  
I laid my hand on the secrets you're so desperate to hide.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Perhaps that knowledge will be lost to me before long,  
but it'll remain forever as a black mark on your record.  
  
**Yuni：**  
So take that.
