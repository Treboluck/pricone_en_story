**Narration：**  
{player} arrives at the Ivory Tower as usual,  
but finds Yuni heaving a deep sigh atop her desk,  
still struggling to find a new research theme to pursue.  
  
**Yuni：**  
*sigh*...  
  
**Yuni：**  
What is this feeling?  
My fingers seem heavy as I turn each page.  
  
**Yuni：**  
A dull lethargy permeates my entire body, impairing my concentration  
like sunbeams luring me into sleep's embrace.  
In other words, to use the layfolk's terms...  
  
**Yuni：**  
I'm in a funk.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's the matter?  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuni：**  
What indeed, I wonder.  
I've been searching for that answer all day.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, why must my hollow consciousness persist on this plane?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Seriously, is something wrong?  
`Tag 2`  
**Rosetta：**  
Po~ing!  
Answering Question!  
Doctor Yuni Is Attempting To Find A New Research Theme!  
  
**Rosetta：**  
But Due To A Lack Of Ideas,  
Her Drive, Motivation, Will To Live—All Are Trending Downward!  
Her Thought Processes Have Entered Melancholic Mode!  
  
**Rosetta：**  
In This Mode, Humans Are Prone To Poetic Musing  
And Questioning The Value Of Their Own Lives!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ahhh...  
Looking back, why did I leave the mountain and pursue academia?  
  
**Yuni：**  
If all I wanted was to read and to write,  
I could have done so all I wished in the elders' archives.  
  
**Yuni：**  
A breeze without fragrance, a project without progress,  
a room without cheer.  
Say, Rosetta, what color is the sky outside?  
  
**Rosetta：**  
Po~ing!  
Answering Question!  
Try Looking Out The Window!  
  
**Yuni：**  
You bid me make use of my own eyes?  
Dear me. It seems even my own pet golem has forsaken me.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm... Observe, young {player}.  
In ironic opposition to the state of my heart,  
the sky above us is a bright and cloudless azure.  
  
**Yuni：**  
And looking down, I see the school road with its greenery.  
Young maidens exchange words with flowery delight,  
skipping along through their fulfilling lives.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Dear me, what a fabulous sight.  
The magic of youth in all its glory.  
This is the rosy academic life of which I once dreamed.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Once... dreamed...?  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Ah!  
  
**Yuni：**  
I remember now! Yes—that's it!  
  
**Yuni：**  
That's the ideal I truly aspired to!  
The reason I left my books behind for the city!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Is something wrong?  
**Choice: (4)**  What is it this time...?  
`Tag 3`  
`Tag 4`  
**Yuni：**  
Hmph, feel free to laugh if you wish.  
But I'll hide no longer—only the purest truth will pass my lips!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes, indeed! I came to this academy  
to seek the flowery academic life of which I had read!  
  
**Yuni：**  
...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hey. Are you listening to me?  
Why do you stand stock still with your mouth agape?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Don't you know of it?  
Academic life, I say—academic life!  
A particular state of existence blessed by all of youth's excesses!  
  
**Yuni：**  
In the terms of the layfolk, I crave the magic of youth!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I don't quite get it.  
**Choice: (6)**  I think you need to calm down.  
`Tag 5`  
`Tag 6`  
**Yuni：**  
Silence.  
I crave what I crave.  
Come, seek the magic of youth with me!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Are you getting enough sleep lately?  
**Choice: (8)**  Did you drink a weird potion recently?  
`Tag 7`  
**Yuni：**  
Are you trying to call me sleep-deprived?  
Still, what is \"enough,\" really?  
I've always been able to sedate this consciousness for ages on end.  
  
**Yuni：**  
In dreams, I remain half awake,  
whilst in waking, you may find me half asleep.  
A state of full alertness would be wasted on this world of delusion.

`Tag 8`  
**Yuni：**  
I did. Dr. Mitsuki's get-up-and-go tonic.  
But that's what I always do.  
Why would you bring it up at this juncture?  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Yuni：**  
Hmm? What now?  
What's this light that seems simultaneously mysterious and familiar?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah! I've heard of this before!  
Youth's magic is often described as sparkling or shining!  
  
**Yuni：**  
I see... So this is it!  
Yes, the sparkle of youth has finally found me!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, such vibrant hues! The color of love, dreams and hope!

**Yuni：**  
Ah—{player}! What a fluke!  
No way. Why're you here?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oh, you're alone?  
Do you mind if I sit here?  
Thanks. I'll sit right down.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ahhh... This is kind of funny, huh?  
We see each other a lot in Astrum, but in person, it's been a while.  
I dunno, it's just weird. Eheh.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Huh~? C'mon, what?  
We don't even go to the same school,  
so you don't need to treat me like a senior.  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Huh?  
Remind me a sec, {player},  
how do you usually talk to me in Astrum?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oh, right! Yeah. That weird half-polite style.  
Yeah, and when you made that one typo,  
you got embarrassed and used that silly emoji. It was kinda creepy.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ahaha. No, no, it was cute. Big lols and stuff.  
  
**Waitress：**  
Good afternoon!  
Can I take your order?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oh, umm... An espresso, then.  
  
**Waitress：**  
Coming right up.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ahh, this is fun.  
Sorry for getting in the way, though.  
You were reading just now, right?  
  
**Yuni：**  
By the way, what's the lucky book?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oh? But that's the one I messaged you about yesterday...  
Huh? You actually bought it?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
But why?!  
If you'd asked, I'd've been happy to lend it to you!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Huh~? Don't worry about all that!  
It's fine. I can meet up any time, OK?  
Call me whenever!  
  
**Yuni：**  
No... I don't mean I'm OK with meeting *anyone.*  
Mm... More like... it's fine if it's you.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Huh~?  
Well, you're, like, you know.  
A friend, I guess? Like... you're special.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah—no... not like that!  
I didn't mean, um, \"special\" in, like, a weird way, or...  
  
**Waitress：**  
Here's your order, miss. One espresso.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oh... Th-thanks.  
  
**Yuni：**  
...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Whew...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Uhhh... Right, yeah. Listen.  
Weren't you saying you wanted to see that one thing?  
The, um, movie... Yeah. The sequel to the other one.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I was like, \"huh,\" so I went ahead and looked up the trailer.  
It was cool. Actually looked pretty fun.  
Mm. So maybe I'll see it too, or...  that's what I thought.  
  
**Yuni：**  
...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Um, how 'bout you? Did you watch it already?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oh, not yet, huh?  
 Huh. I see, I see. You've been busy.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Mm... I see... Busy, huh...  
Well, yeah. That happens, huh.  
Me, I'm... more sort of... not busy. Ahaha.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Mm... So, how should I do this...  
When would be a good time...?  
  
**Yuni：**  
...  
  
**Yuni：**  
H-hey. Just out of curiosity!  
O-on Sunday next week... are you still busy?  
 Or um, doing anything?  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Watching the morning block.  
**Choice: (11)**  Sleeping in.  
`Tag 10`  
**Yuni：**  
Huh? Morning block? ...Um, what's that again?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Huh? Cartoons?  
Oh... kid's shows. I see. Guess that's important. So you're busy.  
Yeah, superhero shows too, huh.

`Tag 11`  
**Yuni：**  
Sleeping...?  
Oh... right... I guess they are busy. Those Saturday nights.  
Huh... you stay up all night till like ten in the morning? Crazy.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well... if you do that... Yeah. You would need sleep.  
When you wake up, there'll be stuff on TV, too.  
Ahaha. I get that... Yeah, I...  
 get that...  
  
`Tag 12`  
**Yuni：**  
Mm. Well, then...  
 Have fun!  
  
**Choice: (13)**  Thanks! I will!  
`Tag 13`  
**Yuni：**  
Ahhh... This espresso's good...

**Ameth：**  
JUST ASK THE GIRL OUT!!!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Um, what? What was that? Talk about bittersweet!  
  
**Ameth：**  
You had a good mood going!  
Like the magic of youth! Or a classic rom-com!  
My heart was going pitter-pat just watching you!  
  
**Ameth：**  
So why?  
Why didn't you go ahead and invite her?!  
You don't have to take the oblivious rom-com hero act *that* far!  
  
**Ameth：**  
I know I'm the one who gave you this dream, but...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Are these memories of yours bugged out or something?!  
  
**Ameth：**  
...Hm?  
Why are you still just standing around?  
You can leave now. Go on, shoo. Get outta here.  
  

---  
  
**Yuni：**  
Huahhh...  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Just now, I feel like I had an awful dream.  
  
**Choice: (14)**  I don't really remember, but... sorry.  
`Tag 14`  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm... I don't recall the details either,  
but I do feel as though you owe me an apology.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Whew...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oh boy. I think I'll study.  
  
**Narration：**  
Returning to her desk as if nothing had happened,  
Yuni began work on her new research project in earnest.
