**Narration：**  
In response to yet another letter from Yuni,  
{player} makes his way once more to the Ivory Tower.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, my friend. Welcome to this humble abode.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I called you here for a very important reason.  
To begin with, please take a look over these contents.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Read the proffered notebook.  
`Tag 1`  

---  
  
**Yuni's Journal：**  
\"That day, this scholar was close to death.\"  
  
**Yuni's Journal：**  
\"To ascertain the veracity of the Azure Depths,  
I set out on an expedition without regard for the dangers...\"  
  
**Yuni's Journal：**  
\"But it was not an easy road. The winds blew strong  
and the dark skies above roared with the cries of dragons.\"  
  

---  
  
**Yuni's Journal：**  
\"...Or so it seemed to me.\"  
  
**Yuni's Journal：**  
\"Some time has passed since the incident,  
so there may be a few small errors in my recollection.  
I've never been one to dwell on the past.\"  
  
**Choice: (2)**  What's all this...?  
`Tag 2`  
**Yuni：**  
Oh? Have you forgotten? It's a record of the day we first met.  
I'm a habitual note-taker.  
I write down everything precisely as it happened.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Even the difficult road and strong winds?  
**Choice: (4)**  Even the dark sky roaring with dragons?  
`Tag 3`  
`Tag 4`  
**Yuni：**  
I may have exaggerated a few details.  
A peaceful picnic outing would only bore the reader.  
I'm a firm adherent of drama in entertainment.  
  
**Yuni：**  
But enough quibbling; move on to the next part.

**Yuni's Journal：**  
\"At the end of a grueling march, I had exhausted the last of my energy.\"  
  
**Yuni's Journal：**  
\"Before the forces of nature, the fleeting lives of men are as nothing.\"  
  
**Yuni's Journal：**  
\"As I closed my eyes and waited for death to come calling,  
my serene visage was as that of a sainted beauty.\"  
  
**Yuni's Journal：**  
\"My serene visage was as that of a sainted beauty.\"

**Yuni：**  
What now?  
Don't lift your eyes to gaze wordlessly at the author.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Come on.  
Cease comparing the written word to its subject  
and proceed to the following paragraph.

**Yuni's Journal：**  
\"My serene visage was as that of a sainted beauty.  
Before long, doubtless captivated by the sight,  
a lone traveler entered the scene as if drawn by fate.\"  
  
**Yuni's Journal：**  
\"He was of the humanfolk.  
Though he rode not on a white stallion,  
he gave a somewhat knightly impression.\"  
  
**Yuni's Journal：**  
\"At any rate, through the unknowable miracle this man worked,  
I was saved from near certain death.  
In the terms of the layfolk, it was super yummy.\"  
  
**Yuni's Journal：**  
\"Thus it was that I met the brave young man  
who would one day come to be known  
as my co-researcher, {player}.\"

`image display end`  
**Yuni：**  
What is it now?  
Don't quizzically cock your head with that blank face, co-researcher.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah well. I presume you grasp the gist.  
Let's proceed to the topic at hand.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I've lost that notebook.  
  
**Yuni：**  
...No, the book you currently hold  
is a backup copy I prepared in advance using magic.  
But the original article is nowhere to be seen.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well, as long as I have the backup,  
it doesn't cause any great inconvenience.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Nonetheless, the original notebook was a trusty item I had long used,  
and it frustrates me to have my daily routine disturbed.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Let's go look for it.  
**Choice: (6)**  Let's give up on it.  
`Tag 5`  
**Yuni：**  
Ohhh! To think that you would offer so readily.  
The truth is, I was in the process of pondering  
how best to subtly influence you into aiding my quest.  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Yuni：**  
Bwahahahaha!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oh, that was funny.  
Now, leaving ridiculous jokes aside,  
let's begin our search for the notebook.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Yuni：**  
Well, worry not.  
I have some idea where it may be.  
Due to a small errand, I visited the new schoolhouse at lunchtime today.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I happened to learn during this visit that Mother Hilda, the Head of  
Academic Affairs, believes in not closing one's eyes during romantic  
intimacies, so I opened my notebook to record this information.  
  
**Yuni：**  
A little later, upon my return to this room, I noticed that it was missing.  
Which means it vanished somewhere between those points.  
Now, let's begin the hunt. Follow me, dear compatriot.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Shouldn't we split up to search?  
`Tag 8`  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. A superficially efficient suggestion. But let's not be hasty.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I have yet to acquire definitive evidence,  
but based on my personal observations, I'd say you're...  
  
**Yuni：**  
...a boy, aren't you?  
  
**Yuni：**  
No, that's all right.  
No need to show me physical proof.  
Leave your belt firmly tightened.  
  
**Yuni：**  
While my special status allows us to claim an exception,  
ordinarily, those of the male persuasion are strictly forbidden  
from setting foot in this academy.  
  
**Yuni：**  
The day's lessons are over, but many students doubtless still remain.  
Ethically speaking, it may be unwise to allow you free rein.  
In the terms of the layfolk, you'd be arrested.  
  
**Yuni：**  
What? How about the reverse?  
Oh, I see. You mean I could search for it alone?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ehhh... Sounds too boring.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrmm... No sign of it...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Dear me, this is troubling.  
All the likely spots were duds.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I'm very confident we followed the exact route I took at lunchtime.  
...So logically, we seem to have run out of locations to check.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  What now?  
`Tag 9`  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. I suppose...  
it's most natural to assume that a third party retrieved the item.  
However, there were no such reports at the lost property counter.  
  
**Yuni：**  
And yet it's hard to imagine anyone would steal it.  
Such a worn old notebook surely wouldn't fetch a single rupie  
from even the shadiest of dealers.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrrrm. We're out of options.  
But our target is still certainly lost.  
Let's return to the Ivory Tower for now and attempt a magical—  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hm?  
Are those... students from this class?  
Why are they standing outside the classroom and muttering...?  
  
**Student 1：**  
Oh my! It's the young gentleman from before!  
  
**Student 2：**  
Oh my! Could that be Dr. Yuni herself beside him?!  
  
**Student 1：**  
The two of them seem very friendly with one another...  
Hee hee. Could it be that they share a special relationship?  
  
**Student 2：**  
Oh yes, that must be it!  
Hee hee. I wonder if he's already proposed? Oh, how delightful!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  What could they be talking about?  
`Tag 10`  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. From the occasional word I'm able to catch... I suspect those girls  
have interpreted our relationship in a very particular light.  
  
**Yuni：**  
A wild misapprehension, of course,  
 but let's not hold it against them.  
  
**Yuni：**  
They can't be blamed. Given the duration since their lives began,  
they are biologically primed to perpetuate the species.  
It's natural that they would view the world through a rosy filter.  
  
**Yuni：**  
In academic circles, we call this adolescence.  
The troubled age of romantic yearnings.  
Though for good or ill, I myself have yet to exhibit such developments.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm... Tell me, young man.  
Have you ever dabbled in the ways of romance?  
  
**Choice: (11)**  I don't really get that stuff.  
`Tag 11`  
**Yuni：**  
I see. You don't understand.  
To tell the truth, I'm the same way.  
  
**Yuni：**  
\"Love.\" It's a common word.  
Naturally, I'm familiar with its various implications.  
  
**Yuni：**  
A preliminary stage preceding the urge to procreate.  
A complex emotional phenomenon unique to intelligent life.  
A rosy, bittersweet feeling beyond compare.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yet these are all just words to me.  
I can't verify them on a intuitive level.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Knowledge is obtained in two stages.  
The act of learning, and the attainment of understanding.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Under that definition,  
my grasp of love is still far from complete.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I understand it's typically triggered  
by physical contact with the opposite sex,  
which leads to heightened blood pressure and mental stimulation.  
  
**Yuni：**  
In the terms of the layfolk, it makes the heart go pitter-pat.  
Or so I'm told. Apparently. That's the theory.  
Well then... what say you?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Look, I mean...  
I was trying to propose that we... experiment.  
  
**Choice: (12)**  Take her hand.  
`Tag 12`  
**Yuni：**  
Uwahhh?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
O-ohhh... That was very sudden. You surprised me.  
  
**Yuni：**  
What's more, this proximity... Isn't it a little excessive...?  
  
**Yuni：**  
No... It's not that I dislike being close.  
Not at all,  
 but, well... it disturbs my composure somehow.  
  
**Student 1：**  
Aaaahhhh, they're so close! This violates every school policy!  
  
**Student 2：**  
Ohhhh, they're gazing into each other's eyes and whispering!  
It's one step short of marriage!  
  
**Yuni：**  
A-awawahhh...  
Our observers sound more excitable than ever...!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Wh-what *is* this agitation I feel...?  
Every neuron in my mind is firing rapidly... Ahhh...  
Let's stop this, young man. The experiment's off! Cease all contact!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Whew... Honestly. What is this situation?  
We've completely lost sight of our notebook-hunting goal.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Dear me... After all that pointless fuss,  
my skin is practically glowing with...  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Hrm?  
Elevated blood pressure... Mental stimulation...  
  
**Yuni：**  
No... It couldn't be. What a silly thought. Yes.  
  
**Narration：**  
Taken unawares by her own sudden embarrassment,  
Yuni furrowed her brow in concern,  
still not quite ready to embrace her own adolescence.
