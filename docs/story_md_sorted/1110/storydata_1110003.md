## Subtitle: On Contemporary Hospitality in Practice
  
**Narration：**  
After receiving a letter from Yuni requesting supplies,  
{player} has dutifully purchased the requested materials  
and is now searching St. Theresa's Academy for the scholar herself.  
  
**Student 1：**  
Aahhh!  
I-it's a young man! Whyever is he in the academy...?  
  
**Student 2：**  
His mannerisms seem terribly suspicious.  
He glances here and there as if to probe his surroundings...  
  
**Student 2：**  
Excuse me? Yes, you, good sir.  
I'm sorry to intrude, but might I inquire what brings you to this academy?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm looking for someone called Yuni.  
`Tag 1`  
**Student 2：**  
Miss... Yuni?  
 Ehm... who might that be...?  
  
**Student 1：**  
Oh! Could he mean that esteemed individual?  
You know—the student who earned an honorary doctorate.  
From the special class.  
  
**Student 2：**  
Oh, heavens! You're speaking of *the* Doctor Yuni?  
The \"miniature sage\" with the sharpest mind the academy has ever seen?  
She's a very special case, so you won't find her in these classrooms.  
  
**Student 2：**  
I'm afraid I couldn't say where you *will* find her.  
To ordinary students like ourselves, she's a legendary figure.  
  
**Student 1：**  
Atop a distant tower, she lives a hermetic life alone,  
or so I've heard in vague and fanciful rumors...  
  
**Student 2：**  
Oh?  
What perfect timing—there's the Head of Academic Affairs!  
Let's ask her for more information.  
  
**Student 2：**  
Good day, Mother Hilda!  
Listen—this young fellow here...  
  
**Teacher：**  
Dear me, what is all this? A young lady shouldn't raise her voice.  
Why, I'll have you know that never since the day of my birth  
have I uttered such a crude and unseemly cry in—  
 Guooorgh! A booooy?!  
  
**Teacher：**  
S-s-see here, young man! What are you doing?!  
Step away from my students at once, you scoundrel!  
  
**Student 1：**  
Wh-whatever is the matter, Mother Hilda?  
  
**Teacher：**  
We have received a string of unsettling reports.  
Word of a suspicious boy prowling around the academy on the hunt.  
May I assume that would be you, young man?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Sounds like me.  
**Choice: (3)**  Probably someone else.  
`Tag 2`  
**Teacher：**  
Dear me! Not even a trace of repentance!  
How can you admit your guilt so brazenly?!  
Returning to the scene of the crime with such nonchalance...  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Teacher：**  
Dear me! As if the evidence wasn't painfully clear!  
To think you can still find the nerve to deny it!  
Have you not even the integrity to confess your crimes?!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Teacher：**  
Still... Ahem.  
 It is our way to hate the sin, not the sinner.  
What led you down this dark path, young man?  
Confess your sins to me before the heavens.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Oh? You're looking for someone?  
But who exactly...  
 What? Miss \"Yuni\"?  
  
**Teacher：**  
Oh my—for Doctor Yuni's research?  
My, you've brought her supplies?  
Oh my, my, my! Well, isn't that simply splendid!  
  
**Teacher：**  
I see, I see. You're Doctor Yuni's...  
 ehm... apprentice, I suppose?  
No, no, no—that's perfectly fine. She is a rising star of this academy.  
We can't let anything stand in the way of her research. Hohohoh...  
  
**Teacher：**  
Now, my dear young ladies.  
Why don't you show this apprentice directly to the Ivory Tower?  
  
**Student 1：**  
The \"Ivory Tower\"...?  
Ehm, was that the library wing of the old schoolhouse?  
  
**Student 2：**  
Astonishing...  
That ancient building? I had no idea anyone was still using it...  
  
**Rosetta：**  
Bi-bi-bip! Bi-bi-bip!  
Notifying Doctor Yuni!  
Wake Up At Once! You Have A Visitor!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Mnnahh... Whew.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Good morning, world.  
I see you're as dark and secluded as ever, you dirty liar.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Good morning.  
`Tag 5`  
**Yuni：**  
Hmm...?  
Oh? Dear me. This isn't a dream.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Greetings, young {player}.  
It's good to see you again.  
What brings you here this fine day?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I've got the supplies you asked for.  
`Tag 6`  
**Yuni：**  
Oh, of course. These.  
I do recall sending that letter.  
  
**Yuni：**  
To think that the demand I dispatched on a half-joking whim  
would find itself fulfilled so readily. You're such a trusting mark.  
No, strike that.  
 You're such a kind young man.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes, I welcome you. Your diligent work is appreciated.  
Thanks a bunch. *bow* Eheheh...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Still, what's this? I find myself in a flustered state of mind.  
Ah... Since seizing this Ivory Tower for my own use,  
this may actually be the first time I've welcomed a guest.  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Ah, of course. If I recall correctly, the usual custom  
is to offer a cup of tea, yes?  
 Forgive my thoughtlessness—  
I'll prepare one at once.  
 Seat yourself and relax.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Here you go.  
I've brought your tea and snacks. Consume them as you will.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hm?  
What's wrong, young {player}?  
Cease blinking your eyes repeatedly  
 and consume. Swiftly consume.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Take a swig of the liquid in the test tube.  
**Choice: (8)**  Try one of the mystery pills on the saucer.  
`Tag 7`  
**Yuni：**  
Most impressive.  
I didn't think you'd drain it in one gulp.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, your face is twisted in horror.  
But of course; that stuff's absolutely vile.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well, I apologize for the belated explanation,  
but that liquid is an extract from a certain floral monster's leaves,  
treated to remove only the harmful constituents.  
  
**Yuni：**  
It technically qualifies as tea, but it's more of an indulgence than a drink.  
One places small amounts on the tongue to savor the odious flavor.  
In my home village, it was more popular than tobacco or coffee.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Where does the appeal lie...?  
Hrmm...  
 I suppose the sheer foulness amuses the mind, in a sense.  
Beyond disgust is a place of enlightenment; the realm of ecstasy.

`Tag 8`  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, to think you'd go straight for that. You have good taste, young man.  
That's a nutritional supplement I received directly from Dr. Mitsuki.  
  
**Yuni：**  
No, wait. Are you man, or are you rodent?  
Don't nibble on each pill individually.  
Take a handful and munch.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oh, no need to fear. With such a vague prescription,  
there's barely a proper dosage to exceed.  
I prefer to simply consume them as everyday snacks.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes, due to the strong effects, I find myself with excess energy  
from time to time,  
 but they don't contain any elements that should  
do lasting harm to the body. They're safe for even an infant to devour.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Legally?  
Oh,  
 I'm sure there's no problem.  
As long as Dr. Mitsuki's still at large, at least.  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Yuni：**  
So, young {player}.  
I want to hear your honest opinion.  
How did you find my first efforts at hospitality?  
  
**Yuni：**  
As the literature proposes, I chose offerings that reflect the unique traits  
of the host.  
 I'm still largely unfamiliar with your own preferences, which  
leaves room for concern,  
 but I hope I was at least able to please my guest.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, you see, I grew up in a lonely village far from civilization.  
Until entering this academy, I had never left the mountain.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Living with elders who shunned society,  
I was raised on their archives of old tomes,  
leading to what I now see as a decidedly insular upbringing.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Perhaps due to this, I'm often told  
that I lack certain elements of common sense.  
  
**Yuni：**  
If by any chance anything about me concerns you,  
please do feel free to share.  
In fact, I insist. Speak at once.  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Well, um... there's the way you talk...  
**Choice: (11)**  Well, um... there's your appearance...  
`Tag 10`  
**Yuni：**  
Oh... Yes, of course. Call it stilted, or call it archaic...  
I'm aware that my speech comes across  
as excessively literary for casual conversation.  
  
Jump to tag 12  
`Tag 11`  
**Yuni：**  
Oh... No, that's not what I mean.  
While it's true that I possess an unusually adorable outward form,  
that's an innate feature, largely unaffected by my environment.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hmm? You don't understand what I'm saying?  
Ah, I see. But of course.  
I can't deny that my style of speech lies firmly outside the norm.  
  
`Tag 12`  
**Yuni：**  
From as young an age as I can remember,  
I was surrounded by elderly sages who spoke in this way.  
You might call it the dialect of my hometown.  
  
**Yuni：**  
On entering this academy,  
I made an initial attempt to align myself with standard speech patterns...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Like, to start with? I tried to talk all normal-like and stuff...  
  
**Yuni：**  
But you see, I soon found that this academy  
is rife with verbal expressions that fall outside the norm.  
To wit, \"good day.\" To wit, \"good heavens.\" To wit, \"cherun.\"  
  
**Yuni：**  
If the dialect of high society is fair game, why not the dialect of a sage?  
Since reaching this conclusion,  
I've returned to embracing my natural ways.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Of course, not long after my matriculation,  
my desk was moved to this tower.  
Since then, I've had little opportunity to converse with my peers at all.  
  
**Choice: (13)**  Why did you end up moving here?  
`Tag 13`  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. Let's see...  
In the terms of the layfolk, I was simply too smart.  
That's the essence of it.  
  
**Yuni：**  
According to the academy, with my remarkable gifts,  
attending classes at the same level as my peers would be fruitless.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Rather than memorizing the textbooks of our forebears,  
I should devote myself to advancing new insights,  
or so they kindly informed me.  
  
**Yuni：**  
In the terms of the layfolk:  
\"Forget attending classes. Just write your own theses.\"  
  
**Yuni：**  
If my research were to earn recognition in academic circles,  
it would surely be a boon to the academy's reputation, you see.  
  
**Yuni：**  
...No, I shouldn't blame others entirely.  
 I myself harbor ambitions  
of bringing honor to my hometown through academic success.  
I have yet to repay the elders for their efforts in raising me, after all.  
  
**Yuni：**  
At any rate, I was offered the use of this old library wing,  
AKA the Ivory Tower.  
 To a seeker of knowledge like myself,  
it was all too tempting a trove of treasures.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Each dusty shelf is packed with ancient tomes and scrolls.  
Wherever I look, new discoveries are waiting to be found.  
Endless learning—all the joys of academia—contained within these walls.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I still struggle to grasp why such a wondrous facility lay abandoned.  
Surely intellectuals the world over  
would give anything to set foot within.  
  
**Yuni：**  
At any rate...  
That's how I came to reside here,  
confining myself to these timeworn archives.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I indulge in the texts around me,  
at times sleeping in their pages' gentle embrace,  
and produce original research in lieu of attending lessons.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Now, do you understand my ways, young compatriot?  
It would please me if we could continue this partnership.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Or in other words...  
To put this in the terms of the layfolk...  
I hope you'll visit again.  
  
**Choice: (14)**  I'd love to.  
`Tag 14`  
**Yuni：**  
Is that right?  
Hrm, good to hear. Yes.  
  
**Narration：**  
And from that day on, {player} found himself  
invited to the Ivory Tower on a fairly regular basis.
