**Narration：**  
As usual, {player} makes his way to the Ivory Tower  
after receiving a letter from Yuni.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah. Welcome home, my friend.  
  
**Yuni：**  
You must be tired from a hard day's work.  
Would you like a bath? Or a meal? Or perhaps... little old me?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  A bath, please.  
**Choice: (2)**  A meal, please.  
**Choice: (3)**  A Yuni, please.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuni：**  
I see.  
Let me draw you a map to the nearest public bathhouse.  
You can visit at your leisure later.

`Tag 2`  
**Yuni：**  
Oh...?  
You're that fond of the nutritional supplements I gave you?  
Good to hear. I'm flattered.

`Tag 3`  
**Yuni：**  
Run that by me again, young man?  
I hope you didn't take my classic welcome joke too seriously.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah... but I only have myself to blame.  
My inner adult charms that this body can't conceal  
must have led you astray. This Sexy Yuni life is a sin...  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Yuni：**  
Now, setting aside this newlywed charade that I learned from fiction...  
  
**Yuni：**  
My compatriot.  
I called you here for a very important reason.  
I have a vital task that I can only ask of a friend.  
  
**Yuni：**  
In the terms of the layfolk: sit tight, 'cause I need to vent.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Today's topic:  
\"The Case of the Persistently Missing Notebook\"!  
Bang bang toot toot.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Now, you understand, out of respect for this fine institution,  
I've long resisted the urge to take excessive advantage  
of the special privileges I enjoy here.  
  
**Yuni：**  
However.  
I had tried not only tracing magic, but even prayer and divination.  
Exhausted every means of finding this notebook alone.  
  
**Rosetta：**  
Po~ing! Dear Pisces, Your Luck For This Week Is Absolute Trash!  
Missing Items? Hope For The Future?  
They'll Remain Lost Forever!  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Yes, that was the gist of my horoscope.  
  
**Yuni：**  
At that point, I had no other option but to scour the academy  
through force of numbers.  
 Though it pained me,  
I asked the Head of Academic Affairs to provide a search party.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Once I explained that this notebook was critical to my next thesis,  
she assembled a crack squad of staff members  
to inspect every nook and cranny.  
 This was three days ago.  
  
**Yuni：**  
And a short while ago, I received word of the squad's disbandment.  
To wit, \"There's literally nowhere left to search. Please let us go home.\"  
  
**Yuni：**  
In other words, this case has reached an impasse. Boo-hoo.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Now, I know what you want to say.  
Since I have a full backup, my research can proceed without the original.  
At first, I too took this optimistic view of the matter.  
  
**Yuni：**  
However, that only reassured me  
while I had no reason to doubt the notebook's eventual return.  
  
**Yuni：**  
If my notebook were to find its way into the hands  
of an unknown third party, I can't claim with any confidence  
that I could retain a clear state of mind.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Is it a problem if someone else reads it?  
`Tag 5`  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm...  
In the grand scale of things,  
 no, I suppose it's not a major problem.  
  
**Yuni：**  
At worst, the poems I penned during late-night moments of madness  
might be exposed to the public eye and cause damage to my dignity.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Even so...  
 I must wonder... Hrmm... No, it couldn't be...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  What's wrong?  
`Tag 6`  
**Yuni：**  
Yes, what indeed?  
I keep asking myself the same question.  
I don't fully understand it. Call it a deep-seated instinct.  
  
**Yuni：**  
The majority of the notebook's contents  
consists of my idle daily observations,  
recorded in abbreviated form with little clarity of structure.  
  
**Yuni：**  
For instance, one page lists a series of personal physical measurements  
that could cause me significant embarrassment if made public,  
 but to the  
untrained eye, they would look like little more than meaningless digits.  
  
**Yuni：**  
However, the same can't be said of every page.  
Our current project, for instance—  
that is to say, my notes on \"The Primordial Deceits of This World.\"  
  
**Yuni：**  
Now, it's not the thought of plagiarism that concerns me.  
After all, I've submitted our project's outline to this academy,  
and thereby to the academic community at large.  
  
**Yuni：**  
In the terms of the layfolk, any copycats would be busted.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yet somehow... What could they be? These unsettling pangs of worry.  
I hope it's nothing more than a form of paranoia...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Let's keep searching.  
`Tag 7`  
**Yuni：**  
You're very kind, my compatriot.  
And I truly do appreciate the sentiment,  
 but it's simply not logical.  
Or what—were you not listening to my story?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Let me repeat myself. This entire school has been scoured.  
What other locations remain for us to search?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  What about right here?  
`Tag 8`  
**Yuni：**  
Here? This very room...?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. It's true, I haven't searched my study.  
But with good reason: if the notebook were here,  
it would long since have been picked up by my tracing magic.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Still, I suppose... No magic can ever be truly infallible...  
No, but still... I'm sure...  
  
**Yuni：**  
It... couldn't be here, could it...?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  It's got to be worth a try.  
`Tag 9`  
**Yuni：**  
Urk...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrmmm. You say that, but this room...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Every inch of it is strewn with books and random items.  
The layfolk might call it a trash heap.  
I'm frankly impressed that I allowed it to reach such a state.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Now, this isn't an excuse,  
but I've always preferred comfortable chaos to excessive order.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Just as evolution results from errors in a species' genetic code,  
the microcosm of a personal space benefits from random disarray  
allowing the buffer of chaos entropy to...  
  
**Yuni：**  
...No, it's no use. I made an effort to justify this state  
by applying logical allegory, but I can't. It's just a messy room.  
  
**Yuni：**  
To search this chaos for a notebook that may not even exist  
would be like digging for a gemstone in the desert.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Or to be frank, it would be a clean-up for the ages.  
  
**Yuni：**  
By the by, my least favorite expression is \"spick-and-span.\"  
Will you take on the challenge despite this?  
  
**Choice: (10)**  I'll do it.  
**Choice: (11)**  Heck no.  
`Tag 10`  
**Yuni：**  
I see. Good luck. Fight well.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Huuuh? I'm cleaning too? Don't wanna.

`Tag 11`  
**Yuni：**  
A wise choice. In a nation far to the east,  
I hear there's an ancient poem that goes like this.  
  
**Yuni：**  
\"In a river clear, fish that swim its unstained depths long for darker days.\"  
I'm no expert,  
 but I believe it roughly means  
\"Making a mess of your room is A-OK.\"  
  
`Tag 12`  
**Yuni：**  
Yes, let's forget this idea. Our limited time in this world  
should be spent with the utmost care, if you ask me.  
  
**Choice: (13)**  And we can forget about the notebook, too?  
`Tag 13`  
**Yuni：**  
Urghhh...  
 Hrm. Perhaps not.  
  
**Yuni：**  
No, you're right. Absolutely right.  
My compatriot, I welcome your suggestion.  
It appears my judgment was in error.  
  
**Yuni：**  
For an instant, the thought \"This is too much of a pain!\" seized my mind,  
and I allowed it to lead my good sense astray.  
Not on the level of an obvious brainwashing spell, but more subtly.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Dear me.  
I confess such cases have been on the rise  
ever since I began this project.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Due to my deeply ingrained habit of taking notes,  
I'm able to notice these inconsistencies  
while rereading my own prior observations...  
  
**Yuni：**  
But were it not for that, I'm sure I'd lose interest and forget.  
A mental block. This world is clearly acting upon us.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Still...  
At present, this is little more than a wild conspiracy theory.  
Sorry to bring it up. There's no need for you to worry.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm.  
For the moment, let's set about  
searching this room for my lost item.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Let's see...  
To begin with, I'll attend to my desk area.  
I'll let you handle cleaning...  
 I mean searching the room at large.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I'd advise you begin by moving my books from the floor to the shelves.  
Ah—not there! Reference books go on the shelf over yonder.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Um... Please look at the labels. That one's a dictionary.  
Wait—that's a social science volume, so it goes on the third...  
  
**Yuni：**  
All right, all right. Step aside.  
I'll organize the stray books myself.  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Urgh. I have a bad feeling.  
I was hoping to casually leave most of the cleaning to him,  
but is the bulk of the work going to end up falling to me...?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah... no, it's nothing.  
Let's see, why don't you...  
 gather and divide up my academic detritus?  
In the terms of the layfolk, take out the trash.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Wait, wait, wait. That ailing potted plant isn't trash.  
It's a rare catalyst that I use for identification charms.  
  
**Yuni：**  
It's surprisingly delicate, so be very careful how you handle it.  
It may look like garbage, but a single sprig can fetch as much  
as the median monthly salary in Landosol—  
  
**Yuni：**  
Waaahhhh! What did I just say?!  
It's falling apart! That monthly salary's falling apart!  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Yes? What is it now?  
Oh, that old scroll? Well, let's see...  
  
**Yuni：**  
No, it may look like a priceless antique recording ancient rituals,  
but that's just a self-portrait I drew last week.  
  
**Yuni：**  
There was a time when I dabbled in the arts.  
But as you can see, my works were of little worth.  
Nothing that needs to be passed down for posterity.  
  
**Choice: (14)**  So it's trash, then?  
`Tag 14`  
**Yuni：**  
...Mm. Trash... I suppose so.  
Between \"trash\" and \"not trash,\" it may fall under the former.  
But I'm not sure I appreciate the wording...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah—wait a moment!  
That's where I store my clothing.  
I'll handle it myself, so please don't—  
  
**Yuni：**  
Waaahhh! Not the underwear!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Gyaaahhhh! Don't touch thaaaat!  
  
**Yuni：**  
*pant*... *pant*... I'm so pooped...  
  
**Yuni：**  
And in the end,  
we uncovered neither hide nor hair of our quarry...  
  
**Yuni：**  
In the terms of the layfolk,  
we found a whole lot of nothing.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrmm... Though I hate to admit it,  
it really does seem that my notebook must be in another's possession.  
A dark and cunning foe with great powers of deception...  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Or perhaps just an eccentric with a love for amateur poetry.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Now... Thank you for your help, compatriot.  
The sun is setting, so let's call it a day...  
 Hm?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oh, look—there's a speck of dust on your cheek.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes, right there.  
Good, it's all... gone...  
 now...  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Wait.  
Hey. What did you use to wipe your cheek just now?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ahhh... That's...!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Gyaaahhh! What did I say about the underweeear?!  
  
**Narration：**  
And a young maiden's shrill cries echoed through the Ivory Tower.
