# Yuni Episode 2
On a quest to seek out the world's deepest secrets, Yuni heads for the fabled Azure Depths, which are said to lead to another plane. After fending off countless monsters, she reaches her destination—but finds nothing there but an old pond. Nonetheless, she concludes that the journey itself was a valuable learning experience.
  
## Subtitle: On the Origins and Inaccuracy of Folklore
  
**Narration：**  
En route to the Azure Depths, Yuni lay collapsed by the roadside.  
Though it was a coincidence that {player} rescued her,  
he now finds himself dragged along on her expedition.  
  
**Yuni：**  
\"From this point onward, the journey goes smoothly.\"  
  
**Yuni：**  
\"I proceed down the road with a spring in my step. It feels as though  
my boots have sprouted wings, which can only be his doing.  
In addition to carrying my supplies, this lad may be my first ever frie—\"  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's that notebook?  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuni：**  
Huaaaghhh?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Wh-what's all this now? Accosting me from behind...!  
It's not polite to intrude on a young lady's private time.  
When I engage in creative writing, I like to enter the characters' minds.  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Well, as for the nature of this notebook, I could give many answers.  
It's variously served me as a travel log, a memorandum, a creative jotter,  
and at times, even a collection of original poetry.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I'm what you'd call a habitual note-taker.  
  
**Yuni：**  
As I'm sure you know, we who study the ways of magic  
have various ways to record information besides the written word...  
  
**Yuni：**  
But myself, I find the act of writing enjoyable in and of itself.  
  
**Yuni：**  
As for the reason why,  
I suppose the process of physically recording one's observations  
represents to me the elevation of information into knowledge.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Not to share with others, nor to leave for posterity.  
I take pen in hand for the sole purpose of furthering my own learning!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Or at least, I wish I could present my reasons with such confidence.  
Though I boast of my thirst for knowledge,  
I'm as yet neither a qualified scholar nor a sage.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Though I do receive a measure of special treatment, my current role  
is to submit assignments to the academy in exchange for credits  
as a humble disciple of learning like my peers. *sigh*  
  
**Yuni：**  
That's why today, in the course of one of my theses in progress,  
the need arose to take to the field, forcing me to leave the Ivory Tower.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  What's this \"thesis\" about?  
`Tag 2`  
**Yuni：**  
The theme of my current research project?  
Ah. Well, that would be... none other than...!  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Hrm?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Dear me. What was it?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You've forgotten what you were studying?  
`Tag 3`  
**Yuni：**  
Now, now! Enough of that foolishness. What do you take me for?  
While I usually prefer not to boast, I passed the St. Theresa's entry exams  
with the highest score. I'm a veritable prodigy.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yet even a genius is human. We're not immune to absent-mindedness.  
Wait just a moment.  
Ahh... In anticipation of this, I believe I noted down...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, good. Here it is.  
So, let's try again. The theme of my research is none other than...  
  
**Yuni：**  
\"The Primordial Deceits of This World.\"  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well, I can't say much for certain as yet.  
But in layfolk's terms, this world of ours is home to a great deception.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Or so my hypothesis suggests.  
Hahah. How's that? A lofty theme, yes?  
When I finally publish this research, it will rock the academic community.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  And yet you managed to forget it...  
`Tag 4`  
**Yuni：**  
Don't make me repeat myself.  
We genii are only human. Nobody is perfect.  
  
**Yuni：**  
When capturing a reader's interest, a character with human flaws  
is more effective than perfection, or so I recall reading once.  
So: be captive. Surrender your interest to me.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ahhh...  
 Ohh...  
Wait, young man. Let's take a brea—  
 Ah, I mean...  
This area is rife with monster activity. We should proceed with caution.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I'll erect a detection spell.  
There's no longer a need to rush.  
The Azure Depths we seek shouldn't be far from this point.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  What are these \"Azure Depths\"?  
`Tag 5`  
**Yuni：**  
Who knows? Certainly not I.  
  
**Yuni：**  
No, wait. Stop that, young man.  
Don't gaze upon this rare and celebrated genius with a look of pity.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I'm not being forgetful; I'm speaking the plain truth.  
Think about it—if the answer were clear, then why investigate?  
Such quests for knowledge are the essence of academia.  
  
**Yuni：**  
At any rate, let me share what insight I do possess.  
According to old tomes, this area was once a human settlement.  
The \"Azure Depths\" are a great void that was feared by its residents.  
  
**Yuni：**  
'Twas a bottomless pit leading down to the underworld... or so it's said.  
Hah, \"underworld.\" The land of the dead.  
An ambitious claim if ever I heard one.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Within hiking distance of our academy, a gateway to another plane.  
As a seeker of the world's secrets, how could I hear of such a tale  
and not arise from my repose to conduct an archeological survey?  
  
**Yuni：**  
So you see, even if there are monsters ahead,  
I'd prefer to avoid retreating from them if at all possible.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Thus I turn to you, my faithful pack horse and now reliable bodyguard.  
In case of emergency, I'll be counting on your valor.  
That sword on your belt is more than just a decoration, I trust?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Incidentally, this fabulously deadly-looking battle-axe I carry  
is 40% decoration, 40% fancy, and 20% pure photogenicity;  
I can't actually swing it. So please don't bother counting on it in battle.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well, what do you expect?  
My muscles are accustomed to doing little more than turning pages;  
how could they possibly lift such a heavy object?  
  
**Yuni：**  
The brutality inherent to the axe combined with the pen nib  
symbolizing intellect—this unique design spoke to the depths  
of my soul, so I purchased it on a whim while traveling.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Can you fight with magic, then?  
`Tag 6`  
**Yuni：**  
Huh?  
What gibberish are you speaking, young man?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Isn't it plain to see? I'm devoted to academic research.  
I embody the adage \"the pen is mightier than the sword.\"  
As if I'd study barbaric fireball spells outside of the realm of theory.  
  
**Rosetta：**  
Biiing!  
Notification From Rosetta To Doctor Yuni!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm? What is it, Rosetta?  
  
**Rosetta：**  
Multiple Readings Approaching This Position!  
Gait Analysis Suggests Several Non-Intelligent Life Forms!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Monsters, as I thought.  
Hrm... We can't avoid them if we're to proceed.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hm? Oh, that voice just now?  
Let me introduce you. This is my pet mineral and navigator  
on this lonely road, the improvised quasi-golem Rosetta.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Just looks like a random stone to me.  
`Tag 7`  
**Yuni：**  
Solitude can lead a soul to madness.  
During my life of reclusion, I felt the need for a conversation partner,  
and thus enchanted a stray pebble with an artificial personality.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Though its countenance may appear stony,  
I assure you its sense of humor is as sharp as my own.  
Until such time as the enchantment expires, I hope you'll get along.  
  
**Rosetta：**  
Be Gentle, It's My First Time!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Its voice sounds kind of like yours...  
`Tag 8`  
**Yuni：**  
You have good ears.  
 Yes, golems and AI fall outside my area of expertise.  
The words it speaks are merely lines I prerecorded myself,  
replayed according to a complex sequence of arbitrary algorithms.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Still, the results are nothing to sneeze at. For instance...  
OK Rosetta, how are my biorhythms today?  
  
**Rosetta：**  
Yuni's So Pretty!  
Yuni's So Sexy!  
Yuni's A Genius Who No Mortal Man Can Resist!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Uweheheh...  
  
**Yuni：**  
So as you see, it can produce rather satisfying responses.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  You... recorded that line yourself?  
**Choice: (10)**  Why does it talk like a parrot?  
`Tag 9`  
**Yuni：**  
Solitude leads a soul to madness.  
I *am* a woman. Even I crave passionate attention at times.  
...Ah, young man? Please don't gape at me with those innocent eyes.  
  
Jump to tag 11  
`Tag 10`  
**Yuni：**  
I can't recall my exact reasoning at the time,  
but I likely hoped to differentiate it from myself.  
As I just noted, we both have quite the sense of humor.  
  
`Tag 11`  
**Rosetta：**  
Po~ing!  
Nearby Readings Entering Visible Range!  
Please Initiate Evasive And/Or Combative Maneuvers!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAGGGHHHH!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. Not the time for casual conversation, I see.  
Bothersome beasts. They're more numerous than I expected.  
We may still be able to retreat if necessary, but...  
  
**Yuni：**  
What say you, young {player}?  
You're the warrior here. I'll defer to your fight-or-flight instincts.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm...?  
Hey. What's all this? That magic...  
No, *is* it even magic?  
What in the world are you—  
  
**Yuni：**  
O... ohhhhh?!  
It seems... you've cast a form of enhancement upon me?  
  
**Rosetta：**  
Effects Unknown!  
No Applicable Data Registered!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ahhh... What now? Something's coming...  
This is a power I've never felt before!  
Ohhhh...! Most intriguing! All the cells in my body feel energized!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Here it coooomes!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Huaaahhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ohhh... my brain expands! The synapses weave theory into praxis,  
and with each swing of my arms, bolts of barbaric light burst forth!  
What is this...? What logic could underly this miracle?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Eheh... eheheh... Thank you for this foreign experience.  
My intellectual curiosity is thoroughly piqued!  
In the terms of the layfolk, I don't think I can lose!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAGGGHHHH!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Learn *this,* sucker!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Dear me. Stay back, young man, or I may injure you!  
Heheheh... This alien power deserves plenty of testing!  
I'll wield it effectively from an academic perspective!  
  
**Yuni：**  
The pen is mightier than the sword!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Huahh! Huaaahhhh! Huachahhh!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oof. Ouchie...  
  
**Yuni：**  
I may be too old for this kind of rampage.  
Ahh... I must return to the Tower and bury myself in books...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Still...  
As expected, there's little truth in folklore.  
  

---  
  
**Yuni：**  
That deep void said to lead to the underworld...  
In actuality, it was nothing more than an old abandoned pond.  
  
**Yuni：**  
We did find evidence of a settlement nearby.  
Based on patterns common in such fables,  
I imagine the truth behind the Azure Depths goes something like this.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Once upon a time, the people of the village  
spun a tale to keep children away from the dangerous waters.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Generations passed, the village declined, and monsters took root.  
What was once a tale for children was distorted over time  
and reached our current age as legend. The End.  
  

---  
  
**Choice: (12)**  That's a shame...  
`Tag 12`  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm? A shame?  
Why, exactly? This result is precisely what I'd anticipated...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oh, I see.  
Did you think I was depressed by this outcome and try to comfort me?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Your concern is entirely unwarranted, yet it pleases me for some reason.  
In the terms of the layfolk, thank you.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Thinking back, I suppose I never told you. I'm sorry.  
 From the start,  
my hypothesis was that this legend held no significant truth.  
And now, we've proven that hypothesis correct. Most satisfying.  
  
**Yuni：**  
As such, there's really no need to comfort me.  
In fact, be proud. I couldn't have done this without your help.  
Let me say it once more: thank you.  
  
**Yuni：**  
This is something of a simplified statement,  
but my intellectual pursuits aren't about exposing hidden secrets.  
  
**Yuni：**  
To me, the value of learning lies in just that: learning itself.  
What matters is reaching a conclusion, not that conclusion's contents.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. For instance, imagine this as a quiz.  
My objective is simply to give the correct answers,  
not to win the game or claim the monetary prize. Do you see?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well, you'll grow to understand.  
The joy of learning is more precious than riches or renown.  
  
**Yuni：**  
That's the reason we take pen in hand each day.  
I hope you'll aid me again, my compatriot.  
  
**Narration：**  
As she tied up the day's tale in a satisfying manner,  
Yuni didn't miss the chance to call {player} a compatriot  
so as to ensure he'd stick around as a convenient helper.
