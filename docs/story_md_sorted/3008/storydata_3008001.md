# Mercurius Foundation Episode 1
Akino, intent on becoming an entrepreneur in the same vein as her father, forms a guild with Yukari, Mifuyu and Tamaki. Their guild is all business on the outside, but it also works to fight evil behind the scenes.
  
## Subtitle: Mercurius Emerges!
  
**Narration：**  
One day in Landosol, yet another new guild is formed.  
  
**Akino：**  
Now that our application to form a guild has been accepted,  
I'd like to commence operations straightaway!  
  
**Akino：**  
Yukari, Mifuyu.  
I look forward to working with you both.  
  
**Yukari：**  
The pleasure is all ours, Miss Akino.  
Leave the nitty-gritty of running the guild to us.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yukari and I will be with you every step of the way.  
After all, your father specifically asked us to take care of you.  
  
**Akino：**  
Yukari, my father's personal accountant.  
Mifuyu, our head of security with a keen mind for business.  
And then none other than moi! We're the perfect team!  
  
**Yukari：**  
So, what exactly will our guild do?  
Any ideas?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Well, if we're going to conduct business like your father does,  
then we'll need to decide just what sort of trade we'll be involved in.  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, well in that case, there's no need to worry. The first thing we must do  
is have a party!  
 A grand gala bringing together all the local movers and  
shakers to celebrate the launch of our guild.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
And waste all that money right off the bat?!  
Miss Akino, please. Surely you're aware we don't have any income yet?  
It's too reckless to spend so much at this point.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Mifuyu is right.  
We still haven't decided how we're going to earn money either.  
Our funds are limited, so I think we should spend them wisely.  
  
**Akino：**  
I understand what both of you are saying, of course.  
However, money is in fact the one thing we do have right now.  
As such, we ought to start by using it effectively.  
  
**Akino：**  
The party will provide massive publicity for our guild.  
If we can spread our name, then those in need will surely come to us with  
requests.  
 In other words, it will be just like we're handing out fliers.  
  
**Yukari：**  
I see. Well then,  
perhaps the people who come to the party  
will provide some word-of-mouth advertising for us.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I see that you've thought things through, Miss Akino.  
Still, please leave the financial planning of the party to us.  
Okay?  
  
**Akino：**  
That's fine. In fact, I would very much appreciate that,  
since I'm not fond of counting coins.  
Now then, let's get the preparations underway!  
  
**Akino：**  
Let's see... The catering is ordered,  
and the invitations have been sent out...  
Our gala is coming together quite nicely.  
  
**Akino：**  
...Hm? What's that wonderful smell?  
It's coming from that food stand.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Welcome, welcome! Taiyaki, piping hot and ready to eat!  
Hey there, young lady. Why nyot try one?  
  
**Akino：**  
\"Taiyaki\"...?  
What is that?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Miss Akino, have you never eaten taiyaki before?  
  
**Akino：**  
No, this is my first time seeing it.  
Is it some sort of grilled fish?  
This shape is quite something.  
My interest is piqued. I'll have one, please.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myuch obliged!  
It's really hot, so make sure you don't burn your meowth. ♪  
  
**Akino：**  
Thank you.  
...Mmf.  
  
**Akino：**  
Hm?! Th-this is delicious!  
I never expected to find something that tastes so wonderful!  
  
**Akino：**  
I am, quite seriously, very impressed. Here, a token of my gratitude.  
Please take it.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hold on, that's over ten times the price of the taiyaki!  
Don't go wasting money on frivolous things like that!  
  
**Akino：**  
Frivolous?!  
Don't be silly. This \"taiyaki\" delicacy  
is more than worth this sum.  
Why, I have half a mind to buy out the whole...  
  
**Akino：**  
Yes, that's it! I'll buy out the whole stand!  
Excuse me, miss. How much would you be willing to part with this stand for?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Buy out the whole stand nyow?!  
Where did that come from?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Miss Akino, get a hold of yourself!  
Can't you see that you're bothering her?  
Come on, just pay what you owe for the taiyaki and let's be on our way!  
  
**Yukari：**  
She's right. We still have lots to do to get ready for the party as well.  
  
**Akino：**  
Fine, very well. I'll give up on the store for now,  
but I can guarantee I'll be back to purchase some more taiyaki!  
Until then, miss. Good day.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Sheesh. What was that all about, just nyow?  
  
**Narration：**  
A few days later.  
  
**Man：**  
...Th-thief!!  
Damn it! Fair or not, I earned those rupies!  
Hey, you lot! Get out there and find that crook!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myahahaha!  
Hey everybody, come and get it!  
  
**Boy：**  
Whoa! Money!  
Rupies raining from the sky!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
They came back again.  
Oh, I'm so grateful!  
Now I can pay for the medicine for my grandson.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Yep, doing good deeds is the cat's meow.  
As a peddler myself, I just can't let crooked businessmen pass on by.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyow if I can just make a discrete retreat,  
that'll be another fine day of rat-catching complete. ♪  
  
**Merchant 2：**  
Did you hear? That chivalrous thief struck again.  
As usual, they gave out all the money again before disappearing.  
  
**Merchant 1：**  
I feel for the guys who got robbed.  
Rumor has it the thief only steals money from dirty business dealings,  
but who knows, we could be next.  
  
**Merchant 1：**  
By the way, are you going to that party tomorrow?  
That big one the new guild is throwing.  
  
**Merchant 2：**  
I wouldn't miss it. The Guild Master is the heiress of House Wisteria,  
after all.  
 Rubbing elbows with some of the big names in her social scene  
could lead to some major business opportunities.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Akino? That name sounds familiar.  
Mya-ha! I remember nyow. She's the crazy taiyaki girl from the other day.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It was pretty fishy of her to try and buy out the whole stand...  
And  
nyow she's hosting a get-together for a bunch of myerchants and socialites,  
too. Those types always make their money doing shady stuff.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
*sniff, sniff* I smell a rat at work.  
I'd better go see for myself!  
  
**Narration：**  
The day of the party.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Such a fancy party.  
Time to go find that Akino girl.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Mifuyu, apparently there's a suspicious man around back.  
Could you go take a look?  
I'm stuck here welcoming new arrivals.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Got it. Where's Miss Akino?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Inside speaking with the guests.  
Probably talking business, too.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Talking business...?  
  
**Akino：**  
Whew. I thought my jaw was going to fall off from all that talking.  
Yukari, Mifuyu.  
Prepare yourselves, because our first job begins from this very moment!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
That's great, but we're in the middle of hosting a party here.  
Can we really just leave?  
  
**Akino：**  
The host doesn't have to be the star of the party.  
I'm sure the festivities will continue just fine without us here.  
More importantly, we must discuss our first job!  
  
**Akino：**  
Please divide up the money in the safe according to this list.  
I also need you to draw up the loan contracts.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Wait, what?! Wh-what're you planning to do with all these rupies?  
And... what's this about contracts?  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, I spoke with several people a moment ago  
and decided to offer them investments and loans.  
Our first order of business will be financing!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Financing?! Wow, you really don't do anything halfway, do you.  
True, our guild certainly has deep pockets, but still...  
  
**Yukari：**  
And here I thought we were going to start out small,  
just doing what it takes to get by.  
Like crafting and selling items.  
  
**Akino：**  
The thing is, we have to spend big to earn big.  
Otherwise, our guild will never grow.  
  
**Akino：**  
I thought I explained this the other day.  
Money is all we have at the moment.  
 And with that being the case,  
our only option is to make money by spending it. Am I wrong?  
  
**Akino：**  
We'll start out by lending money,  
and then use the interest to branch out into other areas.  
  
Well, you two, any objections?  
  
**Yukari：**  
...I must say, Miss Akino,  
you certainly aren't the naive little princess I thought you were.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Indeed. I have to admit, I'm pretty surprised, too.  
  
**Akino：**  
Ohohoho!  
Yes, heap all the praise on me you want!  
  
**Akino：**  
...  
Wait. You mean, both of you took me for an airhead?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyow then, the party's over,  
and the place is empty.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Lending money is the most shameless swindle of them all.  
I need to take a peek at those contracts.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
If they plan on robbing people blind with ridiculous interest rates,  
then I'll take every last rupie in this guildhouse!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hmm, the contracts should be somewhere around here.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Mya-ha!  
Okay, let's see what I've found.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Well... the ameownts are all too large, but these rates  
all look pretty normal.  
 These must be decoys,  
and then they keep the real contracts somewhere el-  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hold it right there.  
One false move, and you can say goodbye to your head.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Wh-when did they?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Th-this is bad.  
Gotta find a chance to slip away...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Mifuyu. It looks like she's going to make a break for it.  
I'll restrain her with a spell and save us the post-battle cleanup.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I-I can't move!  
But that shouldn't be...  
  
**Akino：**  
What's all this commotion? I thought the party had ended.  
Mifuyu. Yukari. What is the meaning of this?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
We had a break-in.  
But never fear, the cat burglar has been apprehended.  
  
**Akino：**  
A burglar, you say?  
Incredible! This is my first time seeing a burglar firsthand!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
This is my first time, too.  
My first time seeing someone happy to have a run-in with a thief.  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh!  
You... Aren't you the taiyaki peddler from the other day?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh my gosh, you're right. It really is her!  
  
**Akino：**  
But why would a seller of taiyaki stoop to thievery?  
With such scrumptious wares, surely you can't be hurting for sales.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'm nyot the problem here!  
I only came to teach you all a lesson  
for trying to prey on people with your loan shark rates.  
  
**Akino：**  
What on earth are you talking about?  
If we did that, we'd lose clients left and right.  
\"Solidarity with all but business rivals\"—that's my family's motto.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
You mean you aren't trying to rip people off?  
  
**Akino：**  
No, perish the thought.  On the honor of the Wisteria name,  
I swear that we do not engage in any unscrupulous practices.  
Such underhanded methods only ever lead to trifling sums.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hmm, I still don't buy it.  
I mean, who goes around saying they'll buy up a whole taiyaki stand?  
A dirty, swindling rat, that's who!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh that. Well, that's just because Miss Akino's sense of money is a bit skewed.  
  
**Akino：**  
I-it is not! If you came across food that delicious, wouldn't you want to  
buy out the business and sell it on an even grander scale?  
I would more  
than gladly open up shops selling your taiyaki all over the continent.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Wait, you're nyot serious, are you?  
That's why you wanted to buy the stand?  
  
**Yukari：**  
That's just the way Miss Akino is. She's not a bad person by any means.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myeah, seems like it. I give up.  
There's no denying that I committed criminyal trespassing,  
so you might as well turn me in.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
So you'll come quietly, eh?  
In that case, I'll go summon the knights—  
  
**Akino：**  
Come now, Mifuyu, no need to be hasty.  
My name is Akino Wisteria.  
 And what might yours be?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Tamaki.  
Wait a sec... No way! Wisteria,  
as in THE Wisterias, the biggest myerchant house on the continent?!  
  
**Akino：**  
So you know of us.  
I'm pleased to hear it.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
No wonder.  
That explains why all your contracts were for such ludicrous amounts.  
  
**Akino：**  
Miss Tamaki. Would you do me the honor of joining my guild?  
As it happens, I was just searching for one more capable individual.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
What?!  
That's a bit out of the blue!  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, your strong sense of justice impressed me!  
Furthermore, it would be such a shame  
if I could no longer eat the  
delectable taiyaki you make.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
All this because of taiyaki?  
She must really love it.  
That girl and her taiyaki.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...Sure, I'll be your cat's paw.  
But this has to be a \"you scratch my back, I scratch yours\" arrangement.  
You're gonna have to pay me well for my time.  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, worry not. You will be well compensated, And if I happen to  
find any scoundrels among those we do business with, I will tell  
you right away. We can also join you in \"disciplining\" them, if need be.  
  
**Akino：**  
After all, I, too, cannot abide those who make their fortunes  
preying on the weak.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I knew she was going to say something crazy again.  
But there's no use trying to stop her.  
 Have no fear.  
If it looks like things are going to get physical, I'll be right there with you.  
  
**Akino：**  
That's the spirit, Mifuyu! With a slayer of dragons by our side,  
we'll have nothing to fear!  
  
**Yukari：**  
And I'm a former holy knight,  
so I can handle a bit of rough stuff every so often, too.  
Not that I actually want to go out and fight, mind you.  
  
**Yukari：**  
But once Miss Akino says she's going to do something,  
there's no dissuading her, so I need to be ready for anything.  
*sigh* There go my dreams of living the easy life in the city.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
And here I thought the two of you were just her attendants.  
  
**Akino：**  
It would appear that Mifuyu and Yukari accept.  
Well, Miss Tamaki, how about it?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It's a deal.

**Narration：**  
A few days later.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Akino! I've got two pieces of good news for you!  
First, I've got a lead on a new business opportunity.  
  
**Akino：**  
My, that certainly sounds interesting.  
And what's the other report you had for me?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...I've sniffed out some rats running a dirty racket.  
  
**Akino：**  
Heheh, we certainly can't let that go unpunished.  
Everyone, head to the back room for a strategy meeting!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus two guild operations, one public, one not so public,  
went into action.
