# Mercurius Foundation Episode 2
Akino's sights are set on the farming business, though they quickly get caught up in a case of harassment from the competition. Agreeing not to rely on force, the team pools its strength to set the villainous farmers straight. 
  
## Subtitle: A Rural Request
  
**Narration：**  
The door to the guildhouse flies open with a bang  
as Tamaki comes rushing inside.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I've got a lead on a new business opportunity!  
  
**Akino：**  
Tamaki,  
thank you so much for your hard work.  
Please tell me more about this business opportunity of yours.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
So there's this farm that I used to help out at sometimes,  
and nyow the owner is looking to sell the place.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Operating a farm?  
I have to say, that's quite different from anything we've done before.  
  
**Yukari：**  
If we were to buy this farm,  
would there be any profit in it for us?  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, let's start by meeting the owner and hearing what they have to say.  
We can think through the details afterward.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I figured you'd say that, so I actually brought them with me!  
Hey, you can come in nyow!  
  
**Brother：**  
Hello.  
Pleased to meet you.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
These two own the farm.  
It used to be quite the moneymyaker,  
but they say it's run into some troubles of late.  
  
**Sister：**  
In the past we had plenty of workers, but we had no choice but to  
dismiss them all... And now we've reached the point  
where all we can do is let the farm go.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Their terms are that our guild takes ownership of the farm,  
and then we hire them on to myanage the place.  
  
**Akino：**  
If everything was running smoothly before,  
then it shouldn't be much of an issue to get the operation  
back in working order.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
And it's not like we'd be starting from scratch, either.  
Not having to spend much on facilities or staff is a real, big plus.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Yes, and having the original people that ran it on board  
balances out our lack of experience. This is a good opportunity.  
  
**Akino：**  
Then it's settled. The Mercurius Foundation  
will purchase your farm.  
Restoration will commence first thing tomorrow!  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day—  
  
**Akino：**  
Phew, I'm exhausted!  
No one mentioned there would be so much physical labor.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
It's not break time yet, Miss Akino!  
There's still plenty left to do, so don't stop now!  
Fixing the farm up was your idea, remember?  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, that was before I knew how strenuous it would be...  
I'm starting to regret the idea now.  
What a fool I was yesterday.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Come on, {player} here came to help out part-time,  
and look at him sweating away.  
You've got nothing to complain about, Miss Akino!  
  
**Akino：**  
Yes, well, I thought we might need a man to do some of  
the heavy lifting, which is why I reached out to Master {player}.  
And am I glad I did!  
  
**Akino：**  
So, Master {player}, if you don't mind taking over for me...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hang in there.  
**Choice: (2)**  Where should I start?  
`Tag 1`  
**Akino：**  
Thank you for your words of encouragement!  
I feel like I just might make it through this now—  
wait, what?!  
Please, you must help me!

`Tag 2`  
**Akino：**  
I knew I could count on you, Master {player}!  
Now, if you could step over here...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh no you don't!  
That's it, you're coming with me!  
  
**Akino：**  
N-now don't be hasty, Mifuyu!  
Master {player}! Please help me!!  
  
**Brutish Man 1：**  
Hey, what's all the ruckus?  
I thought all the workers here got the axe.  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh? Who might you be?  
  
**Brutish Man 2：**  
We're from the next farm over. Haven't y'all heard  
that bad things happen to anybody who works these fields?  
I suggest y'all keep that in mind.  
  
**Akino：**  
Bad things?  
What's that supposed to mean?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Rivalry against those in the same field, maybe?  
Either way, they seemed way too hostile.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Akino! Mifuyu!  
Are you okay, nyow?!  
Did they try anything funny?  
  
**Akino：**  
Tamaki, you seem so alarmed.  
Who were those men?  
  
**Brother：**  
Those thugs...  
They got a lot of nerve showing their faces around here!  
  
**Sister：**  
They ran a scam to take over the farm next door,  
and now it seems they want this one, too.  
They've come to harass us over and over again.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
This farm is famed for its horses.  
They've sold steeds to many merchants and knight orders.  
  
**Sister：**  
But lately we've had all sorts of trouble, like poison mixed  
in the horse feed, or sturdy fences that suddenly broke, allowing  
monsters to get into the farm and injure the horses.  
  
**Brother：**  
With everything next door, it didn't feel like simple bad luck.  
To top it off, we lost most of our clients as a result.  
That's why we felt we had to let the farm go.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It's gotta be them!  
We may not have any proof, but I know rats when I smell 'em!  
They need to be cleaned out of every last rupie they have!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Stop Tamaki.  
**Choice: (5)**  Agree with Tamaki.  
`Tag 4`  
**Tamaki：**  
Why're you stopping me?!  
Nyone of this bothers you, {player}?!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Tamaki：**  
That's the spirit, {player}!  
Myehehe, we'll hit 'em like a pair of rabid cats!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Akino：**  
Tamaki, please calm yourself.  
Depriving them of their money  
would only be a temporary setback.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
But why!  
I can't stand to see dirtballs like that go unpunished!  
  
**Akino：**  
Neither can I. That's why these scoundrels need to be chastened  
so thoroughly that they won't even think of misbehaving again.  
  
**Brutish Man 1：**  
Dammit! What the hell?  
Someone bought all the feed in town...  
  
**Brutish Man 2：**  
If we can't keep the animals fed,  
they'll get antsy and start actin' up!  
  
**Brutish Man 2：**  
I thought we had it made, what with those losers  
at the other farm  
 ready to give up...  
What gives?!  
  
**Brutish Man 1：**  
Stop yer worryin'.  
Once we sic our pet monsters on 'em again,  
that farm'll be toast.  
  
**Brutish Man 2：**  
Then all we gotta do is sweep in and take the place over,  
and then all the land and livestock around here  
will be ours!  
  
**Akino：**  
...How enlightening.  
It appears you really were the culprits.  
  
**Brutish Man 1：**  
What the?!  
When did you all—?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Stealth is the best friend of a chivalrous thief!  
And nyow you've let the cat out of the bag!  
Time to teach you a lesson!  
  
**Brutish Man 2：**  
D-dammit! ...There's no other choice!  
Go on you beasts, tear 'em apart!  
  
**Monster：**  
Grrrghhh!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myonsters?!  
Look out!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Psh, they can't be too bad if humans can domesticate them.  
Here, I'll show you!  
  
**Monster：**  
Graaarghhh!  
  
**Brutish Man 1：**  
Wha... She got all of 'em in one go?!  
Who... who are you lot?!  
  
**Akino：**  
Come now, surely you recognize me.  
  
**Brutish Man 2：**  
Why the hell would we?!  
  
**Akino：**  
W-what?!  
Very well then, everyone!  
You may beat these men to a pulp at your leisure!  
  
**Yukari：**  
When she puts it like that,  
we kind of sound like the bad guys...  
  
**Akino：**  
Now then, face the iron hammer of justice!  
  
**Brutish Men：**  
Gyaaagh!!  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, we're certainly in quite the pickle now...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Who knew that catching those bozos  
would turn into us having to run their farm?  
  
**Yukari：**  
What're we going to do?  
Our workload just more than doubled!  
  
**Akino：**  
Once thing's for certain—we won't be able to do it all ourselves.  
We'll let the two of you manage both of the farms.  
  
**Sister：**  
Whoa!  
Are you sure?  
  
**Akino：**  
No one will bother you now,  
and I certainly don't mind,  
as long as you keep the profits flowing.  
  
**Akino：**  
And amateurs like us would be more hindrance than help.  
Let's rehire all of your previous workers.  
Do you think that would allow you to continue operations?  
  
**Brother：**  
Of course. Thank you so much!  
Truly, we can't thank you enough!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Don't you worry about it!  
This is just how we do business. ♪  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I just never thought we'd end up cracking criminal skulls  
while doing it.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Seriously...  
I'm going to need a drink when we get back to town.  
  
**Akino：**  
Now then, everyone, we must begin searching  
for our next venture! Back to the city we go!  
  
**Narration：**  
The business-fueled growth of the Mercurius Foundation  
showed no signs of stopping.
