**Rino：**  
Urghhh... Ughhhh...?  
  
**Rino：**  
So, umm... what monsters live on Mt. Ural?  
There's Harpies, Balloon Birds... and, ummm...?  
S... Sig...? Sig... something?  
  
**Rino：**  
Gahh, it was \"Simurgh\"...  
Urgh... I just can't remember all these monster names!  
  
**Rino：**  
Whoa... Ahhh!  
You scared me!  
  
**Rino：**  
Wait... Big Bro?!  
Fancy seeing you here!  
  
**Rino：**  
Honestly, don't sneak up from behind me like that!  
I was so surprised, my head almost jumped out of my chest!  
  
**Rino：**  
Urgh... Our guildmaster keeps telling me  
I shouldn't get in contact with Big Bro...  
But this time he's the one who talked to me, so it's fine, right?  
  
**Rino：**  
Even so...  
It's a real shame, but I should avoid talking to him *too* much...  
  
**Rino：**  
Ummm...  
Did you want something, Big Bro?  
  
**Rino：**  
I was just doing a bit of studying...  
I need to concentrate,  
so I might not be able to help you right now.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Studying? How admirable.  
**Choice: (2)**  What's \"studying\"?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rino：**  
Huh?!  
No no no, it's nothing to be proud of!  
  
**Rino：**  
I'm just cramming like crazy 'cause I have a test coming up!  
If I had decent study habits,  
I wouldn't have to panic like this at the last minute!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Rino：**  
Hmm? You're not saying...  
You actually don't know what \"studying\" even means?  
  
**Rino：**  
You've never had to study before?  
Talk about a life of paradise!  
I'm kind of jealous!  
  
**Rino：**  
But I guess you did lose your memories, huh?  
That makes a lot of sense, then...  
  
**Rino：**  
So, um... This thing called \"studying\"  
is an enemy of all mankind, more awful than any monster!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rino：**  
Ahaha...  
Look, the thing is...  
  
**Rino：**  
I'm kind of hoping to get a place  
at a school for aspiring fashion designers here in Landosol.  
'Cause you know, I love sewing!  
  
**Rino：**  
It's not an easy school to get into, but my family doesn't  
have a lot of money...  
 So I'm hoping to do well on the  
entrance exam, so I can get in on a scholarship!  
  
**Rino：**  
That's right—they grant scholarship money to their brightest  
new students!  
 But since studying, uh, isn't my strong suit,  
it'll be an opal crime just to pass the test in the first place...  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh?  
It's an \"uphill climb\", not an opal crime?  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh...  
So, well, that's why  
 I'm doing my best to study.  
  
**Rino：**  
I'm just so hopeless at learning new words...  
It's driving me crazy!  
 I'm pretty confident about the  
practical exam,  
 but then there's a written test...  
  
**Rino：**  
I can't concentrate at home,  
so I've been taking my study books outside,  
wandering here and there...  
  
**Rino：**  
And, well, studying like crazy.  
There's only a week left, so I'm starting to panic.  
  
**Rino：**  
I don't suppose you could teach...  
No, of course that's impossible.  
You don't even have your memories...  
  
**Rino：**  
I could do with someone to tutor me, though...  
Maybe I should ask Big Sis Shizuru?  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahahah!  
Actually, you'd like someone to teach you, huh?  
  
**Rino：**  
With your memories gone, there must be so much  
you don't know. That's gotta be tough...  
  
I'd be happy to teach you anything I can!  
  
**Rino：**  
It'd be encouraging for me too, to have a study buddy.  
Keeping tabs on each other to avoid slacking off, and stuff!  
So, um... shall we try studying together?  
  
**Rino：**  
You know, when we were kids...  
I remember we'd always sit together and study.  
It really takes me back... Eheheh!  
  
**Rino：**  
Ah...!  
Wh-when I say \"we\", I don't mean me and you!  
That was like, a different big bro? Ummm... Ahhh...  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh? Why is it that I call you Big Bro, anyway...?  
That... might take a while to explain... I-I just feel like it!  
Don't think too hard about that part! C'mon, let's study!  
  
**Rino：**  
So, um, listen.  
Right now I'm learning the names of monsters,  
and where they live.  
  
**Rino：**  
Lots of clothes are made from monster hides, you know!  
So we need to know where to find them all!  
  
**Rino：**  
Which is why the exam includes a section testing  
all sorts of monster-related knowledge...  
  
**Rino：**  
Living in the city, we don't run into monsters all that much,  
but it can't hurt to know this stuff, can it?  
  
**Rino：**  
I've been trying to learn them with mnemonics and stuff,  
but it's harder than you'd think...  
  
**Rino：**  
There are over a hundred types of Gellatina alone!  
It makes me want to go out and exterminate the lot of them!  
  
**Rino：**  
Of course, that's not actually possible in reality...  
So even though it's tough, I need to memorize them all.  
In the end, you've just gotta learn this stuff bit by bit.  
  
**Rino：**  
Long ago... I remember my big bro telling me that.  
And ever since, I've been trying to follow his advice!  
Even if it doesn't always go so well.
