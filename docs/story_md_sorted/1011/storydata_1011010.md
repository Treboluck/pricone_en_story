**Narration：**  
Today, {player} and Rino are exploring monster territory  
in search of valuable materials.  
  
**Rino：**  
I just wanted a break from my studies,  
but we ended up on quite the trek, huh.  
It seemed a lot closer when I was looking at the map...  
  
**Rino：**  
We had to go around the whole mountain...  
No wonder nobody usually comes here!  
Sorry for dragging you along on this, Big Bro.  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, but  
 that means the stuff here'll be extra rare!  
\"Every cloud's full of golden geese,\" was it?  
Point is, let's try to turn this effort into profit!  
  
**Monster：**  
...  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, I spy a monster over there!  
Thanks to the twisty terrain, we can attack from a safe distance...  
Okay, I'll try to snipe it, so you just keep a lookout while I do!  
  
**Rino：**  
Here I go!  
Yahhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Rino：**  
A perfect shot!  
Now that's what I call easy picklings!  
Let's try to keep up the pace!  
  
**Rino：**  
Take this!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Rino：**  
Heheheh... This is going well!  
Now, for our next target...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  How about that one?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rino：**  
That one...? Oh, wow!  
A beastie in the sky? I didn't notice it at all!  
Nice job spotting it at this distance!  
  
**Monster：**  
SKREEEEEEE!  
  
**Rino：**  
That monster looks like...  
Ahhhh! I know I remember seeing its name before  
on the list I was studying, but it's just not coming to me!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Could it be \"Ziz\"?  
**Choice: (3)**  Could it be \"Fizz\"?  
`Tag 2`  
**Rino：**  
That's right! It's a Ziz!  
You know your stuff, Big Bro!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Rino：**  
Did its name really sound quite that bubbly?  
Ummm, hold on...  
 I know! It was \"Ziz\"!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Rino：**  
Now I remember!  
Ziz down is light and strong. It's a really rare, valuable material!  
Oh, but, um...  
  
**Rino：**  
The Ziz itself is strong too,  
so it's really not recommended to take it on willy-nilly.  
I guess we'd be better off just staying hidden.  
  
**Rino：**  
Let's go behind those rocks to make sure it doesn't spot us!  
It'll be a little cramped, though.  
  
**Rino：**  
You OK, Big Bro?  
You've gotta stay as quiet as a louse...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Your hair is tickling me.  
`Tag 5`  
**Rino：**  
Oh, Big Bro! Just try to bear it.  
If you move now, it'll spot us...  
  
**Rino：**  
That's it. Breathe nice and softly. Just like that...  
Now if we stay like this...  
Uwehh... B-Big Bro...!  
  
**Rino：**  
Your, um, breath is... kind of... G-gotta bear it...  
Ahh... H-hold on a minute...  
It's blowing right onto my ears...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Something wrong?  
`Tag 6`  
**Rino：**  
Awawawahhh!  
 Aghhh! I'm so sorry!  
  
**Monster：**  
SKREEEEEEE!  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh no, it's spotted us!  
Wh-wh-what do we do now?!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Just gotta stand and fight!  
`Tag 7`  
**Rino：**  
Y-you're right!  
At this point, it's do or dye!  
Wait, Big Bro? Where are you off to?  
  
**Rino：**  
Don't tell me you're gonna play the decoy...?  
Th-that's too dangerous!  
  
**Rino：**  
W-wait a minute!  
Big Bro, stoooop!  
  
**Monster：**  
SKREEEEEEE!  
  
**Rino：**  
Wahhh! Here it comes!  
Th-there's nothing else for it now... I-I'll take it down!  
  
**Rino：**  
Yaaahhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
SKRUOOOGHHH!  
  
**Rino：**  
W-we did it...?  
I think we really drove it away...!  
  
**Rino：**  
Wait, forget that. Big Bro!  
Are you OK?  
 Y-you're not hurt, right?  
Any bumps or scratches?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  I'm fine.  
`Tag 8`  
**Rino：**  
Urghh... You're all beat up...  
What were you thinking?! What if something'd happened to you?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh? What about me?  
Well, I was just aiming from a distance, so I'm not hurt...  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Thank goodness you're OK.  
`Tag 9`  
**Rino：**  
That's not the problem here!  
That Ziz monster really was super strong...  
I was worried about you, OK?!  
  
**Rino：**  
I mean, it was my fault we both got spotted,  
but if we'd at least stuck together,  
I could've stopped you from taking so much damage...!  
  
**Rino：**  
But you just leapt out all on your own...  
Why did you do such a reckless thing?!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  It's a brother's duty to protect his little sister.  
`Tag 10`  
**Rino：**  
...! Well, that's...  
Th-that's not what we're talking about right now!  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahhh... I want to stop him from putting himself in so much danger,  
so I have to give him a good telling-off...  
  
**Rino：**  
But hearing him say that  
 makes me so happy...  
How am I supposed to argue properly?  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, whatever!  
I guess it's a good thing you're not injured, at least...  
But your clothes are kind of ruined.  
  
**Rino：**  
OK! Hand those clothes over to me.  
I'll sew them up right here!  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh. This is my job as a little sister!  
No arguing—just take them all off! Go on!  
  
**Rino：**  
Looking up close,  
 your clothes are actually pretty big, huh.  
You protected me with with those broad shoulders...  
 Eheheh.  
  
**Rino：**  
Wait, huh? What is it now, Big Bro?  
Oh, those are... feathers from the Ziz?  
I see! We may not have defeated it, but it dropped some in the battle!  
  
**Rino：**  
Wha—?! They're for me...?  
Are you sure I should have them?  
You're the one who went through all the trouble...  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, all right.  
Then I'll use them to fix up your clothes for you.  
Now they'll be even stronger, so you won't get hurt again.  
  
**Rino：**  
Thank you so much, Big Bro.  
Well then, I think it's time we headed home!  
  
**Narration：**  
So Rino and {player} set off back to Landosol  
in higher spirits than they had left with.
