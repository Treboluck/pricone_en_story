**Rino：**  
Heeeey! Big Bro!  
Fancy seeing you here! What are the evens?!  
  
**Rino：**  
How's it going?  
Rino here, always full of energy!  
  
**Rino：**  
What are you doing in a place like this, Big Bro?  
Out for another stroll?  
  
**Rino：**  
I see... There've been reports that this cave's layout has  
shifted around, so you were asked to investigate?  
You do take on some funny jobs! What a buzzy bee!  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahhh... The layout of the cave suddenly changing...  
That couldn't be our guildmaster's fault, could it?  
  
**Rino：**  
She does have that \"object manipulation\" ability  
that lets her change the terrain itself...  
  
**Rino：**  
And actually, I think I remember her talking about  
building a new hideout around these parts...  
  
**Rino：**  
Could she have shifted the ground to make room,  
and that's what changed the cave's layout?  
  
**Rino：**  
...Hm?  
What am I doing in a cave like this, you ask?  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, well, you know me! I'm looking for more materials  
for my sewing!  
 Remember the other day you helped me  
get my hands on that plant with the unique color?  
  
**Rino：**  
Well, it wasn't easy, but I managed to brew up the dye I  
wanted!  
 Now all I need is some cloth to use it on.  
So that's what I've been trying to collect lately!  
  
**Rino：**  
In theory, I could always just buy cheap cloth at a store...  
But it's even better value if I manage to gather everything  
for myself, right?  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheh! It's an investment in my future!  
I'll train my skills and make a gorgeous outfit for free!  
Call me Rino the Economical! I'll make a great wife someday!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You sure will.  
**Choice: (2)**  And your studies? What about those?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rino：**  
Heheh, you've got an eye for quality!  
You can marry me yourself if you like!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Rino：**  
Urghh...  
Um, I... I'm doing plenty of that... too...?  
  
**Rino：**  
I can't afford to fail that entrance exam again!  
So I'm staying up late studying every night!  
  
**Rino：**  
This is like... a bit of a break from the stresses of studying...?  
I mean, it is a fashion school that I'm trying to get into.  
There are practical exams too!  
  
**Rino：**  
So, ummm... I can't just focus on written studies all day!  
Making actual outfits, and gathering materials for them...  
They're all important parts of my studies!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rino：**  
Anyway... Big Bro, you're not actually all that strong,  
so you shouldn't be exploring gloomy caves on your own!  
There are some pretty dangerous monsters in here, you know?  
  
**Rino：**  
Tell you what—I'll be your bodyguard!  
And in return... it would be great if you could help me  
search for the materials I'm trying to find!  
  
**Rino：**  
You know what they say about friends in need and centipedes!  
You with me?  
All righty then! Let's go!  
  
**Rino：**  
So, ah, let's see.  
What I'm actually looking for is a spider monster.  
  
**Rino：**  
It's supposed to live somewhere in this cave,  
and it spins rainbow-colored silk.  
Apparently, it's absolutely perfect for making outfits!  
  
**Rino：**  
The silk is rainbow-colored because it absorbs the pigments  
from all the prey the spider has eaten.  
In other words, it's incredibly easy to dye!  
  
**Rino：**  
So it's the perfect material to make the most of the dye  
I just whipped up!  
 Even if you don't re-dye it, its natural  
colors are beautiful too, so it goes with almost any outfit!  
  
**Rino：**  
I really want to get my hands on it!  
 Oh, but... this spider  
monster is supposed to be really strong. So I'm hoping to  
retrieve the silk without the monster noticing...  
 ...Big Bro?  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh?  
Big Bro! You've vanished!  
  
**Rino：**  
Where the heck did you go?!  
Don't leave me all on my own in here!  
That's too cruel, Big Bro!  
  
**Rino：**  
...Is that a voice coming from above me?  
It sounds like... B-  
Big Bro?  
  
**Rino：**  
Why are you up there?  
Whoa! There's a great big spider hanging from the ceiling!  
  
**Rino：**  
Big Bro's been wrapped up in its web,  
and it looks like he's about to be gobbled up head-first!  
Talk about dire states!  
  
**Rino：**  
I-I'll get you outta there!  
Hang on and don't move!  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahhh... I can't shoot the spider with Big Bro in the way!  
Wait... is the spider using him as a hostage?  
That's one smart monster!  
  
**Rino：**  
Wh-wh-what now?!  
I can't shoot the spider without shooting Big Bro,  
but if I don't shoot, he's gonna be gobbled right up!  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh? Big Bro is... pointing at the ceiling with his head?  
What's that gesture supposed to mean, Big Bro?!  
I don't get it!  
  
**Rino：**  
Ah...  
The area the spider's hanging from  
is all wobbly and covered in cracks?  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, right!  
When the structure of the cave was changed,  
it must've made the rock overhead unstable!  
  
**Rino：**  
The spider itself is too strong for me to defeat in a single shot,  
but if I aim for the ceiling instead...  
  
**Rino：**  
The fall might knock it out for the count,  
or even better, it could get buried in the rubble!  
  
**Rino：**  
It'll send Big Bro tumbling to his doom as well,  
but I'll just have to catch him myself!  
  
**Rino：**  
All right, got it, Big Bro!  
Here goes nothing... Hyahhh!  
Please don't miss!  
  
**Rino：**  
Nice! A perfect shot!  
Eheh... I know how to perform under pressure! ☆  
  
**Rino：**  
The ceiling's collapsing, and down comes the spider!  
Looks like its web got totally ruined and it had to run?  
Now, if I can just catch Big Bro... Hup!  
  
**Rino：**  
Owww! I-I guess trying to catch him in midair  
was a bit of a big ask for my poor little arms...  
H-he bowled me right over!  
  
**Rino：**  
Are you all right, Big Bro?  
Eheheh... Thank goodness you're OK!  
  
**Rino：**  
S-sorry, um, could you move a little?  
You're kind of weighing me down here, so I can't get up!  
Ahh, you're still tied up in the web, so you can't move either?  
  
**Rino：**  
Mnhhh... I brought these spools for the silk!  
Here, let me wind it up right now!  
 Hang in there a minute.  
I'll get you free and get my prize in one fell sweep!  
  
**Rino：**  
What's that? Thanks for saving you?  
Oh no, I'm the one who should be thanking you!  
  
**Rino：**  
For as long as I can remember,  
you've brought me nothing but wonderful treasures!
