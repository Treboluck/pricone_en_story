**Rino：**  
...Mmm...?  
Wait... What kind of situation is this?  
  
**Rino：**  
Was I... asleep?  
Out here in public? That's so careless of me!  
It's like I've thrown caution to the wings!  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh yeah...  
I finally finished making the apron I'd been working on,  
so I came to deliver it to our guildmaster...  
  
**Rino：**  
I gave it to her and she really liked it, so I was relieved...  
My tension evaporated, and since I'd stayed up all night  
to finish it, I was pretty exhausted too...  
  
**Rino：**  
So I sat down on a bench in the park to rest for a moment...  
and I guess I fell asleep right there.  
  
**Rino：**  
Silly me... I need to be more careful.  
I hear the streets of Landosol are less safe lately.  
If I wanted to sleep, I should've at least gone home first...  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahhh, but... I'm still so sleepy...  
I really used up all my energy last night.  
  
**Rino：**  
But I did manage to make a wonderful apron...  
This sense of achievement is just the best feeling! Mmmmm!  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahhh, it would be so great...  
to doze off into this happy haze for just a little longer...  
  
**Rino：**  
...Hmm?  
What's this? Is somebody patting me on the head?  
  
**Rino：**  
And something feels kind of warm...?  
  

---  
  
**Rino：**  
...H-huh?  
What the heck?  
Big Bro...?  
  
**Rino：**  
Wh-wh-wh-why are you resting my head on your lap?  
I mean, it's very nice of you, but out here in public?!  
Like we're a pair of shameless lovebirds?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Uwehh...? You saw me totally passed out on this bench,  
and I looked uncomfortable, so you put my head on your lap?  
Well, it's true that I slept like a happy log as a result, but...!  
  
**Rino：**  
I won't pretend I don't appreciate it,  
but you could have just woken me up, you know?!  
Th-this is so embarrassing!  
  
**Rino：**  
I-I'll get up now!  
I'm sorry for putting you through all that trouble, Big Bro!  
  
**Rino：**  
Whoaaa?! Ahh, I'm still half-asleep, so I tripped right over...  
And fell... right back into your lap!  
 What's the deal with  
that lap of yours?! Is it some kind of black hole?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Urghh... You really don't mind, so I can sleep a little longer?  
Well, I won't deny that's a pretty tempting offer...  
I really am tired through and through. Ahahah...  
  
**Rino：**  
Hmm?  
You find it comforting too, having me lying there?  
  
**Rino：**  
...Of course you do. You used to do this a lot back when  
we were kids. Your memories may be gone, but your body  
still remembers.  
 That actually makes me kind of happy.  
  
**Rino：**  
That's right. I'm sure you don't remember right now,  
but when we were both little, I used to ask you to comfort me  
like this all the time, you know?  
  
**Rino：**  
My mother was a picture book author, and at the time,  
one of her books had just become a big hit...  
  
**Rino：**  
She was so busy working on the sequel,  
she had to leave me with a nice boy who lived nearby.  
  
**Rino：**  
To start with, I hated having to be apart from my mom...  
I think I even took it out on you.  
I seem to remember refusing to talk to you for a while.  
  
**Rino：**  
But you just kept smiling and tried to get through to me.  
I was such a crybaby back then, I started crying over such  
little things, but you did your best to comfort me...  
  
**Rino：**  
I could barely speak through the tears, but you listened  
patiently... Until in the end, I calmed down,  
and somehow you started to seem almost like family.  
  
**Rino：**  
That's why I've called you  
 \"Big Bro,\" you know,  
ever since those childhood days.  
  
**Rino：**  
After that day, I started visiting your house all the time.  
I was so eager just to talk to you about the most pointless  
little things.  
  
**Rino：**  
You might not believe this,  
but I was actually pretty shy before I met you.  
  
**Rino：**  
But somehow when you listened to anything I said with a smile,  
it kind of encouraged me...  
  
**Rino：**  
And as you can see,  
I grew up into the most terrible chatterbox!  
Ahahah! ☆  
  
**Rino：**  
...I'm really so grateful. Thanks to this outgoing personality  
you gave me, I've made more friends than I can count.  
You're the one who opened my world up and made it shine.  
  
**Rino：**  
Lately, Big Bro, maybe because of your memory loss,  
you're less talkative than you used to be.  
But someday, I'd love to chat together like we did back then!  
  
**Rino：**  
So I'm going to keep on talking to you.  
 Maybe if I shower you  
in enough words, you'll absorb them, take them in,  
and recover your old talkative ways! Wouldn't that be great?  
  
**Rino：**  
So I'll tell you about all the most pointless things!  
It's okay if you only respond every now and again.  
You just listen, and take in everything I have to say.  
  
**Rino：**  
That's more than enough  
to make me feel like it's all worthwhile.  
  
**Rino：**  
Because of my parents' work, I ended up having to move  
out of the city... And when I finally made it back,  
it was like you were a totally different person.  
  
**Rino：**  
At first, it felt like my whole world had gone dark.  
But in the end, you're still the same old you!  
  
**Rino：**  
The same guy who'd see me sleeping out in the open,  
and offer his lap as a pillow without a second thought.  
  
**Rino：**  
That's the Big Bro I know and love!  
So just being able to talk like this again makes me happy!  
I wanted you to know that.  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahahah... That's a pretty blank look on your face.  
I'm sorry I'm still such a doofus who can't talk sense.  
But even then, you still hear me out to the very end!  
  
**Rino：**  
Oopsie. It's getting pretty late, so I should really get going.  
You should probably head home yourself, Big Bro.  
Thank you again for being there for me today!  
  
**Rino：**  
Let's hang out sometime!  
No... Let's talk until the cows go home, Big Bro!
