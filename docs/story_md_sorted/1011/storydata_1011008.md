# Rino Episode 8
{player} dreams of another world. In the dream, Rino is studying to get into the same high school as him. Rino asks him for a kiss for good luck, but he refuses, so she asks for one as a reward when she passes the exam instead.

**Rino：**  
Ahhh...  
A tasty meal after a job well done is the best!  
  
**Rino：**  
I've gotta say, right now...  
I'm feeling more alive than ever, Big Bro!  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh...  
I finally got all the materials  
I need for our guildmaster's apro—  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahhh, I mean,  
 the outfit I was trying to make this whole time!  
  
**Rino：**  
It's all thanks to the help you gave me, Big Bro!  
  
**Rino：**  
Yup, yup!  
All's well that ends at the bottom of a well!  
  
**Rino：**  
Still, that spider at the end was a real challenge...  
It really put us through our braces!  
  
**Rino：**  
Big Bro, you didn't get hurt, did you?  
I can do basic first aid if you need it!  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh...  
Lately it feels like I've been picking up  
more survival skills and marksmanship than I'll ever need.  
  
**Rino：**  
I'm ready to cling stubbornly to life  
 in the cruelest  
of environments!  
  
**Rino：**  
Although if I manage to get into the school I'm aiming for,  
the plan is to become a pro fashion designer...  
  
**Rino：**  
So I'm not sure I'll have much use  
for these combat skills and stuff...  
  
**Rino：**  
But they'll be helpful when gathering materials!  
Experience is the mother's cottage...  
 The mother of knowledge?  
That's what they say, right?  
  
**Rino：**  
So I'm sure it won't all be for nothing!  
You agree, right, Big Bro?  
  
**Rino：**  
And it's not just about me.  
All this time we spent together...  
  
**Rino：**  
I'm hoping it hasn't been a waste of your time...  
That it's had some sort of value for you too!  
  
**Rino：**  
Even if someday you end up forgetting everything...  
  
**Rino：**  
I'm sure deep down, in the bottom of your soul,  
you'll hang on to something valuable from all this!  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh...  
Sorry, sorry,  
 I'm talking weird nonsense again!  
  
**Rino：**  
I think I really must be tired...  
Do you mind if I order a dessert too?  
  
**Rino：**  
Whoa...?!  
Big Bro, you're suddenly glowing again!  
  
**Rino：**  
It really does come out of nowhere...  
My heart almost jumped out of my mouth!

**Rino：**  
Big Bro! Over here!  
  
**Rino：**  
Sheesh, look how late you are!  
I guess some things never change, huh?  
  
**Rino：**  
Though since I went and finished all my cake  
before you even arrived...  
I guess I never change either! ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
But c'mon, the cakes here are just too good!  
  
**Rino：**  
Go ahead and order whatever you want too!  
It's my treat today!  
  
**Rino：**  
I came here for a break from cramming for exams,  
but also to thank you for helping me study all the time!  
  
**Rino：**  
So whatever cakes you want, I'll buy them for you!  
  
**Rino：**  
And I'll order more for me too!  
Which one should I choose, I wonder~?! ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
It'll be my seventh one, so let's see what my stomach thinks...  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh? That's too many?  
Don't be silly!  
  
**Rino：**  
The first six were just hors d'oeuvres!  
The main dish is yet to come!  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh... I've been working my brain hard on all that studying!  
So I can handle a whole mountain of sweet treats!  
  
**Rino：**  
In fact, I *need* plenty of sugar to refresh my brain!

**Rino：**  
Huh?  
Which school am I trying to get into?  
Did I not tell you that yet?  
  
**Rino：**  
Hmmm...  
Actually, it's kind of embarrassing,  
so I'll keep it a secret for now!  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh...  
Now I think about it,  
 it kind of feels like  
we're on a date right now, doesn't it?  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh? I'm not trying to change the subject!  
I was just honestly appreciating our precious time together!  
  
**Rino：**  
Whoa-oa-oa?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Urghh...  
I totally lost my balance, and the contents of my bag  
went everywhere...  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh—no, no!  
I'm not hurt or anything!  
  
**Rino：**  
You were pretty quick  
to reach out and catch me, after all...!  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, you don't need to help pick all this stuff up!  
I'll do it myself!  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahhh...  
Well. I guess you saw it now.  
  
**Rino：**  
Yes...  
Those are practice tests for the metropolitan entrance exams...  
  
**Rino：**  
The only metropolitan school around here is  
Tsubakigaoka High, so...  
I guess you know where I'm trying to get into now.  
  
**Rino：**  
That's right.  
It's the same school that you go to.  
  
**Rino：**  
Bahh...  
I was hoping to tell you when I got in,  
and give you a nice surprise!  
  
**Rino：**  
And with my grades, it's a toss-up whether I'll pass...  
I'm still not exactly confident.  
  
**Rino：**  
So I thought it'd be lame if I told you but then  
crashed and burned...  
  
**Rino：**  
...Eheheh...  
Hey, Big Bro...  
  
**Rino：**  
If you want to share your school life with little old Rino...  
Would you give me a \"good luck charm\" so I'll pass?  
  
**Rino：**  
All my life,  
 you've been my biggest source of good luck!  
  
**Rino：**  
So if you do this \"charm\" for me,  
I feel like I'll be able to do just about anything!  
  
**Rino：**  
So, please... Big Bro...  
Mmmm... ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh?  
I mean the \"good luck kiss from your favorite guy\" charm!  
It's all the rage right now!  
  
**Rino：**  
I read in a magazine that it works every time!  
So hurry up and do it, Big Bro!  
  
**Rino：**  
Bah...  
I thought if I rushed you into it,  
you might give it a try without thinking...  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh well, too bad. I'll give up this time.  
  
**Rino：**  
Instead...  
If I pass the exam,  
you can do the \"charm\" for me as a reward!  
  
**Rino：**  
It's a promise, OK, Big Bro?  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh!  
You just wait! I'm gonna study like my life depends on it! ☆

**Ameth：**  
Hmmm...  
She's more forward than I thought, that Rino.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I guess she's not happy to stay your \"little sister\" forever  
after all.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Huh?  
Don't give me that blank look...  
  
**Ameth：**  
You're just too oblivious.  
Can't you figure out why Rino would want to go to  
the same school as you?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ehhh?  
She even asked for a kiss from her \"favorite guy\"!  
How much more obvious can you get?!  
  
**Ameth：**  
And besides, that kiss was a \"charm to help her pass,\" right?  
  
**Ameth：**  
So why does she still want one as a reward afterwards?!  
She's not even trying to hide it!  
  
**Ameth：**  
At least try to figure these things out for yourself!  
Honestly...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, whatever.  
You made her a promise now,  
so I hope you'll make good on it if she does pass.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You're the \"perfect big brother\" who she looks up to  
more than anything in the world, aren't you?  
  
**Ameth：**  
If you break your promise, it'll hurt her feelings!  
So good luck, \"Big Bro\"!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, that's all from me.  
Bye-bye now! See you around!

**Rino：**  
Big Bro?  
The food you ordered has arrived!  
Aren't you gonna eat it?  
  
**Rino：**  
Me...? I'm already stuffed to bursting!  
Maybe if it was just sweet stuff,  
I'd be able to keep on eating forever!  
  
**Rino：**  
...Although, after all the exercise I've gotten lately  
collecting all those materials...  
I do need to eat plenty of calories.  
  
**Rino：**  
I certainly wouldn't want to get sick on exam day!  
*munch munch*  
  
**Rino：**  
Yep, all that material gathering  
was my way of taking my mind off studying!  
  
**Rino：**  
But I don't want to fail the entrance exam again,  
so I'm studying hard too!  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh?  
If I pass, you need to give me... a kiss?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh? Huh?!  
What are you saying all of a sudden?!  
A k-k-k-kiss?!  
  
**Rino：**  
We're just, like, brother and sister, aren't we?!  
  
**Rino：**  
I mean, we're not related by blood,  
so maybe there aren't any moral or legal problems, but...!  
I-isn't it a bit soon for that?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Awww man... You came out with that so suddenly,  
you made me panic!  
  
**Rino：**  
I think everything I've studied so far  
almost flew clean out of my head!  
  
**Rino：**  
If I fail the next entrance exam after this,  
it's all your fault, Big Bro!  
And I'll never let you forget it!  
  
**Rino：**  
...A kiss, huh...  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh.  
Somehow, I'm feeling extra motivated now!  
I guess I'd better go study hard, Big Bro!
