**Majimun：**  
...!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Something feels different about it now.  
Watch out. It might throw a curveball at us.  
Hm? It's just splitting up again.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Pure numbers won't do you any good.  
Doesn't matter how many there are...  
Wait. Gimme a break!  
Just how many are there?! Talk about overkill!  
  
**Kaori：**  
One, two, three, four...  
Wow. My head's getting all spinny.  
  
**Makoto：**  
No one asked you to seriously count them.  
  
**Maho：**  
It doesn't matter.  
They can increase in number as much as they like, but we won't lose.  
  
**Maho：**  
Arthur, Lancelot, Gawain.  
You'll be payin' dearly for what you did to them!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Man, she's seriously pissed.  
  
**Kaori：**  
She's super scary when she gets angry.  
  
**Maho：**  
Makoto, Kaori.  
Give each and every one of them a li'l punishment!  
  
**Makoto & Kaori：**  
G-got it!
