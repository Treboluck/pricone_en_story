The party ventures into a fishing village in search of the plushies. They come across a visibly frightened villager, who explains that a Majimun has appeared. What's more, said Majimun took on the appearance of a plushie.
  
## Subtitle: A Name from a Far-off Land
  
**Narration：**  
The crew find themselves searching all  
over the beach for Maho's missing plushies.  
  
**Kaori：**  
I checked from end to end,  
but they're definitely not here!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Our other belongings are fine, so it's hard to believe anyone stole them.  
Especially when you consider just how many there were.  
It'd be way too obvious.  
  
**Makoto：**  
You'd have a better chance convincing me  
that they just up and went off somewhere on their own.  
  
**Maho：**  
On their own...?  
Did they... did they all come to hate me?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Makoto!  
  
**Makoto：**  
S-sorry! That didn't come out the way I meant it to!  
Look. There's no way they'd hate you when you always treat them so well.  
  
**Maho：**  
No, it's fine.  
If they left on their own, then they'll be back at some point.  
  
**Maho：**  
More importantly, let's have ourselves some lunch.  
It'd be a real waste to spend our time off worrying now, wouldn't it?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Maho...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Princess...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's go find them.  
`Tag 1`  
**Maho：**  
My prince...  
But...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oh, come to think of it, I saw a fishing village while I was out swimming!  
We might find some clues there!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I know for a fact that Kasumi would suggest we  
ask around town if she were here.  
  
**Maho：**  
Makoto, Kaori...  
Are y'all really all right with this?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Why wouldn't we search for lost comrades?  
`Tag 2`  
**Maho：**  
Thank you.  
Thank you so much, everyone...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Don't sweat it. We gotta fill our stomachs up first, though.  
Sandwiches are quick and easy to eat,  
so let's munch on some before we get to work.  
  
**Kaori：**  
I *am* super hungry, now that you mention it!  
First up, we feast!  
Then it's investigation time! ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh.  
You wouldn't think there'd be a fishing village around here.  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's pretty bustling, too.  
Is there a festival going on?  
Leave the dancing to me if there is! ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
This ain't the sort of sound I'd associate with a festival.  
I've got an awful bad feeling about this...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh, let's ask that guy over there!  
Hey! You got a minute?  
  
**Villager：**  
Eeek?!  
O-oh, it's just normal folk.  
Don't scare me like that.  
  
**Makoto：**  
What was that about?  
Do I really seem that threatening?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Nah, not at all.  
Don't sweat it. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Apologies for approachin' ya out of the blue like that.  
We were just wonderin', did somethin' happen here?  
Seems like there's a mighty big commotion goin' on.  
  
**Villager：**  
...appeared.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh? What was that?  
  
**Villager：**  
A Majimun appeared!  
  
**Maho：**  
A Majimun? Never heard of that before.  
Is it an animal of some sort?  
  
**Kaori：**  
No...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You've heard of it?  
`Tag 3`  
**Kaori：**  
I have.  
Never expected to hear a word from my homeland here.  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh, it's from your homeland?  
That would explain the strange ring to it.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Look who's talking.  
So what's the deal with this Majimun thing, anyway?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Majimun has a special meaning back home.  
  
**Kaori：**  
\"Evil spirit.\"  
It's kind of like a type of yokai.  
  
**Villager：**  
Huh. Didn't expect you to know that.  
This village was originally formed by people who moved  
from a country on the other side of the ocean.  
  
**Villager：**  
Apparently the term Majimun  
originated from there.  
  
**Kaori：**  
That's gotta be my homeland!  
Never thought I'd hear anyone talk about it here,  
so I'm kind of happy. ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Happy?!  
We're talking about e-evil spirits and yokai here!  
Which means...  
  
**Villager：**  
Yeah.  
The Majimun appeared not too long ago.  
It got a number of the villagers, too.  
  
**Makoto：**  
It *got* them?!  
What's that supposed to mean?!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Majimun are said to steal people's souls.  
There's a bunch of legends, but the most famous one is that  
they'll steal your soul if they pass under your groin.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Th-they steal souls?  
  
**Villager：**  
The victim won't pass away after that,  
but they're left in a sort of lethargic state, completely unable  
to move.  
Today's victims fit that bill.  
  
**Maho：**  
That certainly sounds like  
their soul's have been stolen.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hm? What's up, Makoto?  
Where's that usual stride in your walk?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Wh-what're you talking about? I always walk like this!  
Yup, perfectly normal!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You're scared, aren't you?  
**Choice: (5)**  You're a lot cuter than usual.  
`Tag 4`  
**Makoto：**  
Wh-what?! As if!  
You think I'd be scared of some dumb legend?!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Makoto：**  
Hold up.  
Is that your way of saying I'm usually not cute?!  
Err, not that I want to be cute or anything.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Makoto：**  
Anyway! I ain't scared!  
Hm? What's up, {player}?  
Why're you kneeling dow—  
Whoa?!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ohh! Nothing'll be able to pass under her if she's on your shoulders.  
You're so smart, {player}! ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Wow. Call me mighty jealous.  
Mind if I ask ya to do the same for me, my prince? ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
That's way beyond the point here!  
Let me down already!  
I'll choke you out with my legs if you don't!  
  
**Villager：**  
You sure are a lively bunch.  
I've kind of calmed down thanks to you.  
  
**Maho：**  
Good to hear we could be of some help.  
I'm always so proud of  
how well our guild members get along.  
  
**Maho：**  
We sure have gotten off track, though.  
Would you mind if I ask what that Majimun looks like?  
  
**Maho：**  
We're a li'l bit busy ourselves,  
but it ain't Caon's style to ignore those in need.  
Any information you could give us would be great.  
  
**Villager：**  
Sure thing.  
I happened to catch a glimpse of it floating by.  
There's no mistaking it.  
  
**Villager：**  
It looked exactly like a plushie.
