Hah! Yah!  
Hiyaaahhh!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What're you doing?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaori：**  
Oh, {player}!  
Haitai!  
This? It's image training!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Majimun are related to my homeland,  
so I'm feeling all fired up!  
  
**Kaori：**  
How about you give it a shot, too?  
Don't worry. Just follow my lead!  
  
**Kaori：**  
First, you focus and create an image in your mind...  
  
**Kaori：**  
You can see a bunch of Majimun when you do that, right?  
All you gotta do after that is take them down!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Uh...  
`Tag 2`  
**Kaori：**  
Huh? You can't see them?  
You're not focusing enough. Create a stronger image!  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's too hard?  
Hm... Not much you can do about that, then!  
Just sit by and cheer me on!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Imagining that you're cheering me on just isn't enough, after all. ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Okay, here I go!
