**Majimun：**  
...!  
  
**Maho：**  
Something ain't right with the Majimun.  
It feels even more wicked than before.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Check it out, Princess.  
There's hitodama coming out from that pot!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Urgh...!  
My body feels all heavy!  
It's like I'm right at the bottom of the sea...  
  
**Maho：**  
Seems like those hitodama are the cause!  
They're inhibiting our strength!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'm kind of sweating it...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Man, even Kaori's feeling it.  
Looks like we're gonna need a different approach for this.  
  
**Maho：**  
We can't go all out,  
but we should still be able to manage it.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Yeah! It's all about guts and vigor!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Uh, I don't think that's what she meant.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Anyway,  
you're in for a shock if you think this is enough to take us down!  
I hope you're ready for a beating!
