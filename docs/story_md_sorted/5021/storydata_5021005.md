## Subtitle: Fulfilled Desires
  
**Narration：**  
The party reunite at the beach following their separate searches for Maho's plushies.  
  
**Kaori：**  
{player}, Makoto, welcome back.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yo.  
How'd things go on your end?  
  
**Kaori：**  
No luck here.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Dang...  
We managed to get two back at least,  
but we've still got a long road ahead of us.  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's gonna get dark soon, so let's spend the night here.  
I got us some firewood and stuff while we were out searching! ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Nice. That's some good thinking.  
Though wouldn't it be better if we stayed at the village?  
  
**Kaori：**  
These are Maho's orders.  
Always possible that the plushies'll come back.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Roger that.  
Camping out on the beach sounds like a good  
way to spend summer, at least.  
Where's the princess, though?  
I don't see her around here.  
  
**Kaori：**  
She said she wants to go look at the sea.  
She walked off that way with Arthur.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hm...  
Hopefully she's not upset.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hey, {player}  
Mind if I ask you a favor?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's up?  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll do it.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaori：**  
Could you go cheer Maho up?  
Losing something dear is a pretty painful experience.  
  
**Kaori：**  
If anyone can help alleviate that, it's you.  
I know that firsthand. ♪  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kaori：**  
Now that's {player} for you! ♪  
A real man knows the script with having to be told anything.  
I might just fall for you. ♪  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kaori：**  
I'll leave her in your capable hands!  
  
**Makoto：**  
We'll get the campsite set up in the meantime.  
The sun's about to set, so bring her back before then, okay?  
  
**Maho：**  
...  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh, my prince.  
Did you come to bring me back?  
  
**Maho：**  
Sorry about all this.  
I never meant to get you wrapped up in all this hassle.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  It's not a hassle at all.

**Maho：**  
Lancelot! Gawain!  
Thanks so much for bringing them back.  
  
**Maho：**  
...  
  
**Maho：**  
I ain't upset or anything, y'know.  
  
**Maho：**  
I've just been thinkin' real, real hard.  
  
**Maho：**  
Kaori said that benevolent spirits make their homes  
in objects that have been cherished, right?  
  
**Maho：**  
If that's the case, then maybe I didn't cherish them enough.  
  
**Maho：**  
I figured my feelings'd come across if I kept on talkin' to  
and takin' care of 'em...  
  
**Maho：**  
But I guess that wasn't enough.  
I never did anything that'd really make them feel loved.  
  
**Maho：**  
It makes sense, right?  
If I'd really cherished them, then they'd never be  
possessed by a Majimun.  
  
**Maho：**  
Everything I've done up until now was...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'd vouch for the opposite.

**Maho：**  
Huh?  
  
**Maho：**  
My prince?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Cheer her up.

**Maho：**  
It's strange.  
I got caught up my thoughts and felt awfully down, but...  
  
**Maho：**  
But when you pat my head like this,  
I can feel a nice breeze blow away all the nasty thoughts.  
  
**Maho：**  
The tight, suffocating pain in my chest  
turns into a warm, fluffy feeling.  
  
**Maho：**  
Thank you.  
  
**Maho：**  
I might be repeatin' myself here, but...  
  
**Maho：**  
You really are my darlin' prince.

The sunset's mighty pretty.  
  
**Maho：**  
It's a li'l bit sad watchin' it sink into the sea,  
but it's okay. I've got my prince right by my side. ♪

**Maho：**  
Well, well...  
I hardly expected things to get this lively.  
  
**Maho：**  
Looks like we're completely surrounded.  
  
**Maho：**  
One, two, three...  
No sense in countin', I guess.  
They've all come back.  
  
**Maho：**  
Everyone! Can you hear me?  
Don't be gettin' up to no good now, you hear?  
If my feelings've come across, then don't lose to the Majimun!

Princess!

Makoto! Kaori! I didn't think you'd come!  
  
**Makoto：**  
You were taking your time coming back, so we got a bit worried.  
Looks like we were right on time!  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's sure feeling like a festival around here! ♪  
Now I wanna dance! ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
You can dance all you want after we deal with these plushies!  
Here they come!

Makoto, Kaori...

Dinner's all ready and waiting for us!  
Let's get these fellas back and enjoy the rest of our vacation!

There's plenty more stuff I wanna do!

Let's do this, Princess!

Let's go, Maho!

I couldn't have asked  
for better comrades!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Let's go!

Yeah!
