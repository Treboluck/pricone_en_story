## Subtitle: Beckoned by Summer
  
**Narration：**  
It's the peak of summer.  
{player} is called out by Maho while in the middle of a walk,  
which leads him to Caon's guildhouse.  
  
**Maho：**  
Don't be moving now,  
my prince.  
  
**Makoto：**  
What're you up to, Princess?  
Sure looks like you're tying him up real good with that rope.  
  
**Maho：**  
That's an awful way to put it, Makoto.  
This is measurin' tape, not a rope.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Urgh...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ohh. Taking his measurements, are you?  
Which means you're making some new clothes.  
Dunno how you can bother when it's this hot.  
  
**Maho：**  
Aye, that's about the gist of it.  
Doesn't matter if it's hot or cold, though. This is just what I do.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Watch out, {player}.  
There's no denying she makes some great quality gear,  
but, well... expect frills. Lots of frills.  
  
**Maho：**  
Frilly clothes are mighty cute, after all.  
But Makoto here never ever wears them.  
She's such a meanie.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Urghhh...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Come on. You know that sort of stuff doesn't suit me...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Now I'm curious.  
`Tag 1`  
**Makoto：**  
What?!  
N-no way!  
I'm not...  
Oh! Ask Yui to wear some for you!  
  
**Maho：**  
Come now, Makoto. No need to be scared.  
He's real curious, ya know?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Stop instigating! And quit trying to strip me down, too!  
Hey, you! You better look away!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Urghhhhhh!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I wanna go to the beach!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Whoa?! You scared the life outta me!  
What's all the moaning and groaning about?!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I can't hold it in anymore!  
Look outside! The sun's shining nice and bright,  
but I'm stuck inside! It's such a waste!  
  
**Maho：**  
We've had an awful lot of indoor security work, too.  
Guess that's been a li'l bit stressful for you, hasn't it?  
  
**Kaori：**  
I wanna swim as far as I can!  
I wanna run along the beach!  
I wanna dance anywhere and everywhere!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Uh, I'm pretty sure you've been getting your fill of that last one.  
  
**Maho：**  
Well, if it's the beach you want,  
it's the beach you get.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Huh?  
  
**Maho：**  
Truth is, I figured y'all would be feeling some burnout,  
so I planned on taking us all on a li'l trip.  
  
**Makoto：**  
For real? Dang, Princess.  
You sure know how to come out with a great surprise!  
  
**Kaori：**  
You're the best, Maho!  
  
**Maho：**  
It's not just us, either.  
The little ones oughtta get out now and then as well.  
  
**Makoto：**  
The little ones?  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus it was decided that Caon would go to the beach, fulfilling Kaori's desire.
