**???：**  
Oh!  
I see you have awoken, my lord.  
  
**???：**  
I am your guide,  
sent by the ineffable Lady Ameth.  
You may call me Kokkoro.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I hope that we can get along.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
To protect my lord from morning till night,  
from the cradle to the grave, is my sworn duty and calling  
as your attendant.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Do not hesitate to ask me for anything, my lord.

**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm, you seem a little taken aback.  
Ahh... I apologize if this seems intrusive, but...  
Perhaps you could tell me your name?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see.  
So, you are called {player}.  
Wonderful. That is indeed the name of the lord I was sent to serve.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I apologize for doubting your identity, even for a moment.  
If you are displeased, you may punish me as you see fit.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Whip me or stone me as you will;  
I have no reason to object.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
According to the divine message Lady Ameth revealed to me,  
you have apparently lost most of your memories...  
So it is little wonder that you are confused.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But I will show you the way forward,  
so worry not.  
  
**???：**  
Hungry...  
So... hungry...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, yes! I was prepared for this!  
It is lunchtime, after all!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I assumed that once you awoke,  
you would require immediate sustenance,  
so I was just preparing some rice!  
  
**???：**  
Yaaaay, steaming hot rice!  
Thank you so much, thank you so much!  
I was so hungry I thought I might die!  
  
**???：**  
Is this all for me?! Don't mind if I do! ☆  
*munch munch munch...*  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh... Who might this young lady be?  
  
**???：**  
*munch munch munch...*  
Wowww, this is good!  
That hit the spot!  
 Food really is the source of all life! ☆  
  
**???：**  
Whew, I'm totally stuffed!  
Still, talk about perfect timing!  
  
**???：**  
Feeding a total stranger without a moment's hesitation...  
You're such good, honest folk!  
I won't forget this debt, as long as I live! Thanks!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Um, I'm fairly sure you were the one who just helped yourself...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh... All the rice I painstakingly prepared for my lord...  
Wh-who exactly are you, anyway?  
  
**???：**  
Oh, I'm...  
No, before we get to that.  
Is that girl over there a friend of yours?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Um, which girl would that be?  
  
**???：**  
Aahhhh! Heeeeelp!  
Monsters! So many monsters! They're chasing me!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, my... This seems to be quite the little situation.  
A young lady I have never met is being attacked by a horde of monsters.  
Wh-what should we do, my lord?  
  
**???：**  
They're almost on top of us, and we can't just do nothing!  
I'll go sort them out in a jiffy, so you two hide somewhere safe!  
I'm coming, random girl!  
  
**???：**  
H-huh? Who are you?  
You're going to help me?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmmm. That horde of monsters is rather large.  
Perhaps we should assist.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I can take this opportunity to teach you how to fight, after all!
