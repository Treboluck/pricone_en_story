# Prologue: Part 2
Awoken from a long slumber, you are greeted by Kokkoro, who calls herself your \"guide.\" Together with a hungry girl known as Pecorine and a kind young healer named Yui, you soon find yourself fighting a pack of monsters that are attacking a girl who has collapsed in the woods.
  
**???：**  
Thank you so much!  
I thought it was all over...  
If you hadn't arrived, I would've been eaten!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Think nothing of it. You're safe, and that is what matters.  
Why were you being chased by so many monsters, anyway?  
  
**???：**  
Oh, actually,  
I think it's probably me they were after.  
  
**???：**  
This girl must have just wandered by  
and got caught in the crossfire...  
I'm so sorry for all the trouble!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You brought them...?  
Um, I'm not quite sure I follow.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In the first place, can we clear up who exactly you are?  
We have yet to so much as learn your name...  
  
**???：**  
Oh, I haven't introduced myself either, have I?  
My name is Yui.  
Thank you again for all your help!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah—yes, of course. You may call me Kokkoro.  
And this fellow is {player}.  
  
**Yui：**  
Um... We haven't met somewhere before, have we?  
  
**???：**  
Hey, guys!  
Come over here a sec! I found something!  
  
**???：**  
It looks like someone's collapsed on the ground!  
One of you was using healing magic back there, right?  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh!  
 Healing magic is my specialty!  
Someone's collapsed, you say? U-umm...

**???：**  
...  
  
**Yui：**  
Whatever could have happened to this girl?  
Did she get mixed up with the monsters like I did?  
She doesn't seem injured, but she's completely passed out!  
  
**???：**  
I'll leave the healing to you, OK?  
I'll go take care of the straggling monsters still lurking around!  
You guys get that sleepyhead to safety in the meantime!

**Kokkoro：**  
Saying that is all well and good,  
but with all these monsters about, we can't go much of anywhere...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss, ehm...  
I'll just call you the perpetually peckish "Pecorine" for now...  
Allow us to assist you until we escape this crisis.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh? "Pecorine?" You mean me?  
I've never had a nickname like that before! It's crazy cute!  
Don't worry, though, I can wipe out a few monsters like this in no time!  
  
**Yui：**  
No, I can't just let you fight on your own!  
Helping out is the least I can do!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Shall we join them in battle then, my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I must apologize.  
Our first meeting has been rather more eventful than I expected,  
but I hope we can work on that going forward.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This is only the beginning of our very own story!
