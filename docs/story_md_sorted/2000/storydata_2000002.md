# Prologue: Part 2
Awoken from a long slumber, you are greeted by Kokkoro, who calls herself your \"guide.\" Together with a hungry girl known as Pecorine and a kind young healer named Yui, you soon find yourself fighting a pack of monsters that are attacking a girl who has collapsed in the woods.

### Place: ???
  
**???：**  
Good morning, sleepyhead.  
  
**???：**  
Sorry, sorry, did I wake you up?  
You can rest a little longer. I need to focus on this work anyway...  
I don't really have time for you right now.  
  
**???：**  
Hmm? Oh, I suppose you're wondering who I am.  
After everything we've been through together, too...  
It's a little depressing to think that for you, this is our first meeting.  
  
**???：**  
I'm... Well, you can call me Ameth.  
That's what everyone calls me lately.  
No need to remember it, though—you'll forget soon enough anyway.  
  
**Ameth：**  
After all...  
This is little more than a dream.  
  
**Ameth：**  
As you can probably tell, I'm pretty damaged right now.  
I can't do much until I finish fixing myself up.  
Can't affect the real world at all.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Which is why...  
I've prepared a sort of replacement.  
A guide who'll take care of you in my stead.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Someone to point you in the right direction, when your life gets complicated.  
You can ask her for the details.  
  
**Ameth：**  
...Oh dear.  
I'm afraid it seems we're out of time.  
I would have liked to talk a little longer, but ah well.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Reality can be cruel like that.  
I suppose you can't laze about dreaming forever.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, see you around.  
Here's hoping your life, your reality, turns out to be a happy one.  
  
**???：**  
…  
  
**???：**  
First you simmer~♪Then boil up hot~♪  
Keep that rice snug in the pot~♪

**???：**  
Oh!  
I see you have awoken, my lord.  
  
**???：**  
I am your guide,  
sent by the ineffable Lady Ameth.  
You may call me Kokkoro.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I hope that we can get along.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
To protect my lord from morning till night,  
from the cradle to the grave, is my sworn duty and calling  
as your attendant.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Do not hesitate to ask me for anything, my lord.

**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm, you seem a little taken aback.  
Ahh... I apologize if this seems intrusive, but...  
Perhaps you could tell me your name?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see.  
So, you are called {player}.  
Wonderful. That is indeed the name of the lord I was sent to serve.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I apologize for doubting your identity, even for a moment.  
If you are displeased, you may punish me as you see fit.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Whip me or stone me as you will;  
I have no reason to object.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
According to the divine message Lady Ameth revealed to me,  
you have apparently lost most of your memories...  
So it is little wonder that you are confused.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But I will show you the way forward,  
so worry not.  
  
**???：**  
Hungry...  
So... hungry...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, yes! I was prepared for this!  
It is lunchtime, after all!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I assumed that once you awoke,  
you would require immediate sustenance,  
so I was just preparing some rice!  
  
**???：**  
Yaaaay, steaming hot rice!  
Thank you so much, thank you so much!  
I was so hungry I thought I might die!  
  
**???：**  
Is this all for me?! Don't mind if I do! ☆  
*munch munch munch...*  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh... Who might this young lady be?  
  
**???：**  
*munch munch munch...*  
Wowww, this is good!  
That hit the spot!  
 Food really is the source of all life! ☆  
  
**???：**  
Whew, I'm totally stuffed!  
Still, talk about perfect timing!  
  
**???：**  
Feeding a total stranger without a moment's hesitation...  
You're such good, honest folk!  
I won't forget this debt, as long as I live! Thanks!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Um, I'm fairly sure you were the one who just helped yourself...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh... All the rice I painstakingly prepared for my lord...  
Wh-who exactly are you, anyway?  
  
**???：**  
Oh, I'm...  
No, before we get to that.  
Is that girl over there a friend of yours?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Um, which girl would that be?  
  
**???：**  
Aahhhh! Heeeeelp!  
Monsters! So many monsters! They're chasing me!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, my... This seems to be quite the little situation.  
A young lady I have never met is being attacked by a horde of monsters.  
Wh-what should we do, my lord?  
  
**???：**  
They're almost on top of us, and we can't just do nothing!  
I'll go sort them out in a jiffy, so you two hide somewhere safe!  
I'm coming, random girl!  
  
**???：**  
H-huh? Who are you?  
You're going to help me?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmmm. That horde of monsters is rather large.  
Perhaps we should assist.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I can take this opportunity to teach you how to fight, after all!  
  
**???：**  
Thank you so much!  
I thought it was all over...  
If you hadn't arrived, I would've been eaten!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Think nothing of it. You're safe, and that is what matters.  
Why were you being chased by so many monsters, anyway?  
  
**???：**  
Oh, actually,  
I think it's probably me they were after.  
  
**???：**  
This girl must have just wandered by  
and got caught in the crossfire...  
I'm so sorry for all the trouble!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You brought them...?  
Um, I'm not quite sure I follow.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In the first place, can we clear up who exactly you are?  
We have yet to so much as learn your name...  
  
**???：**  
Oh, I haven't introduced myself either, have I?  
My name is Yui.  
Thank you again for all your help!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah—yes, of course. You may call me Kokkoro.  
And this fellow is {player}.  
  
**Yui：**  
Um... We haven't met somewhere before, have we?  
  
**???：**  
Hey, guys!  
Come over here a sec! I found something!  
  
**???：**  
It looks like someone's collapsed on the ground!  
One of you was using healing magic back there, right?  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh!  
 Healing magic is my specialty!  
Someone's collapsed, you say? U-umm...

**???：**  
...  
  
**Yui：**  
Whatever could have happened to this girl?  
Did she get mixed up with the monsters like I did?  
She doesn't seem injured, but she's completely passed out!  
  
**???：**  
I'll leave the healing to you, OK?  
I'll go take care of the straggling monsters still lurking around!  
You guys get that sleepyhead to safety in the meantime!

**Kokkoro：**  
Saying that is all well and good,  
but with all these monsters about, we can't go much of anywhere...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss, ehm...  
I'll just call you the perpetually peckish "Pecorine" for now...  
Allow us to assist you until we escape this crisis.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh? "Pecorine?" You mean me?  
I've never had a nickname like that before! It's crazy cute!  
Don't worry, though, I can wipe out a few monsters like this in no time!  
  
**Yui：**  
No, I can't just let you fight on your own!  
Helping out is the least I can do!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Shall we join them in battle then, my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I must apologize.  
Our first meeting has been rather more eventful than I expected,  
but I hope we can work on that going forward.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This is only the beginning of our very own story!
