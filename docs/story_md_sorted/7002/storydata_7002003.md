**Akari：**  
Whoa! It's spurting out everywhere!  
  
**Akari：**  
Look, sis! When we defeated that last monster,  
a flood of little gems came out.  
 And they're bursting with magic!  
  
**Yori：**  
You're right...  
All this energy might be a big help for our guildmaster!  
  
**Akari：**  
That's what I thought! Let's gather them all up!  
Eheh... I hope she gets her full powers back soon,  
so she can grant our wishes for us!  
  
**Yori：**  
...  
  
**Yori：**  
When Illya's magic comes back,  
and she uses her vampire powers to fix my shyness...  
Maybe then I'll finally be able to tell you how I really feel.  
  
**Yori：**  
I wish I had the courage to do it myself...  
But I just don't feel confident enough...  
  
**Akari：**  
Oh, I can't wait for Illya to be restored!  
She's gonna make me the cutest girl in the whole world!  
  
**Yori：**  
Honestly, Akari...  
I can't believe you'd wish for such a silly little thing.  
  
**Akari：**  
If I'm the world's cutest girl,  
that should make my twin sister just as cute, right?!  
Maybe then you'll be confident enough to get over your shyness!  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh?! Where'd that come from all of a sudden?!  
  
**Akari：**  
Huh?  
 It's not sudden at all.  
It's what I've been hoping for all along!  
  
**Yori：**  
Akari...!  
  
**Yori：**  
She really does come out with the craziest things...  
I never knew she felt that way...  
  
**Yori：**  
Thank you, Akari.  
For both our sakes... I've got to overcome this hurdle...!
