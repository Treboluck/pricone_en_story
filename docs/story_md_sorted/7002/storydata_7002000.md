**Akari：**  
Ooh, it's so biiiig! ♪  
This is my first time doing anything like this!  
  
**Yori：**  
The Tower of Luna, huh... It sure does look impressive.  
  
**Yori：**  
So... This place holds the key to your memories, does it?  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh? \"Probably\"?  
Sheesh, that doesn't exactly inspire confidence!  
  
**Yori：**  
Wait, what am I saying?!  
That was the perfect time to say \"Leave this to us!\"  
  
**Yori：**  
Oh, I'm such an idiot...  
We might be able to find his lost memories here.  
This is my chance to finally repay him for all the attention he's given me!  
  
**Yori：**  
Urgh... Why can I never seem to say these things properly...?  
  
**Akari：**  
...  
  
**Akari：**  
Hee hee.  
 Looks like Yori is really trying to do her best!  
  
**Akari：**  
I hope this adventure lets her convey her feelings  
and thank him properly like she's always wanted to!  
  
**Akari：**  
All right! Let's do our best today, {player}, Yori!  
I'm sure it'll be a really stimulating experience! ♪
