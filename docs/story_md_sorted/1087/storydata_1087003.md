# Hiyori (New Year) Episode 3
Hiyori and {player} come across a lost child and a brutish-looking man. They end up helping out at a stall run by one of Hiyori's acquaintances, which in turn leads to the child reuniting with his mother and the man receiving a job offer. Needless to say, Hiyori is more than satisfied with the results.

**Narration：**  
With the grab bag now in their hands,  
Hiyori and {player} talk about what's in it.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
All that's left is this and this, I think?  
Yup!  
That's it all organized.  
Wow though, that really was a bargain and a half!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
There's still some left, so I'll give them to people we know around town.  
Yui and Rei, too.  
And you, of course!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are you sure you want to give so much away?  
`Tag 1`  
**Hiyori：**  
No problem!  
Apparently each year's winner does this anyway.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
And there's plenty of stuff I don't have any use for.  
Might as well give those to people that do, right?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hm?  
What's going on over there?  
  
**Boorish Man：**  
Outta the way, slowpoke!  
I'mma beat your ass if you don't move faster!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
What's up with him?  
  
**Man 1：**  
Ohhh, right. He's a delinquent that lives around here.  
Security's pretty tight during this time of the year,  
so he's probably annoyed that he can't get up to anything.  
  
**Man 2：**  
Try not to get involved with him, you hear?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Okay!  
He kind of looks like he's trying to get himself hurt, though.  
Maybe there's something on his mind?  
  
**Lost Child：**  
Mama? Where are you?  
  
**Lost Child：**  
Oh.  
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to—  
  
**Boorish Man：**  
Tch. Scram, kid!  
You're getting in everyone's way!  
  
**Lost Child：**  
*sob* Waaahhh!  
Mama! I'm scared!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Uh oh. He made him cry.  
Hey, Mr. Knight.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's go help out.  
`Tag 2`  
**Hiyori：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Boorish Man：**  
Ugh.  
Why do crying kids gotta be so annoying?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey! If you've got the time to bother people,  
then give us a hand and help the kid out!  
Okay?  
  
**Boorish Man：**  
The hell? Don't just start bossing—  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Come on, come on!  
He's gonna cry even more if you don't!  
  
**Boorish Man：**  
L-let go of me!  
What's with you two?! Seriously, let me go!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey, are you okay? What's wrong?  
Did you get separated from your mommy?  
  
**Lost Child：**  
U-um... I...  
  
**Boorish Man：**  
Spit it out already!  
  
**Lost Child：**  
Eeek! I'm scared!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey there! Be nicer to him!  
  
**Boorish Man：**  
Urgh..! W-why is this chick so strong?!  
Hey. Wh-what's wrong?  
  
**Lost Child：**  
*sob, hic*  
I dunno where my mama is...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Well that's not good.  
Don't worry, though. We'll help you find he—  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Oh, Hiyori!  
There you are!  
Mind if I ask you a favor?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey there! How come you're not running the takoyaki stall?  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
I kinda ran out of ingredients, you see,  
so now I gotta run out to buy more.  
Sorry, but could you take care of the stall while I'm gone?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
No problem!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Can you do me a favor in return, then?  
It'd help if you told everyone we've got a lost boy here.  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
That so? Sure thing. I've got stock being  
kept warm in the back, so sell those if anyone  
comes by.  I'll be back as quick as I can!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Right then! Guess we've got a job to do!  
Let's all work together!  
  
**Boorish Man：**  
What?! Y-you're including me here?!  
I ain't about that! Just let me go already!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
We're all in it together, my friend!  
So let's bring some customers in!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
The more people that come,  
the more chances we have of finding his mom!  
  
**Lost Child：**  
*sob* Takoyaki...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Sure looks delicious, doesn't it?  
But let's hold off until he gets back.  
Think you can do that for me?  
  
**Lost Child：**  
Okay...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Atta boy! We can have some together,  
so let's use that as motivation to work!  
Woo! ♪  
  
**Lost Child：**  
*sniff* Woo...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Welcome, welcome!  
If it's takoyaki you're looking for, we've got it!  
  
**Lost Child：**  
W-welcome...  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Wow! That looks and smells good!  
Oh! Hello, Hiyori! I take it you're helping  
someone out again?  
Talk about a hard worker!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Not at all.  
Also, um. This boy here's lost,  
so I'm trying to find his mom while taking care of the store.  
You didn't happen to see anyone looking for their child, did you?  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Hm...  
I didn't, no,  
but I'll ask around for you!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Hello, Hiyori.  
I heard you talking about a lost child.  
Is there anything I can do to help?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Thank you!  
We're in the middle of looking for his mom!  
  
**Boorish Man：**  
...What's with them?  
They only just met the kid. Why are they so...  
  
**Narration：**  
The four of them continue to look after the store until the owner returns.  
  
**Narration：**  
As they're doing so,  
{player} notices something important.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Mr. Knight?  
What's wrong?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  We're running out of takoyaki.  
`Tag 3`  
**Hiyori：**  
You're right! I got ahead of myself and sold too many too quick!  
We've only got one, two... Five boxes left!  
They'll sell out in no time!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Wh-what should we do? The owner's nowhere to be seen...  
We're gonna have to make some ourselves!  
  
**Boorish Man：**  
*sigh* Fine, fine. Whatever.  
  
**Lost Child：**  
*sniff*  
What are you doing?  
  
**Boorish Man：**  
Use your eyes, kid. I'm gonna make some more.  
  
Those two'll be useless, but I've got experience from one of my old jobs.  
  
**Lost Child：**  
I'll help too.  
  
**Boorish Man：**  
Uh, sure.  
...  
Make some boxes out of that paper and line them up over there.  
Think you can do that for me?  
  
**Lost Child：**  
Okay.  
...  
Sorry for bumping into you earlier.  
  
**Boorish Man：**  
...No problem, squirt.  
But less talking, more working.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hehe. That's a relief.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Not only do we have more takoyaki,  
but those two seem like they're getting along now.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Looks like it'll be all right.  
`Tag 4`  
**Hiyori：**  
Yup!  
Which means we should get back to attracting customers!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Excuse me!  
Are any of you looking for a lost boy?  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Hiyori! I think I found his mom!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, you're back!  
  
**Boy's Mother：**  
Um, excuse me!  
Is my son really here?!  
  
**Lost Child：**  
Oh! Mama!  
  
**Boy's Mother：**  
Oh, thank goodness you're okay!  
You have no idea how worried I was!  
  
**Lost Child：**  
I'm sorry...  
  
**Lost Child：**  
Thanks so,  
so much!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I'm glad you managed to find her!  
  
**Lost Child：**  
Yeah!  
Thank you as well, mister!  
  
**Boorish Man：**  
Hmph...  
You stayed strong right at the end.  
Not bad, kid.  
  
**Lost Child：**  
Ehehe! Working with you was real fun!  
See you again! Bye-bye!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Bye-bye!  
...  
He sure took a liking to you, didn't he?  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
I'm surprised how many customers you brought in.  
Thanks a lot. You really saved my bacon!  
  
**Boorish Man：**  
Sh-shut it!  
I didn't even do any—  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
That's enough!  
You must be the person who's been causing issues around here recently.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
What's going on?  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
There's been several reports of someone trying to start fights  
ever since New Year's, so we came out on patrol. Lo and behold,  
the culprit's now being violent towards a young girl!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
No he's not!  
In fact, he just helped us reunite a lost child and his mom!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
What's more, he even made takoyaki while the owner was gone!  
I'm not lying!  
I swear!  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
It's as she says, sir.  
He helped both my store and that lost boy.  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
...Well. No one got hurt, nor is there proof of any scuffle taking place.  
Your behavior remains an issue, however.  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
Cause any more issues, and you'll be arrested on the spot.  
Now then. Allow us to take our leave.  
  
**Boorish Man：**  
Dammit.  
The kid's gone home, so I'mma scram too.  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Wait a minute!  
You made this takoyaki, didn't you?  
  
**Boorish Man：**  
Yeah. And so what?  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
It's delicious! I actually run a restaurant here, you see.  
And now I'm very keen on having you as part of the kitchen staff.  
How about it?  
  
**Boorish Man：**  
Y-you what?  
  
**Boorish Man：**  
...Well. If I feel like it, I guess.  
Catch you later.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
He might act like that,  
but I knew he wasn't bad at heart.  
No one is, after all.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I just hope today stays with him, though.  
Maybe that'll help him change, even if just a little.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'm sure it will.  
**Choice: (6)**  It probably will.  
`Tag 5`  
**Hiyori：**  
Yeah! Definitely!  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Hiyori：**  
Glad you agree!  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Hiyori：**  
I mean, just look at what happened today!  
Lots of stuff happened, and he helped make a difference!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That boy was able to find his mom,  
and the stall owner found someone to help with his restaurant!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
So yeah. He's needed, just like anyone else.  
Not only today, but from here on out as well!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I always go on about scratching each other's backs,  
but today really proved that! Right?  
  
**Narration：**  
Hiyori flashes a smile at {player}  
, happy to have witnessed a moment that allows someone to change for the better.
