## Subtitle: The Price of Freedom
  
**Narration：**  
Rei and {player} remain on the run,  
but the situation takes a turn for the worse  
upon their pursuers catching wind of their location.  
  
**Rei：**  
Another dead end!  
  
**Pursuer：**  
There's nowhere left to run, Lady Rei.  
Please come with us. I'm sure your father will forgive you.  
  
**Rei：**  
Absolutely not!  
Is it that wrong of me to desire my own freedom?!  
  
**Pursuer：**  
You're free to continue this charade.  
Let it be known that your friend may  
come into harm's way as a result, though.  
  
**Rei：**  
What?! But he has nothing to do with this!  
  
**Pursuer：**  
That's a difficult pill to swallow, my lady.  
The two of you have been fleeing together this entire time.  
  
**Pursuer：**  
And we're well aware that the two of you are quite close.  
  
**Pursuer：**  
Our mission is to bring you back safely, by any means necessary.  
Those are your father's orders.  
  
**Pursuer：**  
Now then.  
Please do come with us.  
  
**Rei：**  
...I guess this is as far as I go.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Is now really the time to give in?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rei：**  
We're out of options, though...  
And I wouldn't be able to live with myself if you came  
into harm's way because of me.  
  
**Rei：**  
Thanks for you sticking by me until now.  
But this is the end of the road.  
I refuse to get you involved in this any longer.  
  
**Rei：**  
If the price of freedom involves losing someone dear,  
then it's far too steep for me to pay.  
  
**Rei：**  
Fine!  
I'll cooperate, so don't you dare lay a hand on him!  
  
**Pursuer：**  
A wise decision.  
Do make your way over here, then.  
We'll have a carriage take you back home.  
  
**Rei：**  
Some dreams just weren't meant to be.  
  
**Rei：**  
But this is fine. You, Hiyori and Yui are too precious to me.  
I'm more than willing to betray myself if it ensures your safety...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  No! That's not a sacrifice worth making!  
`Tag 2`  
**Rei：**  
...!  
  
**Rei：**  
*sigh* You're a bit too good at this, you know.  
How am I supposed to remain steadfast  
if you pull a stunt like this?  
  
**Pursuer：**  
Get your hands off her!  
The rumors about you two may be true,  
but that doesn't mean we'll stand for this!  
  
**Pursuer：**  
Lady Rei, please.  
Only you can convince your darling out of this.  
  
**Rei：**  
Wha—?!  
H-he's not my darling...  
  
**Rei：**  
This is troublesome.  
They're making the same assumption as that noble from earlier.  
How am I going to explain this to Father?  
  
**Rei：**  
...Ohhh.  
If they're going to make assumptions,  
then I just need to pour extra fuel onto the fire.  
  
**Rei：**  
Hey.  
You've gone this far to stop me.  
Which means you're ready to do whatever it takes, right?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You bet I am.  
`Tag 3`  
**Rei：**  
Perfect.  
I'm going in,  
so don't move an inch!

**Rei：**  
Don't pull away.  
Just stay still for me. Please.  
  
**Pursuer：**  
Wha—?! L-Lady Rei!  
You can't just do that in public!  
  
**Rei：**  
We need to play up to those rumors.  
This is the best way to convince them that I've made my mind up.  
  
**Pursuer：**  
Don't look! I forbid you!  
Keep your eyes shut tight until I say so!  
  
**Pursuer：**  
U-understood!  
  
**Rei：**  
So far so good.  
Let's give them a good show.  
  
**Rei：**  
His face is so close...  
I can practically feel the warmth of his skin.  
  
**Rei：**  
I can't take my eyes off him, even if I wanted to.  
We're so close that I can feel his breath.  
  
**Rei：**  
This isn't a situation I ever would have imagined.  
Hehe. Who knew I could be so daring?  
  
**Rei：**  
If I had it my way, this wouldn't be just an act...  
Scratch that. Yui might get legit upset at me.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You smell nice.  
**Choice: (5)**  Sorry for being so sweaty.  
`Tag 4`  
**Rei：**  
I do? Really?  
I would have assumed the opposite,  
considering how much we've been running about.  
  
**Rei：**  
And now I feel a sudden urge to get away from you.  
But don't ask why. I'm begging you.  
  
**Rei：**  
That caught me off guard.  
But I guess I don't smell sweaty.  
Thank goodness.  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Rei：**  
That doesn't bother me in the slightest.  
This isn't exactly the time to be worrying about that, either.  
  
**Rei：**  
Besides... You don't smell bad at all.  
In fact, I'd say you smell nice.  
Sorry. Forget I said anything.  
  
**Rei：**  
What's gotten into me?  
I might be letting this situation influence me a bit too much.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Rei：**  
This should be long enough.  
I'll move away now.

`image display end`  
**Rei：**  
*exhale*  
Well?! It should be perfectly clear now!  
  
**Pursuer：**  
I can't believe my own eyes...  
  
**Rei：**  
Now get out of my sight!  
Tell my father that I already have  
someone I want to spend my life with!  
  
**Rei：**  
I will never, [[ever]] let him shape my own future!  
  
**Pursuer：**  
You have no idea what you've done, Lady Rei.  
And we can't take responsibility for what's to come.  
Retreat!  
  
**Pursuer：**  
Please excuse us,  
Lady Rei.  
  
**Rei：**  
Phew. That went well.  
  
**Rei：**  
Thanks for the help.  
Things should go back to normal now.  
At least, until my father issues another order.  
  
**Rei：**  
That said... It was a spur of the moment bluff in the end,  
but I'd never really considered the idea of  
having someone I want to spend the rest of my life with.  
  
**Rei：**  
A bold statement, if I do say so myself.  
Especially when no one knows what the future holds.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I know what it holds.  
`Tag 7`  
**Rei：**  
Huh? Really?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  You're going to have your wish granted, right?  
`Tag 8`  
**Rei：**  
Ah...  
Yeah. That's it.  
I couldn't have said it better myself.  
  
**Rei：**  
We all swore that we'd have our wish granted. Together.  
That's as good a reason as any to  
keep going on with a firm resolve.  
  
**Rei：**  
Thanks again. I mean it.  
You helped keep me on the path I want to be on.  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus Rei made a bold, brave step  
towards the future she had long envisioned.
