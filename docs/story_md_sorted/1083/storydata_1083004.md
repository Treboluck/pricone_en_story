# Misaki (Halloween) Episode 4
Misaki heads into town on Halloween during a dream, only to be surprised by how all the youngsters are celebrating it. Determined to prove she's a proper adult, she takes part in an apple bobbing contest. Though she succeeds, she's still treated like a child, much to her disdain.
  
## Subtitle: Tonight, I Become an Adult!
  
**Narration：**  
As the Halloween fever dies down and  
the city returns to normal, Misaki finds herself a little saddened.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Oh. Hey there, {player}.  
I haven't seen you since the Halloween party.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That party was a blast.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misaki：**  
Yup! It sure was!  
Ahem... Looking at it from a child's perspective, of course.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Ahhh.  
There's something sad about seeing the city  
go back to normal like this.  
  
**Misaki：**  
I hear adults talk about this feeling sometimes.  
What did they call it again...  
Ennui, I think?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Wait. Why are you glowing?!  
Enough with the tricks! Halloween's over already!  
  

---  
  
**Misaki：**  
The time has come! Off to town we go!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Why? Isn't it obvious?  
Because it's Halloween!  
Listen up.  
A real adult knows that  
Halloween's the day you go wild in town!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Or that's what they said on TV, anyway.  
Nevertheless! Today, I become an adult!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Mom sure pulled a fast one on me, though.  
Asking you to accompany me since it's dangerous by myself and all that.  
  
**Misaki：**  
But don't go acting like you're in charge of me or anything!  
I'd be just fine on my own!  
  
**Misaki：**  
But hey.  
You're here, so I'll let you take the lead!  
  
**Man：**  
Trick or treat! Cheers!  
  
**Woman：**  
I'll drink to that!  
Oh, hey! Let's take a pic!  
We'll get a bunch of likes!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Wow, they're *really* going wild.  
So this is how adults spend the night...  
  
**Woman：**  
Hey, look over there! Cutie spotted!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Huh?  
Wh-what's going o—  
  
**Woman：**  
Hey there! Has anyone ever told you how cute you are?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Y-you mean me?! Really?  
U-umm... Thank you...  
  
**Woman：**  
Wow, wow! She's all flustered! What a beaut!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Errr, ummm....  
  
**Misaki：**  
I-is this how adults have fun?  
It's kind of... intimidating.  
  
**Man：**  
Awww, give her a break  
You've got her cowering behind her big bro!  
  
**Woman：**  
Don't worry, we won't bite. Take a pic with us! ♪  
The whole world'll be screaming about how cute you are!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I, uhhh...  
I'd rather... Ummm...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Take her hand and run.  
`Tag 2`  
**Misaki：**  
Oh...  
  
**Woman：**  
Awww. Off she goes.  
  
**Misaki：**  
*sigh* What was all that about?  
  
**Misaki：**  
I-I wasn't scared or anything, by the way!  
Just a little taken aback!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Thanks, though...  
I appreciate it.  
  
**Misaki：**  
H-hey, look!  
The cosmetics store over there's running an event!  
Let's go check it out!  
  
**Female Staff：**  
Gather around, everyone! We're currently holding  
an apple bobbing contest! And anyone who succeeds will win  
themselves some Halloween-exclusive cosmetics!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Wow! That sounds fantastic!  
Maybe I should give it a shot...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Wait, you've never bobbed for apples?  
It's a staple of Halloween. You throw apples in a tub  
full of water, then try to pick them out with your teeth.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  That sounds pretty tough.  
**Choice: (4)**  I bet you can pull it off!  
`Tag 3`  
**Misaki：**  
Hmph.  
Only a kid couldn't do something that simple!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Misaki：**  
That goes without saying!  
So let's get to it!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Misaki：**  
Excuse me! I'd like to participate in the contest!  
  
**Female Staff：**  
Goodness, aren't you cute? ♪  
Give it your best now.  
  
**Man 2：**  
Hey, are you really gonna participate?  
From what I've seen, no one's been able to pull it off yet.  
There's no way a kid can break the streak.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Don't you dare treat me like a kid!  
Just watch. I'll do it and prove you wrong!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Okay. Let's do this!  
  
**Misaki：**  
*inhale* Hmph!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I'll get one on my first tr— Urgh!  
I forgot that the apples won't stay still  
when they're in the water!  
  
**Misaki：**  
But still! I'm a proper adult! A fine lady! This won't stop me!  
Hm? That apple's a little bit smaller...  
Jackpot!

**Misaki：**  
Phew! I did it! I got one!  
  
**Female Staff：**  
Wow! Congratulations!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Yoooooo! She did it!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Heh! They're all singing my praises!  
And no doubt ready to accept that I'm a proper adult, too.  
  
**Misaki：**  
I did go and prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt, after all!  
  
**Female Staff：**  
You did such a good job.  
I'm sure your parents would be proud.  
  
**Man 2：**  
Right? Seeing such a little kid give it her all is just,  
like, so inspiring!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hm. I'm just going to assume I misheard all that.  
Yup!  
And hey. Now I've got some exclusive cosmetics. ♪

**Female Staff：**  
Congratulations!  
These are for adults, though, so you should gift them  
to either your mom or your sister if you have one.  
  
**Misaki：**  
What?!  
No way!  
What was all that effort even for?!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Argh, I can't believe this!  
Someone turn me into an adult already!  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ahahaha! Poor thing, having that effort go to waste.  
She'll become an adult whether she likes it or not though,  
so there's no real need for her to rush it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
As for you, welcome back.  
That was a special little \"dream\" I conjured up for you.  
Did you like it?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Have to say though, young adults sure like  
to go wild on Halloween.  
No surprise that Misaki was so flustered.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Much as she wants to act otherwise, she's still a kid.  
So don't let her get hurt, okay?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Be a gentleman. Just like she wants you to be.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway. See you around. ♪

**Misaki：**  
Mmm...  
Huh? What happened to the Halloween cosmetics...?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Oh. I think I'm still half-asleep.  
What sort of fine lady sleeps in the middle of the street?  
Come on, you. Let's get up.  
  
**Misaki：**  
I get the feeling that I had a Halloween-related dream just now.  
Probably because this year's was so fun...  
  
**Misaki：**  
I'm a bit sad that it's over, but well...  
That's just more reason to make next year's even better.  
  
**Misaki：**  
{player}!  
I'll teach you even more about the joys of Halloween next year!  
You better be ready for a boatload of fun!  
  
**Narration：**  
Having made the most of Halloween this year,  
Misaki vowed to enjoy next year's even more.  
All with a beaming smile appropriate for her age.
