# Misaki (Halloween) Episode 1
Misaki hopes to take part in a campaign giving away candy for free, but is too shy to say the required phrase for it. After bumping into {player}, they go around the business district together, with Misaki getting so excited she forgets her own hesitation over saying the phrase.

**Narration：**  
With Halloween drawing closer,  
talk about holding a party spread through Misaki's class.  
  
**Girl：**  
I can't wait for Halloween!  
Hopefully I get lots and lots of candy!  
  
**Boy：**  
Hey, how's this sound?  
Let's throw a big party during our next break!  
We can dress up and bring candy and stuff!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Good grief. Getting excited over Halloween and simple candy?  
Now that's just childish, my friends.  
  
**Girl：**  
What sort of sweets do you like, Misaki?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hm. Good question.  
Lately I've been really into  
hybrid sweets you can get in the business district!  
  
**Girl：**  
High-bred...?  
  
**Misaki：**  
They mix two different sweets into one,  
entirely new sweet! It's super fancy!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Not that I've ever actually had one.  
I've just seen them in magazines.  
  
**Girl：**  
Wooow!  
Oh, that reminds me. Did you hear?  
They're giving out candy and stuff for  
an event in the business district!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Oh,  
are they now?  
That actually sounds enticing!  
I might have a look on my way home.  
  
**Boy：**  
Heh! Now you're the one getting excited over candy!  
  
**Misaki：**  
N-no I'm not!  
I just have some free time after this.  
Don't lump me in with kids like you!  
  
**Man：**  
Gather 'round, children!  
We've got a free candy campaign going on today!  
Each store has different goods, so make sure to check them all!  
  
**Man：**  
O-oh, hey there little miss!  
Here, have this flyer!  
  
**Misaki：**  
My, that's awfully nice. Thank you.  
Let's see... How do I get my hands on all this candy?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Oh,  
here we go.  
I just need to say \"Trick or treat!\" to the... staff...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Nope! Absolutely not!  
I'm just admitting that I'm a kid if I do that!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I mean, I *do* want that candy.  
But I don't have it in me to participate...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What're you up to?  
**Choice: (2)**  I can buy you some candy if you want.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misaki：**  
Gaaahhh?!  
D-don't sneak up on me like that!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Misaki：**  
Really?!  
Yay!  
Wait, no! I'm a fine lady! I don't need your stinking candy!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Misaki：**  
...Oh.  
I didn't realize it was you, {player}.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Quite the coincidence.  
Perfect timing too, even!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Tell me. What're your thoughts on Halloween?  
It's an event for kids, right?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Huh? You're not even sure what Halloween is in the first place?  
Come on. You're supposed to be older than me.  
How can you not know—  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hold on a minute.  
I just had a stroke of genius! ♪  
  
**Misaki：**  
You're as hopeless as ever, aren't you?  
But don't worry. I'll carry out my duty as a splendid adult  
and show you just how fun Halloween can be!  
  
**Misaki：**  
First off, we need to participate in today's event!  
They're giving out free candy as part of a campaign, you know.  
  
**Misaki：**  
There's a little trick, though.  
First you need to say \"Trick or treat!\",  
otherwise they won't give you any.  
  
**Misaki：**  
So listen well. I can't be the only one saying it.  
I'm doing this for your sake, so you need to join in.  
Got it?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Now then. Let's do it at the same time.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Trick or treat!  
`Tag 4`  
**Misaki：**  
Trick or treat!  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Well I'd hate to be tricked, so here's a treat!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I-it worked! She actually gave us some!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Wh-what's with that look? Of course I'm not happy!  
I'm just doing this for your sake. Don't forget that!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Anyway! Let's move on to the next store!  
This free, sweet goodness is all down to me,  
so you better be thankful!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Wow. It got really busy all of a sudden.  
This might be a struggle.  
  
**Man：**  
Our famous hybrid sweets are back on sale, folks!  
But act quick! We've only got limited stock!  
  
**Misaki：**  
For real?! The same ones from the magazine?!  
No time to waste! I'm getting in on that if it's the last thing I do!  
  
**Misaki：**  
But wait!  
We'll never make it through with this many people!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Whoa?!  
What gives?!  
Put me down! I'm not a kid!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hey, where are you going?! Put me down already!  
All the boys in class are gonna make fun of me if they see us!  
  
**Misaki：**  
But wait. Isn't this... technically a bridal carry?  
H-hmph... Not bad. Not bad at all.  
  
**Misaki：**  
I have to hand it to you, {player}.  
You're carrying me like this because you recognize that  
I'm a proper lady, right?  
  
**Misaki：**  
What's with that face?!  
Am I wrong?! Then let me down, you doofus!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Wait, huh?  
When'd we get in front of the right store?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Don't tell me... *this* is what you were aiming for?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Ah! S-silly me!  
We won't get anything unless we say something!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Trick or treat!  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Well! I'd hate to be tricked, so here's a treat!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Oh wow! They actually mixed together a crepe and creme brulee!  
There's no way this *can't* be delicious! I'm sure of it!  
  
**Misaki：**  
It's so nice, I even feel a teeny, tiny bit bad about eating it, but oh well...  
*munch*  
  
**Misaki：**  
It's so sweet! ♪  
And it melts right in the mouth! ♪  
  
**Misaki：**  
Oh, right. Here.  
You can have some too.  
It's super duper delicious!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I honestly thought I'd never get to eat something from here.  
So? Halloween's fun, right?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Let's not assume I'm having a blast, though!  
I just want you to enjoy yourself. Like the cool lady I am!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Oh, on that note!  
There's a bunch of other stuff to enjoy about Halloween.  
I'll teach you everything there is to know!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Not today, though. It's almost time for my curfew.  
Let's meet up again tomorrow!  
  
**Narration：**  
Misaki returned home, more than pleased by the day's bounty, only to be scolded by her mother for not being able to finish dinner.
