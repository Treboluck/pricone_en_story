# Sarendia Orphanage Episode 1
Suzume greets Saren on her return, while Kurumi, Ayane, and friends play with some blocks Suzume bought them. Saren works hard to keep the orphanage afloat, but she somehow overlooked bringing the children toys.

**Saren：**  
I'm hooome!  
Are you here, Suzume?  
  
**Saren：**  
The meeting went on way longer than I expected,  
so there's no way I'm gonna make it home before tomorrow.  
I'm gonna crash here for tonight, okay?  
  
**Saren：**  
Besides, I've got a bunch of little things to do in Landosol tomorrow.  
It'd be a waste of time and money  
to go all the way back home just to sleep.  
  
**Saren：**  
Goodness knows I can't risk losing either.  
The Sarendia Orphanage can't run on smiles alone, now can it?  
  
**Saren：**  
Suzume?  
Are you here?  
Hmm?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Eeek! Yes, I'm here!  
I'm coming!  
Just one moment, please!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm so sorry! I was doing the laundry and didn't even hear you!  
Welcome back, milady!  
Yaaagh!  
  
**Saren：**  
Look out!  
You've got to be more careful. We both know how clumsy you can be!  
Are you okay?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Yes, I sure am!  
I'm just fine and dandy!  
I might be useless, but at least I'm durable!  
  
**Saren：**  
We really need to work on your self-image...  
Listen, it's really late,  
so we need to keep it down unless you want the neighbors to hate us.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, I see now.  
The flooring's uneven over here.  
  
**Saren：**  
That must've been what tripped you. This is too dangerous to leave.  
I'll hire someone to fix—  
  
No, actually, I think we can take care of this on our own.  
  
**Saren：**  
It's just a quick fix-up anyway.  
Now Suzume, I need you to make sure you tell  
the kids this area is off-limits until I'm done, okay?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, no, milady!  
Please, allow me to take care of that!  
At the very least, you could put something more appropriate on!  
  
**Saren：**  
Yeah, you're right.  
Even if I wanted to take care of it right now,  
the hammer would be far too loud.  
  
**Saren：**  
I guess I'll leave it for tomorrow.  
*yawn*  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ahaha,  
looks like someone's tired.  
It's not every day I get to see you yawn that big.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh dear, that was rude of me, wasn't it?  
I'm so sorry.  
  
**Saren：**  
So how were things today, Suzume?  
  
I'm really sorry. I wish I didn't have to leave you to look after the Orphanage.  
  
**Saren：**  
Unfortunately, I'm going to be doing a lot of traveling between  
Landosol and home until everything's taken care of.  
But just because I'm busy, that doesn't mean I can just leave the kids.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I understand.  
You certainly have a lot on your plate, don't you?  
  
**Suzume：**  
You can leave the housekeeping to me.  
I'll do my upmost to rein in my klutziness.  
  
**Suzume：**  
All the kids here are perfect little helpers too.  
Just look at how well we've done so far!  
  
**Saren：**  
You have.  
They're all really,  
really good kids.  
  
**Saren：**  
Yeah. Yeah!  
 And those wonderful kids  
deserve to live their lives in peace and harmony.  
That's why I work so hard every day.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, now I'm all raring to get something done.  
Do we have anything here that needs taking care of?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, no, no, no!  
Please just rest, milady!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
...♪  
Y-you're up next, Pukichi.  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Sure am.  
Now, just warning you, but I'm a total pro at this,  
so don't come crying to me when I smoke ya!\"  
  
**Kurumi：**  
What...  
does that even mean?  
  
**Saren：**  
Hmm?  
Now that's odd. It's far past your bedtime, you two.  
What are you doing awake?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Eep!  
I, um...  
*sniffle* I-I'm sorry!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Yo!  
If it isn't Miss Saren.  
You been working hard or hardly working?\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Welcome home,  
Mama Saren!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
W-welcome back,  
Mama Saren.  
  
**Saren：**  
Come on, don't call me that...  
I'm way too young to be a mom.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, whatever.  
I'm home, sweethearts!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Hey,  
I hope your definition of sweetheart extends to good ol' Pukichi!\"  
  
**Saren：**  
It sure does.  
Good to see you again, Pukichi.  
  
**Saren：**  
So now,  
does anyone want to explain why you're all sitting on the floor like this?  
  
**Saren：**  
There better not be any mischief going on here,  
or someone's gonna be in trouble!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wha?! Eep!  
That tickles!  
Please, Mama Saren... Aah! Hee hee!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Okay, so! We were playing with these new toys!  
They're super, duper fun! Like, everyone here loves 'em!  
See? They're like little blocks!  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh,  
you're playing Jonga! Wow, that takes me back.  
I used to play it all the time. Hold on a second...  
  
**Saren：**  
Where did you guys get this? I know I bought  
you kids daily necessities and whatnot,  
but I don't remember ever buying a Jonga set.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um.  
S-Suzume said...  
that we could all play with it...  
  
**Saren：**  
Suzume gave it to you?  
Suzume, is that true?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh? Oh, yes!  
See, I was really happy that we managed to get some beds around here,  
but the kids were starting to look a little bored, so...  
  
**Suzume：**  
I went and got some toys, some picture books... all sorts of things.  
Most of it is my old stuff,  
but I also went shopping to fill in the gaps.  
  
**Suzume：**  
O-oh, I really messed up, didn't I?!  
I promise  
I didn't use any of the orphanage's money!  
  
**Saren：**  
You didn't mess up.  
Not in the slightest.  
  
**Saren：**  
Actually, I want to know why you'd pay for it out of pocket.  
I mean, that's exactly the sort of thing our operating budget  
is meant to account for.  
  
**Saren：**  
So did you get a receipt?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh? Wha?  
Uh, I don't think...?  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, how many times must I tell you that  
you need to get a receipt when you go shopping?  
This is exactly why.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hmm...  
Well, it doesn't have to be exact, I guess.  
Just give me a list of what you bought and how much you think it was.  
  
**Saren：**  
You were right. We need books and toys here. I wanted this to be  
a place where kids could live their lives to the fullest.  
 How could I  
have forgotten something so important? This was such a major oversight.  
  
**Saren：**  
Thank you, Suzume.  
You might be a bit of an airhead,  
but you always come through in the end.  
  
**Saren：**  
Who's a good girl, now?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Yaagh!  
P-please, milady!  
Not in front of the children!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hey, no fair!  
Mama Saren! I'm a good girl too! Pat my head too!  
And don't forget, Pukichi and Kurumi deserve headpats too!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wha— Huh?  
I-I do?  
  
**Saren：**  
Of course you do. You're all very, very good kids.  
And I love you all so, so much. Group hug!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh... Oh no!  
O-our Jonga tower's gonna fall!  
  
**Saren：**  
Hey, can I play too?  
I'm really good at these sorts of games.  
In fact, I'd go so far as to say I'm the Queen of Jonga!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yeah, come play with us! I'm gonna win though!  
And when I do, you've gotta give me tons of headpats!  
No...  
You've gotta come to see us more often!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Yeah.  
I-it gets...  
lonely without you.  
  
**Saren：**  
Okay.  
I know now.  
This is a place that I can call home.  
  
**Saren：**  
It feels so wonderful  
having someone to come home to.  
  
**Saren：**  
Right?  
You think so too, don't you, Suzume?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Who, me?  
I mean, I do, but...  
  
**Suzume：**  
If you like it so much,  
then please just get some rest already, milady!
