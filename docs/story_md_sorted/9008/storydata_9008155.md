That monster there...  
The Ulfhedinn, it appears to be the boss of the monsters around these parts.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Thanks to this monster's rampage, the routes from Landosol  
to the village beyond the mountains have been totally cut off.  
It looks pretty strong, but let's go for broke and take it out!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh!  
You're ready for action, huh!  
Were you the one who accepted the request  
from the Guild Association this time, Karyl?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, uh, yup. I did bring the request over...  
But, this request isn't from the Guild Association, actually.  
  
**Karyl：**  
There was a kid crying that he couldn't visit his parents in the  
village across the mountains.  
 So, uh, I sort of got carried away  
and blurted out \"I'll take care of that beast!\" without thinking.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl!  
You're such a sweetie!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*chuckle* It seems my lord, too, is filled with renewed vigor.  
He looks more fearless and chivalrous than ever! Miss Karyl,  
let us dispose of this monster for the sake of that poor child.
