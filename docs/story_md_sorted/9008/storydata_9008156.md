We did it, Karyl! We've slain the monster!  
Now people can travel freely between Landosol and  
the village on the other side of the mountains, just like before.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
While our request this time did not come from the Guild Association,  
we still completed a good deed for a defenseless child.  
I am certain that this will bring joy to Lady Ameth too.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Uh-huh.  
And, from what I've heard,  
that kid’s family is apparently rolling in the dough!  
Maybe we'll be rewarded pretty handsomely.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl...  
Don't tell me that was your motive all along, was it?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Of course not!  
I'm not just out to make money, y'know?!  
You believe me, right, {player}?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*chuckle* Worry not; my lord knows the truth. You have a  
habit of making such excuses out of bashfulness, do you not?  
You may speak harshly, but you are a truly kind soul at heart.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Th-that's not true! I'm not kind or anything!  
Argh! Spending all this time with you guys doing  
stuff for the guild really is starting to mess with my head!
