**Ninon：**  
Shogun! Shogun!  
What lands are you planning to conquer today?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Huh? You're just going grocery shopping?  
No need for me to come?  
How could you leave me out?! How heartless!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Huh?  
Shogun, what is that strange light over there?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Wahh! The light is coming closer!  
It is descending upon me!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Waaaaaahhhhh!  
  

---  
  
**Ninon：**  
Shogun! Over here!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Sorry to call you here all of a sudden!  
I needed to show you this item  
that I just found lying on the street!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Behold and be amazed...  
Deke-deke-den!  
A treasure map!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Look right here. It shows a building with a \"¥\" mark,  
and even a secret passageway inside!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Doesn't this look like a bank?  
`Tag 1`  
**Ninon：**  
A bank, you say?  
Of course! Banks do contain lots of money!  
But then, why is there a secret route inside?  
  
**Robber 1：**  
Gah! Look what those brats over there are holding!  
It's the plans for our big heist!  
  
**Robber 2：**  
For real?! How did that happen?!  
Grab 'em, you guys!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Wahh! What are you doing?!  
L-let us go!  
Why are you tying us up?!  
 Ah! Could it be...?!  
  
**Ninon：**  
You are sushi chefs in training?!  
Using us as practice for making maki rolls?!  
  
**Robber 2：**  
Of course not!  
  
**Robber 1：**  
Heheh... We belong to a notorious gang of thieves!  
Our boss sent us to steal tons of cash from a bank!  
Though we ran into a hitch when we lost our map...  
  
**Robber 2：**  
Now that you've seen our plans, we can't leave you alive.  
We'll take you somewhere nobody will ever find you,  
and dispose of you there.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Th-the forces of justice will never allow such a thing!  
Wh-who is your leader?!  
  
**Robber 1：**  
Heheheh... Nobody knows that.  
The boss's identity is a closely-guarded secret.  
He's known only by a code name...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Nngh! L-let us go!  
Please save me! Shogun! Shoguuuun!  
  
**Robber 1：**  
Wha—?! D-did you say \"Shogun\"?!  
How d'you know the boss's code name?!  
Don't tell me this guy's the boss?!  
  
**Robber 2：**  
H-hold on. Wait! It could just be a fluke.  
If this kid here really is our Shogun,  
he should know the secret greeting we prepared!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Secret greeting...?  
We live by one motto, and one motto alone!  
Namely, \"To conquer the lands!\"  
  
**Robber 1：**  
...  
  
**Robber 2：**  
...  
  
**Robber 1：**  
Guahhh! They even know the secret greeting!  
It's true... this kid is our Shogun!  
Hey! Untie them, quick!  
  
**Robber 2：**  
Shogun! How can we ever apologize?!  
F-forgive our terrible rudeness!  
  
**Ninon：**  
H-honestly! Show some respect!  
All of you, stop this heist nonsense  
and go home like good boys!  
  
**Robber 1 & 2：**  
Of course! We're sorry we ever doubted you!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hahahah! Once more we have protected the city's peace!  
Evil never prospers while justice prevails!  
Isn't that great, Shogun?

**Ameth：**  
How was that? Just a little present from me.  
Did you have a pleasant dream?  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just saw was a dream I created for you and Ninon  
using fragments of your memories.  
Did it ring any bells?  
 Well, I suppose you wouldn't know.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Keep collecting more memory fragments,  
and I'll have more dreams to show you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
These past moments you've shared with those girls...  
They're your best chance at finding the truth of this world.  
So good luck!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, see you later!  
  

---  
  
**Ninon：**  
Mmngrhh... Was that... a dream?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Huh...? Shogun... you had the same dream as me?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Amazing! That's my shogun!  
Only a true shogun can conquer other people's dreams!  
  
**Ninon：**  
And even in the dream, your greatness saved the day!  
All hail the shogun!  
  
**Ninon：**  
I must work even harder  
 so that I will be known  
as your most faithful retainer!  
  
**Narration：**  
Though a little shaken by the strange experience,  
{player} couldn't help but think to himself  
that it was worth it, since it made Ninon so happy.
