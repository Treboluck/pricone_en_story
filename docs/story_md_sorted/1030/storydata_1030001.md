**Monsters：**  
GRRRAAAAGHHHH!  
  
**Narration：**  
While relaxing on the plains one day,  
{player} finds himself encircled by monsters.  
As he prepares for a tough battle, suddenly a voice rings out.  
  
**???：**  
Deke-deke-den!  
One! Flounders of humans' bloody feast!  
  
**???：**  
Two! Creepy dudes who wallow in lewds!  
  
**???：**  
Three! Demands that paint this waterworld!  
My blade will cut your butts!  
De-de-den! Hyahh!  
  
**Narration：**  
Reciting an utterly indecipherable catchphrase,  
a strange girl leaps down from atop a nearby tree.  
  
**???：**  
Hark, innocent traveler!  
  
I'll de-liver you from your plight!  
  
**???：**  
Ninpo: Bunshin no Jutsu! Fwippy-fwoosh-fwoosh!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Is she doing her own sound-effects...?  
`Tag 1`  
**???：**  
Ohohoh! Such useless attacks!  
Take this...  
Secret Strike: Slicey Swallow!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRUOOOOGGGHHH!  
  
**???：**  
...Have no fear, I used the back of my blade!  
Monsters... all gone!  
  
**Narration：**  
But it looks like the girl has failed to notice  
one last monster lurking behind her...  
  
**???：**  
Heheheh... No need to thank me!  
I am but a humble wandering ninja warrior!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Behind you! Behind you!  
`Tag 2`  
**???：**  
Yes, we should put this ugly business behind us!  
Hence, you must not ask me to stay!  
A ninja departs in stoic silence!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAGHHHH!  
  
**???：**  
...Huh? Waaahhh!  
A sneaky back attack?! What a dishonorable monster!  
  
**???：**  
I'll just use my \"Secret Strike: Sweepy Moon\" to...  
Oh noooes!  
I'm all out of magical energy!  
  
**???：**  
Profound sadness...!  
At this rate... I will have to commit sudoku!  
  
**???：**  
...Huh? Not so hasty, you say?  
Do you have a cunning plan?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Power the girl up.  
`Tag 3`  
**???：**  
Ahh...! Wh-what's this...?  
This energy flowing through me...  
Can it be \"that power\"?!  
  
**???：**  
Hah! Now's my chance!  
Secret Strike: Drizzly Rain!  
Schwakadakadak!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRUOOOOGGGHHH!  
  
**???：**  
Victory is mine!  
A thrilling turnabout, and one beat-up monster on the menu!  
  
**???：**  
But the glory is not mine...  
  
**???：**  
This is all thanks to you, my honorable shogun!  
  
**???：**  
A shogun is so important,  
his mere presence powers up his followers!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'm not a shogun.  
**Choice: (5)**  I don't even have any memories.  
`Tag 4`  
**???：**  
No no no, you can't fool me!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**???：**  
Now now, no need to be so humble!  
  
  
`Tag 6`  
**???：**  
I need no further explanations!  
Only a true shogun could lend me such powerful power!  
  
**???：**  
Ahh...! But then that means... Just now, I was...  
deeply lacking in honorable respect!  
  
**???：**  
Shudder shudder shudder...  
S-slay me in one fell strike!  
  
**???：**  
I don't wanna be sold to an evil magistrate!  
Or cry \"Oh myyyy!\" as he pulls on my kimono belt  
and spins me like a spinning top!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I wouldn't do that...  
`Tag 7`  
**???：**  
R-really, you won't...?!  
Shogun! You're as kind as you are great!  
  
**???：**  
I know! You must allow me  
to join your entourage as a retainer!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Allow me to tell you my name. I am known as Ninon!  
  
**Ninon：**  
It's a pleasure to serve you!  
My shogun, I swear to help you conquer all of these lands!  
  
**Narration：**  
Swept along by Ninon's cornucopia of misunderstandings,  
{player} somehow found himself  
with a new self-proclaimed ninja retainer...
