**Ninon：**  
*pant* *pant*  
  
**Ninon：**  
Shogun! Sorry I got you mixed up in this  
and made you run away from them with me!  
I can not possibly apologize enough!  
  
**Ninon：**  
But... With bandits causing chaos in the city,  
I couldn't sit by and do nothing at all!  
  
**Ninon：**  
So you see, it cannot be helped at all if I attacked on instinct!  
  
Any ninja or samurai would rather commit sudoku  
than abandon their honor!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Although I really am sorry it ended up  
with both of us running away...  
  
**Ninon：**  
For now, let us hide ourselves in here!  
Sneaky-sneaky, creepy-crawly, topsy-turvy...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Phewwww... My heart finally stopped racing.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Shogun, let's stay in this cave  
and rest here for a little while.  
Just you and your loyal retainer, chilling out together.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Still, this is a very gloomy cave...  
I can almost feel ninja snakes and bats lurking in the shadows...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Would you mind if I stayed close by your side for now?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Thank you greatly!  
Eheheh... Next to my shogun is where I feel safest.  
  
**Ninon：**  
If you get hungry, I brought some pickled kombu,  
so let me know any time!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hmm...? Shogun?  
You look like you want to ask me something.  
What is it?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Why do you like ninjas and samurai so much?  
`Tag 1`  
**Ninon：**  
Because! They're so cool!  
  
**Ninon：**  
They protect the weak and ask for no thanks! Like heroes!  
They are the coolest of cool!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Oh, you want to know if I've ever seen  
a ninja or samurai for myself?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Eheheh... Actually, I did see them once!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Back when I was very little, my parents took me  
to see a traveling show that was in town!  
  
**Ninon：**  
There I saw ninjas and samurai being so cool!  
Even now, the memory is so strong...  
I could not forget it even if I tried!  
  
**Ninon：**  
And also, with the right ninja training, you can do anything!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Sleep while standing up, change clothes in a flash,  
eat without moving your hands...  
Isn't that super convenient?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Sounds like you just want to be lazy...  
`Tag 2`  
**Ninon：**  
Eheheh! I'm just kidding!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Coolness and convenience... Those are very good...  
  
But there's much more to it!  
  
**Ninon：**  
I believe my shogun is a chosen one who'll conquer the lands  
and make a peaceful world where everyone can smile!  
  
**Ninon：**  
So my dream is to become a great ninja samurai warrior  
who can help my shogun in his mission  
with all kinds of amazing skills!  
  
**Ninon：**  
I'll keep training hard to master the ways of ninjutsu,  
so I can make you proud!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm counting on you.  
**Choice: (4)**  I hope you're ready to work hard!  
`Tag 3`  
**Ninon：**  
Eheheheh... Your faithful Ninon  
 will never leave your side!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Ninon：**  
...Oh! Right, Shogun!  
I'm filled with honor to serve you!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Bandit：**  
Hey! I heard voices coming from over here!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Oh dear! Looks like we've been found already!  
 Hup!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Nothing left for it but to take them on!  
When the going gets rough, the rough get ready to do ninja things!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Shogun!  
With you and me together, nothing can stop us conquering the lands!  
  
**Narration：**  
True to her word, Ninon defeated the bandits and escaped  
to safety with {player}. Having shared  
a special moment, the two headed home in good spirits.
