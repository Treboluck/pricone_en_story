# Ninon Episode 5
When {player} takes Ninon to the library, she offers to make him dinner as thanks. She attempts to use the \"Naked Apron\" technique she learned in a book, but is ultimately far too embarrassed to go through with it.
  
## Subtitle: Cooking Like a Samurai!
  
**Ninon：**  
Hey! Shogun, Shogun!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Today, I came here  
with a request to make of my shogun!  
  
**Ninon：**  
It is my belief that conquest is more than just fighting.  
An eye for an eye makes the world look like pirates!  
  
**Ninon：**  
As such, please take me to visit the library of learning!  
  
**Ninon：**  
I beg this favor!  
In return, I will warm your sandals  
inside my kimono every day from now on!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Well, if you insist.  
`Tag 1`  
**Ninon：**  
All right!  
That's my kind shogun!  
Well then, let us set out at once!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Whew! I learned many things from that library visit!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Best of all, I finally got to read a book called \"Bushido\"!  
My heart rings out louder than the bell of Gion!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hmm? What kind of book is this \"Bushido\"?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hohoh! I'm glad you asked...  
 It tells of shoguns and samurai,  
their lives and philosophies, and even their ways of cooking!  
It's a great tome of knowledge!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Oh, yes! I must find some way to thank you  
for taking me to the library today!  
What would you like me to do?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'd like to try your home cooking.  
**Choice: (3)**  Show me your new Bushido knowledge!  
`Tag 2`  
**Ninon：**  
Well, that is a fine idea!  
I can try the methods I learned from \"Bushido\"!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Ninon：**  
Ummm... All right, then...  
First I will try the cooking methods that the book taught me!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Ninon：**  
Eheheh...  
 It's a little embarrassing...  
But for my shogun's sake, I can do anything!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Very well, then!  
You go do some training, and work up an appetite!  
While you do, I will whip up a fine meal at the guildhouse!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Cooking is about love, honor, and the warrior's way!  
I will prepare a feast fit for a shogun!  
It will not disappoint!  
  
**Narration：**  
A little while later, {player} finishes training  
and makes his way back to the guildhouse.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'm back.  
`Tag 5`  
**Ninon：**  
Welcome home, Shogun!  
  
**Ninon：**  
U... Ummm... Ahhh...  
  
**Narration：**  
For some reason, Ninon seems to be blushing and fidgeting.  
Slowly and hesitatingly, she continues her welcome.  
  
**Ninon：**  
D-darling?  
Would you like dinner? Or a bath?  
Or maybe...  
 m-me?  
  
**Ninon：**  
...  
  
**Ninon：**  
O-oh no! Please don't freeze up...!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Urgh... I knew this would not be enough...  
I am sorry, Shogun... I know there is something  
very important still missing...  
  
**Ninon：**  
B-but... Umm...  
Wearing nothing but an apron...  
was too embarrassing even for me...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  What are you talking about?!  
`Tag 6`  
**Ninon：**  
The \"Naked Apron\"... I read in the book of Bushido  
that it is the traditional garb to wear  
when presenting a meal to the shogun...  
  
**Ninon：**  
I-I tried to do it properly, but...  
When it came to it, my face went redder than a lantern,  
and I could not continue...  
  
**Ninon：**  
From now on, I will train harder to be a perfect retainer!  
So please... do not lose hope in me yet!  
Ahhh... Ahhh... Waaaaaahhhh!  
  
**Narration：**  
Hearing Ninon's cries, the other members of the  
Weissflügel: Landosol Branch guild came rushing into the room.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Shogun! Please forgive me!  
The Naked Apron is too much for me to bear!  
  
**Narration：**  
For some strange reason, they all seemed to think  
that {player} had been trying to force Ninon  
into a compromising situation.  
  
**Narration：**  
It took quite some time to convince them that the blame  
lay with a certain book of questionable origin...
