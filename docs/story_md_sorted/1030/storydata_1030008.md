## Subtitle: A Fine Day for Recreation!
  
**Ninon：**  
Shogun! Shogun!  
A new recreation center opened just out of town!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Yes, recreation!  
\"Master Shogun! Let your topknot down!\"  
Doesn't that sound like the most exciting thing?!  
  
**Ninon：**  
I can't wait to pay it a visit!  
Let's go today! Let's go right now!  
 Uwahh!  
  
**Narration：**  
Tripping up while still holding on to {player},  
Ninon's foot slips down onto the lower ground beside the path.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ahhh! I'm fallin—  
 Huh?  
What's this funny light all around us?!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Uwaaaaahhhhhhh!

**Ninon：**  
Shogun! Today, the time has come for us to visit  
a place of challenge! A test we must surely overcome  
if we are to conquer the lands!  
  
**Ninon：**  
That's right, the gaming arcade!  
But you'd be wrong to assume this is just any old game!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Behold! Here awaits a battle we can't afford to lose!  
A mighty conflict for the fate of all the lands!  
  
**Ninon：**  
So come on, take this katana controller and ready it like so!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Let's play!  
The new big thing in immersive samurai swordplay,  
\"Sword of Yamato II\"!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Take this! Schwing!  
Hiyahh!  
  
**Ninon：**  
I heard a rumor that if you hit this sumo wrestler 256 times,  
he'll go down for big points!  
  
**Ninon：**  
I will never accept defeat!  
Hwaaahhh!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Whew... Though we shine on the field of battle,  
our foes are no pushovers!  
Their formation is a clam of no escape!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ah... Ahh!! I lost all of my lives!  
Time to break out... Ninpo: Continue no Jutsu!  
Shwipshwipshwip! Kaching-kaching-kaching!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hey! My 100-yen coin!  
`Tag 1`  
**Ninon：**  
'Twas a necessary sacrifice for our conquest of the lands!  
The golden bun of rebirth!  
  
**Onlooker 1：**  
C'mon, dude, let her have a measly hundred yen!  
  
**Onlooker 2：**  
Yeah, man up!  
Do you want your girlfriend to win or don't ya?!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Everyone... Thank you so much!  
 Now I'm fired up!  
Our shared swordly passion is at its peak...  
It's time, Shogun! Use your special attack!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Take this! Lunar Backflip Inferno!  
**Choice: (3)**  Take this! 16-Swing Barrage of Doom!  
`Tag 2`  
**Ninon：**  
Whoaaaa! Amazing!  
I've never seen such an acrobatic attack!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Ninon：**  
Whoaaa! Your blade's moving so fast, it's turned into a blur!  
  
**Onlooker 1：**  
Holy heck! That's crazy!  
Does this guy have springs in his shoulders?!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Ninon：**  
That's my shogun all right!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Your skills are so unspeakably intense, even your controller  
is making creaky, cracky noises of amazement!  
  
**Ninon：**  
...Creaky... cracky noises?  
  
**Staff：**  
Hey!  
I saw you break that controller just now!  
That'll cost you!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Eeeep!  
 I'm super sorry!

**Ameth：**  
How was that? Another little present from me!  
Did you have a pleasant dream?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I created that dream based on your lost memories with Ninon,  
but it was interesting how you handled things this time.  
I was certainly entertained, at least.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, catch you later!  
  

---  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ahh! Where... am I...?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Was all of that... a dream?  
Wow, it's night already...  
  
**Ninon：**  
At this hour of night,  
I guess the recreation center will be long closed...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Oh well...  
 I had lots of fun with you  
in my dreams today, at least!  
  
**Ninon：**  
So... I think today was a good day!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Any time I spend with my shogun  
is the happiest of times for me!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Let's meet up tomorrow and go to the recreation center for real!  
Right, Shogun?!  
  
**Narration：**  
Both inside the mysterious dream and outside of it,  
{player}'s days with Ninon were filled with  
fun and excitement.
