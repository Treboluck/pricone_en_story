**Suzume：**  
Hello!  
Welcome to the Salty Watermelon!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wow!  
That sure is a delicious name for a cafe!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, hey!  
I know you!  
You're the maid that works at the Sarendia Orphanage.  
Uhh... Suzume, if I'm not mistaken?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Talk about a coincidence!  
Sure am glad to see you here, though!  
Mind if I give you a big hug?

**Suzume：**  
Wait, why?  
That might be a big issue!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hehe.  
That aside, I'm not quite as surprised as you are.  
I'd heard that the Gourmet Guild was here on vacation.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm a little jealous of how well you all get along.  
And while I'm at it, thank you for being such a good friend to  
Kokkoro and {player}.

**Pecorine：**  
Not at all!  
The pleasure's all mine!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hehe.  
Part of me forgot that Kokkoro and {player}  
are staying at the Sarendia Orphanage. That's why  
you're treating them as one of your own, isn't it?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Which means the two of them have found a new family.  
That must be nice...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ah, sorry. I might have come on too strongly.  
They're living there for now, yes,  
but it's only a temporary thing.  
  
**Suzume：**  
They could leave at any time,  
so I guess it's better to not get too attached.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I don't see the issue.  
It'd be a bit of an exaggeration to say that day'll never come,  
but there's no point in thinking about it too much. Right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That aside, mind if I order a drink?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh! Of course, feel free.  
The last thing anyone wants is a bout of heatstroke,  
so make sure to keep yourself hydrated.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hehe. Will you be drinking here?  
Takeout is perfectly fine, too,  
as long as you bring the glass back.  
  
**Suzume：**  
We can even bring your order to you if you're close by!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wowzers! Now that's what I call good service.  
You're making me wanna become a loyal patron!  
Especially with a cutie like you working here! Glomp! ♪  
  
**Suzume：**  
P-please don't hug me like that!  
You'll cause issues for the store!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Something wrong, Suzume?  
**Choice: (2)**  Oh hey, it's Peco.  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, {player}!  
Don't worry, it's just a customer  
getting a bit too touchy-feely.

`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, if it isn't {player}!  
Heyas! ☆  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
...Wait a minute. You're wearing the store's apron,  
which means... you're working here?  
And here I was, wondering where you'd run off to!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ahh... Truth is, we're incredibly understaffed right now.  
And this is my first day, so I'm nowhere near used to it yet. I keep making clumsy mistakes and tripping up all over the place.  
  
**Suzume：**  
{player}, witnessing the disaster unfold,  
found it in his heart to help me out.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I kept telling him to go have fun with you all instead,  
but he just wouldn't listen.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha.  
Sure sounds like him, all right.  
A nice guy that just *has* to help people. ♪  
  
**Suzume：**  
Yeah... He really is kind.  
He even helps out as much as he can at the orphanage.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You know what? I don't mind helping out, either.  
Don't worry. I've worked at plenty of restaurants at this point.  
Experience is practically my middle name!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Don't worry about it! Really!  
I'm not sure why, but we have barely any customers.  
There's not much to do right now.  
  
**Suzume：**  
If anything, you and the rest of the Gourmet Guild  
are the only ones that have come around.  
It'd be a waste to increase personnel with so few customers.  
  
**Suzume：**  
So please feel free to go enjoy yourself, {player}.  
We may be understaffed, but it's not nearly as bad as I thought.  
The owner and I can handle things here.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aww. How about this, then?  
If people start flooding in, then give us a call for help.  
And don't hesitate, either! I'm always up to do some work. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That said. It *is* weird how there's no one else around.  
Even the beach is pretty much empty despite it being  
the perfect time for people to come. What's the deal?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ahaha. I'm not sure myself, but well...  
I'd say it's better than the place being full of people.  
You get to sit back and relax that way.  
  
**Suzume：**  
In fact, I'd even say I'm jealous.  
Sure has a real vacation vibe to it. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well hey. How about you come join us once you're done?  
Assuming you're not exhausted after a hard  
day of work, of course. ♪  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, that sounds great!  
I'll have to take you up on it. ♪  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ehehe.  
This year's summer feels like it might be a little bit special. ♪
