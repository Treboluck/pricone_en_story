# Suzume (Summer) Episode 1
Suzume, concerned about the Sarendia Orphanage's financial situation, proposes doing part-time work at a beachside cafe to help out, now that she has much more time on her hands.
  
## Subtitle: It's Time for Work!
  
**Saren：**  
*siiigh*  
  
**Ayane：**  
That sure was a big sigh.  
Is something wrong?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
D-does your tummy hurt? Not good!  
I-I'll rub your tummy for you...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Rub rub, rub rub... ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Me too, me too!  
Get better soon, Mama Saren! Rub rub... ♪  
  
**Saren：**  
Wah!  
Hey, that tickles!  
  
**Saren：**  
Hehe. I appreciate the concern.  
Also, Ayane. I think I'd prefer it if you used  
your own hands instead of rubbing Pukichi against me.  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Hey there. You got a problem with me?\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Don't worry. Pukichi's a real gentleman!  
I use him for massages whenever my shoulders are all stiff.  
Doesn't hurt a bit!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
A-are you sure you should be using him like that?  
I feel sorry for him...  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"It's cool.  
I'm happy as long as I'm being useful to someone.\"  
  
**Saren：**  
Spoken like a true gentleman.  
At any rate, don't worry about me.  
  
**Saren：**  
You two are still children.  
You don't need to concern yourselves with  
the orphanage's financial circumstances.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Come on! You gotta stop treating us like kids!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
A-are we really struggling that much for money?  
  
**Saren：**  
Hmm...  
We're not on the brink of poverty, at the very least.  
But we're definitely coming up short where it matters.  
  
**Saren：**  
I need to figure out a solution soon.  
The longer this lingers, the more we're going to struggle.  
And that's the last thing I want to put you all through.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hmm...  
I'm pretty sure we're cutting back on all possible expenses, too.  
  
**Saren：**  
Which makes it a matter of raw income.  
We're not making enough to get by.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Milady!  
  
**Saren：**  
Wahhh?! Wh-what's wrong, Suzume?  
There's nothing elegant about storming in, I'll have you know.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I-I'm sorry!  
I should really learn to be more composed...  
  
**Suzume：**  
That aside, though!  
Milady, would you be okay if I took on some brief part-time work?  
  
**Saren：**  
Huh? Part-time work?  
I'm perfectly fine with it, but do you mind  
if I ask what brought this on?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Well. This is something I'd been considering for a while now.  
The orphanage isn't doing too well financially, right?  
  
**Saren：**  
It isn't...  
We were just discussing that, in fact.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I figured as much.  
So, well...  
I want to help support us as much as possible.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I've grown accustomed to life here,  
plus the children are much less of a handful these days.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Kokkoro and {player} have been especially helpful  
when it comes to assisting with chores, too.  
  
**Suzume：**  
If anything, I've wound up with plenty of time to spare  
in the afternoons. Time I'd much rather spend working  
instead of sitting around doing nothing.  
  
**Suzume：**  
So... I had a look through some job search magazines,  
and found something that seems pretty good.  
Have a look. The work itself is simple, plus it pays well.  
  
**Saren：**  
Let's see here. Hm...  
You're right. This does seem good.  
Plus, the work is nice and similar to what you do here.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Can I see?  
Hey, it's at a beachside cafe.  
What is that, by the way?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh. It's a cafe that's run by the ocean... I think?  
They sell yakisoba and stuff.  
I remember going there with someone a long time ago... ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
It was family, so maybe my parents?  
But since they're Lost, it's all kind of fuzzy...  
But I, uh, kind of remember it...?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ahhh... Thinking about them makes my head hurt...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Y-you okay?  
Lemme rub your head for you. Rub rub... ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ehehe...  
Thanks, Ayane. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Umm. Sorry for talking about myself.  
If Suzume wants to work, then I'll cheer her on.  
She is right about having spare time in the afternoon, after all.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yup, yup.  
I'm so free I've even been reading books.  
Me, reading books!  
  
**Saren：**  
Well then...  
That does make sense, I guess.  
It's not like the orphanage itself is doing any sort of real work.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm super busy myself,  
what with all my management duties and whatnot.  
  
**Saren：**  
But meanwhile you've all been bored to tears...  
Sorry. I feel terrible for not even considering that.  
  
**Suzume：**  
There's no need for you to apologize...  
I assume it's okay for me to go ahead with this, then?  
If so, I'll whip up a resume and send it over to them.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Needless to say, I'll put the pay  
towards the orphanage's funds, too. ♪  
  
**Saren：**  
Hey now. That's your money, so use it for yourself.  
Buy some nice clothes, eat some good food,  
or even just go enjoy the day somewhere pleasant.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hehe. But I am.  
Anything I use for milady—for the orphanage—is also for myself. ♪  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm...  
Should have figured that you'd say that, shouldn't I?  
You've always been that sort of girl.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hehe.  
Thank goodness, though.  
Part of me thought you would say no.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Overprotective is your middle name,  
so you're always looking for ways to make life easy for us.  
  
**Saren：**  
Really?  
If anything, I'm all for letting birds leave the nest.  
  
**Saren：**  
You *are* the biggest klutz in Landosol, though.  
I'm slightly worried you'll cause issues over there.  
Or even worse,  
blow the property up and leave us in debt.  
  
**Suzume：**  
D-don't worry! It'll be fine! Probably!  
I'll be as careful as possible.  
  
**Saren：**  
I mean, I believe you.  
But this is your first run with part-time work,  
so don't push yourself too hard.  
  
**Saren：**  
Also, don't even think about following  
any weirdos that try to hit on you.  
And make sure you wear enough sunscreen...  
  
**Suzume：**  
I-I know, I know!  
Please don't treat me like a little child!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Okay. The time for work has come!  
All for the sake of those dear to me... ☆
