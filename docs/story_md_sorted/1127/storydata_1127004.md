# Rin (Ranger) Episode 4
Of her own will, Rin leaves home in order to attend a gaming event—something that she rarely does. She is grateful to {player} for inspiring her to go out, and she teaches a pair of children who want to learn more about the game, even though she finds it a hassle.
  
## Subtitle: The Acorn Ranger Rides Again
  
**Narration：**  
People are shocked after Acorn Ranger Rin goes on hiatus following  
her fierce battle against the formidable monster.  
Nevertheless, the desire for her return has been growing day by day.  
  
**Rin：**  
I told you, I've already fulfilled my duty!  
From now on, it's just eat-sleep, eat-sleep for me.  
So don't disrupt my cycle, okay?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  But you've got a mountain of requests.  
**Choice: (2)**  Your armor's all fixed, you know.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rin：**  
D-does this face look bothered?  
  
Whether it's Caon or Carmina, there are strong people all over,  
  
so folks should send their requests elsewhere.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Rin：**  
It has nothing to do with my armor.  
It's because my willingness to work is totally nonexistent!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rin：**  
And for that reason, I flat out refuse to take on any jobs.  
Good day. I bid you adieu.  
  
**Rin：**  
*pant*, *puff*... Can't you give it a rest for just one day?  
Running away uses up precious energy, you know.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  It's my job as your manager.  
`Tag 4`  
**Rin：**  
Man, you try too hard.  
But it doesn't matter what you say, my working days are over!  
  
**Rin：**  
And if you're gonna try and force me to work, you gotta catch me  
first.  
But just so you know, deception won't work this time.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Up in the sky! A flock of sweet buns!  
`Tag 5`  
**Rin：**  
Huh? Sweet buns? Where? Where are they?  
Argh, the sun's too bright—I can't see a thing.  
  
**Rin：**  
...No, wait. This light isn't coming from the sun!  
A-aaahhh!  
  

---  
  
**Rin：**  
Come on, quit dawdling.  
Keep zoning out like that, and you'll die.  
  
**Rin：**  
Cause the town's full of zombies right now.  
That's right, today's the special event day  
for the mega-popular game,  
Town of the Dead!  
  
**Rin：**  
To be honest, I didn't wanna step foot outside of my house,  
but today, and today only, I had no other choice.  
  
**Rin：**  
After all, there's a massive zombie outbreak, and the item drop rate is  
doubled!  
What's more, event-exclusive Golden Zombies will show up  
at specific spots!  
  
**Rin：**  
Take one of these guys down, and you get a special item that puts you  
straight into EX class.  
Even shut-ins will be flying out of their homes to  
get one.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  You never change, huh?  
`Tag 6`  
**Rin：**  
...People who say stuff like that deserve to be eaten by zombies.  
Oh, an enemy just showed up.  
It's zombie-hunting time. See ya later.  
  
**Rin：**  
Phew, we defeated a whole bunch of 'em.  
And we got a truck-load of items too. All that's left is the real prize...  
  
**Rin：**  
Aha! Speak of the zombie! A golden one popped up!  
Hand over your special item! Fiend! Wretch!  
  
**Rin：**  
I did it! I won! I got the Golden Entrails!  
Eheheh, it was worth leaving the house after all.  
  
**Rin：**  
How about you? Did ya kill the Golden Zombie?  
...Yikes, you got swarmed by low-level zombies.  
Looks like hell.  
  
**Rin：**  
You really suck.  
Here, lemme see that.  
Oh, you dunno how to equip yourself.  
  
**Rin：**  
You'll get nowhere using just a wooden plank.  
Your elements are all off too.  
I wish you'd try a bit harder.  
  
**Rin：**  
For now, switch weapons. And make up for your low firepower  
with more hits.  
Take this, you stupid, undead freak!

**Rin：**  
Here, try it.  
Come on, you're far too slow.  
You're being eaten! You're being eaten!  
Quick, use a recovery pill!  
  
**Rin：**  
*sigh* And you're dead. You really are terrible at this.  
...What are you smiling about?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I'm happy you decided to come out.  
`Tag 7`  
**Rin：**  
Er, that's 'cause...  
I wanted to join the event, so I had to.  
...But if I hadn't met up with you, I'd probably still be at home.  
  
**Rin：**  
So I owe it to you.  
...Thanks.  
  
**Rin：**  
S-so, if you don't mind,  
I'd like you to stay with me a little longer...

`image display end`  
**Boy：**  
Hey, hey!  
You guys are playing Town of the Dead, right?  
  
**Girl：**  
Teach us how to beat the Golden Zombie.  
  
**Rin：**  
D-damn these little pip-squeaks.  
It was going so well...  
  
**Rin：**  
Figure it out yourself.  
Or here's a better idea—go home and study.  
  
**Boy：**  
Huuuh? But you guys are playing it.  
Pretty please?  
I know, I'll give you this sparkly acorn.  
  
**Rin：**  
Urgh, trying to charm a lovely high schooler with an acorn...  
That said,  
there is something alluring about it.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Go on, show them how to do it.  
`Tag 8`  
**Rin：**  
...All right, all right. Let's just get this over with.  
  
**Girl：**  
Yay! Thank you so much!  
  
**Boy：**  
Me first! Start with me!  
  
**Rin：**  
Okay, okay.  
Oh, pretty impressive.  
You've got much better sense than this guy, heehee.  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Surprise, it's me.  
Rin seemed to be having a good time, huh?  
  
**Ameth：**  
And to think, she went outside of her own accord.  
Up until now, she's seemed pretty hopeless, so I was deeply moved.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, she's not a bad kid. She just sometimes lacks motivation.  
She would have gone out eventually.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But I feel that her life afterwards would have been vastly different  
depending on whether you were there by her side or not.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You've come so far together.  
Make sure you see this through to the end, okay?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, you'd best be off.  
  

---  
  
**Rin：**  
Ngh, *yawn*...  
Somehow I fell asleep.  
Snoozing outside... I guess I am too lazy.  
  
**Rin：**  
But I had the weirdest dream.  
One where I was outside with  
you playing a game.  
...In the dream, I *chose* to go outside.  
It seemed pretty fun.  
  
**Rin：**  
Let's go back to my room, {player}.  
Don't worry, I won't run away again.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey, show me the request forms.  
...Hmmm. I guess this one looks the easiest.  
And then this one—  
  
**Rin：**  
Hmmm. To think I'd put this armor on again.  
Yeah, it's been properly mended.  
Very good, very good.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Acorn Ranger Resurrection!  
`Tag 9`  
**Rin：**  
Sorry to burst your bubble, but the Acorn Ranger is already dead.  
So now I'm like Acorn Ranger 2, or X,  
or something like that, with  
enhanced slacking off and escape abilities.  
  
**Rin：**  
Acorn Ranger 2 will be more carefree than ever.  
Wait, that's a bad thing. Really bad.  
  
**Rin：**  
All right, best be off, Manager.  
Let's go milk the easy work for all it's worth!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus, Acorn Ranger Rin was resurrected. Whether or not  
this signaled the birth of a new legend remained uncertain.
