**Narration：**  
Owing to her destruction of the bandit gang, Rin's name has become  
widely known to the general public. With her immense popularity  
comes the moniker \"Acorn Ranger Rin\".  
  
**Rin：**  
Nom nom.  
Whew. Sweet buns before work are the best.  
Toss me another one, Manager.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Time to get going.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rin：**  
Huh, already?  
So be it. Shall we head out?  
  
**Announcer：**  
We would like to call to the stage our special guest  
for today's game launch event, Acorn Ranger Rin!  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey there, what's up?  
I just got here, but can I go home?  
  
**Audience：**  
Ahahahahah!  
  
**Announcer：**  
Rin, we'd prefer it if you stayed!  
Everyone, throw acorns at the stage to encourage Rin to persevere!  
  
**Fan 1：**  
Ranger Rin! You can do it!  
  
**Rin：**  
Wahey, so many snacks!  
Thanks a bunch.  
Well then, I guess I'll hang around for a bit longer.  
Oh, when the event's over, can I get a free copy of the game?  
  
**Audience：**  
Ahahahahah!  
  
**Announcer：**  
Acorn Ranger Rin's meet and greet is this way!  
Please line up in order of the number on your ticket!  
  
**Fan 1：**  
Ranger Rin, I'm always cheering for you!  
Keep up the amazing work!  
  
**Rin：**  
Cool, thanks.  
But I don't really wanna do any work.  
  
**Fan 2：**  
I-I'm one of your biggest fans...  
W-would you do me the honor of calling me by my name?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Huuuh?  
Gross, go away.  
  
**Fan 2：**  
Wahoo! Your cold demeanor really gets me going! Thank you, milady!  
  
**Rin：**  
Phew. I'm exhausted.  
{player}, what's next on the agenda?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Tomorrow you're out monster hunting.  
`Tag 2`  
**Rin：**  
Man, that's no fun at all.  
Well, I'm super strong, so I guess it can't be helped.  
  
**Rin：**  
Funny though, who'd have thought *I* would end up working so much?  
Becoming known as the Acorn Ranger and getting spoiled for it...  
You never know what life'll bring, huh?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Working's pretty fun, huh?  
`Tag 3`  
**Rin：**  
No way.  
  
But if I put in a tiny bit of effort, I get a ton of profit in return.  
  
**Rin：**  
Even if I just fob something off, the people around me get crazy happy.  
And with your help, I can manage any tough jobs that come my way.  
  
**Rin：**  
Dare I say, manual labor is easy-peasy!  
Well, that's also thanks to me being real strong.  
  
**Rin：**  
I hope I can continue to live life on easy mode.  
Don't worry, trickle-down economics means you benefit too,  
so let's keep at it!  
  
**Rin：**  
Hmmm, all's good, all's well, all's super.  
I'm gonna do loads of easy work again today.  
  
**Rin：**  
Now then, what request do we have?  
Ah, monster hunting.  
Usually I'd just complain about it,  
but today I'm feeling real good.  
  
**Rin：**  
A monster like this won't be a problem.  
Plus, I need to make sure to show folks how strong I am.  
{player}, I'll be back before you know it.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You don't need to take on that job.  
**Choice: (5)**  Don't go, it's too dangerous.  
`Tag 4`  
**Rin：**  
This is the one time you don't have to force me. What the heck, man?  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Rin：**  
Dangerous? I'm not gonna take on an army, you know?  
Get it together, Manager.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Rin：**  
I have no idea why you don't want me to go,  
but I'm actually up for it for once.  
  
**Rin：**  
Well, whatever. It's not like I *really* wanna go.  
I'll go do this other easy job instead.  
  
**Rin：**  
Ah, you don't have to come with me. I'm definitely not going in way over  
my head. Well then, buh-bye.  
  
**Rin：**  
Whew. Got that done faster than expected.  
I guess it's time to go home and take a nap.  
  
**Rin：**  
...Oh, right. That monster-hunting request came from around here, if I  
remember correctly.  
Well, why not get it knocked out on the way back?  
  
**Rin：**  
Heheh, I can imagine the look on {player}'s face  
when I tell him I killed the monster.  
Can't wait to see it.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Rin：**  
See, piece of cake.  
I can already see {player}'s frustrated expression.  
  
**Rin：**  
All righty! Gonna go home and stuff myself with sweet buns—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh? It had backup?  
Yikes, my tail's all poofed up...  
Aw hell, I'm in over my head.  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh, is this why {player} tried to stop me from coming?  
'Cause he knew another monster would be waiting in ambush...?  
  
**Rin：**  
B-but still, I'm a different girl now!  
This monster is something I can handle on my own!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Rin：**  
Ahhh! Th-that wasn't good...  
Such a fast and heavy attack...  
I'd be dead if it weren't for this armor.  
  
**Rin：**  
But now it's my turn...  
Wait, what?  
I'm suddenly having difficulty moving...  
Huh?!  
There's a dent in the breastplate, and it's tight against my body...  
  
**Rin：**  
N-no... I'm much stronger than I used to be.  
Even without the benefits of the armor, that monster's dead!  
  
**Rin：**  
Yaaahhh!  
  
**Rin：**  
Wh-what?  
I-it has no effect at all...?  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Rin：**  
Ah, I  
can't dodge it. Ahhhhh!  
  
**Rin：**  
U-ungh... O-ouch... It wasn't even head on. Urgh...  
H-how can *I* die in a place like this...?  
  
Oh, I get it.  
Heh, heheh...  
  
**Rin：**  
It looks like I made a grave mistake. I was never strong.  
All of it was thanks to this armor.  
Hahah.  
Maaan.  
  
**Rin：**  
Well, not just the armor.  
{player}'s support, as well as  
the praise I got from the people around me...  
helped me to succeed...  
  
**Rin：**  
I myself haven't changed at all since the beginning.  
I'm just a lazy, good-for-nothing deadweight for the guild.  
Honestly, I'm so stupid, getting carried away like that...  
  
**Rin：**  
...I don't think I can even lift a finger anymore.  
...I guess this is the end.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey, {player}, I did good, didn't I?  
I just wish he could've praised me one last time.  
  
**Rin：**  
...Huh? That sound...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Phew, I made it in time...  
`Tag 7`  
**Rin：**  
No way! {player}?!  
D-did you come to save me? But why...?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  You didn't come home, so I got worried.  
`Tag 8`  
**Rin：**  
I see. You always care, even though I just do my own thing...  
  
**Rin：**  
Well, that's never been something to bother you, huh?  
It doesn't matter who, you'll come to the rescue at the drop of a hat.  
You're that kinda guy.  
  
**Rin：**  
But I'm sorry... I can't move my body.  
Even if I could, without this armor I'm a liability who can barely fight.  
  
**Rin：**  
Just leave this useless squirrel, and get the heck outta here.  
Because *you* are the hero that Landosol needs.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  The armor never mattered!  
`Tag 9`  
**Rin：**  
E-even if you tell me that...  
I'm done. It's all over for me.  
  
**Choice: (10)**  You're strong! You can do anything!  
`Tag 10`  
**Rin：**  
...You know, you're really kind.  
But I know myself better than anyone. I'm not strong at all.  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh? Wh-why're you powering me up?  
You're already pushing yourself by protecting me...  
  
**Rin：**  
Even though you're in danger yourself, you care about  
the safety of other people.  
That's a true acorn ranger.  
  
**Choice: (11)**  Go, go, Acorn Ranger!  
`Tag 11`  
**Rin：**  
!  
...Come on, even at a time like this?  
You're such a cheeseball, geez.  
  
**Rin：**  
But you've helped me remember. I'm the Acorn Ranger.  
I kinda suck, but I'm the Acorn Ranger.  
  
**Rin：**  
If I can't rescue even this one big softy here,  
I really am a hopeless case,  
whether I'm the Acorn Ranger or not.

**Rin：**  
..Hey, monster! Yeah, you. Consider yourself lucky.  
  
**Rin：**  
You're gonna get a special gift from a celebrity so famous that  
even Carmina can't hold a candle to her.  
  
**Rin：**  
I'm gonna use up decades' worth of motivation so that I, Acorn  
Ranger Rin, can destroy you using my final, ultimate attack!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Rin：**  
Farewell, hard work!

`image display end`  
**Monster：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Rin：**  
Heh, heheh... Did you see me, {player}?  
When I actually do something, I do it right.  
  
**Choice: (12)**  Thanks, Acorn Ranger Rin.  
`Tag 12`  
**Rin：**  
You're welcome.  
*pant* But I'm at my limit. The rest I leave up to you...  
  
**Rin：**  
Ngh. Huh? What was I...?  
Oh yeah, I defeated the monster and lost the ability to move.  
You carried me all the way here?  
  
**Choice: (13)**  You did a fantastic job.  
`Tag 13`  
**Rin：**  
Yeah, your praise does make me happy after all.  
That being the case, maybe trying hard ain't so bad.  
  
**Rin：**  
But doing work is what caused me to turn weird and get into this mess  
in the first place.  
  
**Rin：**  
Nah, I guess I shouldn't do things I'm not used to...  
  
**Narration：**  
With that, Rin drifted off into a comfortable slumber.
