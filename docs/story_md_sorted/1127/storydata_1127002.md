# Rin (Ranger) Episode 2
Rin's reputation gets an unexpected boost from her earlier success, and she is thus sent on a bandit-hunting mission. Although bewildered by her allies' overestimation of her abilities, with luck on her side, Rin is able to complete the mission almost single-handedly. Little by little, her awareness begins to change.
  
## Subtitle: A Mission Marred with Misunderstandings
  
**Narration：**  
A little time has passed since Rin's rescue mission.  
As usual, she foregoes work in order to laze around  
in her room with {player}.  
  
**Rin：**  
Heheee,  
there's nothing better than eating sweet buns all day  
while not doing any work.  
The sweetness is gonna make me melt.  
  
**Rin：**  
I've had no missions since that rescue one.  
I was right all along. Peace is amazing.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I wanted to see you do more.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rin：**  
Come on, enough of that.  
I told you, it was all due to chance.  
  
**Rin：**  
And I don't want Caon to start expecting things of me either.  
I wouldn't mind it if it was acorn-picking, though.  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh? Who's that?  
Yeah, come in!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Excuse me. Am I correct in assuming you're Rin?  
  
**Rin：**  
Uh, last time I checked...  
But why? Who are you?  
  
**Man 1：**  
I'm a member of the Menagerie.  
I've come here today  
to deliver a job request to you in person.  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh? Sorry, I'm a little confused by what you're telling me.  
The Menagerie has a job for me? You've got the wrong girl.  
All right?  
  
**Man 1：**  
No, there's no mistake. I would like you to join me and some other  
guilds on a mission to infiltrate a bandit hideout, in order to free  
some hostages and eliminate said bandits.  
  
**Rin：**  
But that's a job for Caon!  
Come on, look. See this massive, cute tail?  
I'm a squirrel. A squirrel.  
I'm not cut out for the rough stuff.  
  
**Man 1：**  
The details can be found in this missive.  
Please take a moment to review it.  
  
**Rin：**  
Are you listening?  
Hello, can you hear me?  
  
**Man 1：**  
...Rin.  
  
**Rin：**  
Wh-what? Got a problem?  
Well then, I have a hundred times as much to complain about.  
  
**Man 1：**  
No. I'm simply looking forward to your participation.  
  
**Rin：**  
Wh-what did he mean?! What was that cryptic remark?!  
Was he being sarcastic? Or was he serious?  
Urgh. People who are difficult to read are scary.  
  
**Rin：**  
...All right, let's run for it.  
I don't mind if it's rescuing stranded people,  
but making enemies of bandits is like going to your own funeral.  
  
**Rin：**  
Look, the names of members of really powerful guilds are written on  
this document.  
So it won't make a difference if I give this one a pass...  
  
Huh?  
  
**Rin：**  
H-he should've said there was a bounty...  
With this much I'd be able  
to buy all the games I wanted,  
and still be able to live the high-class  
sweet bun life with only the change.  
  
**Rin：**  
...But a bandit gang? It'd be scary and dangerous.  
But I really do like money.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Great, I'll get your stuff.  
`Tag 2`  
**Rin：**  
W-wait,  
I mean...  
Hey! Put my armor back right now!  
  
**Rin：**  
*sigh* I can't fight it. I'll go tag along, but I'll hang back away from  
any action.  
Then I'll just pretend to fight whenever I need to.  
  
**Rin：**  
Laugh all you want.  
It's a survival strategy of the weak!  
  
**Rin：**  
*sigh* We've made it to the rendezvous point...  
  
**All：**  
...  
  
**Rin：**  
Wh-why's everyone looking at me?  
Well, I guess it makes sense.  
Caon only sent one person—ol' squirrel girl here.  
  
**Rin：**  
\"What can this little runt even do?\" is what they're thinking, I bet.  
This sucks. Oh,  
but if they expect nothing of me, I can get away with  
doing just that.  
  
**Woman：**  
Is that the girl from the rumors?  
But she just looks like an ordinary girl...  
  
**Man 1：**  
Then look harder.  
At first glance, she might look unmotivated and  
slovenly, but she's always on guard.  
It's the perfect natural stance,  
free from wasteful energy use.  
  
**Man 2：**  
The way you talk about her suggests she's a total pro.  
But I'm  
having a hard time believing it, even with her right in front of me.  
Hey, son, tell me. That girl...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  She defeated the dreaded tax inspector.  
**Choice: (4)**  She wields the spear of a thousand forms.  
`Tag 3`  
**Rin：**  
Hey, don't overexaggerate!  
That was all thanks to Mahy and the others!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Rin：**  
Lies, overstatements—bad, naughty!  
Totally reprehensible, don't you know?  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Woman：**  
And she doesn't even take credit for her own achievements.  
What a wonderfully humble personality.  
  
**Man 1：**  
Well then,  
it's clear who our mission leader is this time!  
  
**Man 2：**  
We're so lucky to be teamed up with such a brilliant person!  
We're counting on you, leader!  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh? Wait, no, don't decide for me...  
Hey, listen to meee!  
  
**Rin：**  
Man, why is this happening...?  
Is it punishment for being idle every day?  
I wanna go home. Just let me go home.  
  
**Rin：**  
Haaa, haaa.  
Whew, wheeew...  
  
**Woman：**  
The instant the mission began, her face suddenly became taut.  
  
**Man 1：**  
She switched from normal mode into battle mode.  
  
That's a master for you.  
  
**Rin：**  
As if! I just stiffened up 'cause I'm scared of dying at the vanguard.  
  
**Man 2：**  
Hey, look.  
Over there, there's a watchman. Let's get him, quick.  
  
**Man 1：**  
No, it's not a good idea to cause a commotion out here.  
I think we should avoid battle, if possible.  
  
**Woman：**  
But we can't dawdle too much, can we?  
  
**Rin：**  
Good, good. You guys can figure out all the bothersome details.  
While you do, I'm just gonna sit here and eat my acorns...  
Ah! I-I spilled them everywhere!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Rin!  
What on earth are you doing?!  
  
**Lookout：**  
Hey! Who's there?!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Dammit, he's onto us!  
Looks like we've got no choice but to—  
  
**Lookout：**  
Eh, wh-what's this? Argh, i-it's slippery! Whoooa! Uwaaahhh!  
  
**Woman：**  
He slipped on the acorns and knocked himself out...  
  
**Man 2：**  
Incredible! Who knew you could avoid fighting like that?!  
You're not just all brawn, are you?!  
  
**Rin：**  
It's luck, good luck I tell ya!  
  
**Rin：**  
Ahhh, that's it. I really need a breather.  
  
**Woman：**  
Y-you want to take a break inside the enemy base?  
  
Are you sure that's okay?  
  
**Man 1：**  
It is, precisely because of where we are.  
The continuous extreme  
tension can cause serious mental fatigue.  
  
**Man 2：**  
You mean she's making it easier for us to take a rest  
by doing so herself first?!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Exactly.  
She's an exemplary leader.  
  
**Rin：**  
*sigh* This is tiring.  
Just do what you want...  
  
**Man 1：**  
We've arrived. This is the bandits' assembly hall.  
Rin, what's the plan?  
  
**Rin：**  
Don't ask me...  
Hey, {player}, any ideas?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Let's storm the place.  
`Tag 6`  
**Man 2：**  
Hehe, your friend there has the right attitude.  
Let's do it, leader!  
  
**Rin：**  
Urghhh...  
I'm long past caring!  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Huh? Who the hell're you guys?  
  
**Man 1：**  
We are the Guild Alliance!  
O band of thieves, surrender yourself to justice!  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Hah! I think yer a bit shorthanded. Don't take us fer chumps.  
Get 'em, boys...  
Go on, I said sic 'em!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
B-Boss, that girl... ain't she the rumored Nutcracker...?  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Huuuh?  
Yer tellin' me a kid like that's a disaster-level monster  
on par with the guys in Twilight Caravan?  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
The rumor says she's a tiny, spear-wielding beastgirl...  
I-it really is her!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
B-boss, she's gonna crack our nuts!  
Dudes like us ain't got a hope in hell of winnin' against her...!  
  
**Rin：**  
Yikes, have the rumors really spread as far as these bad guys?  
And \"the Nutcracker\"?  
Come on, choose a better nickname, geez.  
  
**Rin：**  
But I'm lucky they've gotten themselves spooked.  
If all goes well, I won't have to lift a finger.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey, {player}, power me up.  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Eek! Wh-what's she doin'?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey, won't you be gentlemen and come with me quietly?  
You see, I'm not very good at holding back.  
  
**Rin：**  
I might just turn this whole crappy hideout into dust, you know?  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Y-yaaah! S-stay back! Stay baaaaack!  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
I-idiot, get back here!  
  
**Rin：**  
D-did I scare them too much?!  
Wh-wh-what should I do?!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Rin, look out!  
  
**Rin：**  
I-I can't escape!  
A-at this point, it's do or die!  
  
**Rin：**  
D-don't touch me!  
Stabbity-stab... and one more for good measure!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Argh! Gaaahhh! Urgh...  
  
**Man 2：**  
Sh-she took him out so easily...  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
I-I'm so sorry!  
I'll release the hostages and return the stuff we stole immediately!  
Just please, I beg you, spare my nuts!  
  
**Man 1：**  
I'm astonished. I didn't know she was *this* good...  
  
**Woman：**  
She dominated them all on her own...  
  
**Man 2：**  
A-  
amazing! Incredible!  
  
**Rin：**  
Hah, hahaha...  
Thanks...  
  
**Man 1：**  
We're so grateful, Rin.  
Thanks to you, we completed the mission with zero casualties  
on either side.  
  
**Rin：**  
But I didn't do anything.  
  
**Man 1：**  
Your modesty is also a virtue.  
Fighting alongside you is my life's crowning achievement.  
  
**Woman：**  
Let us take care of the legal stuff.  
We'll also negotiate additional rewards.  
  
**Man 2：**  
You were an amazing leader! See you around!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Good job.  
`Tag 7`  
**Rin：**  
Honestly, I'm ready to keel over.  
  
**Rin：**  
...Too much unnecessary praise was piled on me, I was forcibly signed  
up for a dangerous expedition, and the crazy misunderstandings about  
me deepened...  
It was all just a pain the butt.  
  
**Rin：**  
But despite the fact that it was only a series of coincidences,  
we managed to resolve two requests at once...  
  
**Rin：**  
Could it be that... I actually *can* do the things I set my mind to?  
  
**Narration：**  
Such was the inkling that crossed Rin's mind.  
It wouldn't take long for it to become conviction.
