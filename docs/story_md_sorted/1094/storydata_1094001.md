# Grea Episode 1
Grea disappears all of a sudden, leading Anne and {player} to search for her. They soon find her watching over a lonely child from afar, promptly giving her the courage to approach said child. Though nervous at first, the ice is broken when Grea's stomach rumbles from hunger.

**Narration：**  
Left with no choice but to wait for the Guild Association to prepare a  
magic tracer for them, Grea and co. spend the time checking out  
Landosol. Today's events take place on a certain day during that period.  
  
**Anne：**  
Hey hey, {player}!  
You listened to my request the other day,  
so how about we go somewhere Grea wants today?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sounds good!  
`Tag 1`  
**Anne：**  
Awesome!  
Anywhere you've got in mind, Grea?  
  
**Grea：**  
M-me?  
Hm...  
  
**Grea：**  
I can't really think of anything, so...  
Let's go wherever Anne wants to go. I'm happy to just tag along.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Does Landosol not really interest you?  
`Tag 2`  
**Grea：**  
Huh?!  
S-sorry, I didn't mean to imply anything like that...  
  
**Grea：**  
Um... Truth be told, I'm not really the outdoors type in the first place.  
I just... can't really think of anywhere I'd like to go.  
  
**Grea：**  
I'm, well... Something of an outcast, you see.  
I never really fit in, even in my homeland.  
So there was never an opportunity to go out with friends and stuff.  
  
**Anne：**  
Grea...  
  
**Grea：**  
Even after coming to Mysteria, I never go myself involved with everyone.  
I was just scared, really. Over my  
appearance and powers, and how people would react to them.  
  
**Grea：**  
I'd just shut myself away in the concert hall,  
playing away at the piano on my own.  
  
**Anne：**  
But hey! We've been going out pretty frequently these days, right?!  
We went into town and got ice cream!  
Remember that?  
  
**Grea：**  
Hehe. Of course. It's always fun going out with you.  
If anything, you're the one that taught me what it feels like to have fun.  
  
**Grea：**  
But, well.  
Tagging along with you is still about the best I can do right now.  
  
**Anne：**  
Urgh.  
It does feel like I've just been dragging you around,  
now that you mention it!  
  
**Grea：**  
That's fine. Like I said, it's a lot of fun.  
It's just, yeah.  
I still can't come up with somewhere to go on my own.  
Sorry.  
  
**Anne：**  
I guess that's fair...  
  
**Anne：**  
Well. How about we just relax today?  
  
**Grea：**  
Huh?  
Are you sure?  
  
**Anne：**  
I mean, we've been running about ever since we got here.  
Makes sense to take a break, right?  
  
**Anne：**  
And hey. You might come up with something in the meantime.  
If you do, then we'll head out.  
How does that sound?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I like it.  
`Tag 3`  
**Grea：**  
Anne, {player}...  
Thanks.  
  
**Narration：**  
With that said, they settle on sitting back  
and relaxing at the Sarendia Orphanage.  
  
**Narration：**  
Then, during the afternoon...  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh, {player}!  
Have you seen Grea anywhere?  
  
**Anne：**  
The books here are all so interesting,  
so I kind of got caught up in reading them.  
  
**Anne：**  
Grea was right by me at the time,  
but before I knew it, she was gone.  
  
**Anne：**  
Huh? You'll help me look for her?  
Thanks!  
That'll be a big help!  
  
**Anne：**  
Hm... She's not inside, at least?  
Where did she run off to?  
  
**Anne：**  
Did she head out into town, maybe?  
Then again, I can't see her doing so alone—  
  
**Grea：**  
...  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh, Grea!  
There she is!  
  
**Anne：**  
Seems like she's being all discreet about something, though.  
What's going on?  
Let's try and sneak up on her.  
  
**Grea：**  
...  
  
**Anne：**  
Grea!  
What're you doing here?  
We looked all over for you.  
  
**Grea：**  
Eeek?!  
A-Anne!  
And {player}, too...  
  
**Anne：**  
Come on. Don't go vanishing like that. You had me worried.  
So? What're you peeking at?  
  
**Grea：**  
Err, I, well...  
  
**Grea：**  
You see that girl there? She's been by herself all this time.  
And she looks lonely, so I got curious.  
  
**Grea：**  
But, well,she might get scared if I approach her.  
So I...  
  
**Anne：**  
So you sat here and watched over her?  
Wait. How long've you been here?  
  
**Grea：**  
H-how long...?  
That's a good question.  
  
**Anne：**  
Pfft.  
Ahaha! Ahahaha!  
Oh, Grea! You're killing me here! Ahahaha!  
  
**Grea：**  
H-hey!  
Don't laugh!  
  
**Anne：**  
Hehehe... S-sorry, sorry.  
You're just so kind, yet so awkward. I love it.  
  
**Anne：**  
Hey, {player}.  
Would you mind helping me give  
this awkward girl the push she needs?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Let's go have a little chat.  
`Tag 4`  
**Grea：**  
{player}...  
  
**Grea：**  
...Yeah.  
I'm sure she won't panic if you're both with me.  
  
**Anne：**  
I'm sure it'd be fine even on your own.  
Either way, let's get going!  
  
**Grea：**  
U-um...  
Do you mind if I have a minute?  
  
**Girl：**  
Huh?  
Who are you?  
  
**Grea：**  
Err...  
M-my name's Grea.  
I started staying at the orphanage not that long ago.  
  
**Girl：**  
Grea...?  
  
**Grea：**  
Th-that's right.  
And... um.  
If you'd like, we could—  
  
**Grea：**  
Eeek?!  
  
**Anne：**  
Wait.  
Grea, was that... Was that your tummy rumbling?  
  
**Grea：**  
Ahhh!  
Why now, of all times?!  
  
**Anne：**  
H-hehe...  
You really were watching over her for a while, weren't you?  
  
**Grea：**  
Anne.  
I can tell how desperately you're trying not to laugh, you know.  
  
**Anne：**  
Sorry, sorry. It's just...  
Ahahaha!  
This side of you's just so cute!  
  
**Grea：**  
Anne!  
Quit teasing me!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  That was the rumble of all rumbles.  
**Choice: (6)**  Perfect timing, really.  
`Tag 5`  
**Grea：**  
Hey! What's that supposed to mean?!  
I can't believe you're teasing me as well!  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Grea：**  
Perfect timing?  
You say that like I planned it...  
Urgh. You're just as bad as Anne.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Girl：**  
Are you hungry?  
Should we go get some sweets together?  
  
**Grea：**  
Oh... Y-yeah.  
That sounds good. Let's go.  
Urgh. Now she's looking out for me. Why did it end up like this?  
  
**Girl：**  
Okay!  
Ehehe...  
  
**Grea：**  
...?  
What's wrong?  
  
**Girl：**  
Well... My friend's down with a cold today,  
so I was feeling lonely.  
  
**Girl：**  
But you all came along and spoke to me!  
That made me really happy!  
  
**Grea：**  
Oh...  
  
**Grea：**  
...Hehe. Well then.  
If you're happy, then I'm happy.  
  
**Anne：**  
Look at that smile on her face.  
Hehe. That's a relief.  
  
**Anne：**  
Grea's terrible at doing things for her own sake,  
but she'll move mountains for other people's sake.  
That's one of her best points.  
  
**Grea：**  
Hm? Anne?  
What are you all smiles for?  
  
**Anne：**  
Nothing! Don't mind me. ♪  
  
**Grea：**  
Really?  
Okay, I guess...  
  
**Girl：**  
What's wrong, Grea?  
  
**Grea：**  
Oh...  
Nothing. It's fine.  
How about we get going?  
  
**Narration：**  
Grea took the girl's hand,  
an expression of utmost warmth on her face.
