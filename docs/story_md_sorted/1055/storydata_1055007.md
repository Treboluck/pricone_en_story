**Narration：**  
While out on a shopping trip, Ayumi spots {player},  
and finds herself silently following his steps as usual.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Where could he be going today?  
Oh, but he looks as dashing as ever...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Oh, he's talking to a cat... That's so cute...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
It's fun to see sides of him I didn't know about like this,  
but our date the other day was even more fun... Eheheheh...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
If I just approach him directly again, maybe I'll be able to...  
Ohhh, but that's still too embarrassing!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
N-now he's leaving the city...  
What could he be planning to do all the way out here?  
  
**Monster 1：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Wahh?! There's a monster right by him!  
...Huh? It's only a little one, though...  
  
**Monster 1：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Ahh... He defeated it... Did he take on a monster slaying job?  
Wow...  
 I'd never have the courage to do that on my own...  
  
**Monsters 2 & 3：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Eep! T-two of them at once?  
Oh no... Should I step in and help him? But that's scary...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
H-he's helped me out so many times...  
And now he's in trouble...!  
 But I just don't have the courage...
