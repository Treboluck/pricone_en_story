## Subtitle: Perpetual Panic
  
**Narration：**  
Ayumi has come into town to do some shopping on her day off.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Eheheh... I don't have work today,  
so maybe I'll buy that manga I wanted to read!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
...Huh?  
...  
Ahhh! I-is that {player}?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Wh-what's he doing here? Sh-should I say hello?  
Oh, but I wouldn't want to be a bother!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
*staaaare*...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I wonder where he's going?  
I heard his guildmates talking, so I know his name now, but...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I still need to thank him for helping me that day...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
He actually left the city...  
 Ahh... Wh-what now?  
I should really say something...  
 But I'd be so embarrassed...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I shouldn't interrupt if he's in a hurry...  
F-for the moment, I'll just wait and see where he's going...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
Wh-what could he possibly want all the way out here?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Awawah! Th-the path's so narrow... I'd better be careful.  
I wonder if he'll be all right...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Ahh—he's gone so far already!  
If I don't hurry, I'll lose him!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh?  
...Waaaaahhhhh!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Owwww... Urgh...  
I was so focused on {player}, I forgot to watch my step...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I-I need to get back up this cliff!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
O-ow... D-did I sprain something?  
Ohhhh no... Out here in the mountains?! It hurts...!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Ohhhh... This is my punishment for sneakily following him...  
I didn't have the courage to say hello, but that's no excuse...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
*sniff*... *sniff*...  
{player}... {player}...!

**Choice: (2)**  Why are you crying?

**Ayumi：**  
M-my foot really hurts... Ahhh...  
But i-it's all my fault... *sniff*...  
...Uweh?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Ayumi：**  
Uh...  
{player}?! Wh-why are you here?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Oh... R-right, this must be a vision before I die.  
The gods in their mercy are showing me what I want to see...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Now I can die happy...  
...Huh? That's not it? I'm still alive?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
...It's really you?! Huh?!  
B-b-b-b-but how come?! Why?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
...O-oh, I see. You were mining minerals for a job  
when you heard me scream  
 and came looking for me...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I can't believe he rushed over all this way...  
Ahhh... He's just like the handsome and heroic prince  
in that romance manga I read!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh?! Wh-why am I out here, you ask?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Oh, well! Um, I'm just, just out for a walk,  
or um, s-something like that!  
I... I enjoy mountain hikes!  
 So, um...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Ohhhh, this is so embarrassing!  
I'm getting in the way of his work again!  
I want to vanish into thin air!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I-I'm totally all right now, so...  
 Oww!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
S-seriously, I'm fine! Don't worry about me!  
It's nothing, really!

**Ayumi：**  
Waaaahh?! Um, {player}?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
S... so cl... so close...  
I-I do appreciate this, but your face! It's so... close...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Aahh... I-I hate to admit it, but this is really kind of nice...  
I thought I was being punished, but this feels more like...  
a reward, if anything...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Eheh... Eheheh...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Aaahhh!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Catch Ayumi.  
**Choice: (6)**  Wrap your arms around Ayumi.

**Ayumi：**  
Um! Umm! I-I'm so sorry—  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Uwah?! I tripped again?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Uwaaahhh?!  
{player}'s face is right—! I... I'm so sorry...?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
You were... so close... I couldn't—!  
I'm so embarrassed... My face... I'm sorryyyyyyy!  
  
**Narration：**  
With {player} unable to halt Ayumi's descent into panic,  
it took the two of them some time to make it down from the mountain.
