On the day of her date with {player},  
Ayumi manages to oversleep,  
and finds herself running full-pelt towards the meeting point.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Aaaahhhh! What now?! What do I do?!  
I can't believe I overslept! I'm such an idiot!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
{player} is so upstanding, he'll have arrived early, too!  
I-I've got to hurry!

 Urgh... old habits die hard...  
But while I stay down here, I'm keeping him waiting longer!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Ahhh, but... What if he's really angry with me?  
Of course he is. Showing up late when this was all my idea...!

Urgh, but, but...  
that's because I was so excited I couldn't sleep...  
Ohhhh! But I can't explain that to him, can I?!

much closer than they had been before.
