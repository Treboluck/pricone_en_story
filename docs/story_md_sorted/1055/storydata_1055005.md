## Subtitle: Assertive Advice
  
**Narration：**  
Still hoping for a chance to thank {player} properly,  
Ayumi is struggling to work up the courage to approach him.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
*sigh*... {player} keeps helping me out all the time,  
so I really want to take him on a date  
to show him how grateful I am for everything...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
But actually, I don't think I've ever even approached him myself before.  
Urgh... What now...? I want to invite him, but I could never... Urghhh...  
  
**Monika：**  
Hm? Say, if my eyes don't deceive me, is that Ayumi?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Oh... Monika! Good afternoon...  
  
**Monika：**  
Yes, I thought it was you.  
What worries you, Ayumi? You look quite forlorn.  
If you have any concerns,  
 I'd be happy to help.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh?! No, um... Uhh...  
I don't think I... um...  
 Aaahhh...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I can't explain that I'm too shy to talk to him!  
That's too embarrassing!  
Besides, it's way too trivial to bother Monika with...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I-I'm very sorry... I can't say.  
  
**Monika：**  
You're unable to tell me?  
Hmm. Could it be you're caught up in some manner of conflict?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh? W-well, I suppose...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I-I do have a lot of rivals, and people do say that \"love is war\"...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Yes, I guess it's a... sort of conflict?  
  
**Monika：**  
R-really?! I wasn't expecting it to be true!  
Why did you not tell me sooner?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh? W-well, I mean...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
This is my own problem,  
so I don't think it's really right... to share it...  
  
**Monika：**  
Who is it?! Who is the other party?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Th-the other party?!  
Ummm, i-it's someone you already know quite  
 well...  
  
**Monika：**  
Somebody I already know?!  
  
**Monika：**  
An enemy is lurking among those I trust?!  
To think I was unable to notice...  
 I'm a failure as a soldier...  
  
**Monika：**  
Ayumi! Tell me their name at once!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh?! I... I can't!  
 I couldn't possibly!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
E-even if it's Monika, I'd be way too embarrassed  
admitting out loud who it is I like!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Ohhh... Aaahhh...  
  
**Monika：**  
This turmoil... Could you be under duress...?  
  
**Monika：**  
...Ugh! To think you are facing such a tough opponent!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
W-well, I guess you could say he's a tough one...  
He's always surrounded by girls, after all...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
And all the girls he hangs around with  
are way cuter and more appealing than me...  
  
**Monika：**  
Wh-whaaat?! This foe operates as part of a gang?!  
This is not a matter for you to handle alone! It's outright war!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh?!  
 U-ummm...  
Monika, what in the world are you talking about?  
  
**Monika：**  
Well, what else?! Your embroilment in a conflict  
with a cruel enemy who is forcibly silencing you, of course!  
  
**Monika：**  
I cannot let this stand! We must seize the upper hand!  
Ayumi, thank you for telling me! You'll be safe now, I promise!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Ehhhh?! Y-y-you've got it all wrong!  
I didn't mean a real conflict!  
 A-all that's bothering me is...  
  
**Monika：**  
Ohhhh... So that's all.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Th-that may be \"all,\" but to me, it's... um... ahh...  
  
**Monika：**  
Enough! If this boy has come to your aid,  
you should just tell your honest feelings to his face!  
Enough dillydallying over details!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Wahhh!  
 Th-that hurts...  
  
**Monika：**  
It's a call to action! Go forth, Ayumi!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Uergh... Why is Monika always so fierce?  
 But...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I do feel like right now, I might be able to do it!  
Right... I-I'll do my best! Yeah!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Umm... At this time of day, he'll be... there, I think!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
There he is... I knew he'd be shopping!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
N-now! Say what you have to say, Ayumi!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
...*staaaaare*  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Urghhhh...  
I... I still don't have the courage after all...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Look at how late it's gotten...  
Ahhh, I'm going to have wasted a whole day  
just staring at him again...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
...No, no! This is no good!  
I can't let what Monika did for me go to waste!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Right, I'll do it! First, a normal greeting!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
H-hi, {player}! G-g-good maftermoom!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Nooooooo! I flubbed iiiit!  
B-b-b-but, but, but! I really did manage to greet him!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Good afternoon.  
**Choice: (2)**  Good maftermoom.  
`Tag 1`  
**Ayumi：**  
Waaaahh! G-good afternoon to you too!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Ayumi：**  
Aaahhh, n-no, th-that's not it! I messed it up, that's all!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Ayumi：**  
I-I, ah, I, um, uh, ah... I... well... listen...!  
Awahh... Urghhhh...!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
It's no gooood!  
Just looking at his face makes me... makes me so...!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
B-but... after I finally managed to approach him...  
Can I go back to my days of just watching?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
M-Monika said not to think too hard about details...  
And I shouldn't just assume it'll go badly before I try.  
I want to thank him like he deserves! So I need to have courage!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
L-listen! W-would you like to go out somewhere with me?!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Sure.  
`Tag 4`  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh? Y-you really would?!  
Wahhh... A-am I sure this isn't a dream?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
No way! You really said you'd go out with me?!  
Ahhh... awaaahh!  
  
**Narration：**  
With a little courage, Ayumi was able to achieve her wish.  
Thanks to a good friend's help, she felt she had grown a little that day.
