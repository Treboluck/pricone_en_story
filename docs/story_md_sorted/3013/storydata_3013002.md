## Subtitle: Meet Mr. Popular
  
**Narration：**  
As usual, Mimi, Misogi and Kyoka have gathered in Landosol  
to play together.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Look! Look! I drew a fluffy bunny! Isn't it the cutest?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hmmmm... I guess it's pretty cute,  
 but it'd look way cooler if you gave it some horns!  
Like this!  
  
**Mimi：**  
D-don't do that, Misogi!  
I'm going to show this picture to Mr. Nice Guy!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Mr. Nice Guy?  
Who the heck are you talking about?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Eheheh... That's a secret!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hmmmph! You're no fun, Mimi!  
Fine, then!  
I won't tell you anything about my special friend, either!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Both of you... I'm not sure what's going on exactly  
with all this talk of special friends...  
But could you focus a little more on our guild activities?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Aw, c'mon... You call it \"guild activities,\"  
but all we're doing today is drawing silly pictures!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
That's because Mimi won at rock-paper-scissors,  
so we're doing what she wants to do.  
Today's activity is drawing pictures!  
  
**Misogi：**  
And you call that guild stuff? It's so booooring!  
Aren't guilds meant to do way more cool and adventurey stuff?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Well, when you win at rock-paper-scissors,  
we'll all join in with whatever you want to do.  
Although, I might have to veto any ridiculous ideas...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Bahhhh!  
You're such a rule-follower, Kyoka!  
You goody-goody model student!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi, you're making it hard to tell  
whether those are supposed to be insults  
or just plain compliments.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Eheheh... Mr. Bunny, you're so cute!  
I hope Mr. Nice Guy will like this picture!  
...Ahh!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Is something wrong, Mimi?  
  
**Mimi：**  
I... I just remembered I need to be somewhere!  
I've got to hurry!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Well then, let's bring our guild activities  
to a close for today, shall we?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Good call!  
Heheh... Now that that's over, what fun should I have next?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ooh, I know! I just had a great idea!  
I'm gonna head home too!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Bye-bye now, Misogi!  
You too, Kyoka!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi, Mimi! Goodbye!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Whew. Now, what should I do next?  
It's a bit early to head home to the Elven Forest...  
But then, I don't really know anyone else here in Landosol...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Oh! There is that guy I met the other day. Is he still around?  
He was a bit of a weird one, but I suppose it's worth a look.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh! There he is!  
He seems to be loitering around aimlessly again...  
As usual, he looks like some kind of suspicious creep...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Hello again, {player}.  
What are you wandering around this area for?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Hmm? You seem to be lost?  
Really, though... How long is it going to take  
before you get used to the city layout?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I suppose there's nothing else for it. I'll see if I can get you back on track.  
Do you have some kind of map or a note to refer to?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh good, you do have a note. Let's see...  
 Oh?  
It looks like... Are you meeting up with someone?  
If this is the meeting time, you ought to hurry!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
There's barely any time left at all!  
Come on, we'd better run!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
*pant*... *pant*... *pant*...  
Ehm... What's the shortest route to this point...?  
If we turn into this back alley...  
 Ahhhh!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Owwww...  
What just happened?  
  
Is this some kind of pitfall?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
O-ow! That hurt!  
 Get off me, {player}!  
Weren't you following along behind me?  
Why did you fall into the hole as well?!  
  
**???：**  
Ahahahah! It totally worked!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Hmm? I know that laugh...  
  
**???：**  
Hey, mister! You all right down there?!  
Here, lemme toss you a rope so you can climb back up!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Y'know, mister, you've gotta at least try to look out for these things!  
How many times have I told you  
 to watch where you're walking?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi!  
I suppose this pitfall trap must be your doing?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? Kyoka?  
What're you doing in the hole with Mr. {player}?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I was just helping this man find his way around the city.  
I'm the one who should be asking why you seem to know him!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh, well, I'm like his training instructor!  
I'm teaching him how to be more careful  
and not fall for traps!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I... I'm not sure if you're perfect for that job,  
or the worst teacher imaginable...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahh! Look at the time!  
It's already past your meeting time!  
We need to hurry!  
  
**Misogi：**  
My training ain't easy, you know! Right, miste—  
Huh? Hey, Kyoka! Mister! Where are you going?!  
Wait for me!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
*pant*... *pant*... *pant*...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Th-the meeting point should be just up ahead!  
Right in front of that store...  
 Wait, huh?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ah!  
 Mr. Nice Guy! Over here!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
M-Mimi?!  
Don't tell me you're somehow friends with  
{player} here as well?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Kyoka? Misogi???  
Why are the two of you here with Mr. Nice Guy?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Mr. Nice Guy?  
Wait, the guy you were talking about  
was Mr. {player} the whole time?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Yep, that's him! I've been teaching him lots of things,  
like drawing, and writing!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Y-you're even learning from Mimi? A grown-up like you?  
Maybe you're more hopeless than I thought...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Thanks for all your help, Mimi, Misogi.  
**Choice: (2)**  Could you teach me too, Kyoka?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kyoka：**  
Wh-when you say it like that, it sounds like you're sayingI'm the only one who's unhelpful here!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kyoka：**  
M-me, teach a grown-up...?  
But I suppose... if you've lost your memories, that does make some sense...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kyoka：**  
All right, then.  
 I'll do what I can to help with this fellow's lessons.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Oh, you don't need to, Kyoka.  
I'm just fine teaching Mr. Nice Guy on my own.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh?! B-  
but if we teach him together,  
I'm sure it will help him learn faster...  
  
**Mimi：**  
No, I'm really OK on my own!  
Isn't that right, mister?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hey, no fair, Mimi!  
We're all in this guild together, so let me join in!  
  
**Mimi：**  
But Misogi, you're no good at studying...  
  
**Misogi：**  
I'll handle the physical lessons!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
R... Really, Mimi! You too, Misogi!  
Why are you letting your guard down so much around this guy?!  
Can't you see he's a very suspicious creep?! Just look at him!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Huh~? He's not a bad man!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Yeah, seriously!  
  
If you hate him so much, why don't you just leave him to us?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I-I'm worried about the two of you!  
So I have to keep an eye on him myself!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Is that understood, {player}?!  
If you try anything funny with my friends,  
I'll set off this Siren Amulet before you can say \"oops\"!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so the Little Lyrical guild wound up with a new mission:  
teaching {player} the ways of the world.
