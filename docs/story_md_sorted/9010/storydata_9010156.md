**Karyl：**  
Argh! Now I'm soaking wet from all the seawater!  
Ugh, I've had enough of the sea.  
I just wanna go straight home and take a shower!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But we've already come all this way,  
so why don't we head down to the beach for a bit?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I have no qualms with that so long as my lord allows it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We've got some time to spare, so why don't we take a dip in the water?  
Oh, that's right. You can't swim, huh, Karyl?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-who said I can't swim?!  
I was just thinking that I didn't feel like swimming today, that's all.  
Just so we're clear, it's not like I can't swim or anything! Got it?!
