# Snowy Night Encore
Nozomi and the others struggle against the elite reindeer that have mastered the power of Santa's sack. Though they cannot interfere while its power manipulates the townspeople, the three of them succeed in destroying the sack through their teamwork.

**Narration：**  
By the power of Santa Claus's sack,  
the people of Landosol have one by one been turned into reindeer.  
{player} and his entourage are rushing to put a stop to it.  
  
**Boss Reindeer：**  
Brrrooooooooaaaar!  
(I, the new Santa Claus,  
will destroy this holiday once and for all!)  
  
**Illya：**  
We've finally caught up!  
...I recognize this place.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It's where we held our holiday concert!  
  
**Christina：**  
You have a discerning eye choosing this venue... ♪  
Both singing and fighting are entertainment worthy of the stage.  
Let us make the most of this opportunity!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hold your tongue, Christina!  
This is not the time for solo ripostes!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hahah. ☆  
In situations like this, it is best to concede to your elders!  
  
**Illya：**  
*I* am the elder in this situation!  
  
**Christina：**  
Steel yourself! ☆  
  
**Boss Reindeer：**  
Broar!  
(Rngh!)  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It blocked the attack with its antler?!  
  
**Boss Reindeer：**  
Broooar!  
(Weakling!)  
  
**Christina：**  
We have a tough guy—  
Oh?  
  
**Illya：**  
You got knocked away?!  
Did I not warn you?!  
  
**Christina：**  
...'Tis but a scratch!  
  
**Christina：**  
It should be impossible for the reindeer to block my attack or even graze me...  
Is the response of my Numbers Avalon being dulled?  
Could it be the snow?  
  
**Christina：**  
Those muscles of yours are far more than meet the eye.  
You managed to land a solid blow the instant I hesitated... ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Are you okay, Producer?!  
You're laughing, but that was a bad hit...  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahahah! ☆ I cannot help but laugh!  
To face off against such a worthy foe on this special night  
is the greatest gift a girl could ever ask for!  
  
**Illya：**  
My apologies, but I must sequester your present, for now it is my turn!  
The only way to attack such a large adversary is from a distance!  
  
**Boss Reindeer：**  
Broar!  
(Futile!)  
  
**Illya：**  
My magic...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It was absorbed by the sack...  
  
**Illya：**  
So it's no holds barred, I see!  
  
**Boss Reindeer：**  
Broooooar!  
(Now you're on my naughty list!)  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Look out!  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
I-it's swinging its sack all over the place...!  
If I had been hit, it would have finished me off!  
Much obliged... I was saved thanks to you.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
To think that both your attacks would have no effect...  
Who would've thought those reindeer were that strong...?  
  
**Christina：**  
Ha. It is but a lowly reindeer.  
  
**Illya：**  
That is correct.  
It is no match for the legendary vampire.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
If we work together, I'm sure we can do something!  
  
**Boss Reindeer：**  
Brrrrrrrooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrr!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? Wh-what?! What's up with it all of a sudden?!  
  
**Illya：**  
That roar...  
I have a bad feeling about it.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmph. Does that reindeer have more tricks hiding in its sack?  
What's next?  
  
**Reindeer：**  
...Brouh.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? Look... it's all the people from town who were turned into reindeer!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmmmm. They've all gathered in this venue.  
  
**Illya：**  
My, is it getting lively...  
Even if it is nothing but reindeer.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  There's a legendary vampire here too.  
**Choice: (3)**  There's a famous idol here too.  
`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
Insolence! How dare you bundle me together with mere reindeer!  
What do you think I am?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hahah, how interesting.  
A legendary vampire would make quite the spectacle. ♪  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? Are you expecting me to do something?  
Ummm... Hi everyone, thanks for waiting!  
  
**Christina：**  
Idol of Carmina,  
there is no need to treat a reindeer as your rival...  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Illya：**  
But that roar...  
Could it be trying to—  
  
**Reindeer：**  
Broough!  
  
**Illya：**  
As I thought, it's controlling all the reindeer!  
  
**Christina：**  
As can only be expected from an elite reindeer.  
What amazing leadership!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Producer, this isn't the time to be praising it!  
The other reindeer are gathering in droves...!  
At this rate, we'll be surrounded in no time!  
  
**Boss Reindeer：**  
Brouh!  
(You're wide open!)  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Eeek!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Defend Nozomi.  
`Tag 5`  
**Nozomi：**  
{player}...!  
Thanks for protecting me!  
  
**Reindeer：**  
Brooough!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hngh... These reindeer are more of a nuisance than I expected.  
But they are former people, so we cannot simply cut them down.  
Unless...?  
Shall we just proceed to slice them up?  
  
**Illya：**  
Stay your hand!  
The day will come when they will be under my control, so I cannot permit you to do them harm!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Whether you'll rule them or not, we mustn't hurt them!  
Because I'm sure the townspeople, and even the elite reindeer,  
weren't bad to begin with!  
  
**Boss Reindeer：**  
Brouh, broooooar!  
(We refuse to accept a holiday that exploits reindeer labor!)  
  
**Christina：**  
Tch...! Do you actually have a grasp of the situation?  
We're not going to sit in a circle holding hands and singing Kumbaya.  
What an utterly naive sentiment.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...Yes we will!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Because today is...  
  
**Illya：**  
Ah, of course.  
Because today is...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  A happy holiday.  
`Tag 6`  
**Christina：**  
...I see.  
When you put it like that, I can do naught but stand down.  
  
**Christina：**  
Therefore,  
you must do something about these reindeer formerly known as people.  
Reindeer Prime belongs to me and Illya Ornstein.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? I'm supposed to deal with the reindeer people...?!  
What?! How...?  
  
**Christina：**  
Enough of the bewilderment.  
Tell me again what it is you are.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Me...?  
I am...  
an idol of Carmina!  
  
**Christina：**  
Then as an idol,  
do a splendid job as your producer demands!  
  
**Christina：**  
Be they Santa or be they reindeer,  
mesmerize them with your voice, Nozomi!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...Right!  
You got it, Producer!  
  
**Boss Reindeer：**  
Brrrooooooooaaar!  
(This holiday that causes only reindeer suffering ends here!)  
  
**Illya：**  
On your guard, Christina!
