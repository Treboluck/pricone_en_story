**Narration：**  
After leaving the reindeer to deal with their pursuers,  
the three Santa candidates get away from town.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmmm. Elizabeth Park, was it?  
It's certainly been a while.  
When was the last time...? Well, it doesn't really matter.  
  
**Illya：**  
It appears to be rather dilapidated...  
Are there actually people living here?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
No, I don't think that's the case...  
But what on earth happened here?  
The fences and stuff are all falling apart.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hey now, what's all this racket...?  
Y'all are gonna make me have a cow at this rate.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Mahiru?  
`Tag 1`  
**Mahiru：**  
Hm? {player}?  
Sorry, I can't think of nothin' funny right now.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm havin' a bad day.  
Even though it's the festive season and all, it's been udder chaos...  
A real crappy holiday... so I just can't laugh.  
  
**Illya：**  
Yet you jest much more than one would expect.  
Tell us, cow girl, what in the blazes happened here?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
What's with all the Santas?  
An ensemble garbed in the same ensemble.  
Comediennes...?  
No, street performers?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ummm... Yeah, something like that.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Well, if you'll hear me out, I'll talk.  
...Today's just been one disaster after another.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
First off, I made a whole load o' puddin'  
to sell as a new product at Elizabeth Park.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But just as I finished up, a reindeer came outta nowhere  
and just swiped it all away!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...Producer...  
  
**Illya：**  
...Christina....  
  
**Christina：**  
Don't point those fiery daggers in my direction.  
I'll get third-degree burns... ♪  
  
**Mahiru：**  
An' that ain't the half of it! I was out shovelin' snow  
when a torrent of crazy magic came rainin' down outta nowhere!  
Now the fences I just fixed  
are all smashed up again!  
  
**Christina：**  
...Hey, Illya Ornstein.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...That was Matsuri's...  
  
**Illya：**  
It was me?! The fault was mine?!  
Urghhh...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Because of that, I ain't got nothin' to sell,  
and I gotta pitchfork out for repairs!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
At this rate, we ain't gonna make it through the winter!  
Urghhh, I feel so bad for the residents of Elizabeth Park!  
  
**All：**  
......  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's give her a present.  
`Tag 2`  
**Nozomi：**  
A present...!  
Yeah, let's do that, {player}!  
  
**Illya：**  
We are Santa Claus...  
candidates after all!  
  
**Christina：**  
The boy is right.  
To those lamenting their misfortune, are we not duty bound to consign good luck...? ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
In other words, we must restore Elizabeth Park, correct?  
Management happens to be a specialty of mine. ☆  
I have an idea.  
  
**Illya：**  
Hold your reindeer, Christina.  
I too have a glimmer of an idea.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It's gonna be okay, right...?  
Whose idea do you think will be better, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I want to see Christina's idea.  
**Choice: (4)**  I want to see Illya's idea.  
`Tag 3`  
**Christina：**  
Very well.  
  
**Christina：**  
Those around me seem to believe that I can only live on the battlefield.  
But I'll have you know,  
I am also a shrewd businesswoman.  
Consulting is easier than wielding a sword.  
  
**Christina：**  
Mahiru, was it? You are the manager, correct?  
Your pudding idea was right on the mark.  
Having a specialty is the basis of all commerce.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ah, thank ya...?  
  
**Christina：**  
However, it is not acceptable for pudding to be the only product you sell.  
Even if your customer pulling power increases, it will only be temporary.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Aha... I think I get what you're sayin'.  
So whaddya reckon I should do...?  
  
**Christina：**  
If you wish to sell food,  
then seize control of the stomachs of each and every customer.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...!  
  
**Christina：**  
Commandeer their culinary cravings,  
and hold them captive until they are fully satiated.  
That's how to do business... ♪  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Th-that's a fantastic idea...!  
How should I go about it?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmmm...  
  
**Christina：**  
Establish a steakhouse here!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
......  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Christina：**  
Fortunately, it seems you have... good quality ingredients here.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Th-there ain't no way!  
Everyone on the ranch is like one big, happy family!  
  
**Christina：**  
Rest assured.  
I shall guarantee the taste.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
That ain't what I mean!

`Tag 4`  
**Illya：**  
Very good, very good.  
  
**Illya：**  
From the looks of it, despite this ranch being large, there are few animals.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Sure, I'd love a large ranch with lotsa animals,  
but we just ain't got enough manpower, so carin' for 'em all'd be pretty tough.  
Any more chores, an' Rinrin, Shioshio, an' Limalima are sure to keel over.  
  
**Illya：**  
Yes. I can tell you lack servants simply by looking.  
However, it must not be so.  
People tend to shy away from deserted, rueful places such as this.  
  
**Illya：**  
Hence, my gift to you.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Huh...?  
Somethin' feels kinda weird... The wind is pickin' up...  
  
**Illya：**  
Now that I am in my original form,  
I can put my underlings to work at will!  
Come now, my servants!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wh-what's goin' on?!  
Holy cow! Th-there's bats comin' from all over the place!  
  
**Illya：**  
Heheheh! What say you? Adorable, are they not?!  
They are numerous and easy to handle.  
  
**Illya：**  
With them, Elizabeth Park will become livelier,  
and visitors are sure to come in droves.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
There ain't no way that's happenin'!  
The ranch turned so black so fast,  
I oughtta be callin' it Elizabeth Dark!  
  
**Illya：**  
You managed to make a joke out of that...?  
  
You truly are adept...!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, really?!  
I gotta write that down—  
Wait, no!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Look!  
The animals are all kickin' up a fuss!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hrk. Urgh... It appears bats were the wrong call...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hurry and get 'em outta here!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Mahiru：**  
*sigh...* We ain't survivin' this winter after all...  
We're all gonna freeze in this frigid weather...!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Don't give up... There must be a way!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
We're bound to think of something!  
  
**Illya：**  
...Hm?  
Nozomi, what have you been doing all this time?  
  
**Christina：**  
From over here,  
it looks as though you're excavating random holes in the ground...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Elizabeth Park is really big, and the scenery is beautiful!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
So I thought it would be nice if there was a hot spring or something here!  
  
**Illya：**  
I-I see...  
I believe I grasp the concept...  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah. ☆ To think up such an idea and put it into action  
is no less than what I would expect from the Carmina idol  
who can make even crying children laugh.  
  
**Christina：**  
However, although I admire your slow-and-steady attitude,  
merely digging like that will get you nowhere.  
Gouging out a hot spring by hand is unrealistic in the first place.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But still!  
I'm...!  
A Santa Claus... candidate!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  A miracle is bound to happen.  
`Tag 6`  
**Nozomi：**  
I know, right?!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Y'all would... do this much for Elizabeth Park...?!  
  
**Illya：**  
...Now I understand.  
This is one of those fabled holiday miracles.  
  
**Christina：**  
Why is it that I now find myself believing...? ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Producer, Illya!  
  
**Christina：**  
Illya Ornstein.  
Do you think you have it in you?  
  
**Illya：**  
'Tis but a trifle.  
On the contrary, holding back is the struggle.  
  
**Christina：**  
Everyone, vacate the area.  
Do not blame me if you get caught up in it.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
C-caught up in what...?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Mahiru, you too...!  
  
**Illya：**  
Here I go—Vermilion Bite!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Amazing! She exposed the bedrock in an instant!  
  
**Christina：**  
Now it's my turn to let off a little steam... ☆

**Nozomi：**  
A hot spring...  
  
**Christina：**  
A hot spring.  
  
**Illya：**  
'Tis a hot spring.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I-it's like a dream...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I can't believe it! A real hot spring!  
This'll be the centerpiece of Elizabeth Park!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm sorry for callin' y'all street performers!  
Y'all are the real thing!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Eheh. Glad you feel that way!  
  
**Elite Reindeer 2：**  
Brooough...?  
(What are they up to this time...?)  
  
**Illya：**  
Hm?  
Oh, the reindeer—they have finally returned!  
What impeccable timing!  
  
**Elite Reindeer 2：**  
B-brooough?  
(I've got a bad feeling about this.)  
  
**Christina：**  
We're about to commence constructing a hot spring here,  
so you'll be gathering the materials for us.  
We'll build a grand tourist destination to my liking... ♪  
  
**Elite Reindeer 1：**  
Broooooooooough?!  
(Hot spriiiiiiiiiing?!)  
  
**Narration：**  
And so came to be Elizabeth Park's newest attraction—  
the hot spring.  
  
**Elite Reindeer 1：**  
Brooough, brooough!  
(I can't take it anymore! I've had it up to my neck... no, my antlers, with you!  
What do you think we are?!)  
  
**Elite Reindeer 2：**  
Brooough, brooough!  
(Damn holiday! Year after year we have to run around all over the place!  
I want to make them understand how we feel!)  
  
**Elite Reindeer 3：**  
...Brrgh, brooough.  
(...I think I have an idea.)  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Feels like I've seen these reindeer before...  
Where was it now...?
