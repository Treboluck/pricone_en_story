**Christina：**  
Fighting this long and hard is a magnificent feat.  
You have impressed me, boy.  
  
**Christina：**  
What say after the battle has come to an end, you and I exchange gifts?♪  
Heh, I merely jest.  
Don't run away and leave me by my lonesome.  
Now, let us enjoy this time together.  
  
**Christina：**  
We will decide what happens after that when the time comes. ☆
