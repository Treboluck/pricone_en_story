**Nozomi：**  
We won...?  
We really won, didn't we...?  
  
**Illya：**  
Indeed. What an arduous endeavor that battle turned out to be.  
It appears the reindeer are no longer able to move.  
  
**Christina：**  
Now then, whatever shall we do with these  
insolent traitors who turned against their master...?  
  
**Illya：**  
Christina... I do not mean to stymie your enjoyment;  
however, today is a special day. A little restraint might be advised...  
  
**Christina：**  
No need to tell me.  
I do not hold a grudge against them.  
Rather, I would say I am grateful,  
for I have been the recipient of a very stimulating holiday experience.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Producer...!  
You're really strict about loads of stuff,  
but you're actually pretty kind!  
  
**Illya：**  
Indeed. Christina's outward image is one of intrepidness,  
but in reality she is simply lonely.  
  
**Christina：**  
Both of you, line up over there.  
It's about time you received your special presents from Christina Claus. ☆
