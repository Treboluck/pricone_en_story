Mr. Reindeer, enough is enough!  
Today is supposed to be a happy holiday!  
  
**Christina：**  
Pointless. Words alone can no longer get through to it.  
Do you sense that indomitable spirit fiery enough to melt away the snow?  
That is the manifestation of the reindeer's true feelings.  
  
**Illya：**  
That reindeer, to think it had this much power all along...!  
It looks as though we too shall have to battle with all our might!  
  
**Christina：**  
Heh. A fight to the death is what I've always wanted.  
Let's show each other what we're made of!  
Put your heart, soul, blood, sweat, tears, and everything else into it!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...Sorry, Mr. Reindeer.  
Now we're also going to fight with all we've got!  
  
**Illya：**  
The inelegant scuffling ends now!  
For you see, today is a special day!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
When the battle is over, let's join with the reindeer  
to enjoy the holidays one more time!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah. ☆ I'm enjoying myself plenty right now.  
However, if there is something more entertaining than this,  
I shall use my whole might to put an end to this conflict.  
  
**All：**  
For a happy holiday!
