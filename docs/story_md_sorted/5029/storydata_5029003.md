# Attack on Santa
The Santa candidates deliver gifts in a slapdash manner all over Landosol. As the girls continue their wild Santa activities, the reindeer are forced to deal with the problems that arise in the process.
  
## Subtitle: Attack on Santa
  
**Narration：**  
It's the holiday season, and the townscape is painted pure white in snow.  
Christina, Illya, and Nozomi continue  
spreading cheer (?) throughout Landosol.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hmmm... I wanna play a huge prank.  
  
**Misogi：**  
I'm already bored of pitfall traps and trick boxes.  
Mister {player} always falls for my tricks,  
but it's the holidays, so I wanna to do something fancy.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? Something just fell from the sky.  
What the heck is it...? It's round and black.  
Could it be... a bomb?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Wow! Awesome!I've never seen one so big!  
Woohoo! Even Mister {player} will be surprised by this!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
*sigh*... The holidays are almost over...  
I'll have to put away the holiday tree and all its decorations...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
It's a little sad...  
If only we could have a huge tree outside, we'd always be able to enjoy it.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh?! Whaaaat?!  
There's a massive tree growing outside...  
And it's twisting around...!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Is it really a tree? It's moving... I'm scared!  
What is it? What should I do?  
Waaah! Mama Saren!  
  
**Boy：**  
What did you ask Santa for?  
  
**Girl：**  
I wished to travel! How about you?  
  
**Boy：**  
I asked for a huuuge airship!  
  
**Girl：**  
Ah! Then we can go traveling on the airship!  
Hehe. I hope Santa pays us a visit!  
  
**Boy：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey, have you heard, Kaori?  
  
**Kaori：**  
What's that? *munch, munch*  
  
**Makoto：**  
They say that all over Landosol, strange things have been happening.  
Like weird things falling from the sky, or something.  
  
**Kaori：**  
From the sky?  
Ah! Do you think it's Santa Claus?  
*munch, munch* *munch, munch*  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh yeah, it's that time of the season today.  
By the way, what have you been munching on all this time? We're on patrol, you know.  
  
**Kaori：**  
This?  
It fell from the sky earlier!  
Right when I was feeling hungry. Perfect timing. ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
From the sky...  
For real?  
  
**Akino：**  
You over there, people of Caon!  
Might I ask a favor?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
What is it?! What's wrong?!  
  
**Akino：**  
Larceny! There are thieves in this town!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oh no, that's crazy! *munch, munch!*  
What was stolen? *gulp!*  
  
**Akino：**  
An airship!  
  
**Makoto：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Akino：**  
During a test flight of the airship I recently purchased,  
I was assailed by thieves...!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Airships... can be stolen...?  
  
**Akino：**  
Somehow some reindeer got onboard, and it was all over so quickly!  
Anyway, I want you to retrieve it for me!  
There's no doubt that the criminal who orchestrated the hijacking was...  
  
**Akino：**  
Santa Claus!  
  
**Makoto & Kaori：**  
...Santa Claus?  
  
**Christina：**  
Hahaha.  
All fine, smooth, and dandy. I'm starting to think  
that I was Santa Claus all along... ♪  
  
**Illya：**  
It certainly has been an entertaining trial!  
The joyous countenances of the townsfolk are not an unpleasant sight.  
The qualities of a ruler residing in me are quite frightening... ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ummm... Is this really all right...?  
We *are* giving people the things they want, but...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Santa Claus is fun.  
**Choice: (2)**  Santa Claus is scary.  
`Tag 1`  
**Nozomi：**  
...I see.  
Well, if you're having fun... then I guess it's no problem, right?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wait. You have amnesia, don't you?  
You don't really know how Santa Claus is supposed to act...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
Yes. With the amount of joy that I have dispensed,  
harboring fear is a given.  
After all, fear and joy are but two sides of the same coin.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I don't think it's that complicated...  
  
**Christina：**  
We're simply not smiling brightly enough.  
All we need is to conduct business while laughing at the top of our lungs!  
Ahahahahah! ☆  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I don't think it's that simple either...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Christina：**  
At any rate, just look at the masses dancing with delight.  
It's a absolute given that I will become Santa... ☆  
  
**Elite Reindeer 1：**  
...!  
  
**Illya：**  
What are you blathering about, Christina?  
Did you not hear all the jubilant screams from the recipients of my gifts?  
Such joy is proof that *I* have what it takes to be Santa.  
  
**Elite Reindeer 2：**  
...!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I-if those two become Santa Claus,  
Landosol is in for a really bad time!  
  
**Akino：**  
Aha! Found you!  
Those gaudy costumes—you're definitely the hijackers!  
  
**Kaori：**  
It really is Santa Claus!  
Thanks for the goya veggies earlier!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Now's not the time for thanks!  
Hey, you four over there! I need a word!  
Huh? Haven't I seen those guys before...?  
  
**Christina：**  
Uh-oh, this is bad. ☆  
  
**Illya：**  
Tch. They've found us!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hey, you two!  
Don't you think your reactions make you seem like criminals?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Reindeer, engage!  
Buy us some time... ♪  
  
**Elite Reindeer 1：**  
Broogh?  
(Us?!)  
  
**Illya：**  
We're depending on you, reindeer!  
Fight unto death!  
  
**Elite Reindeer 2：**  
Brooogh?!  
(You're kidding?!)  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I'm so sorry, Mr. Reindeer!  
  
**Elite Reindeer 3：**  
...Brooooough!  
(...This is it!)  
  
**Makoto：**  
What the—?! Reindeer?!  
  
**Kaori：**  
If you insist on getting in the way,  
I'll just have to teach you to be a little more obedient!  
Hyaaa! ♪  
  
**Elite Reindeer 3：**  
Broough!  
(Wha—?!)  
  
**Kaori：**  
It blocked my attack?!  
Nice antler work!  
  
**Akino：**  
Ah! The bandits are getting away!  
  
**Makoto：**  
What's up with these reindeer?!  
They're far too strong...  
  
**Akino：**  
Santa Claus, hold it right there!  
  
**Christina：**  
Who in their right mind would stop mid-flight because they were told to?  
Not Santa, that's for certain... ♪  
  
**Illya：**  
If it is presents you desire, then you can wait patiently at home  
like everybody else!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
We're honestly trying to become Santa, aren't we?  
Because I'm not so sure anymore!  
  
**Narration：**  
The band of Santas running around Landosol  
were greeted by an endless stream of happy (?) voices  
wherever they went.  
  
**Elite Reindeer 3：**  
Br-brooough.  
(Ow, ouch...)  
  
**Elite Reindeer 1：**  
Brrrroooough!  
(Why are we forced to fight?!)  
  
**Elite Reindeer 2：**  
Broough, broough, broooooough!  
(This *definitely* isn't a reindeer's job!)
