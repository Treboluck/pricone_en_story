What on earth? The reindeer produced something from the sack!  
They are our spitting images...  
What is the meaning of this?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ohhh. Things are getting interesting. The incomparable Christina has  
her very own double... This is shaping up to be quite the party!  
Do not disappoint me, now, doppelganger!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I don't care how much it looks like me,  
there's no way it can do what I can!  
I'll show that thing, whatever it is, the true brilliance of an idol!  
  
**Illya：**  
There can only be one Ruler of the Night.  
I shall teach it the difference between the two of us!  
  
**Christina：**  
Come, intrepid imposters! See if you cannot magnificently  
lay us low and take the places of those you imitate!  
Hahaha, but the real Christina is not such a feeble opponent.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Producer,
