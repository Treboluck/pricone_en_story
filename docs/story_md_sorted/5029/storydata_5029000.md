**Nozomi：**  
Everyone!  
Thanks for coming to Carmina's holiday show!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Tonight, I hope Santa Claus  
pays you all a visit! ♪  
  
**Narration：**  
It's a snowy holiday.  
The curtain falls on Carmina's holiday concert during a frenzy of excitement.  
  
**Christina：**  
Good work, as always.You outdid yourself.  
I imagine you may have tired of applause by now, but you should embrace it.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Producer!  
How was our show? Did we do okay?  
  
**Christina：**  
Yes, very well indeed.  
I'm pleased to see Carmina is making great strides.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Thank you very much!  
Tsumugi and Chika are thankful too!  
I know it was sudden, but we appreciate you being our producer!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah.  
I hate boredom above all else.  
If there is pleasure to be found in an endeavor, I will find it.  
  
**Christina：**  
Besides, it's a very merry holiday, is it not?  
I have no intention of playing Santa Claus,  
but surely it cannot hurt to bring some revelry to the jovial populace.  
  
**Illya：**  
Well, it was so noisy that I considered complaining,  
but that concert was quite a sight.  
It was right of me to accept your invitation.  
  
**Illya：**  
Oh, look over there.  
It's the idol girl from earlier.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh?  
  
**Christina：**  
Hm? Has a lost child wandered in here?  
Only permitted persons are allowed in here,  
little miss.  
  
**Illya：**  
Who are you calling \"little miss\"?!  
I am Illya Ornstein, Ruler of the Night!  
From where I stand, it is you who is a veritable little girl.  
  
**Christina：**  
Impertinence. I am Christina.  
Illya Ornstein...  
Hmmm, I've heard that name before,  
but where...?  
  
**Illya：**  
No, never mind who I am.  
The one we are here to see is the idol girl over there.  
...Come along, now. If you have something to discuss, then get on with it.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, it's you!  
  
**Christina：**  
My my, if it isn't you, boy.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
{player}!  
You came to see our holiday show!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Thanks for the ticket.  
`Tag 1`  
**Nozomi：**  
Aw, no need to thank me!  
I mean, I wanted you to come see us!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hohoh. Doling out VIP tickets, were we?  
No wonder they managed to get backstage.  
Pity, I was itching to teach the security team a good lesson... ♪  
  
**Illya：**  
I simply followed {player}  
and was permitted entrance as well.  
  
**Christina：**  
It seems security *will* be getting the gift of pain this year.  
It is the holiday after all...♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Producer, go easy on them...  
  
**Illya：**  
You would make quite the Santa Claus...  
  
**Illya：**  
...Hm? What is that curious sound...?  
  
**Christina：**  
What was that? The jingling of bells...?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It's coming from above.  
`Tag 2`  
**Nozomi：**  
Everyone, look! Are those... reindeer?!  
There are reindeer flying in the sky!  
  
**Illya：**  
Are they pulling a sleigh?  
Don't tell me...  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh? Apparently it intends to land here.  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Ho ho ho!  
Happy holidays, my dear ladies!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...Santa Claus?  
  
**Illya：**  
Well, this is a certainly a first...  
  
**Christina：**  
No doubt about it—this time definitely qualifies as trespassing.  
After showing you true pain, I shall ask you to leave.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh?!  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Ho?! H-hold on a minute!  
I'm Santa Claus... Look, here are my reindeer...  
  
**Christina：**  
You have no proof.  
There is a high chance that you are simply a red suit-wearing, reindeer-steering, flying intruder. Am I wrong?  
  
**Illya：**  
Hm... Now that you mention it...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
No one can really argue when you put it like that.  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Yeesh!  
*I* require proof? What a cruel world!  
Ah, I have an idea! You, boy. With the innocent eyes!  
Tell me, is there anything that you want right now?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Something to keep me warm.  
`Tag 3`  
**Santa Claus：**  
Ho ho ho! Piece of fruitcake!  
Ladies, watch this!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
He pulled a scarf and gloves out of his massive sack...!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmph. Surely they were already in there.  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Ho ho ho! There's more where that came from!  
How about a heater? And a kotatsu?  
And here, have a freshly baked sweet potato!  
  
**Illya：**  
Ohhh! A bounty of heat!  
That sack, what is its secret?  
The items it produces are clearly larger than the sack itself...  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Which is proof that I'm Santa Claus.  
My magic sack produces whatever a person wishes for.  
  
**Christina：**  
Whatever a person wishes for...  
Oho.  
  
**Illya：**  
Whatever a person wishes for...  
Hmmm.  
  
**Christina：**  
...It appears you're not just full of stuffing and lies after all.  
Well then, state your business. I've certainly been a good girl,  
but I am no longer of the age to appreciate holiday gifts.  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Ho ho. So be it. The truth is,  
I am searching in this area for someone to become the new Santa Claus.  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
As I was flying in the sky, I heard many merry voices  
singing in unison with a pleasant carol. I came to pay a visit  
to the source of all the jollity, as I believe that person has the gift.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Do you mean... the holiday concert earlier...?  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
How about it, miss pop star?  
If it pleases you, would you care to have a go at being Santa Claus?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Y-yes! I'd love to!  
If I could become Santa Claus and bring happiness to millions,  
I'm sure it would count as another success as an idol!  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Very good, very good.  
If that's the case, then take my sack—  
  
**Christina & Illya：**  
Hold your reindeer, Santa!  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
W-what?!  
  
**Christina：**  
This becoming Santa Claus thing...  
  
**Illya：**  
We want to do it as well!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh?  
Producer and Illya too...?  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Ho ho. Such passion! I find it difficult to refuse.  
You there, do you think these two can handle it?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Should be entertaining.  
**Choice: (5)**  ...Um...  
`Tag 4`  
**Christina：**  
Yes, yes. That's my boy,  
honest to a fault... ♪  
  
**Illya：**  
Though I do question what you mean by \"entertaining.\"

`Tag 5`  
**Illya：**  
Why are you at a loss for words?  
My minion, will you not look at me?! Do not avert your gaze!  
  
**Christina：**  
The boy appears to have misunderstood something.  
We are sincere in our desire to bring joy to the people.  
Let's talk about it in the back. In depth... ♪  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Santa Claus：**  
Hmmm. I have some reservations, but...  
so be it!  
Well then, ladies, I nominate you as Santa Claus candidates!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Did you just say Santa... candidates?  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Indeed. There aren't many of these sacks out there, you see.  
So out of the three of you, I can only choose one.  
  
**Christina：**  
There can only be one Santa, correct?  
Then how shall we decide?  
A trial of strength would help save time immensely. ♪  
  
**Illya：**  
Do you think you are the only one with confidence in their might?  
If only I could return to my true form...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Come on, can the two of you please not  
make faces that would make children cry?!  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
As you all know, Santa's mission is to give out presents.  
Therefore, I shall ask you to deliver presents to the people of this town  
without using the power of my sack.  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
The contender who brings joy to the most people shall win my recognition as worthy to be Santa.  
  
**Christina：**  
This will be entertaining... ♪  
  
**Illya：**  
Very well...!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I won't lose!  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Well then, here's a freebie for each of you.  
I need you to look the part.  
Ho ho ho!

**All：**  
Oh?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmmm... To think even our appearance would change. It's the real deal, the power of that sack.  
Hmm? ...Illya Ornstein, what happened to your childish body?  
  
**Illya：**  
Oh! I have returned to my original form!  
And without borrowing {player}'s power!  
More and more do I find myself coveting the sack...!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
This outfit is sooo cute... ♪  
Yeah, now I feel ready for the challenge!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Do your best, everyone!  
`Tag 7`  
**Christina：**  
Hmph, of course, boy.  
  
**Illya：**  
Just you watch, my minion.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I know you've got my back!  
  
**All：**  
The one who will become Santa Claus is me!
