# Gift for the Gifters
After the reindeer return to their original forms, Christina and Ilya urge them to accompany them to the newly excavated hot spring. There they all soak in the tub in order to recover from their holiday fatigue.
  
## Subtitle: Gift for the Gifters
  
**Narration：**  
The reindeer rebellion on an otherwise holy night  
has been put down thanks to the efforts of {player} and friends.  
The town returns to how it was before. Afterwards—  
  
**Christina：**  
Now, what shall we have them do?  
  
**Illya：**  
Exactly. They turned against their master.  
\"Sorry\" will not suffice.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ummm... I think we should first listen to  
what the reindeer have to say for themselves.  
  
**Elite Reindeer 1：**  
B-brooough!  
(We, erm, were annoyed...)  
  
**Elite Reindeer 2：**  
Broobrbr!  
(Every year we're forced to work hard...)  
  
**Elite Reindeer 3：**  
Broh brooough!  
(We don't even get any presents...)  
  
**Christina & Illya：**  
Nope. Didn't understand a thing.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
W-well, I can't say I did either!  
But listen, some things do make it across the language barrier...  
Say, you think so too, right, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I understand.  
**Choice: (2)**  Brooough.  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
You seem so sure about yourself, {player}.  
But are you certain of the veracity of your claim?

**Christina：**  
What's this? You can speak Reindeerese?  
If that's the case, boy, won't you become my reindeer?  
What say you? You decline?  
Hmph. What a pity... ☆  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Santa Claus：**  
Hold on a moment, ladies.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Santa...  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
I would like  
a word with the reindeer...  
  
**Elite Reindeer：**  
......  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
...I'm sorry, my boys.  
Even though I've taken care of you for years and years,  
I suppose I just never understood your feelings.  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
While I was transformed into a reindeer, I was able to hear your voices.  
As well as your sorrow, resentment, and bitterness because you cannot  
enjoy the holiday yourselves...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
So that's why...  
Sorry, reindeer.  
We were being nothing but selfish...  
  
**Elite Reindeer：**  
...Broough...  
(...Master...)  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
I really am sorry.  
To Santa, reindeer are supposed to be irreplaceable companions...  
As someone who distributes joy, I could not have been more foolish.  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Please... please... forgive me...!  
If you weren't here with me, there would be no Santa Claus.  
I am only Santa Claus because of you elite reindeer...!  
  
**Elite Reindeer：**  
Broough... brooough...!  
(That goes for us as well... We forgot that if you weren't here, we wouldn't be elite.  
We'd just be ordinary wild reindeer... We're so sorry...!)  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...Thank goodness  
It looks like the reindeer have forgiven us...!  
  
**Christina：**  
So, have we come to an agreement?  
Then let us move on.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh?  
  
**Elite Reindeer：**  
Bruhh?  
  
**Christina：**  
Come now.  
You attacked me. Did you really think I would let you get away with it scot-free?  
  
**Illya：**  
Yes, yes.  
The cost of treason must be paid with one's flesh.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
What? Are you for real?!  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Sorry! This incident is entirely my fault—  
it was caused by my lack of compassion!  
I beg you, will you not forgive these reindeer...?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
That's right, Producer! Illya!  
We're about to resolve the situation!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmph.  
Do as I say and follow me.  
  
**Illya：**  
Yes, right now.  
If you do not make haste, the holidays will draw to an end.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ahhh, just wait, please!  
Can't you see that you're both being so selfish...?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? Why are we here...?  
  
**Christina：**  
What are you doing? Remove that clothing at once.  
Do you need me to take it off for you? Spoiled child... ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh?! W-wait a minute, Producer!  
{player} is still here!  
  
**Illya：**  
I-insolence, {player}! Why did you follow us in here?  
The men's bath is over there!

**Christina：**  
Ahhh. A splendid hot spring!  
  
**Illya：**  
Agreed.  
I can feel it in my bones!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ummm... Er... Producer, Illya.  
Why the hot spring all of a sudden?  
  
**Christina：**  
Because I wanted a nice, relaxing bath.  
  
**Illya：**  
We did excavate it, after all.  
  
**Christina：**  
...Well, that's one of the reasons.  
We've done nothing but run around all day.  
  
**Illya：**  
...The best treatment for a weary body  
is an extended soak in a pleasant hot spring.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Is that... for the sake of the reindeer...?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Come now, don't give me those puppy-dog eyes.  
You'll make me light-headed.  
  
**Illya：**  
Christina is the one who suggested it.  
Her words and deeds belie her appearance. She is actually quite kind.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah. ☆  
One day I wish to get to know you better on the battlefield,  
O legendary vampire.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Producer is really strict about a lot of things,  
but she's been so kind to all of us in Carmina.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hah. You may call me Lady Christina the Kind.  
...By the way, boy, how is the water temperature over there?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Could be hotter.  
**Choice: (5)**  It's super hot.  
`Tag 4`  
**Illya：**  
Oh. {player} likes it hot, does he?  
Now that I am small again, the water feels as though it is boiling to me.  
  
**Christina：**  
Illya Ornstein.  
The point of a hot spring is to be fully submerged, is it not?  
Allow me to assist you... ♪  
  
**Illya：**  
Glub, blub!  
Cease this at once, Christina! My small stature does not permit you to  
make merry with my body as it pleases you!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hehe. They both look like they're having lots of fun.

`Tag 5`  
**Christina：**  
Hot is exactly how it should be.  
You ought to enjoy the sensation of your body boiling... ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
The falling snow is keeping my head just cool enough.  
I could stay here forever.  
  
**Illya：**  
This is delightful. I could use a hot spring at my castle.  
What say you, Nozomi? Are you up to the task again?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
N-not really... I think I'll pass.

**Nozomi：**  
Hee hee.  
The reindeer are singing like they're having fun too.  
  
**Illya：**  
Yet I find a holiday hot spring visit  
somewhat out of the ordinary.  
  
**Christina：**  
What are you talking about?  
Today we are all Santa Claus.  
  
**Illya：**  
! Oh,  
that is correct, that is correct.  
  
**Christina：**  
For Santa Claus, this holiday is a battlefield.  
After combat, alleviating one's fatigue is only natural.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Yes, Producer!  
  
**Illya：**  
Well,  
can we at least say it?  
  
**Christina：**  
Hm...?  
Ah, of course.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh yeah!  
Okay, all together now!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
One, two, three...  
  
**All：**  
Happy Holidays! ♪  
  
**Narration：**  
As the holy night drew to a close, the voices of the new Santa Clauses  
echoed high into the snowy sky.

**Illya：**  
Oh, incidentally,  
what happened to the whole \"becoming Santa Claus\" situation?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ah, yeah, good question!  
  
**Christina：**  
Indeed.  
Such an ambiguous ending just will not do.  
I am most certainly the one chosen by the...  
Hm? The magic sack...?  
  
**Illya：**  
...Christina, correct me if I am wrong,  
but earlier this evening, you shredded the magic sack to pieces...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
There aren't many of those sacks in existence  
according to Santa, right?  
  
**Christina：**  
...Hmmm.  
  
**Illya：**  
Christina...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Producer...  
  
**Christina：**  
Well, this is a hot spring after all.  
How about we just let everything wash down the drain?  
  
**Illya & Nozomi：**  
...*sigh*
