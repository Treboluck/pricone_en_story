# Silent Night, Insurgent Night
Just as a new Santa Claus is about to be chosen, the reindeer plot a rebellion and snatch Santa's sack. They use its mighty power to transform themselves, and begin exacting their revenge by turning the townspeople into reindeer.
  
## Subtitle: Silent Night, Insurgent Night
  
**Narration：**  
The three Santa Claus candidates return to Landosol.  
With the setting sun, the end of the day approaches.  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Ho ho ho!  
Good work, ladies.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Santa?!  
  
**Christina：**  
What happened to you? You were nowhere to be seen.  
Can you honestly say you were auditing our activities?  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Of course.  
I watched very carefully.  
  
**Illya：**  
If that is true, then fine...  
But your being here right now  
suggests that you have selected your Santa, correct?  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Correct. I've had the pleasure of watching up until now,  
and honestly, all three of you did rather well.  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Surmising people's wishes,  
and running around fulfilling them—  
In a word, splendid!  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
There were a few points where you went overboard,  
but that was all an expression of your desire to bring joy to others.  
In order to be Santa Claus, such an attitude is indispensable.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmph, that goes without saying. ☆  
  
**Illya：**  
I am the woman who will one day rule this world.  
Hearing the wishes of the common folk is my duty.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It was super fun!  
Being Santa must have been a wonderful job!  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
So, as to who will inherit my sack...  
To be honest, you all did a fantastic job.  
  
**Christina：**  
Whoa there. Don't tell me  
you're going to be a coward and have all three of us be Santa.  
  
**Illya：**  
That is unacceptable.  
Have all our efforts been for naught?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Yeah. Since we all worked so hard,  
I think we need a clear result.  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Ho ho. Understood, understood.  
In that case, in my stead, let's have him decide for us.  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
He has been watching your activities more closely than anyone else,  
so let's ask him to choose who is worthiest of being Santa Claus.  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
If we do this, I assume you ladies will voice no grievances?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Great idea!  
If {player}'s the one making the decision,  
then I can accept any outcome!  
  
**Christina：**  
He is certainly more trustworthy  
than a Santa we only met today.  
  
**Illya：**  
Agreed. Well then, we shall have {player} take his pick.  
Now, who is the first to come to mind?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I think Christina would be best.  
**Choice: (2)**  I think Illya would be best.  
**Choice: (3)**  I think Nozomi would be best.  
`Tag 1`  
**Christina：**  
Heh. I knew I could count on you to make the right choice, boy.  
I shall take the time to praise you properly later... ♪  
  
**Illya：**  
Grrr... To lose to the likes of her...!  
However, results are results. I must accept the outcome.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Yeah. I agree that Producer will definitely prepare gifts  
that everyone will enjoy.

`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
As expected of {player}—an excellent decision!  
I wonder if someday  
we will become like Mr. and Mrs. Claus...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Congratulations, Illya!  
I'm looking forward to all my presents!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmmm. Much to my chagrin,  
I shall yield to you, Illya Ornstein.  
I'm certain you'll make it an exciting holiday to my liking... ♪

`Tag 3`  
**Nozomi：**  
For real?!  
Thank you so much!  
Eheheh, it's a dream come true...!  
  
**Christina：**  
I suppose the idol of Carmina wasn't a fraud after all.  
A pop star who is also Santa Claus  
would be well worth producing. ♪  
  
**Illya：**  
Your present to me shall be a ticket to your next concert.  
I await patiently!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Santa Claus：**  
Ho ho. I see.  
I shall trust in your convictions.  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Well then, to the chosen one I give this sack—  
  
**Elite Reindeer 1：**  
Broooooooooouuuugh!  
(I won't let that happeeeeeeen!)  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Oof?!  
Th-there's no need for that!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Mr. Reindeer?!  
Ah! It stole Santa's sack...!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hold it right there!  
  
**Christina：**  
Return that at once!  
  
**Elite Reindeer 2：**  
Brooough!  
(Out of my way!)  
  
**Illya：**  
Hngh!  
Recreant...! What is the meaning of this?  
How dare you attack without warning...!  
  
**Christina：**  
Nice attack.  
It would have been inexcusable, had it landed.  
  
**Elite Reindeer 3：**  
Brooough! Brrrrroough!  
(I'm sick of you people! I can't keep up with your nonsense!)  
  
**Nozomi：**  
What's the matter with them?!  
They look kind of angry...!  
  
**Christina：**  
Nothing's the matter. It's obviously a plot to rebel against their master.  
I know because I've been there myself... ♪  
  
**Illya：**  
Christina, all your experiences are so dark.  
Anyway, what are we going to do about this situation?  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
My boys, simmer your tempers!  
This is no way for elite reindeer to act! Why all the histrionics?!  
  
**Elite Reindeer：**  
Brrrrooooooooooough!  
(So that we can become Santa!)  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wait, Santa!  
They're up to something...!  
  
**Illya：**  
What...?  
The reindeer all jumped inside Santa's sack?!  
  
**Christina：**  
The bloodlust is making my spine tingle.  
Numbers Avalon... no, are my instincts warning me...?  
  
**Christina：**  
Do not let your guard down.  
That is, unless you want this holiday to be the anniversary of your death.  
  
**Illya：**  
There is an overwhelming power emanating from the sack...!  
Just what in the blazes is happening...?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Look!  
Something's coming out!  
  

---  
  
**Boss Reindeer：**  
Br-rrrooooooooaaarrr!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hey, is this... some kind of sick joke?  
  
**Illya：**  
The reindeer got far, far bigger...  
And it's standing on its two hind legs...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
The reindeer merged together...?!  
  
**Boss Reindeer：**  
Broooarr!  
(I am a force to be reckoned with!)  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
To think my sack could be used in such a way...!  
Reindeer, this is not something I can forgive!  
Return the sack immediately!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Santa, look out!  
  
**Boss Reindeer：**  
Brooooar!  
(First off, we'll give you a taste of how we feel!)  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Wh-what do you mean...?!  
  
**Reindeer：**  
...Brooough?!  
(Wh-what on earth?!)  
  
**Illya：**  
Santa Claus... became a reindeer?!  
  
**Christina：**  
It is an extension of the power that transformed our clothes in an instant.  
There is nothing at all to be surprised about.  
  
**Christina：**  
More importantly,  
don't you think you should worry about yourself?  
If the purpose is insurrection, then the targets are...  
  
**Christina：**  
What's this?  
Whoa there now, are you simply going to turn heel?  
If you flee now, you'll spoil all the fun.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You're wrong, Producer!  
It's not running away...  
  
**Man：**  
H-hey, what's that?!  
A-aaarrgh!  
  
**Woman：**  
Oh my! What just happened?!  
A man just turned into a reindeer!  
  
**Boy：**  
That reindeer's humongous!  
So cool!  
  
**Girl：**  
Wow, that's a big sack! What's inside?  
  
**Middle-Aged Man：**  
No, I don't want to become a reindeer!  
Somebody help me!  
  
**Middle-Aged Woman：**  
D-daaarliiing!  
What am I supposed to feed to a reindeer?!  
  
**Old Man：**  
Ohhh, the town is all lively.  
What day is it again?  
  
**Old Woman：**  
It's the height of the holidays, dear.  
Oh my, your hair's getting thick again.  
  
**Illya：**  
Does that monstrosity intend to turn all the townspeople  
into reindeer, one by one?  
  
**Christina：**  
Whoa there.  
At this rate, Landosol will become a town of reindeer.  
That could be quite fun though... ♪  
  
**Illya：**  
No, it will not be fun!  
I do not wish to rule such a town!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Producer! Illya!  
Let's stop that reindeer in its tracks!  
{player}, you'll lend us a hand too, won't you?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Let's take back our happy holiday.  
`Tag 5`  
**Nozomi：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Christina：**  
By all means!  
  
**Illya：**  
Away we go!  
  
**Narration：**  
Thus, in order to put a stop to the mutinous elite reindeer,  
{player}, Christina, Illya, and Nozomi  
took off through the festively decorated streets of Landosol.
