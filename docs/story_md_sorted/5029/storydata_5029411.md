## Subtitle: Happy Happy Holiday
  
**Nozomi：**  
The holidays are coming to an end...  
It was loads of fun, but now that it's over,  
it kinda seems like everything was just a dream.  
  
**Illya：**  
Heh. Could it be, perhaps, that the experience itself  
was our true gift from Santa Claus?  
  
**Christina：**  
What's the matter with you, you lifeless layabouts!  
There is still plenty of time!  
Keep your bodies moving until the last second!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
P-Producer, isn't there anything you want to reflect on after all that happened?  
  
**Illya：**  
Indeed, indeed! Does your riotousness know no bounds?  
  
**Christina：**  
If you have time for reflection, then you have time for enjoyment. ☆  
Come now, let me enjoy myself, you bores!  
The holidays are not yet over! ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Y-you're totally right!  
Illya, how about a sing-along?!  
  
**Illya：**  
What?! You want me to sing...?! Wait, how did it come to this?!  
  
Ah! Desist at once, Nozomi! Get that microphone away from me!  
Minion! I need your assist—...  
You're applauding?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Even the boy has come to understand how to enjoy this festive season!  
...Hahah. It was not a bad holiday.  
Perhaps it was thanks to you that I did not get bored.
