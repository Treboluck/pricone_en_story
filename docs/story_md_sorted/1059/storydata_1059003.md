**Kokkoro：**  
Mmm~♪ Mhmm~♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Ahh...  
I thought I heard footsteps.  
So it was you, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh... Is something the matter?  
I thought you had already gone to sleep for the night.  
Did you have a bad dream? Shall I pat you on the head?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh...  
 You noticed that I was slipping out of bed  
in the middle of the night, and thought it odd.  
So you followed me here out of curiosity, did you?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Haha... It is not as if I have been wildly carousing  
in the city's nightlife.  
I just had a little errand to run, here in the Elven Forest.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please do not worry.  
I would not dream of running off  
and leaving you behind, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I would never abandon you, I promise you that.  
I want nothing more than to stay by your side forever...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, quite.  
I was intending to release a messenger crow from this forest.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I suppose... it is something like a messenger pigeon.  
  
In the village I call home, we use crows rather than pigeons.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That's right. I was sending word back to my hometown.  
All the things I have experienced since meeting you...  
I have a duty to report them to the village elder.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, I refer to him as the elder, but he is also my father.  
He must be worried with his daughter journeying so far away,  
so I must send word regularly to reassure him.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
By the way, my lord, crows are very intelligent.  
They become quite affectionate if one feeds them,  
and they understand us well enough to carry out simple tasks.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The birds and animals in this Elven Forest in particular  
seem particularly accustomed to people...  
 So by leaving food  
and the like, I endeared myself to some of the crows here.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Once that is done, I need only tie my letter to a crow's leg  
and sing the melody passed down in my clan.  
By imbuing the notes with meaning, I can give quite specific instructions.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
These crows grew up here in this Elven Forest,  
and I doubt they know the location of my hometown.  
So I use the song to show them the right direction.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Your singing was beautiful.  
**Choice: (2)**  You like crows, do you?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh... Well, thank you, my lord!  
Such a compliment from you is a great honor indeed.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I worked hard to train my singing voice.  
It has many uses besides just communicating with crows.  
The songs of elves possess special powers, you see.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
For instance, our lullabies.  
If you have trouble sleeping, I will gladly sing for you.  
As long as you don't mind...

`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, I do.  
Not only crows, but all birds and insects,and the beasts of the land.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We elves are quite attuned to natural creatures.  
It is our way to live in harmony with nature.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As such, cities like Landosol which are filled with  
artificial constructs... can be a little tiring for us.  
It does me good to visit the forest and refresh my senses.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh... Hold on one moment now, my lord.  
Once I have seen off the messenger crow,  
we can head back together.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The world outside the city is far from safe.  
So I would like to escort you myself.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And I must apologize.  
I should have informed you before I came out here.  
I did not mean to make you worry.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The crows of this forest are nocturnal by nature,  
so it was necessary for me to come here at night.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And during the day, I would rather not leave your side.  
At night, you are usually fast asleep in bed,  
so it is easier for me to move around alone.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But from now on, to avoid worrying you unnecessarily,  
I will inform you of the dates and specific details  
of my intended actions in advance.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Haha... You think I should not worry so much  
and just move about as I please?  
Does my unwavering attention make you feel guilty, somehow?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Being constantly monitored by a strange girl  
who you scarcely knew until just recently...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Could it be you find me overbearing?  
Am I... a nuisance to you, my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You don't mind... any of that?  
Well, it reassures me greatly to hear those words.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The truth is...  
I spent most of my life  
dreaming of the day I would be able to serve you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So right now, I am filled with happiness.  
I beg of you to believe me on this point, at least.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am so, so happy right now.  
Happier than I can put into words.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
After all, I have finally become a part  
of the story I always longed for, the life I always dreamed of.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Even if I cannot be the hero or his beloved heroine...  
It is enough for me to be close to the one I care for...  
And live like this, happy by his side.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Haha... I am sorry. You probably don't understand.  
I am supposed to be your guide,  
yet I am so bad at explanations...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please excuse me for a moment while I sing my melody.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My life by your side has been so full of wondrous things,  
my letter ended up longer than I intended.  
I only hope it will not weigh the crow down too terribly...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Now, my winged messengers.  
Carry my words, my happiness, to the village I call home.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Mmm~♪ Mhmm~♪
