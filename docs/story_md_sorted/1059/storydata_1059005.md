## Subtitle: Parent or Child?
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Good morning, my lord.  
It is time for you to arise.  
Are you already awake? My lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh dear, you seem to be still fast asleep.  
Eheh... What a sleepyhead...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well, I suppose it has not been very long since we began  
staying here at the Sarendia Orphanage.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Doubtless you are not yet quite used to sleeping here.  
After all that has happened, you must be tired, as well.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
For today, we do not have any pressing duties to fulfill,  
so a part of me wishes to let you sleep to your heart's content...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But it is not healthy at all to disturb one's daily rhythm,  
and it would not do to miss out on the hot breakfast  
our hosts have prepared for us.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So for now, I must steel my heart and awaken you regardless.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord...!  
Please wake up now, my lord!  
Hmm... His sleep is deeper than I thought.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
How troublesome you are, my lord.  
If you cannot arise on your own, I cannot help but think  
it would be better for me to sleep by your side after all.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
After all, with all your memories lost...  
One might say you are little more than a newborn infant.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And an infant needs a guardian  
to watch over and care for him from morning until night.  
...Yes, it is certainly not that *I* am lonely sleeping by myself...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...My lord? Did I see you chuckle just now?  
Could it be... you have already awoken?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Get up.  
**Choice: (2)**  Pretend to be asleep.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah! So you had regained consciousness after all.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm...  
He certainly seems...  
 to be asleep...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well then, I'm sure he will not react if I tickle him.  
After all, he is far away and dreaming.  
Tickle... tickle...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I knew it... You were awake this whole time!  
Really, can you not at least try to arise when I ask you to?  
You really are such a handful, my lord.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh...  
Allow me to wish you good morning, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I apologize for waking you when you still quite evidently  
wished to remain sleeping.  
If I have displeased you, punish me as you see fit.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
For the sake of awakening you and maintaining your health,  
I will gladly accept whatever sacrifices must befall me.  
Persecute me as you will— I have no regrets.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh?!  
M-my lord?  
Is your sleepiness clouding your judgment?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Why would you grab my shoulders and pull me close...?  
My lord, were you... also lonely sleeping by yourself?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I-I can quite empathize—  
...Wait, no... Ahh...  
This is not proper! Oh, what to do?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I-is it a kiss you desire?  
Could this be what they call a good morning kiss?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Aahh!  
Huh? My forehead?  
Why would you press your forehead up against mine?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Excuse me?  
You think... I might have a fever?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh... You were measuring my temperature.  
So there was a logical reason behind your bold actions...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm... Perhaps these last few tiring days  
have taken their toll on my condition, as well. I feel ashamed.  
I cannot bear the thought of infecting you, so I will leave the room.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wahhh?  
My lord? Why are you suddenly lifting me in your arms?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Carrying me to your bed... Gently laying me down...  
Covering me in a blanket... and patting my head...?  
Umm... What is all this?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You wish for me to rest here? In your bed, my lord?  
If I have become ill, I must rest my body and recover...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh... While I very much appreciate the sentiment...  
I would be quite capable of returning to my own room to rest.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
While I may be a little feverish, it is really only a little.  
It will not prevent me from walking a short way.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And I would certainly not want  
to leave infectious germs behind in your bed...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh... My lord...!  
He left me alone in the room without explaining a thing...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I can hear voices in the distance...  
It sounds like he went to consult  
the other residents of the Orphanage.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It seems he intends to fetch medicine and care for me...  
Eheh. You are such a kind fellow, my lord...  
Even if you could be a little clearer in communicating your intentions...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Still, I deeply appreciate your kind efforts.  
Ahhh, I can still feel my lord's warmth in these sheets...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
S-somehow I feel so comfortable,  
I am becoming a little sleepy...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Perhaps these last few nights of sleeping alone  
really have been weighing upon my heart...  
I did find it more difficult to sleep soundly than usual...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That may be one reason why my health has deteriorated.  
It is almost as though I am the infant here.  
How embarrassing. I am a failure as a guide...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And yet... Even if I am a hopeless attendant...  
I feel sure my lord would never abandon me.  
He is always so kind, and he cares for me so.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheheh...  
I could not be more lucky to serve such a fine lord...!
