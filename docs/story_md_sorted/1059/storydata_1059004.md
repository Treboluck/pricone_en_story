## Subtitle: Are You My Lord?
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That was a delicious meal.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh...? My lord, you have not cleared your plate.  
It is not nice to waste perfectly good food, you know?  
How silly of you...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Ah, I see. Your stomach is not in the best of sorts?  
Perhaps the unusual cuisine we ate with Miss Pecorine last night  
did not agree with your digestive system.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Whatever shall we do? I am a light eater myself,  
so my appetite has already been sated.  
I fear I cannot help you with finishing these leftovers.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, no...! You need not force yourself to eat them!  
I will ask and see if we can take them with us in a bag. They would  
serve as emergency rations, or I could feed them to my crows.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh...?  
What is all this?  
There seems to be a mysterious light surrounding us...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Could this be the phenomenon Lady Ameth told me of?  
Ah, my lord, please do not worry.  
If I am correct, this should not present any real danger.

**???：**  
Excuse me. Yes, you there, sir.  
Could I quickly ask you something?  
  
**???：**  
Umm...  
This may be a little sudden, but...  
Might you possibly be my lord?  
  
**???：**  
Oh... You seem quite confused by the question.  
Perhaps you are not my lord after all. How disappointing.  
  
**???：**  
I felt a strange connection to you,  
and you looked just like the lord I had always imagined, so...  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Ah, but I haven't even introduced myself.  
My name is Kokoro Natsume.  
I am in the fifth grade of elementary school.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.  
...Are you quite sure you are not my lord?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I am your lord.  
**Choice: (2)**  I don't really know...  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokoro：**  
So it is true...!  
Ahhh... How I have longed to meet you!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokoro：**  
Hmm... Perhaps you are not yet aware of your calling.  
In that case, I can hardly blame you.  
Though it saddens me a little, it would not be right to impose myself.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Nonetheless, though it may seem strange to you...  
Would it be all right if I were to call you \"my lord\" nonetheless?  
Think of it as a kind of nickname, if you will.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokoro：**  
Haha...  
At any rate, my lord...  
 I am afraid I seem to have lost my bearings.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I often find myself getting lost like this...  
I tend to wander this way and that, until I lose track of my route.  
But it is getting late, so I would like to go home if possible.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
You will accompany me? To keep me safe?  
My lord, you are such a kind fellow.  
But really, just showing me the way to the station will suffice.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Hmm.  
The station is that way, is it?  
The entrance is not obvious, so you will guide me there?  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Thank you ever so much, my lord.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I will never forget this debt I owe you.  
Someday, when you yourself become lost,  
I will find you and guide you to your destination.

**Ameth：**  
Awwwwwww! ☆  
There she is! My adorable little Kokkoro!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Can you believe her? Calling a man she's just met \"my lord\"?  
Talk about having your head in the clouds!  
Awww, she's the cutest kid in the universe!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hmm?  
Oh, sorry about that, {player}...  
I suppose I owe you some explanations.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But, well,  
what you just saw was basically just a dream,  
so you don't need to worry about it too much.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It looks like you and Kokkoro  
barely knew each other at all on the \"other side,\" after all.  
  
**Ameth：**  
In fact, you need to hurry up and regain your memories  
so you can meet \"that\" Kokkoro properly,  
get to know her, and make her happy for real!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Though of course, there's not much I can do but pray.  
  
**Ameth：**  
As you just saw in the dream,  
by \"that\" world's standards, her attitude is... a little odd.  
Or should I say, downright eccentric. It can't be an easy life.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Which is why...  
When I see the happy life she's living in \"this\" world,  
it almost makes me think this situation might not be so bad.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But you know... Every dream has to end eventually.  
  
**Ameth：**  
...Oh dear...  
I guess we can't talk for much longer.  
I'm still not fully recovered, so there are limits, you know.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So, though it's a bit of a shame, let's call it a day for now.  
See you later, {player}.  
Give my regards to Kokkoro! Bye-bye!

**Kokkoro：**  
My lord... My lord?  
Is something the matter? You seemed quite... out of it.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Haha.  
If this really is as Lady Ameth foretold,  
I expect you were lost in a sort of daydream.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
By the way...  
We already finished our meal  
and are on our way back to the hotel right now.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As it seems your stomach is not in the best of sorts,  
you should get home quickly, drink some medicine,  
and wrap up warm for the night.  
 I will take good care of you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You can count on me, my lord.  
Protecting your health is my utmost priority.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh... Truly I am a blessed soul.  
To be able to serve my lord and care for him like this...  
I yearned ever so long for the day this life would begin.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, ever since I was a small child...  
Well, I suppose I am still not exactly large...  
But this life truly is everything I had dreamed of.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am so lucky to have you, and so happy.  
My lord, if I might be so bold...  
I hope you will keep me by your side forever.
