**Narration：**  
One peaceful afternoon on the Sarendia Orphanage grounds,  
the air is filled with the cries of Kokkoro and a small animal.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My Lord!  
Look, it is the ball you love to play with.  
Here! Why don't you fetch it for me?  
  
**Dog：**  
Woof, woof!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. My Lord, you truly are a swift fellow.  
You recovered the ball in no time at all.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh!  
 My Lord, please do not leap upon me so suddenly.  
My body is not large,  
 so it cannot withstand your weight... ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh.  
 Do it again, you ask?  
 You are in high spirits today.  
Very well. Here goes... Fetch!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Woof!  
**Choice: (2)**  Rrrruff!  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh—my human lord?!  
A truly spectacular catch!

`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh—my human lord?!  
Now, now. You can't put the ball in your mouth.  
Spit it out now, please!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am terribly sorry, my lord.  
I was so preoccupied with my doggie lord, I failed to see you there.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Did you need me for something...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This is... a letter addressed to me?  
Well, thank you for bringing it all the way out here.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It looks like some kind of official notice.  
 What could it be?  
\"We are happy to inform you we have located the stray dog's... owner?\"  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The original owner of... my doggie lord?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Wow, that's great news!  
`Tag 4`  
**Dog：**  
Ruff!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes... it is.  
 It's very good.  
At long last, this little one will be reunited with his real family.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well, there is no time to lose.  
I will respond now, and we can take him first thing tomorrow.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...  
  
**Dog：**  
Woof! Woof!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. My little doggie lord...  
There is no need to hurry so.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I know that you love to be taken for walks,  
but please, do try to match my natural pace.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This will be...  
 our final walk together, after all.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We were only together for a brief time,  
but it feels like so much longer.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
At first, you would not eat the food I offered,  
but as I persisted, you slowly opened up,  
and lately, you are even willing to share a bed with me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I gave you the name My Lord, and sang you to sleep each night...  
Whenever I stroke your soft fur, I can hear you murmur happily...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But those days  
 must come to an end, it seems.  
...*sniffle*  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Wipe Kokkoro's tears away.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah... I am ever so sorry, my lord.  
Shedding selfish tears on such a happy occasion...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I always knew that these days could not last forever,  
yet now my heart is awash with a sensation I can scarcely bear.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This emotion... I felt it one other time recently.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The sense of loss I felt  
when it seemed that you, my lord, were drifting apart from me...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It feels almost as though I am saying goodbye  
to my human lord as well, and it...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It makes me... feel so lonely.  
So lonely, I fear I cannot bear it.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Goodbyes aren't forever.  
`Tag 6`  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord?  
What exactly do you...?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  You can always find each other again.  
`Tag 7`  
**Kokkoro：**  
We can always... be reunited?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As long as we care for one another,  
there will always be another chance...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It is never too late to seek each other out.  
That is what you're telling me, isn't it...?  
  
**Dog：**  
*whine*... *whine*  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My doggie lord, are you agreeing?  
Will you be so kind as to remember me?  
  
**Dog：**  
Woof!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh... Thank you ever so much.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You too, my human lord. I am most grateful.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It was childish of me to become so distressed by a simple goodbye.  
I feel... a little embarrassed.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In truth it is I who should be guiding you, my lord,  
yet today it seems you have shown me the way.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am a failure as your guide.  
And yet...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The kind respect you show for my earnest feelings  
makes me feel so thankful.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Just as I always knew... You are the only lord for me. ♪  
  
**Clerk：**  
Well then, I'll go and fetch the dog's owner,  
so please wait here a moment.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It is almost time... my lord.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Which one?  
`Tag 8`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, please. You tease me so terribly sometimes, my human lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. No, I understand.  
You are only trying to lighten my heart... But I am all right now.  
  
**Woman：**  
Excuse me. Are you the visitors from the Sarendia Orphanage?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes,  
 that would be us!  
  
**Woman：**  
I'm told that you were the ones who found my dog...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes. We have him with us right here.  
  
**Dog：**  
...?  
  
**Woman：**  
...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
He certainly loves attention, so I hope you will give My L...  
give your dog all the loving care he needs  
from now on, my good madam.  
  
**Woman：**  
Um... I'm not sure how to say this, but...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Is something the matter?  
  
**Woman：**  
That's not him.  
This isn't the dog I've been looking for.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Huh?  
  
**Clerk：**  
M-my apologies, everyone! We just checked the files,  
and there was a mix-up with the letter's address!  
  
**Clerk：**  
I'm so sorry for the trouble! This was our mistake!  
Please don't worry, madam, your dog is safe with a different household!  
  
**Woman：**  
Are you sure?! Thank goodness...!  
  
**Clerk：**  
I really can't apologize enough for causing all this inconvenience!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The letter was... a mistake?  
Then, does that mean...  
  
**Dog：**  
Woof, woof!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh... Please, my doggie lord,  
do not leap at me so suddenly!  
Ohh... It tickles so terribly when you lick me like that!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Woof, woof!  
`Tag 9`  
**Kokkoro：**  
You too, my human lord.  
There is no need to pat my head so vigorously...  
I am not a small child who needs to be coddled...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Really, both of my lords are such handfuls...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I suppose it still falls to me to look after the both of you as best I can! ♪  
  
**Narration：**  
As she found herself lovingly hounded from both sides,  
Kokkoro was filled with joy at the realization  
that these days would continue awhile longer.
