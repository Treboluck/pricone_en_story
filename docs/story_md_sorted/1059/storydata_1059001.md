**Kokkoro：**  
Right this way, my lord.  
Please try to be careful where you step.  
 Would you like me to hold your hand?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Very well. Please, go right ahead.  
I will gladly lead the way, as your humble guide.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Haha... Landosol is not a simple city to navigate, is it?  
We must be careful not to become lost.  
These dense crowds also take some getting used to...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh... I apologize, my lord.  
Thank you for catching me there.  
I bumped into a passer-by, and almost tripped over.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am lucky you were here, my lord.  
I should really be more careful.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please excuse me. I should know better than  
to glance around instead of looking where I am walking.  
But everything here is so new to me, it is easy to get distracted.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You should relax a bit more.  
**Choice: (2)**  Maybe I could give you a piggyback ride?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, I could never!  
It is my proud duty to guide you to the best of my ability.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I did not come here to gawk like a tourist.  
I must stay aware of my surroundings, the better to assist you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Haha...  
Your concern does make me happy, though.  
You are such a kind fellow, my lord.

`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, ah...  
While I appreciate the sentiment, I am not a little child.  
I can walk on my own two feet, so please do not worry.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The very thought of being carried by my lord...  
I could not dream of imposing myself in such a way.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
At any rate.  
As we had planned,  
we should see about securing some day-to-day supplies.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The market prices are quite high here in Landosol,  
so I am unsure how well our funds will suffice...  
But if you desire anything, I would like to provide it.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm.  
 As you have lost your memories,  
it must be difficult for you to judge.  
Perhaps I should begin by explaining the concept of currency.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This is called \"money.\"  
At shops and the like, you can exchange it for various goods.  
It comes in the form of coins and banknotes, and...  
 My lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh! My lord!  
You should not put the banknote in your mouth.  
It is not for eating!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please spit it out quickly!  
I must say, you are almost like an infant at times.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Remember, banknotes tend to be handled  
by large numbers of people.  
It is unhygienic to put them in your mouth.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please hold on just a moment.  
Mnhhh... *munch* *munch*  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
There. I crushed some medicinal herbs with my teeth.  
Now let me wipe your mouth with the juices on this swab.  
This should take care of any germs, so...  
Hold still, please.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Rub... Rub...  
There. Now you are nice and clean!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
To think you would try to consume money...  
You must be very hungry, my lord.  
Before we go shopping, let us find something to eat.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmmm. We have not come far from the hotel,  
and I believe there was a kitchen there.  
If we purchase some ingredients, I can prepare a meal.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Making our own meals is cheaper than eating out, after all.  
And this city's restaurants seem to use so many additives...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am concerned for your health, my lord.  
It would reassure me if I could manage your diet myself!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, is there anything specific you would like to eat?  
I have been studying cookbooks to build my repertoire.  
I would like to think I can handle the majority of requests.  
  
**Fishmonger：**  
Hey, little missus!  
I've got some real cheap fish in today!  
It's a great deal!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Excuse me? Are... Are you addressing me?  
Did you say... \"missus\"...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If I may...  
I am merely my lord's humble attendant.  
I am by no means his... \"missus.\"  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh...  
Could it be we give the impression of a married couple?  
My lord and I... joined in matrimony...  
  
**Fishmonger：**  
C'mon, missus! These fish are in season right now!  
If you cook 'em up for dinner,  
your fella there will be thrilled!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It will make... my lord happy?  
Ahh... Then perhaps... I will purchase these fish!  
  
**Fishmonger：**  
Now that's what I call a fine customer!  
How's about these?  
They're full of good nutrients, missus!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Of course, I shall purchase them.  
Yes, of course, those ones also!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Ahhh...  
What is the matter, my lord?  
Hmm? You don't think we will be able to eat all of these?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Y-you are quite right.  
I fear I may not have been thinking straight.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I have read about this in books.  
The proprietors of stalls like these  
refer to female customers as \"missus\" without exception.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am sure they did not *really* think we looked like newlyweds...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I know that, really.  
Yes, I am quite aware.  
...Could I perhaps have one of these fish as well?  
  
**Fishmonger：**  
Coming right up!  
Pleasure doing business with ya, missus!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank you.  
Eheh... heheh...  
  
**Narration：**  
Kokkoro ended up buying so much fish that day  
that almost all of it was doomed to rot away unused.  
  
**Narration：**  
Yet somehow,  
she seemed like she had never been happier.
