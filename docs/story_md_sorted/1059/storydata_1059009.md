## Subtitle: A Lonely Little Guide
  
**Narration：**  
Today, Kokkoro and {player}  
are out in town on a shopping trip together.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, what would you like to eat today?  
I will gladly prepare anything you might desire.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Strapping young lad that you are,  
perhaps you would like a meaty hamburg steak?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am told that the vast majority of men  
are fond of hearty meals of that kind.  
  
**Woman 1：**  
How can I help you, young missus?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I'd like some ground meat, and...  
Let's see, can we have some of those vegetables also?  
Aside from that...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. As a loyal attendant,  
it is my duty to consider all of my lord's dietary needs.  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Of course. You're a fine customer!  
I must say, you're very dependable for your age.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, not at all.  
As my lord's designated guide, this is the least I can do.  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Well, if you say so!  
 I don't really get it, but keep it up!  
Now then, that'll be... 1,005 rupies in total.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Certainly.  
 Ehm, let me check my purse... Oh.  
I seem to be out of small change...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Would it be possible to pay with this 2,000 rupie bill?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Offer a 5 rupie coin.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord?  
Ehm... where did you obtain that money?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It was left over from your allowance?  
I see. That does make sense.  
Thank you ever so much  
 for your consideration.  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Yes, that's just perfect!  
Hee hee. You two make such a sweet pair.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
W-well, thank you...  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Okay, here are your purchases!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Now then...  
 Ah—my lord!  
I could not possibly ask you to carry those bags for me!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Please, let me handle it.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well, if you're sure...  
 My lord, you really are too kind.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What is this?  
Being treated so well by my lord should make me happy...  
And yet, my heart feels somehow uneasy...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, thank you for accompanying me  
on my shopping trip today.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This fine weather we're having seems ideal for laundry.  
I should take a moment  
to hang our freshly-washed clothes outside to dry.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Heave-ho, heave-ho...  
Phew. Today's laundry pile is a little larger than usual.  
If only I were a little taller, it would be easier to hang up the sheets...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Let me help.  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
M-my lord?  
No, I cannot ask you to trouble yourself...  
 Ah.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank you very much...  
You certainly are  
 the kindest of fellows, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Once more, I inconvenienced my lord...  
I feel like a failure as his guide...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The weather's still nice, so perhaps I will weed the yard as well.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Join in without saying a word.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
M-my lord!  
You must not strain yourself so!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You have had such a tiring day.  
Please, sit down on the soft grass and rest your aching limbs.  
It is rather hot today, so I will bring you a refreshing drink.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Here. This should quench your thirst.  
And take this hat to protect you from the sun's rays.  
Oh! Are those beads of sweat upon your brow?  
 Let me wipe them away!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
How is that?  
 Are you beginning to feel a little sleepy?  
Please feel free to take a nap. Would you like a lullaby?  
Well then... Ahem.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Huh?  
You would rather assist me with my daily tasks?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Oh, no—  
I would never spurn your honest kindness.  
But I can manage this alone.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
There is no need to trouble yourself with such things.  
Please relax and enjoy your own free time.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Now then,  
 if you'll excuse me, I should return to weeding the yard...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What's this?  
 Somehow, I am feeling dizzy all of a sudden...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Mnhh... Ahhh...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What happened? I can't seem to recall...  
My head is resting on something soft...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
M-my lord...?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Did I... actually collapse?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  You should drink this.  
**Choice: (6)**  Here, cool yourself down.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kokkoro：**  
You have even brought a drink for me...  
*gulp*... *gulp*...  
 Ah, such a refreshing sensation...  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Kokkoro：**  
A damp towel...?  
Did you prepare this for me, my lord?  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank you so much, my lord. I am deeply honored.  
...And yet...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Is something wrong?  
`Tag 8`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Why...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Why will you not allow me to perform my duties...?  
Oh... ohhh...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
On our shopping trip,  
you were the one with change prepared...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And each time I attempt to aid you,  
somehow you end up trying to help me instead!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
All I wish is to be of service, my lord,  
but now it is as though our positions are reversed...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I must be a failure as your guide...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I feel so ashamed of myself... Ahhh...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord is adapting so admirably to our life in Landosol.  
I should be happy and proud of him...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yet I cannot help but feel lonely.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Rest your head on Kokkoro's lap.  
`Tag 9`  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord...?!  
Hm? Your ears are itchy, you say?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well, that is most troubling.  
I must give them a thorough cleaning right away.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But alas, I do not have any cotton swabs on hand.  
I hope you will not mind if I use my fingers...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hee hee. Your ears are so very large, my lord.  
My little finger fits inside  
 without the slightest of trouble.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Still, it may be dangerous to insert it too deeply,  
so I will only clean a little way inside for now.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well then, please excuse me.  
Rub... rub...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh, my lord!  
 Please try not to move.  
I know it may tickle, but you must bear it.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Rub... rub... ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank you, my lord.  
I see in your face that you are trying hard.  
You are doing wonderfully. Now, let me attend to the other ear...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Rub... rub... ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. I feel your head shuddering intently upon my lap.  
It's enough to make me feel ticklish myself.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Rub... rub... ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
There, that will do.  
Has this relieved the itching you felt?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. You look positively invigorated, my lord.  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Thanks for always doing so much for me.  
`Tag 10`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, my lord.  
 Such praise is more than I could possibly deserve.  
In truth, it is I who feel overwhelmed with gratitude.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
To guide you in life and attend to your needs is my calling.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So please, my lord...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I hope you will not mind  
if I continue to serve you like this in the future.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Guiding you this way and ensuring your continued happiness  
is what I truly wish to do with my life.  
  
**Narration：**  
Filled with satisfaction at having been able to please her lord,  
the smile on Kokkoro's face was even warmer  
than the sun's dazzling rays.
