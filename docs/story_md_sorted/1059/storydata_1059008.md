**Kokkoro：**  
Laaa... ♪  
Lala... la... ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Oh? My lord.  
What brings you out here at this late hour?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes... I left a note this time, so I am sure you are aware,  
but the messenger crow I sent to my village  
should be returning shortly.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So I was hoping to greet it here in the forest.  
It is taking longer than I thought, so I am a little worried.  
I only hope it has not been attacked by monsters or the like...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That's right.  
I was helping the crow to better find its destination  
by singing at a pitch that is easy for crows to hear.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
There is special power in the songs of elves, after all.  
Though compared to a real bard, I am but an amateur.  
My lord, would you care to sing with me?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Although, since hearing your voice comforts me so much,  
if I am not careful I might find myself lulled into a slumber...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wahh...?! Ah, I see you have brought our doggie friend  
along with you.  
 Do not leap at me so suddenly,  
My Lord! You gave me a frightful shock.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
All this licking is also unhelpful...  
Honestly, you are such an affection-seeker, My Lord!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see...  
So the doggie My Lord started howling from loneliness  
when he realized I was gone.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And the neighbors scolded you for letting him make  
so much noise?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So you thought it would be a good idea  
to take him on a little walk to find me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well, I apologize for the trouble.  
I suppose I should have foreseen this.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My Lord must have been afraid  
that I was running away and abandoning him...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It's all right, My Lord.  
Though someday when we find your owner, we may have to  
say goodbye, for now, I have no intention of leaving your side.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah...  
My lord, you seem to be glowing again.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What could it be?  
Does Lady Ameth have something she wishes to speak with you about?  
  

---  
  
**Kokoro：**  
...What's this?  
Why, if it isn't you, my lord!  
It has been quite some time.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I hope you have not forgotten me, have you?  
That's right. It is I, Kokoro Natsume, your faithful servant.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
It is such an honor to see you again, my lord!  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Mmrmph...  
Why are you covering my mouth, my lord?  
Hmm? I should not call you \"my lord\" in such a loud voice?  
  
**Kokoro：**  
People will look at us strangely?  
But my lord, I do not mind what they think.  
What matters is that you are my one and only lord...!  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Could I at least refrain from saying it in public, you ask?  
Well, if those are your orders, I will obey.  
It is my pride to faithfully submit to your every whim!  
  
**Kokoro：**  
By the way, my l...  
Ah... I suppose I need another way of addressing you.  
Mr. {player}, what brings you here to the zoo?  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Could it be you are on a date with a lady friend?  
They do say that heroism and romance go hand in hand...  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Hmm?  
You came here with friends, but you seem to have lost them?  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Ah, well... This zoo is quite tricky to navigate, after all.  
And on a holiday like today, it can get quite busy.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I can certainly see how you might have gotten separated.  
What's that? Your phone is running out of battery,  
so you're not sure how you are going to find them?  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I see... Well, I do happen to have a charger on hand,  
so feel free to borrow it.  
 While we wait for the battery  
to replenish, we can have a little date of our own.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Mr. {player}...  
Might I be so bold as to hold your hand?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Go ahead.  
**Choice: (2)**  Forget holding hands, I'll give you a big hug.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokoro：**  
Yay...!  
Well then, excuse me. I will gladly accept your offer.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Mr. {player}... Your hands are so very large!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokoro：**  
Ahhhh...!  
You are really too kind...  
 I am honored by the gesture!  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Eheh...  
Just as I thought,  
you are without a doubt the kindest of fellows.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokoro：**  
Hmm?  
You want to know what I was doing at the zoo?  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Actually, I happen to live here.  
Oh, I suppose that sounds a little misleading...  
I do not mean to say that I am kept here like an animal.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
To be more specific, I have a residence in this zoo's research facility.  
My father is a lead researcher here, you see.  
 Our family home  
is abroad, so this is where we are staying while in Japan.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
As such, I have the privilege of entering the zoo itself freely.  
So most days after school, this is where I spend my time.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I am afraid I have not been able to fit in very well at school.  
I'm sure I have only my own eccentric mannerisms to blame...  
But as a result, I have nobody to play with after school.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I must confess, it makes me a little lonely...  
So when I happened to see you here,  
it made me truly happy.

**Kokoro：**  
Ahhh...?!  
What is this all of a sudden, Mr. {player}?  
When you dash off so suddenly, it is quite startling!  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Huh?  
You would be happy to play with me until the sun goes down?  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Well, that is a most tempting offer...  
But Mr. {player}, did you not come here  
with friends of your own?  
  
**Kokoro：**  
You should really go and find them instead of wasting time with me.  
Though I am hardly an expert on the subject of friends,  
they are quite precious, are they not?  
  
**Kokoro：**  
You are so very kind, Mr. {player}...  
I can see you are trying to comfort me  
and help stave off my loneliness.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Thank you ever so much.  
I am truly grateful to have a fellow like yourself  
as my one and only lord.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Eheheh...  
How blessed a life I live!

`image display end`  
**Ameth：**  
Ahhhh... Kokkoro...  
How sweet can you be...?!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Thanks for that, {player}.  
You're always so nice to my little Kokkoro.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You have to understand, she really was always on her own.  
It was rare to even see her smile.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And yet... On that day when you played with her at the zoo,  
or any time she saw you, really,  
she was able to smile like a sweet kid her age ought to.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But, you know... This should only have been the beginning for her.  
After this, the two of you met up with your friends  
and hung out for a while, didn't you?  
  
**Ameth：**  
And among those friends  
was someone with a little sister who goes to Kokkoro's school...  
Thanks to that encounter, she made a friend of her own.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Her happiness was finally just beginning.  
She was going to be able to enjoy life like an ordinary schoolkid.  
Her days of wandering alone at the zoo were about to end.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But then.  
Right then, just before she could take hold of her happiness,  
her ordinary life was snatched away by a fantasy.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's why, {player}...  
I don't even care if you just went along with it because it was easier.  
You agreed to be her \"lord\"... so you need to make her happy!  
  
**Ameth：**  
You have to break her out of this twisted prison. I know there's  
no point saying this to you now, but that's my most heartfelt wish.  
I'm counting on you, {player}.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, I suppose that's all for today.  
Bye-bye, and give my regards to Kokkoro.  
  

---  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord?  
Ah, thank goodness. You have finally awoken.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You were speaking with Lady Ameth, were you not?  
What kind of things did you talk about?  
Hmm... I see... You do not really remember.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well, from what I have been told,  
your meetings with her are little different from dreams.  
So I suppose it is inevitable that your memories are unclear.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Though Lady Ameth gives me her guidance at the temple,  
I am only able to hear her voice...  
I confess I am quite curious about what she might look like, and so forth.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh...?  
My lord? Why would you suddenly pat my head?  
You just felt like it was the right thing to do...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Haha... You are such a strange one, my lord.  
While your displays of affection make me very happy...  
They also make me quite sleepy, so now may not be the time.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Until I have welcomed my messenger home from its journey,  
I need to be able to stay fully awake and alert.  
So, my lord, let us save the affection for later tonight.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Once we have finished here and returned safely home,  
I will let you pamper me to your heart's content!
