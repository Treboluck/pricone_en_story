# Kokkoro Episode 7
Kokkoro has decided to call the stray dog \"My Lord.\" Surrounded by her two lords, Kokkoro admits that she hates to be alone. Laying down to rest with the two of them close by, she is reminded of her father's warmth from her childhood.

**Kokkoro：**  
Please, My Lord, you must not...!  
Please keep your tongue to yourself,  
 you naughty boy!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
All of this licking is going to make my face quite slimy!  
We only just got nice and clean in the bath together...  
This is not the time to get dirty!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Aahh...!  
My Lord, please do not stick your face inside my clothes...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That tickles terribly... Ahaha...!  
Eheh... You are such an affection-seeker, My Lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Hello?  
What brings you here at this time of night, my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see...  
You heard strange voices coming from my room  
and felt the need to investigate?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well, I must apologize for the commotion at this late hour.  
Some of our fellow residents must already be sleeping, too...  
I should have been more considerate.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh...  
Come to think of it,  
it is quite rare for you to visit my room, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Since the layouts are identical, and we have little  
in the way of personal belongings, our rooms look almost  
like mirror images of one another, do they not?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
They look a little bare, so a part of me wants to purchase  
some furniture for decoration,  
 but this is only  
a temporary home until we find a place to settle down together.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm?  
Oh, yes... You remember the doggie we found on the street the other day.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The people at the registry are still trying to find the owner for us,  
but it seems they are not having much luck.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
After all, government institutions seem to be lacking in  
efficiency of late.  
 So while we wait patiently for the results,  
I am taking care of the little fellow myself.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I'm sure you recall that much.  
But it seemed inconvenient to keep him around without a name,  
so I have been calling him \"My Lord.\"  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I suppose it is a little confusing when both of you are here.  
  
**My Lord：**  
*whine...*  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh!  
Please try to behave yourself, My Lord!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am trying to hold a conversation with my human lord  
right now.  
 Please settle down to sleep,  
and I will join you presently.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  He sure seems fond of you.  
**Choice: (2)**  You two sleep together?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed.  
We have become almost like family.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
When we first took him in, he was reluctant even to eat  
the food I offered...  
 But I persisted in tending to his needs...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And I think he came to realize that I am not his enemy.  
It feels like he has finally accepted me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If anything, he has been a little too affectionate lately.  
You see? Even now he is rubbing up against me...  
Ahhh, My Lord... you are more adorable than I can bear!

`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, yes.  
Is there... a problem with that?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thanks to the doggie My Lord sleeping by my side,  
I have been sleeping more soundly these past few days.  
Having someone's warmth nearby helps me to relax.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It actually makes me a little sad to think  
that we will have to return him to his real owner someday...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Of course, I would like to share a bed with you too, my lord.  
But alas, we have been warned against that.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, look.  
I think the doggie My Lord has finally fallen asleep.  
Let me take him gently to bed, so that he does not wake up.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I will tuck him in, sing him a little lullaby,  
lie by his side, and pet his head until he is  
far away and dreaming.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, does this bring back memories?  
I used to put you to bed in a similar fashion  
before we arrived at the Orphanage, didn't I?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh...  
Could it be that my human lord is also wanting  
to snuggle up to me again for the first time in a while?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If you desire such a thing, I would be most happy to oblige.  
No, I should say I want the same thing myself.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord...  
Even if it is only for a moment, would you join me in my bed?  
It would be nice to share our warmth...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That's right.  
Come along, and lie right here.  
Put your arms around me from behind.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, my lord. You always handle me as if  
I could shatter at any moment...  
Your touch is so very gentle.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh...  
When we lie here like this, it brings back memories  
from when I was very young.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My father was busy with work, so he could only come  
home every once in a while. When he arrived home  
late at night, he would often come and lie by my side.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I will never forget that comforting warmth.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I suppose I am still a poor, foolish child...  
Using you as a substitute for my father's warmth...  
And even substituting you with this sweet little creature.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But alas...  
When I try to sleep alone, I cannot help but feel terribly lonely...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord...  
Just for tonight...  
 Would you mind if I called you \"Papa\"?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm?  
No response whatsoever...  
It looks like you have fallen asleep, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Whatever shall I do? I cannot move with your arms around me.  
Not that... I can honestly say I mind...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But this bed is a little small for the three of us together.  
I feel in danger of tumbling onto the floor.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It would be a truly terrible thing  
if I were to fall and injure you, my lord...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And yet...  
Ahh... Your warmth is so pleasant.
