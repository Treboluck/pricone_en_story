# Kokkoro Episode 2
While searching for a source of water to wash their clothes, {player} and Kokkoro happen across a seaside beach. Though the salt water is no use for washing, the beauty of the ocean is enough to make them forget why they came there to begin with.
  
## Subtitle: The Great Glittering Blue
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh...  
So this is what the real ocean looks like...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This is the first time I have actually seen it.  
My hometown is deep in the mountains,  
and the largest body of water nearby was a small spring.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So while I knew of the ocean's existence,  
until now, I had never witnessed it with my own eyes.  
It is... quite overwhelming!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Look out there, my lord!  
The waves are reflecting the rays of the sun, making the whole surface glitter like jewelry!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah! My lord, there are crabs!  
Two small crabs walking side by side! Are they mother and child?  
So it really is true that crabs walk sideways!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Ah...  
I apologize, my lord.  
I may have gotten a little overexcited.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We did not come here to frolic by the oceanside, did we?  
In fact, we did not intend to come to the beach at all.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That's right.  
We were searching for a source of water  
to wash our accumulated laundry.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
While there are guilds that provide laundry services,  
they are a little expensive for our needs.  
It will be far more efficient if we handle it ourselves.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Frugality is a virtue, after all.  
Besides which, I am quite skilled at housework.  
I trained well in my hometown, so as to better serve my lord someday.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Besides which...  
Allowing a complete stranger to handle my lord's clothing  
would make me a little uncomfortable.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As much as I can manage, I would like to provide for your every need myself...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
At any rate... We asked a neighborhood woman where we  
might find a waterside location, and she directed us here.  
She even drew us a map, which was admittedly helpful...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But I suppose I should have been a little more specific.  
She must have assumed  
we were looking for a spot for recreational purposes.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Really, though...  
I am not some little child  
who would frivolously play by the waterside...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But alas, seawater is hardly suitable for washing clothes.  
How very unfortunate. Whatever shall we do?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What's that?  
Yes, I'm afraid so.  
Water from the sea is full of salt, you see.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Look, my lord.  
I have scooped a little seawater into my hand.  
Would you care to taste it?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Haha...  
You look quite taken aback by the taste.  
 Let me try a little as well...  
Ahhh! Not only is it salty, it also has a unique bitterness!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I expect it has germs and the like,  
so washing our clothes here might actually make them dirtier.  
And if we used detergent, it would contaminate the environment.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This spot is a little far from the actual city, too.  
It would be quite the burden to come all this way every time we do laundry.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Disappointing though it may be,  
I think we will have to rule out this spot as our laundry solution.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Forgive me, my lord. I made you come all this way,  
only to achieve nothing whatsoever.  
We will have to carry our laundry right back to Landosol.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am ever so sorry.  
This is all my responsibility.  
Please punish me however you see fit.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Splash her with seawater.  
**Choice: (2)**  Pat her on the head.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wahhh?!  
I-  
is this my punishment?  
Then I will gladly accept it, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But I would appreciate it if you could refrain  
from splashing me so suddenly...  
Th-the water got in my eyes...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As it is saltwater, it stings a little...  
Ahhh... My eyes must be turning bright red...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm?  
My eyes are always red?  
Oh... I suppose you are right. Heheheh.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhhh...! Wh-wha...?  
Why would you suddenly pat my head?  
This seems almost more like a reward than a punishment...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see...  
 This was your first time seeing the ocean too,  
so you wanted to show your appreciation?  
You felt more like praising me than chiding my faults?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh... Not only do you overlook my carelessness,  
but you actually reward me for it?  
You really are the kindest of fellows, my lord.

**Kokkoro：**  
Haha... Since we came all this way,  
perhaps we should enjoy a walk along the beach.  
We can leave our laundry basket atop this rock for now.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Come, my lord, right this way!  
You should hold my hand.  
The waves can make the sand slippery.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It really is a remarkable sight, the ocean...  
The way the waves sweep back and forth endlessly...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahaha!  
I can even feel the sand between my toes...  
It tickles a little!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That's right.  
The shoes I always wear are essentially sandals.  
So walking along the beach exposes my feet to the elements.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It might be a good idea for you to go barefoot as well, my lord.  
Your socks will get wet from the waves,  
 and besides,  
I would like to share this curious sensation with you!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, my lord! There are seagulls circling above our heads!  
\"Meow, meow,\" they say! Their cries sound just like cats!  
Together with the sea, it's like we are surrounded by music.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, my lord... It's so very strange.  
When I am by your side,  
even the smallest of things seem to shine with wonder.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If by any chance you are able to feel the same way...  
it would make me feel incredibly honored!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I grew up in the mountains, knowing precious little else.  
Like you with your lost memories, I know nothing of the world.  
So perhaps the two of us can learn of the world together.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
New sights and sounds, new scents and tastes, new sensations on  
our skin... If I can only walk by your side through it all,  
nothing could make me happier, my lord.
