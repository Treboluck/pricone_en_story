**Narration：**  
On a certain afternoon, {player} and Kokkoro  
are taking a walk all the way outside of the city.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank you for agreeing to accompany me  
on this walk today, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ordinarily, for fear of monster attacks,  
I would avoid venturing so far afield...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But why is it, I wonder?  
Today, I feel I can handle almost anything.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Though I cannot recall the contents,  
ever since we shared that dream...  
it feels as though greater strength is flowing through my body.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. Perhaps this will make me seem childish,  
but my body feels so light, I want to skip along! ♪  
Just like this—hop, hop!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Look out!  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah—my lord?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A carriage is hurtling along at great speed... Ah, it passed us by.  
I am very sorry. I should not have allowed my guard to slip.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So, ehm... Well.  
Perhaps you could let me go now...  
You are embracing me so tightly,I fear my bones may shatter...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh.  
Still, thank you very much, my lord... ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...What is this sensation? My body feels hot and flushed.  
When we shared a bed last night, I felt nothing strange...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Could this enhanced state  
be causing my senses to be heightened somewhat?  
My heartbeat, too, seems to be racing much faster than usual...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Are you OK?  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, I did not mean to cause you to worry.  
I am perfectly fine.  
As you see, if I just take some deep breaths...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*huff, puff...*  
*huff, puff...*  
There. My pulse is back to a sensible rate.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Now, shall we proceed, my lord?  
We would not want any more accidents,  
so please,/2325/ take my hand...  
 Ah?!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Something wrong?  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
N-no...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What in the world?  
Just now, when I tried to take my lord's hand,  
my heartbeat began racing once more.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Holding hands is an everyday occurrence for us,  
 so why...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Am I... feeling nervous around him?  
My own lord, of all people?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  That carriage is coming back this way.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
M-my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This time he simply pulled me by the hand,  
yet my pulse is growing even stronger...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Whatever is happening to me today...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Huh?  
It's dangerous, so we should keep hold of one another's hands, you say?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
N-no, I am fine!  
I am not a small child, you understand, so...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I... rejected him out of instinct.  
My lord is going ahead without me...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My body felt so hot before, yet now it seems cold...  
Am I... feeling lonely?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
E-ehm, my lord!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Could we... hold hands as we walk after all, perhaps?  
Even just a single finger will be sufficient...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Sure.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank you very much...  
Well then, I will take your hand. ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Again my pulse races... But what is causing it?  
I know not why, but something tells me it is not a bad thing...  
  
**Coachman：**  
Hey, you two!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Sir Coachman, is something wrong?  
Why do you seem so flustered?  
  
**Coachman：**  
You can't go this way!  
There's a herd of monsters blocking the road!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A monster herd, you say...  
This road leads directly to Landosol City.  
We cannot allow this to stand...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My apologies, Sir Coachman.  
We will be proceeding this way to face the monsters.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
While we do, could you take a message from us  
to the Guild Association in the city?  
  
**Coachman：**  
S-sure.  
But will you two be all right on your own?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes. We will not do anything careless.  
Besides, today...  
 I feel ready to handle anything.  
  
**Coachman：**  
Uh, if you're sure...  
 All right!  
Well, good luck out there!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well then, shall we proceed, my lord?  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
These are the monsters the coachman mentioned, I presume.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Their numbers are indeed great. But...  
My lord, could you lend me your power for a moment?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Will you be OK?  
**Choice: (7)**  You shouldn't be reckless...  
`Tag 6`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank you very much for your concern.  
But I would like to ask you to trust in me.  
  
Jump to tag 8  
`Tag 7`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Of course, I would not wish to upset you in any way.  
I believe this is not a reckless act.  
  
`Tag 8`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Somehow...  
I feel sure that I am capable of this.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh...  
 Thank you, my lord.  
I feel your strength flowing throughout my body...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well then... to battle!  
Spirits, grant me the blessing of light!

**Kokkoro：**  
What is this...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I have never seen anything like it!  
Strength is blooming all around me!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Beautiful petals dance through the air, fluttering into the sky...  
Why, it looks...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...almost like a bridal bouquet...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wait, why am I thinking such things here in the midst of combat?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yet this is a great power indeed!  
My body moves so freely... Precisely as I will it!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The spirits must be lending me more strength than ever before!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And most of all...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I feel my lord's power more keenly than ever!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
With my lord connected to me so deeply,  
there is nothing I cannot achieve!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please watch over me, my lord.  
Right now... I can overcome any challenge!  
  

---  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It appears there are no more monsters remaining.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  You were incredible!  
`Tag 9`  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am honored, my lord.  
It would seem I have somehow forged a deeper bond with the spirits.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
All of this is thanks to your aid, I am certain.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Each time you cause my heart to race,  
each time you share your loving kindness,  
I can feel myself growing stronger and stronger.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord.  
Please allow me to swear a solemn oath  
that from this day forth...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I will remain forever by your side! ♪  
  
**Narration：**  
Embracing the new power she had awakened,  
Kokkoro faced the future with renewed resolve in her heart.
