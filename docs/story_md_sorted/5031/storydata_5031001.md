# An Enthusiastic Start
In order to get her hands on an extravagant prize, Suzume joins the race alongside the Gourmet Guild. From the outset, Tomo and the others are battling for first place, while Karyl, who is lagging far behind, lends a hand to a fallen Kurumi. As she does so, Lima comes to the rescue, and the three of them set out for the second leg together.
  
## Subtitle: An Enthusiastic Start
  
**Pecorine：**  
What exactly is the New Year's Landosol Guild Race?  
  
**Karin：**  
Please allow me to answer that question.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Urk! Karin... what are you doing?  
  
**Karin：**  
Right. Actually, this event is being sponsored by the Guild Association.  
  
**Karin：**  
It's a competition to determine Landosol's Lucky Guild—  
an inter-guild race starting in town and ending at the shrine!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You kidding me? Does the Guild Association not have anything better to do?  
  
**Karin：**  
Are you sure you should be saying that?  
Because... would you believe it?! The victorious guild  
receives the title of Lucky Guild!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Lucky Guild? What an auspicious title.  
  
**Karin：**  
According to legend, not only will the members of the guild chosen as  
the Lucky Guild receive blessings for the following year, but the people  
around them will too.  
  
**Karin：**  
But it's not only a title that they will receive.  
Each member of the winning guild will be  
able to choose an extravagant prize!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't tell me, it's a high-end osechi dish or something?! *drool...*  
  
**Karin：**  
Ah... Food isn't on the list because there's a risk of it spoiling.  
You see, food poisoning and such would be unacceptable  
from an Association perspective...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine's stomach is not so weak.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Koro, is that supposed to be a compliment?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's a shame there's no food involved,  
but I love the idea of being named the Lucky Guild. ♪  
I wonder if we could compete too...  
  
**Karin：**  
There's no food as such, but there are meal vouchers!  
For more prize details, please consult this catalog.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Th-thank you very much...  
  
**Karyl：**  
You want to participate...?  
  
By no stretch of the imagination are we dressed right for this!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
C'mon Karyl, don't sweat the details!  
Kimono racing is sure to make for some fun memories!  
  
**Karyl：**  
If we could run on memories, we wouldn't have such a hard time...  
  
**Suzume：**  
I-I couldn't possibly take part together with you guys, could I?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wha? What's with you all of a sudden?  
  
**Suzume：**  
W-well... One of the prizes is a feywood kadomatsu...  
It's said that this kadomatsu is imbued with the blessings of a  
great spirit, and will bring good luck for the whole year it's on display.  
  
**Suzume：**  
It's an extremely expensive item that's well beyond the reach of the  
Orphanage.  
But if I could get my hands on it, I'd like to send it to  
milady's business partner who I covered in soup...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's great thinking!  
All right! Suzume's joining our team! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, I'm not gonna bother.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huuuh! Let's run the race together!  
C'mon, I'm sure there's a perfect extravagant prize for you too. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Get that catalog outta my face!  
No way they have anything I want...  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Tickets for a full-course meal at a fancy restaurant?!  
W-we're always eating monster meat,  
so going somewhere like that for a  
change maybe wouldn't be so bad...  
Pecorine would love that, right?  
  
**Karyl：**  
...*sigh*. All right, all right.  
If you insist, I might as well take part too.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yay! ♪ I'm glad you're suddenly motivated to join!  
Which prize convinced you?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Th-that's for me to know and you to find out!  
It's got nothing to do with the rest of you!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ah, that makes it five people.  
But only four can run...  
Ummm.  
  
**Karyl：**  
In that case, what if {player} uses his powers from the sideline  
in order to support us? That way—  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl, cheating is inadmissible.  
Besides, forcing my lord to run is something I simply cannot do...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'll just try my best to cheer you on.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, my lord... with your support, this race is as good as won.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Simple as that...  
Rules-wise, is it okay for Suzume to join our team?  
  
**Karin：**  
Yes, it's no problem at all.  
In the same way, there are other racers signed up with different guilds—  
  
**Kurumi：**  
B-Big Sis Suzume?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh? Wait, Kurumi, is that you?  
What are you doing here?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ummm... Er... I wanted to join the race, so...  
I decided to participate with Little Lyrical...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Whaaaa?! A-are you sure you really want to?!  
You'll have to do lots of running!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I know. I thought that maybe running in front of lots of people could be  
like acting practice. They'll be using projection magic to broadcast the  
race all over Landosol, so if I try my best, Mama Saren might see me.  
  
**Suzume：**  
B-broadcast?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I-I was hoping to do my best to redeem myself  
without her knowing what I'm up to...  
But there's a good chance she'll see me...  
  
**Commentator：**  
Calling all racers! Participants in the first leg are to gather at the starting line!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ahhh. I-I have to go now...  
I'll try my very best not to lose to you and your friends.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Uhh, sure! T-take care of yourself out there!  
  
**Commentator：**  
In the first leg, the course takes racers through the streets of Landosol!  
Second-leg racers, please take your positions at the first handoff zone!  
Other guild members are welcome to ride alongside the race in wagons!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Now, the battle to become the Lucky Guild is about to begin!  
Which guild will be the first to pass the sash?!  
  
![503100002.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/503100002.webp)  
**Tomo：**  
Usually it's a sword, but today this sash  
is a symbol of Nightmare's pride...  
I'll come out on top, no matter the cost.  
  
`image display end`  
**Lima：**  
I-I'm not a monster, so relax, okay?  
*sigh* Running in a costume is really tough!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myahahah. I'll show you all the Mercurius Foundation's secret weapon!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
*inhale* *exhale*... *inhale* *exhale*...  
  
**Ninon：**  
May the presiders over warriors be my vanguard!  
Heehee... My mental concentration is perfect...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Why am I in the first leg?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? Because you said you're raring to go so bad it's crazy...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't overexaggerate! As if I would say something like that!  
  
**Commentator：**  
On your marks! Get seeet...! GO!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
See ya later!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey! Hold up! Wait for me, you guys!  
  
**Tomo：**  
This is a race. Nobody will wait for you, even if you ask them nicely.  
  
**Commentator：**  
Uh-oh, Karyl was so distracted by Pecorine's  
retort that she's already far behind!  
Gourmet Guild, I feel for you!  
  
**Karyl：**  
! Just as I thought, it's really hard to run in this thing!  
Argh, it's gonna get all messed up!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Now, a while has passed since the race started, and we have Tomo,  
Tamaki, and Ninon in the top three respectively! Then Lima in fourth,  
and lagging behind them is Kurumi, with Karyl bringing up the rear.  
  
**Tomo：**  
There's no knowing what kind of snide remarks I'll hear from Christina if I  
don't have an overwhelming lead when I hand the sash over to her for the  
next leg, so it's time I did something about this neck-and-neck situation.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...It should be about time.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Tamaki, now!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I've been waiting for this! Full throttle! Away!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Wow! She's suddenly swifter than the wind!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Here comes Tamaki, with a sudden burst of speed!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
The Mercurius Foundation spent a lot of money to develop  
these speed-boosting boots...  
aptly nyamed \"Cheetahs\"!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It's bordering on unfair, but this kitty's feet are evolving!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ninpo: Taiyaki Tirade no Jutsu!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Meow, meow, meow! Taiyaki! Tons of taiyaki falling from the sky!  
Don't mind if I do!  
...N-nyasty... It tastes like paper...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Haahaahaa! You are correct! That happens to be papier-mâché taiyaki!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Looks like I can take advantage of this sabotage...  
Now's my chance!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Goodness! While Tamaki and Ninon were making a fuss,  
Tomo burst into the lead! Is this the decider for the first leg?!  
  
**Ninon：**  
S-stealing a march is dishonorable!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah. ☆ You're in first place, Tomo!  
Quickly, hand over the sash!  
  
**Tomo：**  
*huff, puff*... What, no words of gratitude?  
Well, not that I expected any.  
I'll leave the next part to you.  
  
**Christina：**  
A magnificent opening act!  
Now, I take the lead role!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Shapan! Go forth like lightning!  
  
**Monika：**  
Right! The distance between me and first place is negligible!  
I won't let your efforts go to waste!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Akino, ya gotta cat-ch up to her!  
  
**Akino：**  
Goodness, how can you mess up while wearing Cheetahs?  
When the race is over, I shall have you reimburse  
the development fees!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
That's so cruel!  
  
**Commentator：**  
One by one, the top racers are handing over  
their sashes to their second-leg runners!  
What happened to the competitors at the back of the pack?!  
  
**Lima：**  
Ahhhhh! You're all so fast!  
Wait for me!  
*PTHEH*! *PTHEH*! *PTHEH*!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Why could it be...? Lima is spitting all over the place.  
  
**Karyl：**  
*huff, puff*... I can't believe *I'm* in last place...  
If I wasn't dressed like this...  
Huh?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
*puff*... *pant, pant*...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Is that... Kurumi, was it?  
I can definitely overtake her.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Eeek!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Kurumi!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Kurumi has unexpectedly fallen over! This is Karyl's chance!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah! What a lucky break!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
*whimper*... *sniff*... *sniff*...  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Argh. Hey, you.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Eek! Y-yes...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Heh... Get on.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm gonna give you a piggyback ride, so get on!  
You're hurt, so you shouldn't overdo it.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl...  
  
**Commentator：**  
An unexpected helping hand! How wonderful!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
B-but—  
  
**Karyl：**  
Argh, what a nuisance! Up you go!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Waahhh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ngh! There... Are you holding on tight?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I-I acted all cool back there,  
but trying to race with someone on your back is tough.  
I'm already running out of strength...  
  
**Lima：**  
Are you okaaay?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey! Wh-why are you running the wrong way?!  
  
**Lima：**  
This little kid is injured, so I couldn't just leave her!  
So you can ride in here!  
  
**Karyl：**  
What the...? A trailer?  
  
**Lima：**  
Either way, I'm far behind first place,  
and ignoring the two of you so I can hand the sash to Shiori  
feels kind of wrong.  
  
**Lima：**  
Come on, get in, get in!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're a big softy.  
All right, I'm in.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Th-thank you...  
  
**Lima：**  
Here we gooo!

The passionate display of friendship has the crowd roaring in applause!

This is the New Year's Landosol Guild Race!
