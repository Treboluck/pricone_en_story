## Subtitle: Right before the Finish Line
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Everybody, the race will soon come to an end. It was a remarkably  
impassioned race, in which each of us put our faith on the line.  
I feel it is somewhat bittersweet, would you not say?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm dead tired after being forced to race in this kimono...  
It's such a relief to think that all this silliness is finally over.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
C'mon, Karyl, enough of the negativity.  
The look on your face when you  
were frantically running to keep up... How we screamed together right at  
the very end—  
they will always remain in my heart as precious memories!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Sh-shut up! Forget about those things, right now!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh.  
Miss Suzume, as the star of the race,  
could you please say a few final words?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh?! M-me?! Er, um...  
E-everyone! I'll keep my focus right until the very end, and I'll enjoy  
emery movent—  
W-waaah! I messed up right at the end!
