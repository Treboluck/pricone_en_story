**Karyl：**  
Man, what a difficult god!  
How much more does it need to rampage before it's had enough?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
*sob*... Mountain God, why won't you compose yourself?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I suppose this much is not enough to abate the residual excitement  
from the race.  
However, we cannot let it continue like this...  
It seems this time be a fight to the death.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Looks like we're near our limits on both sides of this battle.  
If that's the case, we'll have to settle this soon!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
C'mon, we're in the home stretch!  
Let's give it everything we've got!
