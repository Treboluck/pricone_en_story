**Commentator：**  
The competition has entered the second leg!  
Here each racer must complete the tasks  
presented at two checkpoints in order to progress.  
  
**Commentator：**  
Speed and strength alone... won't win this race! The current standings  
are as follows! In first place is Christina. In second is Monika.  
Akino is in third. Following them are the racers from the other guilds!  
  
**Christina：**  
I appreciate your detailed explanation!  
Dear audience, I am Christina. ☆  
In first place is Christina Morgan!  
  
**Akino：**  
Reiterating your position at the top of your lungs is so vulgar...  
I'll pull you off the top spot in a heartbeat!  
  
**Monika：**  
As far as I'm concerned, both of them are rather loud…  
Hm? What's that...?  
  
**Commentator：**  
The top three racers have reached the halfway point!  
On to the first task!  
  
**Monika：**  
What...? \"Go to the checkpoint with your idea of a feast.\"  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh? My idea of a feast...?  
How simple.  
I'll summon Nightmare's chef and have him whip me up a full course in no time!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Wha—?! Y-you don't have time to waste on something so pointless!  
Are you trying to ruin my efforts?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Old lady Christina!  
I'll have some Tora Tiger Chips!  
  
**Christina：**  
I thought I told you to cease with the \"old lady\" bit, little girl. ♪  
I'll add you as part of the full course.  
  
**Akino：**  
Nightmare's chef?! I cannot be beaten here...  
Their opponent will be the Wistaria Family's chef!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmph. You think a mere merchant's chef can take us on?  
Guards! Have the palace chef prepare a full course right now!  
Consider yourself beheaded if we lose!  
  
**Commentator：**  
My, oh my! Although it wasn't intended to be a cooking competition,  
inadvertently, that's how it's turned out!  
In the meantime, the other racers have reached the checkpoint!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
\"Your idea of a feast\"? ...That would be...  
  
**Commentator：**  
What's this?!  
Kyoka of Little Lyrical has already brought something with her!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Um, this is...  
a cupcake my mom made me bring as a snack.  
Store-bought cupcakes are tasty, but my favorites are definitely  
the ones my mom makes...  
  
**Commentator：**  
This is undeniably a feeeast!  
Somehow Kyoka, who was trailing behind, is now in the lead!  
  
**Shiori：**  
What should I do...? If they wanted a book recommendation or  
something, I'd be able to give them one in an instant...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Shioshio! How 'bout this?! It's Elizabeth Park's deluxe cheese!  
This cheese, made with such care—  
ain't no doubt the folks of  
Landosol have eaten it at least once!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Mahiru!  
Y-you're right. This cheese is rich and nutritious...  
Eating it gives you tons of energy. It really is a feast.  
  
**Shiori：**  
One of the reasons my health improved  
was because of all the fresh food at the ranch...  
My idea of a feast is Elizabeth Park cheese!  
  
**Commentator：**  
I see! Indeed, this is a familiar feast!  
Shiori takes second place!  
  
**Monika：**  
Hmmm. It's simply what you consider a feast, is it?  
If that's the case, how about this cracker that we at Weissflügel  
are considering officially adopting?!  
  
**Ninon：**  
That's an emergency ration...  
  
**Yuki：**  
My stomach will scream if we adopt something  
that doesn't have even a hint of moisture in it.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Heehee. Something so stiff and pointy won't be going in my mouth.  
  
**Monika：**  
Is that right...? So this isn't a feast then...  
I thought you would all be happy, so I made a lot of preparations...  
  
**Kuka：**  
...H-huuuh?  
Actually, I feel like I could handle such a stiff object.  
Maybe I'm a bad girl.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Sh-she's right.  
If someone with my beauty eats it,  
there's no doubt it will become known as a feast.  
  
**Ninon：**  
*chomp*  
Oh! It's delicious like regular food!  
  
**Monika：**  
R-really?! Then I'm glad...  
I actually came up with a way to make it easier to eat—  
  
**Yuki：**  
Enough, we don't need an explanation, so go.  
Or are you paralyzed in awe after once again realizing my beauty?  
  
**Monika：**  
Ah! R-right! I have to catch up to those two!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Meanwhile, Christina and Akino are waiting for two full course meals to be prepared!  
Just what on earth did those two come here for?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Pecorine! What the heck are you thinking?!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Oh! It looks like the Gourmet Guild members  
are having a little trouble of their own!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The best kind of feast is obviously monster cuisine!  
I've already got a fire going, so I'll be done in no time!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Don't tell me you just ran off to the moors to hunt  
and came back with a monster before anyone noticed...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Waste not, want not! Right? ♪ Yay, all done!  
Ah, I made enough for the audience too!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't start handing out your weird food to the masses!  
If you've finished cooking, then get going, you idiot!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A meal becomes a feast when everyone enjoys it together. ♪  
  
**Commentator：**  
A bowl of Pecorine's monster food  
has made its way to the commentator's seat...  
For some reason it's glowing... *chomp*  
  
**Commentator：**  
Th-th-th-th-th-th-th-this tastes AMAAAZIIING!  
It melts in the mouth, and it's filled with mysterious juices!  
Everyone in the audience is chowing down!  
  
**Christina：**  
The Wistaria Family's full course meal is beyond expectations...  
Particularly this osso buco. It's cooked to perfection.  
  
**Akino：**  
And Nightmare's full course is as good as it gets.  
This galantine​... What impeccable flavor.  
  
**Commentator：**  
Those two are digging in to each other's dishes with absolute relish!  
This is no longer a race, but simply lunchtime!  
  
**Commentator：**  
However, that doesn't change the fact that it's a feast!  
All racers have cleared the first task! What on earth could the next task  
be? We wait with bated breath to find out!  
  
**Commentator：**  
What's this? For some reason, Shiori and Kyoka, who should have  
reached the second checkpoint by now, have come back.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Umm... {player}... Can I ask a favor?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
......  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's up?  
`Tag 1`  
**Shiori：**  
Well, I made it to the second checkpoint with this girl, but the task there  
was to \"take a trusted member of the opposite sex to the relay station at  
the third leg.\" So we were wondering if you would accompany us.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I-I don't necessarily trust you,  
but I don't know any other boys...  
So I have no other choice!  
  
**Monika：**  
Hold it! If you're coming, then you're coming with me!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh! If I need a boy I can trust, then I'll take him too!  
  
**Monika：**  
Hey, don't meddle in the business of others!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Didn't you meddle in our business first?  
{player} is coming with Shiori and me!  
  
**Akino：**  
Why are you having this conversation without us?!  
  
**Christina：**  
If that is the nature of the next task,  
then I cannot let you have the boy.  
  
**Commentator：**  
It's a battlefiiiiield!  
  
**Commentator：**  
The racers are all fighting over one boy!  
An enviable scene is unfolding right before our eyes!  
  
**Commentator：**  
There are audience members who are  
weeping bitter tears and grinding their teeth!  
As a man, I feel the saaame!  
  
**Christina：**  
Yes, perfect!  
If it's going to be that way, let's gamble our lives for the boy, princess. ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
W-w-wait! Let's resolve this peacefully—  
  
**Christina：**  
D I E. ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Woah! This woman definitely just wanted to fight!  
  
**Akino：**  
How barbaric...  
Well, let's go while we have the chance—  
  
**Monika：**  
I won't allow you to get away with this, you coward!  
  
**Akino：**  
My! What an awfully rude child!  
  
**Monika：**  
Child?!  
I am a fully grown woman!  
  
**Shiori：**  
P-please... Everyone, calm down...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
You've seduced this many girls...?  
It's like I always said, you're a suspicious creep!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Um... I think you might have to choose one of us...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I can't choose just one of you.  
**Choice: (3)**  You're all important to me.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kyoka：**  
You're horrible...  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Kyoka：**  
I was right, you are a creep...  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Commentator：**  
Er... At this rate, it's likely that blood will be spilled,  
so everyone can take that boy  
to the next checkpoint. I shall allow it!  
  
**Commentator：**  
An unexpected turn of events!  
The power of one boy has everyone on equal footing!  
This will put the third-leg runners in a difficult situation!  
  
**Narration：**  
Meanwhile, Saren is walking through the city center on her way to a business meeting.  
  
**Saren：**  
*sigh*... I haven't had the chance to talk to Suzume at all lately...  
She seems quite down. I wonder if she's all right...  
  
**Commentator：**  
Well, well, there's been lots of drama in the first leg!  
Karyl assisting a fallen Kurumi...  
That was a true act of sportsmanship!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Incidentally, Suzume, who, like Kurumi,  
is from Sarendia Orphanage,  
will be running for the Gourmet Guild in the fourth leg!  
  
**Saren：**  
...Huh?
