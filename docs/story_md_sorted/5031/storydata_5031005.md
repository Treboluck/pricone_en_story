# Advent of the Mountain God!
Suzume starts to feel weak, but picks her feet up again thanks to the encouragement she receives from the Gourmet Guild. Meanwhile, Matsuri jumps to the top, and the audience starts cheering for her as the Mountain God. However, the commotion causes a disturbance, and the [i]real[/i] Mountain God—the local deity—is summoned to the race.

Now, in the lead by a tremendous margin,  
we have Mimi, riding atop Mr. Mini-Gryphon!  
Can she hold on to the top spot?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Heehee. I'm number one.  
Amazing, right?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Come on, Mimi!  
It actually looks like we're gonna win!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Best not get our hopes up just yet!  
Based on what we've seen so far,  
I wouldn't be surprised if something weird happened...  
  
**Mini-Gryphon：**  
Eeky squeaky, purrrrrr!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Hm? Mr. Mini-Gryphon, are you hungry?  
...Oh yeah, carrying me must use up lots of energy.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Here, I've brought some snacks. Let's eat them together!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Mimi has stopped to take a break!  
Could this be what they call the luxury of strength?!  
What a frightening girl!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Mimi's... having a picnic, isn't she?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Her actions are totally unpredictable...  
  
**Mimi：**  
*munch* Yum yum!  
  
**Suzume：**  
*huff, puff*...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, I really can't see anyone anymore...  
It's over for me... I don't even have any strength left...  
  
**Suzume：**  
If I wasn't here, the Gourmet Guild would probably...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey! Don't go getting all soft!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
There's still a ways to go until the end! It's too early to give up!  
  
**Suzume：**  
B-but... even if I go all out from here—  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's not about winning!  
I think... it's about running the whole way!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You can definitely make it to the goal  
with the sash that we've all passed along!  
Because it has all of our encouragement in it!

**Suzume：**  
Everyone's encouragement...  
  
**Suzume：**  
You're right... It's absolutely unacceptable for me, a maid,  
to waste the feelings that everyone has shared with me!  
  
`image display end`  
**Suzume：**  
...Thank you all so much.  
I won't give up!  
  
**Suzume：**  
If I give up here, I'll really be a disaster of a maid!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Mimi was in the lead by a fair margin, but Kuka,  
Matsuri, and Mahiru have all finally overtaken her!  
  
**Mimi：**  
That was so tasty.  
Mr. Mini-Gryphon,  
looks like we're playing catch-up again!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Mimi has finished her picnic, and is once again riding Mini-Gryphon,  
chasing the lead! As I thought, only speed can put you head and  
shoulders above the rest!  
  
**Kuka：**  
*sigh...* I'm feeling less enthusiastic now that I've left the volcano.  
There's not enough out here to keep me aroused.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Now's my chance!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
No you don't!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Mahiru and Matsuri are locked in a fierce battle for first place!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
*pant, pant*... This young'un just ain't lettin' up!  
I think I'm already...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'm a... I'm a hero.  
I'm a hero,  
and I'm the Mountain Gooood!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Matsuri—I mean the Mountain God, leaps out in frooont!  
  
**Audience：**  
Mountain God! Mountain God! Mountain God!  
  
**Commentator：**  
The audience has broken out the Mountain God call!  
Right now, the crowd is impassioned by the sight of her gallant figure!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Hm? I-is that an earthquake?  
  
**???：**  
Ogo! Ogo! Ogo!  
  
**Commentator：**  
N-no... Something massive is running this way...  
It's... It's...  
  
**???：**  
OGOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I-it looks like a mountain, but it's movin'!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wh-why's it chasing me?! Is it a monster?!  
  
**Commentator：**  
IT'S THE MOUNTAIN GOOOOOOOD!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? But I'm the Mountain God—  
  
**Commentator：**  
According to local folklore, the god of racing is the Mountain God!  
Simply beholding him is said to be a blessing in itself!  
I never thought I would see the day!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Apparently it mistook Matsuri's cries, along with the fervor around the  
race, for its own summoning!  
That's how intense this year's race is!  
  
**Karin：**  
This isn't the time for composed commentary!  
This is the Guild Association! Due to the perceived danger, the race is called off immediate—  
  
**Mountain God：**  
Ogo! Ogo!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...Miss Guild Association!  
I don't think the Mountain God's here to fight!  
It's probably here to join the race!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Yes! Matsuri is absolutely right!  
According to folklore, the Mountain God is always  
searching for opponents worthy of racing against.  
  
**Commentator：**  
Therefore, the race must go on!  
Can woman defeat god?! The competition enters the final phase!  
  
**Karin：**  
I-I will not be held responsible for whatever happens!  
  
**Mountain God：**  
Ogo! Ogo!  
  
**Kuka：**  
A-aahhh.! Every time the Mountain God takes a step, I can feel the vibrations!  
I'm trembling in all the right places!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wh-what's worse, with each step it takes,  
boulders come flyin' down at us!  
There ain't no way we can keep runnin'!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Without a doubt, it's a natural disaster on legs!  
Each step is followed by a tremendous tremor!  
Valued trackside spectators, please beware of falling rocks!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Urk... What'sh all thish shakin'...? Makin' me wanna barf...  
I retire...  
  
**Akino：**  
Hold on a minute, Yukari! I will not allow it!  
Just throw your guts up and get going!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Akino... You'll out us as a shady guild, so ya better stop.  
Yukari's... had enough.  
  
**Akino：**  
Eeeek!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Either way, that drunken running has taken her well past her limit.  
Retiring here would be astute. It's a pity though.  
  
**Commentator：**  
Finally, we have a retiree!  
Due to the Mountain God's intrusion, this race is getting tumultuous!  
  
**Driver：**  
Whoa! That was close! Wh-what the...?  
  
**Saren：**  
Is something the matter?  
  
**Driver：**  
Well, these fallen rocks are blocking the road.  
Looks like we're not getting through.  
  
**Saren：**  
Fallen rocks? Wow, it's true...  
You're right, this is impassable...  
And we can't just move them out of the way.  
  
**Soldier 1：**  
Hey, what should we do with this cannon?!  
  
**Soldier 2：**  
Oh, we don't need it anymore, so put it over there for now!  
More importantly, we've gotta clear up these fallen rocks.  
We'll be here all day. Damn it...  
  
**Saren：**  
......
