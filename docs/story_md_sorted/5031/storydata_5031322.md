Hm. For some reason the condition of my feet is worsening.  
  
**Suzume：**  
That's not all. I suddenly feel really tired...  
Is the Mountain God doing this to us?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Seriously?! It's already way too difficult to move in these clothes.  
Now it's just being a pain!  
  
**Suzume：**  
The Mountain God doesn't look like it's ready to let up just yet.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's gonna be a tough battle,  
but if we work together, I know we can bring it down!
