# Bound to Finish
With the help of the Gourmet Guild, Suzume battles with the Mountain God for the top spot, but her energy finally begins to run out. However, at that moment, Saren rushes onto the scene, and with her support, Suzume goes all out in the homestretch.
  
## Subtitle: Bound to Finish
  
**Narration：**  
Due to the Mountain God's calamitous running,  
the alpine path has become more perilous,  
and Suzume, who's bringing up the rear, is nearing her limit.  
  
**Suzume：**  
*pant*... *pant*... *pant*...  
  
**Suzume：**  
If milady... If milady could see me now, what would she say?  
\"You don't have to run\"? \"There's no need to try so hard\"?  
  
**Suzume：**  
No... She would say, \"You must win. I'll be waiting at the finish line.\"  
Her kindness towards me is an expression of her belief in me.  
So I absolutely cannot give up!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I've decided—I'll never cause her trouble ever again!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Can you believe it?! Even though the appearance of the  
Mountain God caused Suzume to lose her pace,  
she's somehow almost caught up with the lead pack!  
  
**Suzume：**  
My vision's getting fuzzy...  
But my body's telling me that if I stop now,  
I won't be able to move anymore...  
  
**Commentator：**  
And the crowd is going wild for Suzume, who simply refuses to give up!  
Who would have thought that she would get this far?!  
However, the look on her face tells me that she's nearing her limit!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We knew you had it in you!  
Right, Karyl?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, don't put words in my mouth!  
But yeah, you're the one who said you wanted to join the race,  
so it would suck if you didn't make this far. That's all.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. Yet, Miss Karyl, you were the first to invite Suzume to join us.  
I hope she is all right... It looks very painful...  
  
**Mountain God：**  
Ogo! Ogo!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
*pant, pant* I-I ran too fast. I'm totally beat...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Hngh. I've almost had as much as I can take...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Then this is my chance!  
...Is what I wanna say, but I just ain't got the strength no more...  
  
**Commentator：**  
In spite of fatigue, somehow the top three are keeping up with the  
Mountain God! And Suzume is tailing close behind!  
However, the question is, can she catch up before the finish line?!  
  
**Mountain God：**  
Ogo?! OGOOOOOOOO!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Ooohhh, careful now! In response to Suzume's final push,  
the Mountain God is even more determined!  
Falling rocks have become more frequent!  
  
**Mini-Gryphon：**  
Eeky squeaky, purrrrrr!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Hippety, hoppety! ♪  
  
**Commentator：**  
Mimi, still riding Mr. Mini-Gryphon, is jumping on top of the falling rocks!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Eheheh. This is so fun! ♪  
  
**Commentator：**  
Er... Mimi... was having so much fun with falling rocks  
that she's veered off course and is heading in the wrong direction.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wait, Mimi! Come baaack!  
  
**Mountain God：**  
OGOOOOOOOO!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
W-whaaa! Th-  
this isn't the time to be racing!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
O-our lives're more important!  
Hurry, we gotta evacuate!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-it's getting too rough! My body can't take any more!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Three racers and their respective guild wagons have apparently decided  
to seek refuge from the Mountain God! Due to this, the Mountain God  
is in the lead, with second place—can you believe it—being Suzume!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Whaaa! Whoooah! Eeeek!  
  
**Commentator：**  
What a miraculous display of rock dodging!  
However, these falling boulders just might yet  
force Suzume to abandon the race!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
No, this is a good opportunity!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We'll hold them back, so you just focus on running!  
Hiyaaaahh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Haaaaahhh!  
  
**Commentator：**  
What a surprise! The Gourmet Guild isn't escaping, but rather helping!  
Holding back the lithic onslaught with attacks, they're ignoring danger  
while their wagon runs alongside Suzume!  
  
**Suzume：**  
*pant, pant*... Th-thanks, everyone...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Just a little more and you will have caught up, Miss Suzume!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ah, look out!  
  
**Suzume：**  
...!  
  
**Commentator：**  
A massive boulder just fell right in front of Suzume! She's come to a complete stop!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Damn it! We missed one!  
  
**Suzume：**  
...Ngh...  
  
**Suzume：**  
I can't... go on...  
  
**Commentator：**  
Suzume has been running on fumes!  
Now that she's at a standstill, can she find her feet again?!  
Is this it for her?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So this is... as far as she goes. I am concerned for her welfare.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-what now?  
After all that, the Mountain God's running solo?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
...I knew it. I can't accomplish anything I try. I'm useless...  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm so sorry... everyone... Milady Miss Saren...  
  
**???：**  
...zume! ...Suzume!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Eheh. Right at the very end I can hear her voice, but I know it's not real...  
I must love her so much...  
  
**Saren：**  
Suzume! Get a hold of yourself!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hm? Huh? M-Milady... Why...?  
  
**Soldier 1：**  
Come on, ex-Vice-Captain. Don't go getting all showy now.  
  
**Soldier 2：**  
I would never have thought of using a cannon  
to destroy the fallen rocks and clear the road.  
Hmmm. Brilliant... I've just become her biggest fan.  
  
**Soldier 1：**  
At the very least, now that all those rocks are smashed up,  
we don't have any tidying to do. Everything turned out great!

**Suzume：**  
Why are you here, milady?  
  
**Saren：**  
I knew you and Kurumi were taking part, so I rushed out here!  
But forget that! You have to get up!  
If I were you, I wouldn't give up after coming so far!  
  
**Suzume：**  
But, but... I'm useless. And I'm nothing but a bother to you...  
  
**Saren：**  
And that's okay! Even when you thought you were being a nuisance,  
you saved me over and over again. I'm not asking for perfection!  
  
**Saren：**  
Seeing your smiling face every day is what keeps me going!  
Whether you believe in yourself or not, *I* believe in you.  
I always have, and I always will...  
  
**Saren：**  
As your master and your friend... so long as you are you,  
the way I see it, that's more important than anything!  
  
**Suzume：**  
So long as I'm myself, smiling every day...  
  
**Suzume：**  
How could I forget that milady... Miss Saren is that kind of person?  
I can't believe I was afraid she'd abandon me...  
I can't believe I didn't trust in this person who calls me a friend.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Milady, please... give me another chance... I-I—!  
  
**Saren：**  
Of course! Now, you must go... No—you must *win*, Suzume!  
I'll be waiting for you at the finish line!

**Suzume：**  
Yes! I'll make it, I promise, milady!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Suzume's eyes are once again ablaze with the spirit of battle!  
Could it be that the words of her master  
reignited the flames of passion in her heart?!  
  
**Mountain God：**  
Ogo! Ogo! OGOOOO!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I won't lose! I won't give up!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Suzume, are you feeling all right?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Yes! Milady's words filled me with energy!  
I'm sorry for worrying you.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't you dare lose after making it this far!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Suzume, hurry up and win so we can all share a tasty meal together!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I *will* win. Because I have you all with me!  
  
**Commentator：**  
WHAT INCREDIBLE SPEEEEED! Such a magnificent recovery!  
Sorrows, troubles—Suzume has left them all behind  
and is moving onward! And now she's broken through her limiiiiit!  
  
**Commentator：**  
The guilds seemed helpless against the sudden appearance of the  
Mountain God... However, there was one runner who was ready to  
put the brakes on its rapid advance...!  
  
**Commentator：**  
For a moment she dropped to dead last, but strove desperately to catch  
up to the lead—the miracle shrine maiden, Suzume! She's only a hair's  
breadth behind the Mountain God, and is laboring not to widen the gap!  
  
**Commentator：**  
We're almost at the finish...  
The New Year's Landosol Guild Race is finally reaching its climax!  
  
**Saren：**  
That was an amazing comeback.  
I'm so glad that I got to see you pull it off.  
Come, let's go and see the others.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Uh, um... Milady, can we stay like this for just a little longer...?  
  
**Saren：**  
Huh?  
  
**Suzume：**  
My legs are about to fall off... I can't manage another step.  
  
**Saren：**  
...Heheh. Understood.  
If you like, I can carry you bridal style.  
  
**Suzume：**  
B-bridal style?! Th-that would be far too embarrassing!  
  
**Saren：**  
Ahahah. I'm joking.  
Besides, that wouldn't be very fitting of your victory.  
You can ride on my shoulders like a champion.  
  
**Commentator：**  
She truly is the Mountain God Shrine Maiden! Let's hear it for Suzume!  
Give her a huge round of applause! The winner is the Gourmet Guild!  
Their splendid display bags them the Landosol Guild Race victor's crown!
