Suzume joins the Gourmet Guild to compete in the New Year's Landosol Guild Race in order to win luxurious prizes and the title of Lucky Guild!
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Dressed in our best and enjoying the end of the year, we, the Gourmet  
Guild, happened upon Miss Suzume, who was working as a part-time  
shrine maiden.  
For some reason, she seemed to be in low spirits...  
  
**Karyl：**  
What the heck is this New Year's Landosol Guild Race?  
Huh? Lucky Guild? What's that?  
Well, there are luxurious prizes  
to be won,  
so I guess we've got no choice but to take part!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Since we're here, we might as well participate with Suzume. ♪  
C'mon, it'll be loads of fun!  
  
**Suzume：**  
What?! Me too?!  
Well, but look at those prizes...  
If I could get hold of that one, then maybe...
