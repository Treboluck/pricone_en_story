**All：**  
Happy New Year!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh. ♪  
This year, I hope we find more amazing, more exquisite  
gastronomic delights than anything we've ever had!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah, as long as it's not monster cuisine...  
Well, let's just take things easy.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Heheh. As you say.  
My lord, this year as well, please permit me  
to serve you with my wholehearted devotion.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Suzume, what kind of year do you want it to be?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Let me think...  
  
I hope we can all have a peaceful and happy year.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Suzume, what wonderful hopes you maintain.  
I am very much impressed.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I-it's not really that big of a deal.  
I was just thinking that it would be nice  
if we could all be happy together, that's all!  
  
**Karyl：**  
All happy together?  
Sounds good to me. It's just like you to say that.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm gonna work my butt off so that we can have a fantastic year! ♪  
How crazy is that?! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
{player}, I hope we'll be great friends this year too!
