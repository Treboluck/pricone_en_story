## Subtitle: Landosol's Last Day
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is having a normal, peaceful day when  
Hatsune rushes over, looking very pale.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
{player}, I'm so glad I finally found you!  
This is bad! This is really bad!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I had a prophetic dream!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Do you know what those are? It's when you have a dream that  
predicts the future!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I've had dreams like that before.  
**Choice: (2)**  That sounds like a superpower you'd have.  
`Tag 1`  
**Hatsune：**  
Really?! You've got superpowers too?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
You had a dream about curry, so you had curry for lunch?  
Th-that doesn't count at all!

`Tag 2`  
**Hatsune：**  
I know, right?  
Prophetic dreams are a kind of superpower too,  
so any time I have them, I wake up exhausted and just go right  
back to sleep.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wait!  
Now's not the time to talk about that!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Hatsune：**  
Listen! Landosol's in danger!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I saw it in my dream!  
A meteor's going to come crashing down on  
Landosol. And I mean, a *huge* one!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
You... probably don't believe me, huh? It's so completely  
off-the-wall...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I believe you.  
**Choice: (5)**  I kinda do and kinda don't.  
`Tag 4`  
**Hatsune：**  
Really?!  
Thank you! You really are the greatest friend I could  
ever ask for!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Hatsune：**  
So you kinda believe me then?  
Heehee. That's good enough for me.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Hatsune：**  
S-so what are we gonna do? If there really is a meteor coming,  
then everyone here is in danger... They're all going to  
lose their home! It's just so horrible...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Can we at least evacuate everyone?  
**Choice: (8)**  Is there any way to destroy the meteor?  
`Tag 7`  
**Hatsune：**  
You're right. If we can at least get the people to safety,  
then...  
Wait, but nobody's going to believe me, are they?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I can't tell them about my superpowers... Even if I could,  
there's no guarantee they'd believe that, either.  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh?! How are we supposed to do that?  
There's no way!  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Hatsune：**  
What is it?  
You have an idea?  
Huh? You want me to think back to  
that time I got more sleep than usual?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, that's right!  
If I get tons of sleep like before, my  
superpowers get overcharged!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Who knows? Maybe I *can* destroy a meteor!  
And even if I can't,  
I can at least change its trajectory, right? That way, it won't  
crash into the town!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Yeah, that's a great idea! Gosh, you are such a little  
smartie-pants!  
All right, let's get sleepin'!  
  

---  
  
**Hatsune：**  
This is my favorite spot. It feels so nice that you're asleep  
before you know it.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hey, why don't you nap with me?  
I know if you're by my side,  
I'll sleep even better. So... please?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
You will?  
Thank you! Just get on over here and lie down.  
Good night, {player}. ♪  
  

---  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hnnn! What a nice nap...  
Yep! I'm definitely feeling  
two-hundred percent!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, looks like {player} is still sleeping...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
You should stay here and rest. If I fail and the meteor hits,  
you'll be safe out here.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
But I'll make sure nothing goes wrong.  
I've got a whole town to  
save! I have all the power I need.  
I'll protect Landosol, even  
if it kills me.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
{player}... Thank you for always being there for me.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
You always looked after me when I fell asleep... and you  
kept my superpowers a secret from everyone, too.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Every day I've spent with you has been amazing.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh! And just in case...  
If I can't stop the meteor and it smooshes me and the town...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Please... take care of Shiorin.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
She's more important to me than anyone else in the whole wide  
world.  
I know I can count on you to keep her safe.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
If you're there for her... it'll make her feel better too.  
And if she's happy, then I'm happy.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Or so I say. I think really, I'm... a little jealous.  
It kind of hurts, but just a little...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Actually... I think... it's more than just a little.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
This might be the end, so I want to say it.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
{player}... I love you.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Heehee. Sorry I couldn't say it while you were awake.  
But this is the end, so it's all I can do.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
So... I'll be going now.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
It's really here...!  
Ugh! Why couldn't this have just been a  
regular dream instead of a prophetic one?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
But this is fine! I got plenty of sleep,  
so a little meteor is  
no match for me! Come get some!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Taaake that!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Rrgh... Ggh! I-it's so heavy... I recharged so much...  
My superpowers are stronger than ever before...!  
So why? Why can't I break this?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I-I don't know if I can keep going...!  
  

---  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh? Wh-what? It's so light all of a sudden...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
It's like my powers got a sudden boost...  
Wait, is this...?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
{player}! I knew it... It was you!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I-I can't believe you... I was going to do this all alone!  
I didn't want to put you in danger!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
But what's done is done. Now I REALLY can't afford to fail!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Let's blast this thing together, {player}!  
Ready now?!  
Taaake that!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh... oh my gosh...  
We did it!  
We destroyed the meteor!  
And it's all thanks to you, {player}!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I'm so glad... The whole town is safe.  
You know, I actually thought I'd never see you again.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Th-that's why... I said all that stuff to him while he was  
sleeping...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wait... *Was* he sleeping?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
H-hey, {player}?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
You were sleeping earlier, right?  
You didn't... hear anything I said, right?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Like what?  
Um, w-well...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Like how I...  
*yawn*  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh... Oh no... I'm getting all sleepy again... A-and I had  
something really important to say, too... *yawn*  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Zzz... {player}... Thank you...
