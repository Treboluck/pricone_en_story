## Subtitle: Afternoon Power Nap
  
**Narration：**  
Hatsune and {player} are out on a stroll in  
the forest, when...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Taaake that!  
  
**Monster：**  
Gyaaarghhh!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wow, that was easy!  
So you really do power up anyone you're  
close to!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
That's so cool!  
It's like you've got superpowers like me!  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Whoa! Uh, were there this many monsters before?  
I-I think we  
might need to use my superpowers to get us outta this one!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
We've gotta book it, {player}!  
Hold on tight!  
I'm getting us outta here!

**Hatsune：**  
Teleportation complete!  
And a perfect landing, if you ask me!  
Aw yeah! Love and peace! Peace!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
*yawn* Well, as you know, using my powers makes me extra  
sleepy, so I'm gonna need to take a nap...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hey, the grass here feels really nice. Why don't you take a nap  
with me?  
C'mon, it's not like you're doing anything else,  
right? Come nap with me!

**Hatsune：**  
Heehee. See? Feels pretty great, huh?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
All righty! Dreamland, here we come! Nighty-night!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
What's up, {player}? Can't sleep?  
Whoa, come to think of it,  
your face is *really* red. You okay?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
You don't have a fever, do you? Let's find out!  
Lemme feel your forehead!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh? You think it'll get worse if I get closer? Uh... why?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Well, whatever. Point is, you can't sleep.  
Well, you're in luck!  
I know all there is to know  
about the world of sleep.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
But what's the best way to get *you* to fall asleep?  
Got any suggestions?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Count sheep with me.  
**Choice: (2)**  Sing me a lullaby.  
`Tag 1`  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, good idea!  
Here goes.  
One sheep... two sheep... three sheep...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Four sheep... five sheep...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, of course! Coming right up, one exclusive Hatsune lullaby!  
Rockabye {player}, off to dreamland... ♪  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Hatsune：**  
...Zzz!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Zzz...  
*gasp* Whoa! How'd I put myself to sleep?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I think... that's a mystery... for the morning...  
Zzz... Zzz...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Zzz... {player}...  
Don't ever leave my side...

**Hatsune：**  
Wow, I feel amazing! All that sleep has charged me right back  
up to full energy again! ☆  
  
**Hatsune：**  
How'd you sleep, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You were talking in your sleep, so I stayed up listening.  
**Choice: (5)**  I slept like a baby.  
`Tag 4`  
**Hatsune：**  
Wha? I-I was sleep talking?!  
Geez, I must've been out cold, huh?!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Hatsune：**  
I'm so glad!  
Knowing you got some good sleep makes me feel  
twice as good about my own nap!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Hatsune：**  
Sha-shing! I feel so amazing, it's like I'm supercharged or  
something!  
Like, maybe my powers have gotten stronger?  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Yikes! More monsters?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Heh-heh... Don't assume I'm as weak as I was before!  
I'm supercharged today! I'll get rid of you in a flash!  
Take that!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wow, lookit 'em go!  
Talk about a home run! Bye-bye, monsters!  
  
Heehee. I wonder if all this strength came from me sleeping  
next to you, {player}.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Uh... {player}? Where'd you go?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wait. No way...  
Did I just send him flying with all those  
monsters too?!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH!  
  
**Passerby：**  
O-oh god! There are monsters in the town!  
  
**Royal Guard：**  
And there's someone with them! He could be a monster tamer!  
You're in cahoots with them, aren't you?! You're under arrest!  
Don't even try to resist!  
  
**Narration：**  
After an unbelievable misunderstanding, {player}  
was left no choice but to run from the knights.
