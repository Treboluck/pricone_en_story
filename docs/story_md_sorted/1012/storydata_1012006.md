# Hatsune Episode 6
Shiori tells Hatsune the story of Sleeping Beauty, which makes Hatsune fantasize about {player} kissing her in her sleep. Of course, this doesn't happen, and Hatsune spends the day red-faced and panicked over nothing.
  
## Subtitle: Sleepless Beauty
  
**Narration：**  
Hatsune and Shiori are out shopping together.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Shiorin!  
Didja find the book you were looking for?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I did. It's called \"Sleeping Beauty.\"  
I've always wanted to read it.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wow. What's it about?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Well... It's about a princess who falls into an eternal  
slumber,  
and a prince who awakens her with a kiss.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh?! H-he awakens her with a *what?!*  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hm?  
Is something the matter?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
N-nope! Nothing at all!  
Hahaha!  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
S-so... {player} and I are supposed to go shopping today...  
*sob* What am I gonna do?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
One minute, Shiorin's telling me about her book, the next  
I'm thinking about {player} as the prince...  
And I mean, I sleep a lot too, so...!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
W-what if at some point, I used my superpowers... and he got  
worried because I wouldn't wake up...  
and he...!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, {player} would never!  
I-I'm just overthinking things!  
Clearly!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wagh, {player}?!  
G-good morning!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh? I seem off?  
N-no, not me!  
I'm just super looking forward  
to hanging out with you, that's all!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hey, I know! Let's get something to eat!  
I brought a bunch of  
spending money with me, see? See?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ack! W-what's with this wind?!  
It's gonna blow all my money away!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Heh-heh-heh! But not to worry! I can just use my superpowers to  
bring it all—  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wait, no, I can't! If I use my superpowers, I'll fall asleep!  
A-and if I fall asleep... I-I might get...!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh?  
O-oh, it's nothing!  
I was just saying, it's probably too  
far for me to bring it back by now, even with superpowers.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
S-so yeah, guess we're just gonna have to give up on it...  
*sob* All that money... gone. I worked so hard to save it up,  
too...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Waaagh! M-man, now we've got monsters, too?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
We'll use my powers to...  
Actually, let's not do that.  
{player}, we've gotta run away!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Why am I not teleporting us?  
I-I just don't think I can today!  
Now c'mon, let's get outta here!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Phew... Thank goodness.  
It's looking more and more like I'm  
gonna make it through the day without using my powers now.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Eep! Th-that wasp is huge!  
Don't come any closer!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh no! It's gonna sting {player}!  
I-I can't let that happen!  
Hiyah!  
  

---  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Phew! There's no way that wasp is getting to us all the way  
over here!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wait...  
AGH! I-I wasn't even thinking and I used my powers!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wh-what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do...? I'm getting so  
sleepy... Zzz...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
*gasp* Was I... sleeping?  
You waited all this time for me to  
wake up, huh?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hey, um, {player}... Er... Um... Y-you wouldn't have happened  
to, uh... k-kiss me, right?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Kiss you? Why?  
**Choice: (2)**  I didn't kiss you.  
`Tag 1`  
**Hatsune：**  
O-oh, no reason! No reason at all! As long as you didn't, it's  
all good!  
Sorry for asking something so weird.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Hatsune：**  
R-right! Yeah, you wouldn't, would you?  
Ugh... Why have I been  
so worked up about this all day?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Hatsune：**  
Phew, what a relief.  
A-and of course he wouldn't! Who the heck  
would kiss someone who wasn't waking up? That stuff only  
happens in fairy tales!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
B-but... if {player} was the one doing it...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
AAARRRGH! What am I thinking?!  
G-god, that's so embarrassing!  
  
**Narration：**  
For some time after, Hatsune was so embarrassed, she couldn't  
even look {player} in the eye.
