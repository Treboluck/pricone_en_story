**Boy：**  
Look, Mom!  
I'm super high up!  
  
**Mother：**  
Get down from there right this instant!  
That railing isn't meant to be climbed!  
  
**Boy：**  
I'm fine, I'm fi—  
Whoa?!  
  
**Boy：**  
H-help!  
I'm gonna fall...!  
  
**Mother：**  
Eeek!  
  
**???：**  
Mmm! Now that's what I call good sleep!  
Energy reserves are back to one-hundred percent!  
  
**Passerby 1：**  
L-look out!  
That kid up on the second floor's gonna fall off!  
Someone catch him!  
  
**???：**  
Huh?! I haven't even been awake for a minute, and  
things are already taking a turn for the worse!  
  
**???：**  
No worries, though. I've got this!  
Full throttle!  
Heya!  
  

---  
  
**Boy：**  
Ahaha! I'm floating!  
This rules!  
  
**Passerby 1：**  
Wh-what in the world?  
He really is floating!  
It doesn't seem like the effects of any old spell, either...  
  
**Passerby 2：**  
It's a miracle!  
A miracle brought forth from the heavens to save him!  
  
**Mother：**  
Oh, thank goodness! You're okay, aren't you?  
  
**???：**  
Yay! That went well!  
Sha-shing! ☆  
  
**???：**  
Eheheh.  
Always feels nice to do a good dee—  
  
**???：**  
Whoa! When'd you get here?!  
Hey... Y-you didn't happen to, err, see any of that... did you?  
  
**Choice: (15)**  Never seen any magic like that before.  
**Choice: (16)**  You bet I did.  
`Tag 15`  
**???：**  
Y-yeah! Magic!  
That's exactly what it was!  
I-I'm just your average mage.  
Slinging spells here and there!  
  
**???：**  
What type of magic was it?  
Just one of my superpowe—  
Oops! Close call.  
A-anyway! It's super duper magic!  
  
Jump to tag 17  
`Tag 16`  
**???：**  
N-not good! Not good at all!  
I didn't think I'd get caught in the act!  
  
`Tag 17`  
**???：**  
Okay. Nothing happened here!  
Nothing at all!  
Definitely no superpower-related activities going on!  
  
**???：**  
N-not like those exist in the first place, either!  
Who'd even believe tha—  
  
**???：**  
Huh? You never once mentioned superpowers?  
Sh-shoot! That's suggestive interrogation!  
  
**???：**  
Your argument won't hold up in the royal court without  
sufficient evidence, though!  
And I'm afraid I shan't yield to  
any sort of torture you have in mind either, you fiend!  
  
**???：**  
Hmm? What's that?  
You just wanted to praise me for saving that kid?  
  
**???：**  
A-aww shucks.  
Now you've got me all embarrassed. Eheheh.  
  
**???：**  
Really, though. It's not that big of a deal.  
My superpowers just kind of activated on their  
own the second I saw him in danger!  
  
**???：**  
Wait, nooo!  
I went and spilled the beans on my own!  
  
**???：**  
Urgh... Guess there's no use in hiding it now.  
You can have the special privilege of knowing my secret.  
  
**???：**  
It might not be obvious, but yes. I've got superpowers!  
Sha-shing! ☆  
  
**???：**  
What're superpowers?  
Wait, for real?!  
*That's* how you react after the big dramatic reveal?!  
  
**???：**  
Well...  
Basically, they let me do super duper stuff.  
But also, they're a lot different from normal magic.  
You can't just learn them. You have to be born with them!  
  
**???：**  
They let me fly, teleport, move stuff about with my mind.  
All that good stuff!  
Oh! And I can also attack stuff!  
That part's the same as normal magic.  
  
**???：**  
Th-this is just between the two of us, okay?  
Please don't tell anyone else. I mean it!  
  
**???：**  
The last thing I want is some secret organization finding out.  
Then they'll kidnap and do all sorts of horrible stuff to me!  
Experiments, forced labor... They might even dissect me!  
  
**???：**  
Urgh... Anything but that...  
So yeah, please! No telling!  
  
**???：**  
Y-you promise you won't?  
Yay! Thanks!  
I'm glad you're a nice person,  
otherwise that could have gotten ugly.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I'm Hatsune, by the way!  
Hey hey, what's your name?  
  
**Choice: (18)**  I'm {player}.  
`Tag 18`  
**Hatsune：**  
...Zzz.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Mmm... Hmm?  
Oh, sorry.  
I get really tired when I use my powers...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
So yeah... It's time to pass out.  
Zzz...  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus {player} was left with the difficult question of  
how to deal with a passed out Hatsune  
in the middle of the road.
