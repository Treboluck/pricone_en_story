Oh my, the small snake transformed.  
It seems to possess some rather eerie powers,  
but they will do it no good.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You said it, Kokkoro!  
We'll wipe the floor with that scaly guy!  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's not gonna be that easy! That thing's a deadly Mushussu.  
They're as strong as they are huge,  
and their creepy magic can totally immobilize you!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whoa, for real?!  
 But that means if we beat it...  
we can grill it up and have ourselves a feast!  
Ooh! I'm so pumped for this now! ♪
