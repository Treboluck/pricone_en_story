**Narration：**  
A few days after the Shadow attack on the Orphanage...  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is hiking along an overgrown mountain trail,  
on his way to fulfill a certain errand.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aaahhh...  
Hungry... So hungry...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I made sure to eat plenty before I set out,  
and I brought as many packed lunches as I could carry...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But somehow I'm starving already...  
Is there just a giant hole in the bottom of my stomach?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhh, my poor, empty belly... This is crazy bad.  
At this rate, I'm going to collapse from hunger again...  
Ahhhhh, I can barely stand...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If I could avoid using my Royal Equipment so much,  
I wouldn't end up quite so hungry...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But monsters keep attacking me at every turn.  
If I held back in battle, I'd just get myself killed...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Maybe I should have brought along a bodyguard or something,  
but I don't really have anyone I can ask to do that.  
I guess I did get to know a few people in the city...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But if they're going to end up forgetting me too,  
it's better if I don't get too close to anyone.  
It would just make it harder to say goodbye...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Hmm?  
Is it just me, or did those bushes just rustle?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What a lucky break!  
If it's an animal or a monster, I can make a meal out of it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So this is what they call manna from heaven!  
Fate hasn't given up on me yet! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wahey!  
Let's see what's for dinner! ☆  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Wait! Wait! It's me!  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Oopsie-daisy...!  
Huh?! {player}!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heyas! ☆  
We sure do run into each other a lot. How's it going?  
Sorry about just now! I guess I almost sliced you in half!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What were you wandering around in those bushes for?  
Did you drop something?  
Shall I help you look for it?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Explain the situation.  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm, I see.  
So let me get this straight.  
You've got business somewhere deep in these mountains?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But you don't want to be attacked by monsters,  
so you're trying to hide in the bushes as you go?  
Wow, you're like some kind of ninja!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Haven't you heard of ninjas?  
They're like sneaky special ops soldiers from long ago!  
Though they're just a fairy tale, really.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Anyway!  
I'm not sure where you're headed, but it's dangerous to go alone!  
This area is totally swarming with monsters lately.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You can't walk two steps without bumping into one!  
If you go wandering around outside the city,  
you'll get gobbled up ten times before breakfast!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And you are a bit of a weakl—  
  
Um, I mean, a cute and innocent fellow!  
It really isn't safe for you out here!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Tell you what, shall I accompany you part of the way?  
I can take care of a few monsters!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
In return, though... Do you have any food?  
Ahhhh... I could eat a whole dragon right now...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Here, you can have this.  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm?  
Are these biscuits for me?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Thank you so much!  
I'll never forget this as long as I live!  
Can I fall in love with you?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Nom nom...  
So gooooood!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh... I live again... The calories are flowing through me...  
Sweet treats just flood your system with dopamine, don't they?  
Maybe my true love is sugar! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh...  
You really saved my life there.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whenever I'm in trouble,  
you seem to come to my rescue!  
Can I give you a big kiss?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Sure thing.  
**Choice: (5)**  That's what friends do, right?  
`Tag 4`  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? Are you sure?  
I really will give you a big smackeroo, you know? No backsies?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmmm... Actually, though,  
I get the feeling you don't really understand what a kiss is.  
You did lose your memories, after all.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So I'd feel kind of guilty if I did anything right now.  
It'd be like taking advantage of a little kid!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? Friends do what now?  
They all go around kissing each other?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhh, you meant the part about saving me.  
Eheheh... Friends, huh... That does sound nice.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's such a lovely thought!  
I've been on my own for ages, you see...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So if you want to call me a friend,  
nothing could make me happier!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Pecorine：**  
Anyway, let's get back on track.  
Umm... Could you explain where it is you were headed?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm, I see.  
So you're on your way  
 to a farm called Elizabeth Park,  
and it's deep in the mountain regions.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A farm, huh...  
I bet they have all kinds of tasty stuff to eat!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You say you've been staying at a place  
called the Sarendia Orphanage,  
but it's in danger from monsters called Shadows...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So you're going to take the children  
to this farm where they'll be nice and safe?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But of course,  
it would be rude if you all showed up out of the blue,  
so you're heading over first to get things settled?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Because as it so happens,  
you already know some of the members  
of this Elizabeth Park guild...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I see, I see!  
That would certainly explain  
why you're hiking along out here all on your own.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If the Orphanage needs to send someone  
to say hi to these Elizabeth Park people,  
I can see how it would help if they already know the messenger!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So you're out here on a job,  
a most noble and excellent mission!  
Well, isn't that admirable!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Good {player}!  
What a good boy you are!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
Sorry about that.  
Patting you on the head all of a sudden...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I think I might be a bit too touchy-feely sometimes.  
After spending so much time on my own,  
I get excited around other people!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm?  
You want to know what I was doing here?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, well that's easy.  
My family has a bit of a silly tradition...  
We have to trek all across the land as a kind of training.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Travelling here and there, helping people out,  
beating up monsters that are causing trouble—  
that kind of thing!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
In my family, you have to complete this training  
before you can be accepted as a full adult.  
Talk about a silly family, right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We have way too many of these weird traditions and rules.  
But hey, you can't choose the parents you're born with!  
So I've just got to grin and bear it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Besides, travelling around the country  
lets me try all kinds of delicious local foods!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's a lot of fun, you know!  
...Even if travelling on my own can get a bit lonely.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You remember when we first met?  
I was actually on my way back to Landosol that day,  
to tell my family all about how my journey went.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  So that's why...  
`Tag 7`  
**Pecorine：**  
Yep.  
But apparently I still haven't travelled enough for them...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
They sent me straight back out on the road,  
so I guess it's the wanderer's life for me again.  
I would have liked to stay in Landosol a little longer...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Since you're there, and Kokkoro, and Karyl...  
It's a shame to leave everyone behind so soon...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But you know,  
this is the hand I've been dealt!  
So I've got to make the most of it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And it's not like we'll never see each other again.  
Once my family decides I've trained enough,  
I'll be able to settle down in Landosol.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Come to think of it, it's pretty rare  
to see you out and about without Kokkoro.  
Is she not with you today?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  She went to the temple.  
`Tag 8`  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh...?  
She said she had something to investigate  
and holed herself up in the temple?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Why the temple, though?  
I guess she is supposed to be some kind of shaman,  
so is she getting in contact with some god or other?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
Meanwhile here I am,  
 on a journey to nowhere in particular.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
My family never did give me a specific destination,  
so I can tag along with you  
 for now, if you like.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  That would be great. Are you sure?  
`Tag 9`  
**Pecorine：**  
Yep!  
I'll escort you all the way to your goal!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
As long as you don't mind, that is.  
This counts as helping people, too, right?  
And they do say, it's companionship that makes a journey!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Besides, I'm worried about you.  
I want to make sure you get home in one piece.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Because it really is a wonderful thing  
to have a place to go home to.

**Choice: (10)**  Explain quickly.  
`Tag 10`  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm.  
So this is a girl from Elizabeth Park you've met a bunch of times?  
Her name's Rin?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What could have brought her here?  
She seems to be in some kind of trouble...
