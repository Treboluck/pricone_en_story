# Io (Summer) Episode 1
Io calls {player} along to the beach to help her practice swimming before the summer holidays begin. Some seaweed gets tangled on Io's leg during the process, turning it into something of a complicated situation.
  
## Subtitle: Summer Holiday Training
  
**Narration：**  
The summer holidays are about to begin at Lucent Academy.  
Though the students are amped up for the long awaited period,  
Io finds herself letting out a big sigh.  
  
**Io：**  
*sigh*  
Whatever will I do...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Something wrong?  
`Tag 1`  
**Io：**  
Goodness!  
I can't believe I let one of my students catch me sighing!  
  
**Io：**  
That's hardly appropriate for a teacher.  
Please pretend you didn't see anything.  
  
**Io：**  
But, well. I am facing a little issue.  
And I'm not sure who I should rely on.  
  
**Io：**  
Oh!  
You might just be the ideal person!  
  
**Io：**  
Are you free at the weekend, by any chance?  
There's something I'd like you to help me out with.  
  
**Io：**  
Oh, but then again. I'm a teacher, and you're a male student.  
It probably isn't right for us to be spending a day off together.  
  
**Io：**  
Or... maybe not?  
I'm doing this for the sake of my student, so it should be okay.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Why are you talking to yourself?  
`Tag 2`  
**Io：**  
N-no particular reason!  
Anyway. Would you be willing to hear me out?  
  
**Io：**  
Great! Thank you!  
With that said, let's go to the beach this weekend!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  The beach? Just the two of us?  
`Tag 3`  
**Io：**  
That' right. I'm looking forward to it,  
so don't be late.  
  
**Io：**  
Oh!  
Sorry for the wait!  
  
**Io：**  
Really sorry about that.  
Technically I got here on time,  
but getting ready after that took a bit longer than I expected.  
  
**Io：**  
I'll be giving you some extra credit for not being late,  
though.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Time to swim!  
**Choice: (5)**  Humongous...  
`Tag 4`  
**Io：**  
Huh? This soon?  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Io：**  
It really is a big beach, isn't it?  
Wait. Where are you going?  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Io：**  
Oh.  
Wait up.  
You need to do your warm-ups before swimming!  
  
**Io：**  
It would be awful if your leg cramped up and you drowned.  
If that happened, I...  
  
**Io：**  
It's okay, though.  
I'd give you proper mouth-to-mouth if you drowned!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Mouth-to-mouth?  
`Tag 7`  
**Io：**  
Mouth-to-mouth is when you resuscitate someonewho's drowned  
by blowing air directly into their mouth.  
  
**Io：**  
I-I've never actually kissed someone before,  
but I have practiced with a doll.  
I should be able to manage it...  
  
**Io：**  
B-besides, it's not the same as kissing someone!  
It won't count as my first kiss.  
  
**Io：**  
Anyway. What's important is that doesn't happen,  
so let's do our warm-ups together.  
  
**Io：**  
One, two...  
Three, four!  
  
**Io：**  
Come on, now. That won't do at all.  
You need to give yourself a good, proper stretch.  
  
**Io：**  
I'll show you how.  
Here, just like this...  
  
**Io：**  
Hm? You face just went bright red.  
Which means your body's all nice and warmed up.  
I guess we're good to go.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Off we go, then!  
`Tag 8`  
**Io：**  
No, not yet!  
Our warm-ups are done, but that's not enough!  
  
**Io：**  
Your body might get a fright if you dive in right away.  
Worst-case scenario, your heart could even stop.  
  
**Io：**  
So let's have some fun on the shore first, shall we?  
That should get us prepped up nicely.  
  
**Io：**  
Hey! Got you!  
*splash, splash*  
Hee hee.  
The cold water's so refreshing.  
  
**Io：**  
Phew.  
Our bodies should be used to the temperature now.  
Which means it's time for today's main subject.  
  
**Io：**  
Hm? What's got you so confused?  
Did I forget to explain why we came to the beach today?  
  
**Io：**  
I-I'm sorry!  
Inviting you along must have left me satisfied.  
Apologies for the wait, but let me explain.  
  
**Io：**  
The summer holidays are about to begin, right?  
And I'm sure plenty of the students will be going to the beach with their friends and family.  
  
**Io：**  
There's plenty of people in our class—like Misaki—who can't swim, though.  
That's why I'd like to teach them how to swim before the holidays begin.  
  
**Io：**  
But there's... sort of a big problem there.  
  
**Io：**  
Truth is, I can't swim myself!  
But please keep that from everyone else.  
  
**Io：**  
I've been terrible at it ever since I was a child.  
I can float, mind you, but the issue comes after that.  
And I rarely ever came to the beach with friends when I was a student.  
  
**Io：**  
I wanted to get some practice in, but I was too scared to do it alone.  
I needed a partner, which is why're here.  
And I know you're reliable, so—  
  
**Io：**  
What?! You can't swim either?!  
You seem so proud of the fact, too...  
  
**Io：**  
You think you can still help out, though?  
I guess I can practice my flutter kicks if you take my hands.  
Okay, then. Please do so!  
  
**Io：**  
Urgh... Just being waist-deep is making me nervous.  
  
**Io：**  
Having one of my students help me with swimming  
is such an odd sensation, though.  
Usually it's the other way around.  
  
**Io：**  
Okay. I'll try to swim now, so don't let go.  
Here I go... *inhale*  
  
**Io：**  
Pfff!  
*huff, huff*  
How was I? Did I manage to do it properly?  
  
**Io：**  
What? I didn't even move an inch forward?  
And here I was secretly hoping that my body would learn  
to swim on its own after getting older.  
  
**Io：**  
I need to be an inspiration for you as well,  
so I'm going to practice hard and learn by the end of today!  
Let's give it another shot!  
  
**Io：**  
Eeek?!  
  
**Io：**  
Ahhh! Something touched my leg!  
Ahhh! Go away!  
  
**Io：**  
Mmm! Now it's all tangled up on me!  
It's so slimy!  
  
**Io：**  
This might be an ocean dweller at work.  
They're here to grab anyone that's swimming by the legs  
and pull them down to their underwater city to eat them!  
  
**Io：**  
Hey, can you poke your face underwater and see what's going on?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Sure can!  
`Tag 9`  
**Io：**  
Ahhh! Hurry!  
  
**Io：**  
Oh. That was quick.  
What did the ocean dweller look like?  
  
**Io：**  
Huh? It was a piece of seaweed?  
  
**Io：**  
Oh, what a relief.  
I was worried it might actually be an ocean dweller.  
  
**Io：**  
I realize they don't exist, by the way.  
I just figured you would save me faster if I made it seem like I was trouble!  
  
**Io：**  
Ahhh! The more I move, the more it gets tangled around me!  
Could you go back and get it off me?  
I can't move like this!  
  
**Io：**  
Urgh... Thank you.  
I didn't expect this sort of thing to happen at the beach as well,  
but I'm glad it was just seaweed.  
  
**Io：**  
Hm?! Eeek?!  
  
**Io：**  
A-aha, ahaha!  
Don't touch me there!  
I-it's so tickly!  
  
**Io：**  
Eeek?! Now something hard's touching me!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Oof!  
`Tag 10`  
**Io：**  
Oh! Was it your face that touched my leg?  
Don't tell me I kicked you...  
  
**Io：**  
I-I'm so sorry!  
You made me all tickly, so it happened out of reflex...  
You're not hurt, are you? Show me your face.  
  
**Io：**  
Yeah, you seem fine.  
Boys really are tough, aren't they?  
...  
Oh!  
  
**Io：**  
Ehehe.  
Looks like I got the seaweed off in the process, too.  
  
**Io：**  
You're just a big help today, aren't you? Thanks.  
*chuckle*  
It's almost like we've swapped roles.  
  
**Io：**  
...?  
Why're you staring at my body?

**Io：**  
Huh? The seaweed's still on me?  
  
**Io：**  
Hm... But where?  
  
**Io：**  
Oh my. I just can't find it.  
  
**Io：**  
It must be in one of my blind spots.  
Could you help get it off again?  
  
**Io：**  
Hm? What are you hesitating for?  
  
**Choice: (11)**  I dare not tread this path...  
`Tag 11`  
**Io：**  
But you helped me out before.  
Quit being a bully!  
I'll never get to practicing at this rate!  
  
**Narration：**  
With his heart in mouth, {player} wondered  
if he possessed the energy needed to make it through the day.
