**Shinobu：**  
This spiritual energy is overwhelming.  
I had no idea such a monster even existed...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I'll take the front lines! Miyako, support me however you can!  
  
**Miyako：**  
If we don't finish, there's no Halloween party!  
Don't mess with Miyako's fun, monster!  
  
**???：**  
Oh...? Who the heck are you two?  
  
**Miyako：**  
I-it talked!  
 What kind of monster are you?!  
  
**Jack：**  
You can call me Jack O. Lantern!  
I'm here to ruin Halloween for everyone!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Ruin Halloween?  
 I won't let you do that.  
I suppose it falls to us to defeat you here and now.  
  
**Jack：**  
Aw, c'mon. Talk about a couple of party poopers.  
If you get in my way, I won't hold back!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Look out! Shinobu!  
  
**Jack：**  
Yahhh!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Too slow! Miyako, I'll keep him occupied! This is your chance!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Clever-smart thinking! Now it's Miyako's turn!  
  
**Jack：**  
Whoa-oa-oa! You two are pretty tough cookies!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Nice going, squirt!  
Shinobu! This monster's nothing to be afraid of!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu and Miyako are the strongestest! Take this too!  
  
**Jack：**  
Urgh! G-guess in the human world, my powers aren't all that.  
Time for a tactical...  
 \"Buh-bye, suckers!\"  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ahhhh! No running away!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Miyako! We should hurry and give chase!  
  
**Narration：**  
Meanwhile, on a nearby street...  
{player} is on the way home from his latest job.  
  
**Jack：**  
Move it, move it, move it!  
...Wait, you're a human!  
  
**Jack：**  
Hey! Gimme some candy or you're getting tricked!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sorry, I don't have any.  
**Choice: (2)**  Happy Halloween!  
`Tag 1`  
**Jack：**  
Yeesh, for real?! What a useless rube!  
Well, a trick it is, then! Take this!

`Tag 2`  
**Jack：**  
Yeah! Happy Halloween!  
...Wait, you haven't even got any candy?!  
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Miyako：**  
Lanterny Jack! No more getting away!  
  
**Jack：**  
Guehh! They're still after me!  
Heheh. Think you can beat me in a game of tag? Think again!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
He certainly seems to be enjoying himself...  
Oh, {player}. Are you all right?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Shinobu! What's going on?  
**Choice: (5)**  What're you up to, Miyako?  
`Tag 4`  
**Skullfather：**  
Hey, brat! Hands off my daughter!  
You run off and eat candy with the squirt or whatever!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
No, Father... This is quite fortunate.  
We should ask him to help us.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Hold it, Shinobu! I'm not letting you spend your Halloween  
with a deadbeat like him!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father...!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Aaargh! My daughter's a demon!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I'm sorry. We're really quite happy to see you.  
If you wouldn't mind, we could use some help.  
 You see, the thing is...

`Tag 5`  
**Miyako：**  
{player}, your timing is the bestest!  
Trick or pudding! Give Miyako pudding now!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Miyako, I don't think this is quite the time...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Oh!  
 Good remembering. We need to finish quick and party!  
Miyako will pester you for pudding later!  
  
**Miyako：**  
You look super very not busy!  
Chase the pumpkin person with us!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Shinobu：**  
...And that's the long and short of it.  
What do you say? Will you help us put a stop to Jack's mischief?  
  
**Miyako：**  
No refusings on the menu!  
You protect Halloween with us!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Sure, I'll help!  
`Tag 7`  
**Shinobu：**  
Thank you very much!  
In that case, let's go after him at once!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Wh-where did he go?! What a quick-running pumpkin...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
He said he wanted to \"ruin Halloween,\"  
but what could he mean by that?  
We have to find him and ask why he's doing this.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I expect he'll be hidden somewhere among the crowd here...  
  
**Miyako：**  
How do we see him through all these costumey people?  
  
**Girl：**  
Waaaaahhh! Give it back!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Is that a little girl crying?  
 What could have happened?  
  
**Boy：**  
That's my candy! What're you doing?!  
  
**Man：**  
Oh, shut up! This candy all belongs to me now!  
If you're not gonna play with me, just hand over the candy!  
  
**Miyako：**  
That guy... He's stealing from kids even though he's all grown up!  
What a bad man!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Give back everyone's candy! Stop bullying little kids!  
And give Miyako pudding while you're at it!  
  
**Man：**  
Guehh! You guys caught up already?  
 Yahhh!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Wahhh! Big surprise!  
What kind of crazy man suddenly attacks people?!  
  
**Man：**  
You just don't give up, do ya?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
You're... Jack, aren't you?  
Don't tell me you're possessing one of the townsfolk?  
Release that man at once!  
  
**Man：**  
I need this body to carry out my revenge!  
I'm not giving it up that easy!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Ngh! Th-this isn't good... At this rate...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Then Miyako will punch him right out of there!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
No, Miyako! Stop!  
 If we attack him right now,  
we'll only hurt the host he's possessing!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Urghh... Sh-Shinobu has a point...  
  
**Man：**  
I won't let anyone try to stop me... Haaahhhh!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Urgh! You two, stand back for now!  
I'll deal with this by myself!  
  
**Miyako：**  
That's no fair at all! Miyako's gonna help too!  
  
**Man：**  
Unless you want to hurt this guy,  
 you'll never beat me!  
  
**Man：**  
Urgh...  
 Aaaghhh! It-it huuuuurts!  
...Is this body not gonna work after all?!  
  
**Miyako：**  
H-he's acting really weird now!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
That man must not have been a suitable host.  
Hosts with no affinity cannot channel a spirit's full power.  
  
**Man：**  
Oh! I know!  
 I just had the best idea. Take this!

**Shinobu：**  
Magic?! Miyako, look out!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Aaaahhh!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu! Shinobu!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Why, you... You'll pay for harming my daughter!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Miya... ko...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu! Hang in there!  
Miyako will take you straight to a hospital!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I'm very sorry, Miyako...  
After I promised... I'd throw a Halloween party for you...  
{player}, please take... good care of Miyako...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu! Shinobu, wake up!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Grrr... No forgivings! How dare you hurt Shinobu!  
  
**Man：**  
Uhh...?  
 H-huh?  
Where am I? What am I doing here...?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Wha... D-did the man turn back to normal?  
But then that means Jack...  
  
**Miyako：**  
He got away from us again! No fair!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...Mnhh...
