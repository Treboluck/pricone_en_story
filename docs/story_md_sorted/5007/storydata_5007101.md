On the night of Halloween, Shinobu senses a massive spiritual signature from the city, so she takes Miyako to investigate. Little do they know what spooky horrors await them...
  
**Miyako：**  
Halloween, Halloween~! ♪  
Lots of pudding for Miyako~! ♪  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Miyako, do you have a moment?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Oh! Shinobu is here!  
Super good timing! Gimme pudding or you get tricked!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Hee hee... I thought you might say that.  
Here, have this.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Yaaaay! Pudding!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Actually, though, Miyako...  
I was just on my way to conduct an investigation.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Investigating?  
  
Shinobu works so hard. Hope you find lots of stuffs!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
That's not quite what I meant.  
I was actually hoping you could join me for this job.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ehhhh? Sounds like no fun.  
Miyako is going into town for Halloweening!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh, I see. Well, that's a shame.  
If you agreed to help me, I was going to give you an invitation  
to a most wonderful Halloween party...  
  
**Miyako：**  
A Halloween party?!  
 Say important things quicker!  
Miyako will help investigate after all! ♪  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Thank you, Miyako. Shall we head out, then?  
If my fortunes are correct, it seems that something  
very unusual might happen tonight...
