## Subtitle: The Very Secret Diary
  
**Narration：**  
Having decided to save Shinobu no matter what,  
Miyako and {player} start thinking about  
where they might find Jack.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Urghh... We need to save Shinobu, but don't know how.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Who is that nasty Jack anyway?  
All we know is he wants to ruin everyone's happy Halloween...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's head back to where we first met him.  
`Tag 1`  
**Miyako：**  
Where we met him...?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Oh, right! There might be clues to find there!  
{player}, you're smart!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Let's go quick then! Follow Miyako!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Here it is. This is where...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Look! Over there! Let's look more closer!  
  
**Miyako：**  
...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Skull Daddy said this door's connected to the spirit world.  
Who knows what might be inside...  
It could be full of dangery things.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Maybe you'll even turn dead like ghosts.  
Are you sure you want to come too?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I want to save Shinobu!  
`Tag 2`  
**Miyako：**  
{player}... Thank you!  
Yep, no worries!  
Even if you die, Miyako will stay with you forever!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Well then, let's go!  
  

---  
  
**Miyako：**  
Whoa-oa-oa! D-did we get through?!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Wait, what is this place?!  
Looks like inside a fancy castle...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Urghh... It's super creepy... Too spooky even for ghosts like Miyako.  
Maybe here is where Jack came from in the first place!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Waaaahhhhh! Th-that was scary!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Wh-why's there monsters in the spirit world?!  
O-out of Miyako's way!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Miyako：**  
I-it's not working... Why not...?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Are the monsters ghosts too?  
`Tag 3`  
**Miyako：**  
Y-you're right!  
No wonder they get up when you bonk them!  
You're too smart, {player}!  
  
**Miyako：**  
No point wasting time fighting, then!  
It's dangery for you, so stay close to Miyako!  
  
**Miyako：**  
*pant*... *pant*... We got away somehow...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ahhh... Miyako hasn't had any pudding all day...  
Let's take a pudding break first, then search for clues...  
  
**Miyako：**  
No! Miyako forgot!  
All Miyako's pudding was taken away by Jack!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Urghh... It's all over! Miyako can't move!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding!  
Miyako needs pudding!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Oh, wait! If this castle belongs to nasty thieving Jack,  
it must have sweet treats! Where is the pudding?!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding,  
pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding,  
pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hmm? Something's over here. Jack's... diary?  
  
**Miyako：**  
That's not pudding. Useless trash.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Couldn't it give us useful clues?  
**Choice: (5)**  Pick up the diary and hand it to Miyako.  
`Tag 4`  
**Miyako：**  
Oh, you might be right! Miyako didn't realize!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Miyako：**  
What's this for? Miyako is busy looking for pudding.  
Who cares about silly diaries of...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Awahhh! J-Jack's diary?!  
Th-that might have clues to beating him!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Miyako：**  
\"Jack's Diary. Read and you get tricked!\"  
  
**Miyako：**  
Jack is a silly idiot.  
Warnings like this only make people want to read it more!  
Hmmm...  
  
**Miyako：**  
\"At Halloween, the borders between worlds become blurred,  
unlocking the door to the spirit plane.\"  
  

---  
  
**Jack：**  
In the past, the humans would make offerings,  
and in return, I'd bless them with a fine harvest.  
  
**Jack：**  
Then, on the night of Halloween, I could slip through the door  
and enjoy trick-or-treating among the living...  
  
**Jack：**  
But at some point, the humans forgot all about me,  
and now they just hold parties to enjoy themselves!  
They've forgotten what Halloween is about!  
  
**Jack：**  
Without any offerings, my powers are weak...  
And I'm... all on my own in this world.  
So this year, I'll take my revenge on those ungrateful humans!  
  
**Jack：**  
If I don't find a host before the door closes again  
at the stroke of midnight, my powers will stay weak and useless.  
I'll have to wait another whole year.  
  
**Jack：**  
But that's not gonna happen!  
I'll find a super powerful host, and then when Halloween ends,  
my soul will fuse completely with their body!  
  
**Jack：**  
Then if I eat some candy as a Halloween offering,  
I'll be fully restored! I'll cause chaos in the real world!  
The humans will see what fools they were!  
  

---  
  
**Miyako：**  
Forgotten by humans... Jack's past sounds pretty sad.  
Maybe he wasn't a totally bad guy at the start after all.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako can understand how he feels, a bit.  
Before meeting Shinobu and you, Miyako had no friends either...  
  
**Miyako：**  
But that doesn't mean he can steal Shinobu's body away!  
Miyako made lots of friends here without any bullying!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Eating pudding on my own and floating around Landosol was fun too,  
but meeting you guys made everything way more fun!  
  
**Miyako：**  
So we need to stop Jack!  
If this diary is all true, we have to stop him before Halloween  
ends at midnight, or Shinobu will never come back!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu will be Jack and Jack will be Shinobu!  
That's not right at all! Miyako needs the real Shinobu!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
So you care that much about this body's owner?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu?! Wait, no... Jack!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
My monster minions told me there were intruders in the castle.  
I had a feeling it'd be you, and it looks like I was right!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Talk about rude.  
Snooping around my house, and even reading my diary!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Bullies who steal people's bodies, steal candy from little kids,  
and even steal Miyako's pudding don't get to point fingers!  
  
**Miyako：**  
You give it all back!  
The pudding, and Shinobu!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Heheheh. Go ahead and take them, if you think you can!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Jack! What you're doing is bad! Shinobu, wait for us!  
We'll get your body back from him!  
  
**Narration：**  
So {player} and Miyako challenged Jack  
to a battle for Shinobu's fate.
