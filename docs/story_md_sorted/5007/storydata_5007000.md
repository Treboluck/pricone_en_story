## Subtitle: A Long, Long Night Begins
  
**Narration：**  
Tonight is Halloween.  
Shinobu and Miyako are visiting Illya to discuss a powerful  
magical signature that Shinobu sensed from the city.  
  
**Illya：**  
Hahahahahah!  
'Tis I, Queen of Darkness and Ruler of the Night, Illya Ornstein!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Illya... What're you doing?  
  
**Illya：**  
Ah! Miyako and Shinobu.  
What marvelous timing.  
I need you to take a look!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
A look? At what, exactly?  
  
**Illya：**  
A-hem! Good, my throat is nice and clear!  
Now, feast your eyes upon this!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hahahahahah!  
'Tis I, Queen of Darkness and Ruler of the Night, Illya Ornstein!  
  
**Miyako：**  
...Did Illya hit her head on rocks?  
  
**Illya：**  
Excuse me? What insolence is this?!  
Clearly I am preparing my grand introduction to the world,  
for the day when I take my rightful place as its ruler!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako sees now! Illya's got too much free time!  
  
**Illya：**  
I am no lonely recluse!  
However, until we find a means to restore my magic,  
there is little else for me to do!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Actually, on the subject of magic,  
I do have a lead that might interest you.  
  
**Illya：**  
Really?!  
 Excellent work, Shinobu!  
So? What is this lead?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Well, just this morning, I detected a powerful spiritual signature  
coming from somewhere in the city...  
  
**Illya：**  
Ohhh? Spiritual energy?  
 That does seem most intriguing.  
It could easily prove a valuable resource  
to help me recover my full strength!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Yes, that's why I was planning to go and investigate.  
Even if it isn't related to your magic,  
we can hardly leave such a powerful force unchecked.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako will investigate too!  
 All the clues will be Miyako's in no time!  
  
**Illya：**  
What's this? It's rare for you to cooperate so proactively.  
  
**Miyako：**  
After we investigate,  
Shinobu promised to throw a big Halloween party!  
  
**Illya：**  
Put those efforts towards our world conquest!  
...Or so I'd like to say,  
 but it can't hurt once in a while.  
Go ahead and enjoy yourselves.  
  
**Illya：**  
Much as I would like to join your investigation,  
the bustle of the city makes me rather uncomfortable.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
We'll let you know if anything happens.  
The two of us can handle this alone.  
  
**Illya：**  
I see. Well, I have no reason to doubt your judgment.  
Miyako, don't cause trouble for Shinobu, you hear?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hmph... Miyako is all ready to help, and still Illya isn't happy!  
  
**Illya：**  
Just as long as your \"help\"  
doesn't cause more problems than it solves...  
  
**Illya：**  
Still... I see, I see. Halloween, eh...?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
What is it, Illya?  
  
**Illya：**  
Well... As Ruler of the Night, I should give you fair warning.  
The festivities of Halloween are all too often tainted  
by malevolent designs.  
  
**Illya：**  
You would do well to take care.  
On this special night, there is no telling what may come to pass.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Illya's words were ominous to say the least,  
but the city itself seems full of smiles and laughter.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Illya worries way too much!  
Miyako can't wait for the party!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Haha... Don't worry, I'll make sure it doesn't disappoint.  
Let's do a good job here, so that we can enjoy ourselves afterwards.  
  
**Miyako：**  
No twice-asking needed!  
Miyako brought extra pudding to make motivation super high!  
  
**Miyako：**  
*munch*... *munch*... Pudding while investigating is the tastiest!

**Shinobu：**  
Oh—look over there, Miyako.  
There are children receiving candy treats.  
  
**Boy：**  
Trick or treat! Give us candy, or you're getting pranked!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ahh! Must hide pudding quick!  
Kiddies might try to take Miyako's pudding!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Don't worry.  
Those children are following a prearranged course  
to visit households that are expecting them.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Really?  
 Oh! There's kiddies over there too!  
  
**Girl：**  
Trick or treat!  
  
**Woman：**  
Oh dear! I wouldn't want to get tricked!  
Here. Have a little candy treat.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Bahhh, why's it nothing but kids?  
I wanna see bangin' babes in costumes, not brats!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father. Halloween is for the children first and foremost...  
  
**Miyako：**  
That looks like fun! Miyako wants to do it too!  
Give Miyako pudding or get tricked!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Haha. In your case, I suppose it would be \"Trick or pudding.\"  
  
**Miyako：**  
Of course! In fact, it's \"Pudding or pudding\"!  
No not-pudding options allowed!

**Miyako：**  
Oh! Miyako has an idea!  
We should invite him to the Halloween party too!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
\"Him\"?  
 Oh, you mean {player}.  
Hmm... Well, I suppose that would make for an enjoyable event.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Let's ask him together after this investigation.  
He's been a good friend to me as well, you know.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Eheheh... One more thing for looking forward to~! ♪  
  
**Shinobu：**  
The spiritual signature is coming from this spot.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hmm... This is weirdy.  
Usually there's lots of ghosts, but today Miyako doesn't see any...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
You're right... But why could that be?  
The spiritual energy here is stronger than ever...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu! There's a weird hazy haze!  
Come over and look!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
This is... unusual to say the least.  
I'm not sure what to make of it...  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Watch out, Shinobu! This mist is leaking from the spirit realm!  
There's a direct link between the two planes!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
A link to the spirit world? What would cause such a thing?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako will take a looksie!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Ah... Miyako, it's not wise to stray too close—  
  
**???：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Waaahh?! S-something popped out!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Th-this must be the source of the energy!  
Miyako, prepare for battle!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Okie-dokey! Let's beat up the monster and then party!
