**Miyako：**  
Miyako beat up all the graveyard monsters!  
There must be clues about Jack somewhere around here!  
  
**Miyako：**  
But Skull Daddy said this is connected to the spirit world...  
Past here might be extra dangerous...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Even so, Miyako needs to save Shinobu!  
No time for wasting at all!

Wahhh! What's all this glowy stuff?!  
It's really scary...  
 But no giving up! Forward we go!
