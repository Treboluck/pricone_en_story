**Narration：**  
Hoping to drive Jack out of Shinobu's body,  
Miyako prepares to possess the body herself.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu! Miyako will save you!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Ungh... Nggghhhh!  
 H-hold it right there!  
  
**Miyako：**  
What now?! You ready to give Shinobu back?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Let's talk this over nicely!  
T-tell me what you like more than anything in the world!  
  
**Miyako：**  
What Miyako likes best?  
 Obviously that's pudding!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh yeah. You collected all that pudding instead of candy...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ah! Good point!  
You've still got all of Miyako's stolen puddings!  
Got to save them as well as Shinobu!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Hold it, hold it! Wait up!  
...Listen.  
 I've got a great deal for you!  
If you leave me alone this one time...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I'll give you the biggest, sweetest pudding in the world!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Wha?!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Hey! What's that reaction for?!  
Don't put Shinobu's life on the same level as pudding!  
  
**Miyako：**  
W-world's best pudding...  
Just thinking about it makes Miyako drooly...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Right? Right?! I can give you all that happiness!  
Not a bad deal, is it?  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Don't you dare, squirt! Don't listen to a word this joker says!  
  
**Miyako：**  
The biggest, sweetest pudding... all for Miyako to eat and nobody else...  
That's like the bestest dream Miyako can imagine...  
  
**Miyako：**  
But... but...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Eating it with Shinobu would be even bestester!!!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu, I'mma possess you for a second!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
O-oh, crap! Stoooop!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Get out of Shinobu!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Nghhhh! No, no, no, no, no! I'm not budging!  
  
**Miyako：**

**Jack：**  
Waaaaaghhhh!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
 Miyako! {player}!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu...  
 Shinobu! You're back to normal!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Nicely done there, squirt! I knew I could trust you!  
Shinobu, good job hanging in there!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
It was Miyako's voice that brought me back.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ahhh... You're all back! You're really all back!  
Miyako tried so hard to help!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Yes. I was terribly close to losing hold again...  
But hearing your words, your efforts, helped me keep my focus.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Miyako... Thank you so very much!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Welcome back, Shinobu.  
**Choice: (3)**  You did great, Miyako.  
`Tag 2`

I only made it back thanks to both of your efforts!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Miyako：**  
All thanks to you!  
Miyako could've never thought of that calling-out-to-Shinobu plan!  
  
**Miyako：**  
You really are the amazingest!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Jack：**  
Urghhh! Gah, gah, gah!  
  
**Jack：**  
How can these fools stand in the way of my revenge?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Such a ridiculous plan was always doomed to fail.  
When you were in my body, I could feel the sadness you bear  
from being forgotten...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
However, taking revenge upon humanity  
would only make you more lonely than ever!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
This is no way to fill the hole in your heart.  
  
**Jack：**  
Shut up... Shut up, shut up, shut up!  
Forget it! I've still got one last trick to try!  
  
**Jack：**  
Yaaaaaahhhhhhh!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Wha—?! This is... the door between worlds!  
  
**Jack：**  
Heh. I'll show you all how strong I really am!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Jack! Where are you going?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
This door... Did he return to the city?  
Let's go after him, quickly!  
There's no telling what he might do at this point!  
  
**Girl：**  
Trick or treat!  
Hand over some candy or you're gonna get tricked!  
  
**Woman：**  
Oh me, oh my. How very scary.  
Here—have a tasty treat.  
  
**Jack：**  
That candy treat belongs to me!  
  
**Girl：**  
W-waaahhh! A nasty boy took my candy!  
  
**Woman：**  
Well, now! Who might you be, young man?!  
There's plenty of candy to share, so don't go stealing, you hear?  
  
**Jack：**  
Shut up! Don't tell me what to do!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Look out!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Are you all right?  
Take this girl and get yourselves to safety!  
  
**Woman：**  
Th-thank you, miss.  
I don't know what's going on, but...  
Come on, let's run!  
  
**Girl：**  
Waahhh! Mommyyyy!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
So you did come back to the city...  
What exactly are you planning, Jack?!  
  
**Jack：**  
Told ya, didn't I? I'm gonna show you all what I can do!  
Who even needs a host?  
So what if this world can only hold me till Halloween ends?!  
  
**Jack：**  
Right here, right now, I've got time enough to destroy you all!  
  
**Jack：**  
Trick or treat! Candy treats, all of you come to meeeeeeee!  
  

---  
  
**Boy：**  
Waaahhhh! My candy!  
  
**Girl：**  
My candy flew off somewhere too!  
  
**Miyako：**  
All the kiddies' candy is flying over to Jack!  
  
**Jack：**  
With these offerings, I can wield my full power!  
*munch munch*  
  
**Miyako：**  
Aaaahhhh! He's eating Miyako's puddings too!  
Eating messy and spilling everywhere! That's a super waste!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Miyako, you're far from the only one whose treats have been stolen.  
And look—Jack's spirit energy is growing at a frightening rate.  
  
**Jack：**  
Hahaha... Ahahahah!
