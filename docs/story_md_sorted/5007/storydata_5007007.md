## Subtitle: Treats for Everyone
  
**Narration：**  
With Halloween drawing to a close,  
the time has come for the children of Landosol to head home.  
  
**Girl：**  
Jack! See you around!  
  
**Jack：**  
Yeah! See you next year! I had tons of fun!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Mrghhh... Jack seems super happy and stuff,  
but Miyako is still mad about not getting pudding!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
You did get a lot of chocolate and other candy treats, didn't you?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Not-pudding things mean nothing!  
Pudding, pudding, pudding! Jack, turn into pudding again!  
  
**Jack：**  
I can't do that now!  
Besides, I don't exactly want to get eaten by you a second time!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Too cruel... Even after Miyako saved Halloween...  
This is the worstest reward ever!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Hee hee. Miyako, have you forgotten?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Forgotten? Forgot about... what...  
 Ahhh!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako remembered! The Halloween party!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
That's right. We finished our investigation,  
so shall we go and have that party?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako couldn't wait for this!  
{player}, Jack, you should come party too!  
  
**Jack：**  
Huh? I can join in too?!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Of course you can! Parties are always funner with more people!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Before meeting Shinobu, Miyako thought Miyako was fine being alone.  
But now Miyako knows different! Everything is better with friends!  
  
**Miyako：**  
So you come party too!  
Then everyone can have more and more happys!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Hah! I still ain't forgiven you for what you did!  
But if Shinobu and the squirt say so, I'll allow it!  
  
**Jack：**  
Happiness... for everyone...  
I see...  
 All right then, I'll join in with your party!  
  
**Miyako：**  
This place still has lights on inside!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Just in case our job took all day,  
I booked a venue that's open through the night  
to hold our special party.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu is too smart! Let's go inside!

**Miyako：**  
Wowie! There's puddings everywhere!  
  
**Jack：**  
So much tasty candy, too! Wahoo!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I prepared this party for you, after all, Miyako.  
It wouldn't be complete without plenty of sweet treats.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Woooo! Trick or pudding!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Hee hee... I think we've had enough tricks for one night.  
Go ahead, Miyako. Eat all the treats you like!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Yaaaay!  
...Mmmmm! This pudding is so tasty!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako never knew there were puddings this big in Landosol!  
Could this be a special pudding shop?!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
What kind of pudding shop stays open all night long?!  
Shinobu made all this pudding herself! You better be grateful!

**Shinobu：**  
F-Father! You promised not to tell...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Whaaaaa?! Sh-Shinobu made it?!  
All this... for Miyako to eat?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Y-yes... Um, I made sure to taste them,  
so I think they should at least be edible...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ahhh... Shinobu, Shinobu, Shinobu!  
So much happys! Miyako loves Shinobu!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Well, if it makes you happy, that makes me glad, too!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Of course Miyako's happy!  
 This is the happiest day ever!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Can I have some, too?  
**Choice: (2)**  Three cheers for parties!  
`Tag 1`  
**Shinobu：**  
Yes, of course.  
You helped us out an awful lot back there.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Huh?! Like hell you can!  
Actually, just scram already! It's past your bedtime!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father...!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Aaargh! My daughter's a demon!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Miyako：**  
Three thousand cheers! All thanks to Miyako's hard work!  
  
**Miyako：**  
{player}, bring Miyako extra pudding now!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Miyako：**  
Today is Miyako's special day!  
This pudding is all for Miyako to eat!  
Nobody else can eat it! Jack, no touching the puddings!  
  
**Jack：**  
Hogging the pudding is no fair!  
What happened to happiness for everyone?!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Eating-pudding-happys are a Miyako-exclusive privilege!  
You go find different happys!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Miyako, when Jack offered you that ultimatum,  
didn't you say the pudding would be tastier if we ate it together?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Oh... Shinobu heard that? But this pudding is... Ahhhh...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu is a nasty teaser...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Then... are you saying you don't like me?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako didn't say that! Miyako loves Shinobu!  
Shinobu should stop teasing now!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Hee hee. Your words made me so happy,  
I couldn't help but want to tease you.  
  
**Miyako：**  
M-Miyako was telling lies back then!  
Pudding is for Miyako and nobody else!  
  
**Jack：**  
Then... I'll have to take it by force!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hands! Off! The! Puddings!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Haha... There's enough pudding to go around.  
No need to fight over it, you two.
