## Subtitle: Makoto's Dinner Rush
  
**Makoto：**  
Hi there!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I'm afraid we're not open yet, sir.  
Since this is a tavern, we don't start serving customers  
until evening.  
  
**Makoto：**  
If you'd like to make a reservation,  
I can take your name and save you a seat.  
We'd love to see you back later tonight!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh, it's {player}!  
How's it hanging?  
  
**Makoto：**  
What brings you to our humble tavern?  
Do you need to talk to me about something?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Wait, did I even tell you I where I live?  
Huh? You just picked this place at random, and you're  
shocked to see me, too?  
Wow, what a coincidence! ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yup.  
This is my family's home.  
  
**Makoto：**  
We live in the apartment on the second floor.  
The first, as you can see, is a tavern,  
and most nights I'm down here helping run it.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Technically, my parents are the owners and proprietors.  
I work for Caon during the day, and in the evening, I wait  
tables, work as a hostess, or whatever they need me for.  
  
**Makoto：**  
When things get busy during the end-of-year holidays,  
I take leave from Caon and work here full-time.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Not a day goes by where I don't have a full plate!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ah ha ha. Don't worry, it's not like I'm gonna collapse from  
exhaustion. Caon's actually a lot more laid-back than  
you'd expect, and people aren't exactly flocking to the tavern.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yeah... Lately a lot of the big chains are opening up  
restaurants and bars in this area. It's hard for a tiny little  
mom-and-pop shop like ours to compete.  
  
**Makoto：**  
We've still got our regulars, and we're not going under  
anytime soon.  
But money is tight and, they can't afford  
to hire more staff. As their daughter, I have to step up.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Uh-huh. I'm just getting the place ready.  
We open in an hour, and I'm still cleaning and setting up.  
Unfortunately, I can't let you in right now.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I'm not exactly the meticulous type, so I don't make  
for good cleaning staff.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I don't mean to treat you like you're an annoyance,  
but I might get preoccupied shooting the breeze with you  
and break something. Stay at your own risk.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Can I help?  
**Choice: (2)**  You're a real trouper.  
`Tag 1`  
**Makoto：**  
Hmm?  
It's nice of you to offer.  
I definitely appreciate the sentiment.  
  
**Makoto：**  
But when I've been given a job, I don't feel satisfied  
that it's fully done unless I take care of everything myself.  
No offense. It's just how I am.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Makoto：**  
Huh?  
Uhh, thanks, I guess?  
That was a compliment, right?  
  
**Makoto：**  
You could've probably picked a better way to say it though.  
\"Trouper\"  
sounds like something you'd say to a kid.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I-I'd make a good wife?!  
Y-you think so?  
Man, you come up with the weirdest ways to say stuff.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Makoto：**  
Anyways,  
you never did tell me why you came here  
in the first place.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh, you were looking for a dinner spot and just happened  
across our place, huh?  
Good enough for me.  
  
**Makoto：**  
You're in luck, then.  
You can eat here tonight.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I made too much for my staff meal tonight. It's way more  
than I could ever eat myself.  
Wanna split it with me?  
No charge. Think of it as helping me clean up the leftovers.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ahh, don't be modest. It's fine!  
Just another way I can thank you for helping Yui.  
  
**Makoto：**  
You're way better off getting served a real meal here  
than dropping your hard-earned cash on some overpriced  
fast food!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I made it myself, so don't expect it to taste like  
a gourmet meal, though.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yup, have a seat right there.  
I'll have the food ready for you in no time.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Heh heh.  
The hospitality's second to none here, right {player}?  
I'd love to see you join the ranks of our regulars! ♪
