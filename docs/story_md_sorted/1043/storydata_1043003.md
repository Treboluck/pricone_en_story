**Makoto：**  
Hmm, hmm, hmm... ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh?  
I know I didn't just hear the front door open.  
  
**Makoto：**  
There's a perfectly visible \"Closed\" sign right on the door.  
How do people manage to barge in here without seeing it?  
What a pain.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I was finally about to indulge myself a little, too.  
Oops. Remember, service with a smile.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hi there!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I'm afraid we're not open yet...  
Hey, wait a sec...  
  
**Makoto：**  
{player}!  
You're here before business hours again!  
How many times have I told you? We don't open till night!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh, no way. I treated you to a meal that one time,  
and now  
you think you can drop in whenever you want and eat for free?  
Huh?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I'm not so generous that I'm gonna foot the bill  
for you every time you show up.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'll pay.  
**Choice: (2)**  I just came to see you.  
`Tag 1`  
**Makoto：**  
It's not about the money.  
It's about having consideration for me and my time.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Fine, whatever.  
You hungry or what?  
  
**Makoto：**  
I'll hook you up if you're looking for lunch,  
but there won't be a third time.  
Meals taste better when you've got company, anyway.

`Tag 2`  
**Makoto：**  
Huh?  
Y-you came to... wh-what?!  
What's that supposed to mean?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Eeh, umm...  
Geez, Yui's gonna kill me...  
  
**Makoto：**  
I, umm, I must've misheard you.  
Say that again, I dare you!  
  
**Makoto：**  
...  
  
  
**Makoto：**  
I don't understand what you mean.  
Anyways, if you're hungry, you want something to eat?

**Makoto：**  
Hmm?  
Hey! Stay out of the kitchen!  
  
**Makoto：**  
For goodness' sake, don't you have an ounce  
of common sense? If you don't learn some manners,  
I'm gonna ban you from the premises!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh? \"What do we have here?\"  
Ahh, don't look!  
These, are, umm... Look, I had leftover ingredients, okay?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Y-yeah. I'm baking cookies.  
  
**Makoto：**  
No, they're not on the menu.  
Cute little cookies are the last thing you'd serve at a tavern.  
  
**Makoto：**  
B-baking cookies and sweets like this is just my hobby...  
I-it's stupid, right?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Doesn't suit me at all, right? Go ahead, laugh it up!  
Ugh. My tough-girl reputation is ruined!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh? You wanna try one?  
S-sure...  
  
`image display end`  
**Makoto：**  
Is it any good?  
Really?! Awesome! ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
The customers would rave if we served them?  
Nah, no way these are good enough to charge for yet.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey, don't be a pig!  
Sheesh, {player}, you must be starving.  
Actually, go ahead. I'm glad to see you're enjoying them.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I guess eating homemade meals by yourself is kind of  
an empty experience, anyways.  
 Having someone to really try  
them out makes all the effort worth it.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh?  
You'll be happy to taste-test whenever I bake a fresh batch?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Don't get cocky, {player}!  
If you keep dropping by looking for a handout, I'll...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Eh, whatever.  
I guess it's not that much trouble.
