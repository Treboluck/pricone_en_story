**Makoto：**  
Hmm, hmm, hmm! ♪  
Another fun day of trash cleanup!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hee hee!  
{player} comes to help me out whenever  
I'm on garbage duty these days.  
  
**Makoto：**  
He keeps saying it's to thank me for giving him  
first aid and sword lessons,  
even though I'm the one  
who should be thanking him.  
  
**Makoto：**  
He helps pick up garbage every single time.  
At least this mind-numbing job is fun  
when he's around.  
  
**Makoto：**  
{player}'s such an odd duck, though.  
I don't even have to ask him for help. When I say I've  
got garbage duty, he goes,  
\"I'll help!\" right away!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I don't get what he finds so interesting about it.  
But I can't help having a great time.  
My tail's even wagging!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh?  
Hey, {player}!  
You got here first today. You must be raring to go!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Okay, let's get this road looking pristine!  
We'll split the wages right down the middle. It's not fair  
to use you as free labor, after all. You should get your share.  
  
**Makoto：**  
This is your share for all the work so far.  
No, no, don't be shy. Take it.  
I'll feel guilty if I don't square things up with you.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Good. Buy yourself a decent meal for once.  
Or actually, maybe get a new sword first.  
That thing looks as dull as a butter knife.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hmm? You were told you mustn't replace that sword  
because it's really important? Umm, like a memento  
from your parents or something?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Well, whatever. Even a dull sword can work as a club.  
Plus we won't have to bother getting branches or wooden  
swords for our training. You can use that today.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Of course, we've got a job to do first.  
Whoa, what is this?  
Why're you getting so close?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Something smells good?  
Oh, uhh...  
I kinda made lunch for us today.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Picking up trash along this road takes the whole day.  
Until now, I've just been getting prepacked lunches.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Today, I woke up early and made us lunches myself,  
plus a few treats to satisfy our sweet tooths. Heh heh.  
But you already know what a good cook I am, of course!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh, don't get the wrong idea, though!  
I didn't have some burning desire to see you enjoying my  
homemade lunch, or anything!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I-it's just cheaper to pack lunch than buy it...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That's very economical.  
**Choice: (2)**  I love your cooking, Makoto.  
`Tag 1`  
**Makoto：**  
Bwuh?  
Uhh, right?  
  
**Makoto：**  
The family tavern's not doing so hot,  
so we've gotta keep the  
expenses under control. It's not like my work for Caon pays  
that much either, so we all have to tighten our belts.  
  
**Makoto：**  
You know, for someone without a lick of common sense,  
I'm shocked you know a big word like  
\"economical.\"  
For a second, I didn't know what you meant!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh? I'll make a good wife? Th-thanks...  
What's with all the compliments? Do you really understand  
what you're saying when you open your mouth?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Whatever.  
I get that you're trying to pat me on the back,  
and I appreciate it.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Makoto：**  
Mm-hmm. You eat for free at our place all the time.  
I figured you'd be happier with one of my lunch sets  
than that bland prepackaged stuff.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I guarantee it'll be delicious.  
Something to look forward to while we work!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Thanks, {player}.  
For whatever reason, I was ashamed about cooking  
and baking as a hobby, so I tried to keep it a secret.  
  
**Makoto：**  
But lately I've been less shy about it. I even bring home-  
cooked food to everyone at Caon.  
 It started when you said you  
loved how my cooking tasted, and how happy you were to eat it.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Makoto：**  
A-ah ha ha. Well, all this chitchat isn't gonna get us  
anywhere. Time to get to work!  
Although now that I look, there isn't much trash around today.  
  
**Makoto：**  
These days I'm all fired up to grab the trash collecting  
jobs as soon as they're posted,  
 because I know I'll get to  
hang out with you.  
  
**Makoto：**  
No big deal!  
Anyways, let's take a stroll up and down the road,  
catch some rays, keep an eye out for any litter,  
and have a good time talking about whatever!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Nnh! Ah, I feel great!  
Lately, I've really been loving life!
