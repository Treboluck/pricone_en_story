**Makoto：**  
Hmm, hmm, hmm... ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yup, looking good.  
Another peaceful day in Landosol in the books.  
  
**Makoto：**  
It's getting dark, so this seems like a good place to end  
my patrol for the day.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Nothing out of the ordinary happened, so it should be okay  
to give my report to the guild tomorrow.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Gotta get home and start helping out at the tavern.  
We do the bulk of our business at night, after all.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh?  
Hey, you!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yeah, you.  
You're stumbling around a little too much for my liking.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hmm. Yeah, you're a bit too suspicious.  
Sorry about this, but I need to talk to you for a minute.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Maybe it's due to the recent changes up the chain of command,  
but the government's really dropping the ball lately. The city  
feels like a giant powder keg that could explode at any moment.  
  
**Makoto：**  
And my job is to snuff out any sparks that could set off  
a disaster.  
  
**Makoto：**  
No need to get defensive.  
If you're not doing anything bad,  
I've got no right nor reason to take you in.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh, I should've introduced myself first.  
The name's Makoto.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I'm affiliated with Caon,  
a guild under the banner of the Menagerie.  
Now, let's make this easy, okay?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Pleased to make your acquaintance.  
**Choice: (2)**  Menagerie?  
`Tag 1`  
**Makoto：**  
Uh-huh.  
Ha ha ha. You're awfully polite, aren't you?  
I have to say, I've got a soft spot for guys like you.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yup, I can tell you're not a bad person.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Makoto：**  
Oh, I guess most humans aren't familiar with us.  
Beastfolk like me generally join guilds that fall under the  
Menagerie's umbrella.  
  
**Makoto：**  
And by the way, \"Menagerie\" was chosen as the name  
because of the great diversity among beastfolk,  
and not our animal natures.  
  
**Makoto：**  
In other words, it's a place where everyone can be at ease  
because they know they're all welcome.  
But what's in a name, right?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Makoto：**  
Anyways, Caon's job is to ensure a peaceful, prosperous  
lifestyle for beastfolk everywhere.  
  
**Makoto：**  
You just seem to be a regular human... so I don't want  
to stick my nose into your business any more than necessary.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Of course, I'm not saying I avoid dealing with other races  
at all costs.  
I just don't want to start any conflicts.  
I think we should all try to get along.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Landosol's mainly a human city, so sometimes it's hard for  
us beastfolk not to feel like second-class citizens.  
But that's neither here nor there.  
  
**Makoto：**  
At any rate, can I have your name and guild, please?  
  
**Makoto：**  
{player}, okay...  
Wait. {player}?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Say...  
Do you know a girl named Yui, by any chance?  
  
**Makoto：**  
I knew it!  
Yui was telling me the other day that a guy named  
{player} saved her!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Cool, cool! So you're the one who bailed out Yui!  
Ha ha, I've been wanting to meet you!  
She was beyond grateful when I talked to her.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I should say thanks, too.  
I appreciate you stepping in to protect her.  
She's been reckless like that for as long as I've known her.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hmm?  
Oh, I've been friends with Yui since we were kids.  
  
**Makoto：**  
It's because of her that I learned people can be best friends  
even if they're different races.  
I owe her a lot.  
  
**Makoto：**  
We grew up together and became totally inseparable.  
Compared to the old days, we don't stay in touch quite as much  
as we used to,  
but she's still one of my closest friends.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Back to the topic at hand. If you're the guy who saved Yui,  
there's no way you're up to anything shady.  
So why're you wandering the streets this late at night?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ahh...  
I see. You're lost, huh?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yeah, Landosol's layout is kinda confusing.  
So you can't figure out how to get back to your hotel,  
is that it?  
  
**Makoto：**  
No problem!  
I'll be glad to walk you back there.  
Consider it my way of thanking you for helping Yui.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Cool.  
Just follow me!  
Right this way!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Aww, don't be shy.  
I never turn a blind eye to someone in need.
