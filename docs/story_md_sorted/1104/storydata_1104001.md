## Subtitle: Beachside Officers
  
**Narration：**  
{player}, having bumped into Makoto  
while out for a walk, has come to the beach to help out with her work.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Whew.  
Hardly a surprise or anything,  
but people sure are eager to make the most of this summer.  
  
**Makoto：**  
The place the princess took us to on our last vacation  
really was a hole in the wall.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hm? What's up, {player}?  
You're looking real restless.  
  
**Makoto：**  
\"Aren't we on duty today?\"  
Nah, like I said...  
Oh, right. I guess you figured we're doing our usual patrol routine?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sorry about that. Guess I never explained things properly.  
I'm surprised you even came along without knowing the script, though.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Do me a favor and don't let some shady person take advantage of you, okay?  
Yui'll be real sad if that ever happens.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Me? Of course I would—  
Hey! Quit asking weird questions!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Uhh, what were we even talking about?  
Oh, right. Work.  
Today we're focusing on patrolling the beach.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Needless to say that there's a bunch of people here, right?  
That makes it all the more likely for accidents to happen.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Normally it's up to the Royal Guard to handle that sort of stuff,  
but they're never around when it really matters.  
  
**Makoto：**  
So yeah, that's why we're here to cover for them.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey. Mind if I ask why you keep staring at me?  
Got a problem with how I look?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You sure you're here for work?  
**Choice: (2)**  Wanna go for a quick swim?  
`Tag 1`  
**Makoto：**  
D-don't give me that!  
I can wear what I want on the job!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Makoto：**  
Sure thing! Then let's...  
not do that!  
Man, that was close. Almost let myself slack off on the job.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Makoto：**  
It'd be weird to not wear a swimsuit at the beach, right?  
I didn't bring it with the idea of having fun in mind!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sheesh. Didn't think it'd be this hard to earn your trust.  
Anyway, like I said, we're patrolling the beach today.  
  
**Makoto：**  
If you wanna be cool about it,  
you can say that we're lifeguards.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Lifeguards?  
`Tag 4`  
**Makoto：**  
Oh, right. Amnesia and all that.  
Lifeguards are pretty much pros who work at the beach and stuff  
to keep swimmers and the like safe and sound.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Though you need to take a bunch of tests  
and have a proper license to officially become one.  
I'm far from the real deal.  
  
**Makoto：**  
What does that make us, then?  
Let's see. I'd say we're...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Beachside officers. How's that sound? ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
All right.  
Lemme teach you the basic rescue procedures before we start our patrols.  
No point in doing 'em if you can't spring into action.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Ready and willing to learn!  
`Tag 5`  
**Makoto：**  
Now that's what I like to hear!  
Sounds like you're ready to get put through the wringer. ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
...And that's about it, I'd say.  
Don't go forgetting where the first-aid facility is,  
okay?  
Though you've got a pretty good memory, so it should be okay.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Next up, and probably most importantly, is what to do when  
you've saved someone who's drowned, particularly if they're unconscious.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Then again...  
I'll handle situations like that, so no real need to teach you.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I'd like you to.  
`Tag 6`  
**Makoto：**  
Man, really?  
I mean, it's kind of, y'know...  
  
**Makoto：**  
You think it'd be useful to at least know what to do?  
Yeah, I respect that.  
  
**Makoto：**  
...Fine, fine!  
You really do have a one-track mind when it comes to helping people.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Uh...  
Guess we can start with how to perform a cardiac massage!  
  
**Makoto：**  
First off, get on the ground.  
  
**Makoto：**  
No questions!  
Just lie down on the ground!  
  
**Makoto：**  
There we go.  
Now don't move, okay?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Listen up. When you perform a cardiac massage,  
you place both hands on the person's chest and repeatedly press down!  
  
**Makoto：**  
You wanna give it a try?  
D-don't be stupid!  
You gotta learn with your own body!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I'm already embarrassed enough as it is.  
No way I'm just gonna let him try it out on me!  
  
**Makoto：**  
You know, this might actually be the first time I've  
touched a guy's body like this. It's pretty different compared to a girl's...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Wait, what am I even thinking?!  
Forget all that!  
I know you didn't hear anything, but forget it anyway!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ahem.  
That's it for cardiac massages.  
There's one other important process, though...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Quit giving me those eyes.  
I'm not gonna skimp out on you.  
  
**Makoto：**  
The other process is called, uh,  
mouth-to-mouth...  
  
**Makoto：**  
If someone's almost drowned or lost consciousness, you open up their mouth...  
  
**Makoto：**  
And then you press your mouth against theirs  
and blow air into...!  
  
**Beachgoer：**  
Someone! Anyone!  
  
**Makoto：**  
You hear that?!  
Let's get going!  
  
**Makoto：**  
What's going on?!  
  
**Beachgoer：**  
My wife just collapsed out of nowhere!  
  
**Makoto：**  
She didn't take on water or anything, right?  
Lemme have a look.  
  
**Makoto：**  
She's showing signs of a fever, but she's not swearing...  
Is this...  
heatstroke?  
Either way,  
let's move her to somewhere nice and cool. Help me out!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey, {player}!  
Go bring some ice and fluids from the first-aid center!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Got it!  
`Tag 7`  
**Makoto：**  
Thanks!  
  
**Beachgoer：**  
Thank you so much!  
I don't know how I can make this up to you!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Don't worry about it.  
Just take care, okay?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Phew. That's that.  
Glad it wasn't too serious, at least.  
  
**Makoto：**  
That kind of came out of nowhere,  
but you being there was a big help.  
Thanks.  
  
**Makoto：**  
The day's just getting started, though.  
This is where the real challenge begins.  
  
**Makoto：**  
It'll be tough,  
but let's work together and make it through the day.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh yeah. I got interrupted in the middle of teaching him about mouth-to-mouth.  
But oh well. Never mind.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh? You wanna pick up where we left off?  
...Do I really need to teach you?  
  
**Makoto：**  
F-fine!  
I'll do it, I'll do it!  
But just...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Quit making those puppy dog eyes at me!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus Makoto continued her lesson on mouth-to-mouth resuscitation,  
her face red as a tomato the entire time.
