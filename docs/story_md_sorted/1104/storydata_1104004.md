**Narration：**  
Most people have left the beach as the day draws to a close.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hard to believe how busy it was this afternoon when you see it like this.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Guess we're pretty much done for the day, huh.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Good work, man.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Thanks a bunch for helping out.  
You really did a great job today.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's all thanks to you.  
`Tag 1`  
**Makoto：**  
I'm happy to hear that and all,  
but you ended up saving me as well.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Guess that makes you a full-fledged beachside officer.  
  
**Makoto：**  
One that still uses a swim ring, though.  
Haha. ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh, check it out.  
The sea's starting to shine now that the sun's setting into it...  
Wait a minute.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Seems a bit too bright, doesn't it?

**Makoto：**  
I get that we bumped into each other and all,  
but do we really need to go home together as well?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh? \"Is that a bad thing?\"  
I mean, not really.  
  
**Makoto：**  
But we're not nearly that close, are we?  
  
**Makoto：**  
What's with the lonely expression all of a sudden?!  
Fine, fine! Let's just hurry home!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I don't mind going home together,  
but at times like this I'm never sure what to talk about.  
  
**Makoto：**  
H-how're things going?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Man! That was total dad talk!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Actually...  
How're things going with you and Yui?  
  
**Makoto：**  
What do I mean? Well, uh, you know...  
Actually, nah. I should keep quiet.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hm? What're you looking over at the river for?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  There's a cat being carried away by it!  
`Tag 2`  
**Makoto：**  
What?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Holy crap. It's stuck in a cardboard box, too!  
Hold my bag for me!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh? What am I gonna do?  
Do you really gotta ask?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I'm gonna save it!

**Makoto：**  
There, there.  
You okay?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Whoa there! Settle down!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh well.  
Proof that it's still nice and energetic.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hm? You'll lend me a towel to use?  
Thanks. Pretty thoughtful, ain't ya?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Don't worry about me catching a cold.  
I'm not that frail.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hold up.  
Now that I take a closer look, I'm...

**Makoto：**  
Eeek?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Y-you took a peek, didn't you?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
You swear you didn't?  
As if!  
  
**Makoto：**  
You're looking at me right now, even!  
Turn away already!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Forget everything you saw!  
Don't even think about it for a second!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sheesh.  
You really do keep throwing me for a loop.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Which reminds me...  
I let out a squeal just now, didn't I?  
  
**Makoto：**  
I sure hope he didn't hear me...

**Ameth：**  
And there we have it. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What is it with you and getting glimpses of Makoto in embarrassing situations?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I know you'll forget everything since this is kind of like a dream,  
but still...  
you're a lucky guy. ♪  
  
**Ameth：**  
Kidding, kidding.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Makoto's instincts when it comes to helping people  
are kind of similar to yours, aren't they?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Keep backing her up from here on out, too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Okay. See you around. ♪

**Makoto：**  
Mmm... Huh?  
Why am I sleeping on the beachside?  
  
**Makoto：**  
And {player}'s sleeping beside me...  
Hey! Wake up!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I'm see-through?  
Any more of that and I'll smack you awake.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Guess it goes to show how exhausted we were, though.  
  
**Boy：**  
Wolf lady!  
  
**Girl：**  
Wolf lady!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hm?  
Oh hey, it's you two!  
You seem fine now. That's great.  
  
**Boy：**  
Thanks so much for helping us today!  
  
**Girl：**  
Thank you!  
  
**Makoto：**  
No prob.  
Try not to make your folks worried, okay?  
  
**Boy & Girl：**  
Okay! Bye-bye!  
  
**Makoto：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Something the matter?  
`Tag 3`  
**Makoto：**  
Nah.  
I was just thinking about how nice it is to help people, that's all.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Haha. Not like me to get all pensive and stuff.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Come on.  
You're allowed to laugh at me about it.  
  
**Makoto：**  
You feel the same,  
huh?  
Well then.  
Now I'm extra glad I invited you along.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Mind if I... invite you again, then?  
  
**Makoto：**  
It'd be great  
to have you help out again.  
  
**Narration：**  
Makoto flashed {player} a bright smile as the sun slowly set in the background.
