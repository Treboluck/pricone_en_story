## Subtitle: Where Did Hanzo Go?
  
**Mahiru：**  
I feel kinda sorry for the inspector gettin' hung out to dry like that.  
An' jus' where the heck did that Hanzo character disappear to...?  
Not that I should be sympathizin' though, huh?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  From the dark he came; into the dark he went.  
**Choice: (2)**  He'll get caught one day.  
**Choice: (3)**  Maybe he's closer than we think...

That's sure how it seems. I guess it's some special kinda magic.  
It must be a mighty formidable technique if Nightmare can't even  
find him.  
Crazy how we managed to win against that.

Jus' deserts, huh? Fate willing, he'll be made to pay for his crimes.  
I sure hope nobody else is made to suffer by his hand.

**Mahiru：**  
D-don't say such scary things!  
But he is the kind to show up  
unexpectedly, so I wouldn't be surprised if he jus' popped outta the  
shadows.  
If he does, I'll turn him into shish kebab with this here bident.
