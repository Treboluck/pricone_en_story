## Subtitle: Rin's Outfit
  
**Shiori：**  
Rin's armor is really cute, isn't it?  
And it's nice that she got it from her mom.  
I wish she would wear it more often...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's not suitable for patrolling.  
**Choice: (2)**  We strive for peace.  
**Choice: (3)**  She's taking special care of it.

**Shiori：**  
Maybe it does look a little heavy. That's not good for security work.

It wouldn't go well.

**Shiori：**  
It's true that it's best not to need unsettling things like armor...  
But Rin herself is the exact opposite. she's far too cute in her  
oversized gear. Do you think she'll wear it if I ask nicely?

**Shiori：**  
I understand the desire to treasure gifts, but some things are given  
in hopes that they actually see some use.  
Well, I suppose Rin's safety is most important.
