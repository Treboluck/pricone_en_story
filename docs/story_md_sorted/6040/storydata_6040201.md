## Subtitle: The Mysterious Hanzo
  
**Rin：**  
That Hanzo guy injured Mahy. I'll skin him alive.  
And he dresses like a real weirdo. What's up with that?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm glad Mahiru's all right.  
**Choice: (2)**  He's a denizen of the dark.  
**Choice: (3)**  I know a girl who wears clothes like his...  
`Tag 1`  
**Rin：**  
She's fine 'cause she handled the situation so calmly.  
I tend to think she's too good a person, but up against someone like that,  
it's for the best.  
But I still hate the guy for it.

**Rin：**  
What, like, the underworld?  
Well, he doesn't exactly seem like an  
upstanding citizen.  
The same goes for the inspector, surrounding himself  
with people like that.  
Seriously, trouble always comes looking for us.

**Rin：**  
Is she dangerous too?  
Ah, she's not?  
Then the mystery surrounding that style deepens, huh?  
Honestly, I just don't get it...
