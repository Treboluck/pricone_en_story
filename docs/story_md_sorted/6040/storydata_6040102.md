When she dug up the hot spring, I thought it was jus' property damage.  
But now I'm real thankful that it's come to the rescue in our time of need.  
...Ain't got a clue how she knew it was open for business though.

Yeah, me too. When I look at the signboard, I start to miss 'em real bad.  
But at the same time, it makes me wanna succeed,  
so I guess it's a good  
thing after all.

Ch-Christina Spa Resort?!  
I don't think such a fancy name really suits the ranch, ya know...  
On the contrary, ya say?  
No, no! It's jus' too strange!
