## Subtitle: All About Rin
  
**Mahiru：**  
Rinrin's finally pullin' her weight for us... Ya dunno how happy that makes me.  
But it still feels an awful lot like a dream.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Will she ever go back to normal?  
**Choice: (2)**  She needs a reward.  
**Choice: (3)**  She's doing it for her friends.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mahiru：**  
Even though I was always on her back about it,  
I kinda miss Rinrin's slackin' off.  
Lookin' back on it now, it was somethin' to be grateful for.

**Mahiru：**  
Her reward can be time off, ya reckon?  
I'm afraid that ain't possible...  
I know, she can be the test audience for my new gag!

**Mahiru：**  
She really is a good egg, huh?  
I've known all along that there's more to her than dodgin' work,  
but I never expected her to be this reliable.
