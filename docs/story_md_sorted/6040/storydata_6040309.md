**Lima：**  
Rin's armor is sooo cute, right? ♪  
She said it was a gift from her mom,  
so she should wear it more.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She doesn't wanna work.  
**Choice: (2)**  Ranch life is too peaceful.  
**Choice: (3)**  She's taking special care of it.

**Lima：**  
O-oh yeah, armor isn't really necessary outside of work, is it...?  
Hmmm, but I want to see her like that some more.  
We need to find a reason to make her keep wearing it.

Right. There's nothing better than not having a reason to wear armor.  
Once the ranch is back to normal, do you think she'll stop wearing it?  
That's a little bit sad.

**Lima：**  
Normally, I'd be convinced by someone telling me they want  
to take special care of a gift.  
But we're talking about Rin.  
I get the feeling she just doesn't want to work...
