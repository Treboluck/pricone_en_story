Limalima's forever workin' her hide off for us. She's a true blessin'.  
I always find myself wishin' folks would take note of her good qualities.  
An' it sure would be nice if they'd quit mistakin' her for one of my cows.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Slowly but surely, huh.  
**Choice: (2)**  The kids know.  
**Choice: (3)**  She's nothing like a cow.

**Mahiru：**  
Yeah. If we can clear up the misunderstandings about her bit by bit,  
she should be able to travel around more freely.  
Ah, I ain't sayin' that  
'cause I need her help peddlin' goods or nothin', ya know?

**Mahiru：**  
Folks who're receptive will understand that she's a great gal.  
They say ya shouldn't judge a book by its cover,  
but the ones who do are always adults...

**Mahiru：**  
Right?  
It's really crazy how anyone could make that mistake...  
But I guess we should be grateful that nobody's mistaken her for a monster...
