**Shiori：**  
After going to all sorts of places with you to deliver mail,  
I once again learned how amazing Mahiru is.  
One day, I hope to become such an admirable adult...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I know you will.  
**Choice: (2)**  You're already admirable.  
**Choice: (3)**  Admirable adult...

**Shiori：**  
I doubt I can be the same as Mahiru.  
But in my own way, I hope I can live a happy life full of kindness.  
I think I'll continue to observe Mahiru up close.

You're right. Without overreaching, I'll try to continue achieving  
as much as I can, so that little by little, I'll become more like Mahiru.

I-it's true that Mahiru is tiny and adorable in many ways, but...  
  
Oh, you weren't talking about her childish appearance, were you?!
