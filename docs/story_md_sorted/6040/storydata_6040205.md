## Subtitle: All About Lima
  
**Rin：**  
Lima really is the salt of the earth, isn't she?  
I doubt I'll ever meet someone as good-natured as her.  
I wish other people would notice her great personality too.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Tell her you feel that way.  
**Choice: (2)**  The kids know.  
**Choice: (3)**  They just need to talk to her.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rin：**  
Nah, it'd be too awkward.  
Hmmm, well, that being said,  
if she's ever  
feeling troubled, I'll let her know. Meaning, I'll never have to tell her.  
'Cause people will definitely start to notice how great she is.

**Rin：**  
Kids are really sharp, huh?  
But why aren't they frightened of her when adults always are?  
It's so weird.

`Tag 3`  
**Rin：**  
Yeah, it's the part leading up to that that's the problem...  
Well, you're  
not wrong.  
If anyone still thinks she's a monster after talking to her,  
then I'll give 'em something to be scared of. It's not like me, but yeah.
