## Subtitle: All About the Hot Spring
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm so relieved that our guests are enjoyin' the hot spring.  
It's a bit showy,  
but they all seem to like that about it.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That's Producer for you.  
**Choice: (2)**  They can also admire nature.  
**Choice: (3)**  I wish we could relax too.

At first I wasn't too sure about the way it looked,  
but ya can't argue with a performing arts pro.  
I guess that's what they call foresight, huh?

**Mahiru：**  
From our point of view, the scenery here on the ranch ain't that unusual.  
But I guess the city folks rarely ever see places like this.  
I bet they'd like it better if my cows were still here.

**Mahiru：**  
We all wanna while away the hours in the hot spring, but we can't  
afford to yet.  
Once this is all over, let's all take a dip together.  
But ya can't exactly join us, can ya...?  
W-well, I don't mind if ya do.
