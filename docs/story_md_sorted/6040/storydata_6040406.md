## Subtitle: Monetary Donations
  
**Shiori：**  
People from the nearby towns and even some of the  
Sarendia orphans donated lots of money.  
I'm really, really grateful.  
We have to try to live up to their expectations.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  First, we need to return peace to the ranch.  
**Choice: (2)**  We owe it all to Mahiru.  
**Choice: (3)**  We should return the favor.

Yes, we do. I wish the people who come for our hot spring could  
also experience the real Elizabeth Park. Lively and warm, like our  
home always was.

It's thanks to Mahiru's sales trips to various towns and villages  
where she interacted with many people.  
But not only that, I think it's  
because of her warm personality. It's not something that can be imitated.

**Shiori：**  
Return the favor... How do you think we could do that? Do something  
to make them all happy?  
That makes sense. Then maybe I'll start  
thinking of what we can do to make the hot spring more comfortable.
