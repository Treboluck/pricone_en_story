**Lima：**  
I'm not at all surprised to see that  
Mahiru's adored by so many people.  
I mean, it's only natural for her...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She's so dependable.  
**Choice: (2)**  It's 'cause she's a little cutie.  
**Choice: (3)**  Her adult charm's getting stronger, huh?  
`Tag 1`  
**Lima：**  
When I see her smiling face, I know in my heart that everything's gonna

but  
she is adorable.  
I bet she'd say \"it's 'cause of my mature allure,\"  
or something like that.

...Huh? Oh, r-right, sorry. For a moment there, I had to think twice  
about what you meant.  
Yeah, being able to do lots of things for  
others as a matter of course  
is certainly an appealing, mature trait.
