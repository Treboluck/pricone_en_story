## Subtitle: Where Did Hanzo Go?
  
**Rin：**  
I wonder what the heck happened to Hanzo.  
I won't feel like this is all over until he's been caught.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  From the dark he came; into the dark he went.  
**Choice: (2)**  He'll get caught one day.  
**Choice: (3)**  Maybe he's closer than we think...

It honestly seems that way, huh?  
He and his cronies only did what they did for the sake of money,  
so I guess we can rest easy...  
But still.

I bet capturing him and his underlings won't be a simple task.  
But I have my fingers crossed.  
I wanna flay him for causing me to work so hard.

The last thing he wants is to be easily found.  
So I'm sure he's already a million miles away.  
Honestly, I don't ever wanna see him or his subordinates ever again.
