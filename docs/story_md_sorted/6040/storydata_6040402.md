## Subtitle: That Standing Signboard...
  
**Shiori：**  
That signboard does a really good job of catching the eye.  
We should thank Carmina's producer for sending such a nice gift.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's a nice present, huh?  
**Choice: (2)**  I wanna put my face in it.  
**Choice: (3)**  Christina Spa Resort.

She certainly has an eye for the unusual.  
Such a strange combination sure does leave an impression.  
Setting it up by the entrance is perfect.

**Shiori：**  
Christina Spa Resort.... That's what she wanted to call it?  
It would be nice to respect the wishes of the person who built  
the hot spring... But that's just a little... how should I put it...?
