**Choice: (3)**  She's kind once in a while.

**Nozomi：**  
I-I can't really deny that...  
  
But I think it's because she has a strong sense of self.  
I hope I can become that strong one day.  
Huh? You don't think I should?

**Nozomi：**  
Yeah, isn't she?!  
This one time, a fan started a fight, right?  
But she calmed him down in no time, all on her own.  
  
At that moment, Producer was so dependable...  
But also very violent.

**Nozomi：**  
Hee hee. Once in a while, right?  
She's easy to misunderstand, but she's a really nice person.  
She motivates us with her harsh words!
