And I'll give you credit for not getting in my way, boy. ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You were totally in sync with everyone.  
**Choice: (2)**  Thanks for your help.  
**Choice: (3)**  Good work.

Have you misunderstood something?

wanted to fight.  
If you really are grateful, then take that sword of yours  
and use it to show me a good time. ♪

And to you, good work as well.  
It's a strange feeling, being lauded by the likes of you.
