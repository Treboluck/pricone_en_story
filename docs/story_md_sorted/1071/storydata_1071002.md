## Subtitle: A Deadly Diversion
  
**Narration：**  
Unluckily captured by the knights of Nightmare,  
{player} finds himself being interrogated  
for Christina's entertainment.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm... Amnesia, you say?  
 What a terribly convenient excuse.  
There are spells that can expose outright lies,  
but alas, I do not have the necessary mages or artifacts to hand.  
  
**Christina：**  
On the other hand, it will be most difficult for you to prove  
that you aren't associated with Labyrinth in any way.  
Falsehoods are always so much easier to produce than the truth.  
  
**Christina：**  
So how does this sound? I'll give you a simple test.  
If you successfully pass it, I'll let you go free. All suspicion cleared.  
  
**Christina：**  
Not a bad deal, is it?  
Though I won't force you to accept.  
  
**Christina：**  
If you refuse, I'll just have to escort you to the palace dungeons.  
Then we can enjoy a far more thorough interrogation!  
  
**Christina：**  
Either way, I have my fun.  
So I'll let you choose for yourself. Which will it be?  
  
**Christina：**  
Yes...  
This should be a suitable location.  
 Let's begin the test!  
  
**Christina：**  
I'm glad you chose the more entertaining option,  
my dear {player}.  
  
**Christina：**  
I was beginning to tire of skulking about in dingy caves,  
so I welcome this opportunity for action!  
  
**Christina：**  
Besides... Sadly enough, his suspicions have already been cleared.  
My subordinates reached the conclusion  
that he really was just passing through this area.  
  
**Christina：**  
It seems he was unlucky enough to run into us  
on his way to make a delivery to a farm not far from here.  
  
**Christina：**  
How tedious. I was hoping for a more dramatic  
explanation for his presence!  
  
**Christina：**  
But ah well. There's still the matter of Her Majesty's interest in him...  
And though I know not her reasons,  
that does seem to warrant a little investigation.  
  
**Christina：**  
Now, shall we begin?  
The rules of this test are simple. You're going to spar with me!  
...Though as an amnesiac, perhaps that doesn't mean much to you?  
  
**Christina：**  
A faux brawl, an imitation battle...  
Hmmm. I'm not sure how best to describe it.  
In essence, I'm asking you to fight me.  
  
**Christina：**  
Not a fight to the death, you understand. More like a game.  
But in the event that you successfully defeat me...  
No,  
 if you even touch me, I'll grant you your freedom.  
  
**Christina：**  
That much I swear.  
This may surprise you, but I'm a woman of my word.  
I stand by my promises \"absolutely.\"  
  
**Christina：**  
Now, come at me, boy!  
I won't set a time limit, nor forbid the use of weapons or magic.  
Use all your tricks and daring to achieve your singular goal!  
  
**Christina：**  
Slay the tedium that plagues me!  
Come now, boy! No need to be shy! ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
...You're not moving.  
What's wrong? Quaking in your boots?  
Or would you insult me by refusing to face a woman in battle?  
  
**Christina：**  
Do you need me to motivate you?  
  
**Christina：**  
It will be simple for us to determine your identity.  
If you do not care to cooperate... then perhaps your family,  
your friends, your loved ones will meet my blade!  
  
**Christina：**  
Well, now!  
 That's better. But try to put your back into it a little!  
Worry not—those threats were just my little joke!  
Though if you displease me, I may yet make them a reality!  
  
**Christina：**  
Now, bring it on! Come on, is that all you've got?  
Your childish naiveté maddens me!  
Aren't you a man?  
 Then try to fight like one!  
  
**Christina：**  
Look, your feet are wide open! ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
Hahah! So easily you let me trip you!  
You don't know the first thing about swordsmanship.  
Do you need me to teach you, helpless infant that you are?  
  
**Christina：**  
I'll raise you like a suckling babe in arms!  
Herd you from the cradle to the grave!  
  
**Christina：**  
Stand up!  
Don't you dare give in. Entertain me if you want to live!  
I'm begging you!  
  
**Christina：**  
...Ohh?  
 That fierce gaze... You have a plan in mind?  
Very good! Try whatever comes to mind!  
If you don't, you'll never hope to lay a finger on my body!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Use your power.  
**Choice: (2)**  Call for help.  
`Tag 1`  
**Christina：**  
Ohh...?  
Now what is this strange glow?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Christina：**  
Hahah.  
 How adorable. Are you crying for help?  
As if a reliable ally would wander by  
here in this remote forest deep in the mountains!  
  
**Christina：**  
...Hmm?  
What's this? Is his entire body glowing?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Christina：**  
Ah yes, I recall Her Majesty mentioned this.  
He has the ability to lend his own strength to reinforce his allies.  
  
**Christina：**  
Though it comes with the limitation  
that he cannot strengthen himself...  
  
**Christina：**  
In fact, his motions are becoming slower, if anything.  
Did using this power wear him out?  
  
**Christina：**  
I can't see the logic.  
What are you plotting, young lad...?  
  
**Christina：**  
...Mrghh?!  
What's this?! The forest's birds and beasts are attacking me!  
  
**Christina：**  
Even monsters...  
They all seem overexcited and stronger than usual.  
Did you strengthen them with your ability?  
  
**Christina：**  
Dealing with all these creatures... will be quite a pain.  
But this is a fool's plan, boy!  
  
**Christina：**  
All you can do is strengthen those around you.  
You cannot bend them to your will!  
  
**Christina：**  
See? The beasts you strengthened are attacking you as well!  
You idiot. Think these things through!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm... That face. You anticipated this too?  
Lent the beasts your strength knowing they would attack you?  
Hoping that the confusion would provide an opportunity?  
  
**Christina：**  
Throwing yourself into the lions' den...  
I like it!  
Such daring! Perhaps you're a man after all! ☆  
  
**Christina：**  
But I think not!  
Distractions won't work on me. That's not nearly enough!  
  
**Christina：**  
Rack your brains for some better plans!  
Then I'll gladly crush each and every one!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm? What's this? Raindrops?  
The forecast showed nothing but sun for the next few days...  
  
**Christina：**  
Can it be... He's lending his power to  
the water spirits in the atmosphere to create artificial rain?  
  
**Christina：**  
Ridiculous...  
Even magic cannot change the weather itself!  
  
**Christina：**  
Only special beings like Her Majesty and myself  
can manifest such miracles!  
  
**Christina：**  
Curses. Miracle or not, this weather is a real liability.  
I don't know why, but rain always weakens my senses.  
  
**Christina：**  
I have to subconsciously calculate each individual drop's motion,  
and my brain's processes can't keep up.  
 Not good. In this situation,  
my Absolute Offense and Absolute Defense won't function.  
  
**Christina：**  
Those wild beasts are still rampaging around,  
and I can't focus on both them and the boy!  
Tch... I suppose I was careless. This is the worst turn of events!  
  
**Christina：**  
However!  
Such paltry misfortunes are nothing before the will of Christina!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah!  
Thank you, boy! This is more fun than I had hoped!  
  
**Christina：**  
So, what's next?  
Will you leap instantly through space?  
Or transform into an invulnerable warrior?  
  
**Christina：**  
Show me one miracle after the next and best me however you can!  
  
**Christina：**  
...Wait, whaa—? U-uwhooahh?!

**Christina：**  
You dolt! Why collapse towards me, of all things?!  
Did you slip in the mud you yourself wetted?!  
You halfwit! If this were a battlefield, you'd be dead!  
  
**Christina：**  
Well, no matter. Back to battle!  
Stand and fight! This time, I'll go on the attack!  
  
**Christina：**  
...Hmm? What's that face for?  
Do you have an objection?  
  
![107100202.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/107100202.webp)  
**Christina：**  
Ahh...  
You're right. You do seem to have touched me.

**Christina：**  
Just when things were getting interesting,  
you threatened to spoil the fun by keeling over,  
so I suppose I caught you without thinking.  
  
**Christina：**  
Urgh... How unspeakably careless!  
But...  
 I cannot break my word.  
  
**Christina：**  
As promised, you are hereby free to go.  
  
**Christina：**  
That said, I am still far from satisfied!  
I'll remember your name and face.  
Let's play again, my dear {player}! ♪
