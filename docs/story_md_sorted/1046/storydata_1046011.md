**Narration：**  
Tamaki and {player} have made their decision  
to take down the Korruptio Syndicate once and for all.  
They investigate the enemy while also working at the taiyaki stall.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hmmm, nyot a whole lotta customers today...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh! I see one of our regulars over there!  
He~y! Wanna purr-chase some taiyaki?!  
  
**Regular Customer：**  
...Real sorry, Tamaki.  
I'm trying to cut back on expenses right now.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
W-well, that's a shame...  
Maybe anyother time!

`Tag 1`  
**Tamaki：**  
I knyow that!  
But it's a lot easier said than done...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
We've identified the groups that make up the Korruptio Syndicate.  
But there's just too many of them!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
If I go after them one by one,  
they'll get wise, and I won't be able to infiltrate the rest...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myaaaghh...! What am I gonna do nyow?!

 Myaaaarghhhh?!

The gleaming coating, the enticing smell, the ideal form... It's a treasure!  
All this in a single piece of taiyaki... Nyo wonder this shop's famous!  
Our stall can't compete with this quality...  
  
**Tamaki：**

Selling their wares to *me* without any hesitation...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
They'll live to regret this!  
With my latest snyeaky plan, \"Operation: Feast on Local Taiyaki Secrets,\"  
I'll turn my rivals' strengths into my own!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Coming up with such a purr-fect plan... How talented am I?!  
In a scarier world, I might have been a vigilante or a famous thief,  
feared and admired across the land as a legend!
