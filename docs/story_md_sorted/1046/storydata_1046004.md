**Narration：**  
{player} is feeding the cats one day with Tamaki.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Here ya go! I brought your food fur today.  
Eat up 'til you're filled to the whiskers, my furry friends.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Mya?  
Oh, they already made off with everything.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I guess I'll just open another can and—  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Meowzer!  
There's a light inside the can...  
Myaaaaghhh!

**Tamaki：**  
Who's hungry fur some taiyaki!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Meow-th watering taiyaki!  
Come one, come all! Meow!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh, {player}!  
Purr-fect timing. Come over here fur a sec.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyow... I need you to help me out with something.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I want you to be the guinea pig fur tasting  
my latest taiyaki creations!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
One usually costs 100 yen, but they're yours fur *just*  
70 yen each.  
Nyow that's a bargain!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are they even edible?  
**Choice: (2)**  Why am I paying to be your guinea pig?  
`Tag 1`  
**Tamaki：**  
W-well...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Tamaki：**  
Urghh... Look, I totally get how you're feline, {player}.  
But...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tamaki：**  
I-I'm purr-ty sure they won't kill you.  
So if you'll just bite the bullet and—  
  
**Boy：**  
Um, excuse me...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh? Aren't you two purr-ecious! Welcome!  
How about some taiyaki? They're 100 yen each.  
  
**Boy：**  
Well, um... We don't get much allowance...  
So could you sell us half a taiyaki for this?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
What's this... 50 yen?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Just 50 yen, huh...?  
Hmmm. Well... wait, hold on.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...Okay. I've got a purr-posal!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
If you two help me out with making the taiyaki,  
I'll give you some in exchange as a purr-esent!  
  
**Girl：**  
Really? You will?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Of course! I'm as honest as they come!  
Oh also...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
*whisper, whisper*...  
  
**Boy：**  
Yeah... Yeah, okay!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It's a deal!  
Nyow then, let's start makin' that taiyaki!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
The trick is to be real claw-tious in the beginning...  
then at the last minute you whisk-er it away!  
  
**Girl：**  
Um... Like this?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Yes!  
Purr-fect! You're a taiyaki prodigy!  
  
**Girl：**  
Ehehe... You're a good teacher.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Okay, the taiyaki's done!  
You two know what to do nyow, don't you?  
  
**Boy：**  
Yup, of course!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Good kiddies! Here we go then!  
  
**Girl：**  
Hey, mister!  
Please buy some taiyaki. We made it ourselves!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
{player}!  
These taiyaki are a mixture of my new recipes  
and the children's purr-sistence and hard work.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'll sell them to you at a su-purr-b price.  
You wouldn't say nyo to the taiyaki in front of the children,  
would you?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myeheheh. Nyow you'll be a good boy and become my guinea pig!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I-I'm stuffed...  
`Tag 4`  
**Tamaki：**  
I'm im-purr-essed you ate all of it.  
Exactly according to plan.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyow then, these taiyaki are for your paw-some work today.  
You two eat as much as you like.  
  
**Girl：**  
Whoaaa!  
Look at all those taiyaki!  
  
**Boy：**  
Thank you, miss!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Careful nyot to eat too much and get a tummy ache.  
  
**Boy：**  
Okay!  
Thank you so much!  
See you, miss!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
What meow-velous children they are.  
It was worth hiring them fur the job.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Well, {player}?  
How are you feeling?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Some of the recipes were purr-ty ambitious.  
There's one that's 30 times spicier than chili,  
and another that makes you cat-atonic.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  To be honest, I don't want to remember any of it...  
`Tag 5`  
**Tamaki：**  
Hmm... Looks like my experiment was a failure.  
Oh well, as they say, a cat in gloves catches nyo mice.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Still, thanks fur helping out today, {player}! ♪

**Ameth：**  
Okay. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Think of what you just saw as a dream of sorts.  
Chances are you'll forget everything the second you wake up,  
so no need to brood over it too much.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You know, I'm sure there were more than 10 taiyaki back there.  
I'm surprised you actually ate them all.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Even if you did it for the kids, that was quite a feat.  
I'm impressed.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm also impressed Tamaki improvised that plan on the spot.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Selling... or should I say, \"persuading\" others  
is one of her strong suits.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Be careful not to let her talk you into doing something  
that gets you into trouble.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, that's it for today. Collect more Memory Shards,  
and I'll have more dreams to show you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, see you later! ♪

**Tamaki：**  
Meowr... Nyow that was a weird dream.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
You and I were feeding the cats,  
then I was engulfed  
in a weird light... What was that about?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Still... interesting. That's one paw-sible way to get you  
to eat my new taiyaki prototypes...  
Nyot a bad idea!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...What?  
Don't make kids do my bidding?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyow why are you fur-miliar with what happened in my dream?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...I see.  
So you're saying you saw the same dream just nyow.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyo matter!  
Soon I'll have you  
eating taiyaki out of my paws!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myeheh. Nyow that will be the day!  
  
**Narration：**  
With those words, Tamaki laughs happily.
