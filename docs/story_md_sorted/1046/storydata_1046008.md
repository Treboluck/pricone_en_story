So, I'm on a diet nyow... but whenever I feed the cats,  
it makes me su-purr hungry...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I've even been fur-going my taiyaki lunch  
and feeding it to them.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
But... nyow, I'm hungry as heck,  
and I just can't take it anymore!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Aughh... {player}!

**Tamaki：**  
*huff, huff*  
Just how long a marathon are you gonna make me run...?  
Although it does make fur great cat-hletic training...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
*huff, huff* I-I finally see the finish line...  
Once I reach there, I can rest...  
One final s-purr-t! I've got this!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myaaaghhh—!

**Tamaki：**  
Whew... I'm knyaaackered.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
*huff, huff*...  
Meow?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
What's the matter, {player}?  
Why are you looking away?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Wait, did I cat-cha...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
{player}, don't tell me you've gotten all flustered nyow,  
just from seeing my wet clothes clinging to my body?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myehehe...  
I'm very purr-ceptive  
when it comes to your gaze.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Boys just can't help themselves, can they...?  
Then purr-haps, {player}...  
you'd like to see what's underneath my clothes?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
If it's you... {player},  
I might just... nyot mind?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hehe...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'm kitten with you!  
It's a joke!  
Did you get your hopes up?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myehehe... Anyway, having you observe my purr-formance  
really keeps me in check!  
You're a real paw-sitive influence!

**Ameth：**  
Okay. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That was a rare treat, seeing you get all hot and bothered  
at just a glimpse of a girl's body.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Still, it's always hard to tell whether Tamaki's making a move  
or just messing with you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
All in all, she is one unpredictable gal.  
I wonder if it'd be a handful to date a girl like that.  
Well, at least you wouldn't be bored...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh well.  
It's your concern, not mine. See you around then!

**Tamaki：**  
Meowr...?  
Aughh... I must've dozed off fur a second.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
That was a purr-ty strange dream...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
That said, even in my dream, I litter-ally had the same job!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyo way!  
I was working at a taiyaki stall in your dream, too?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I see.  
It's paw-sible we were having the same dream...  
That's a purr-ty odd coincidence.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myeheh! It's actually kinda hiss-terical,  
looking back at what happened.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I mean, even in my dream,  
you were head over paws fur me.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myahah... Picking up where it left off...  
Purr-haps you'd like to see what's under this...?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myahah! I'm kitten with you!  
Well then, time fur me to get to work!  
  
**Narration：**  
With that, Tamaki returned to her job, a cheerful smile on her face.
