**Narration：**  
In the business district of ​​Landosol, {player}  
encounters Tamaki, who is in an unusually good mood.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Meow! Meow, meow, meowww! ♪  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh, {player}!  
Fancy running into you in a place like this!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're in an unusually good mood. What's the matter?  
`Tag 1`  
**Tamaki：**  
Myeheh! Nyow, I'm glad you asked!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Purr-haps you recall how I told you about  
the young and beautiful thief,  
the Phantom Cat?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Yup, that's the one. I'm im-purr-essed you remember.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Thing is, there's a request box of sorts  
fur the Phantom Cat  
that someone installed here in Landosol.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Rumor has it that a request was de-paw-sited  
into the box today.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It a-purrs to have said, \"To the evil-fighting Phantom Cat.  
There is a villain I would like you to punish.  
Please rain down justice  
upon them.\"  
  
**Tamaki：**  
So, tonight I'm off to paw-nish some bad guys—I mean,  
the Phantom Cat is off to paw-nish some bad guys!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It makes me hiss-terical with excitement  
to witness the Phantom Cat's day-to-day success!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Like just the other day...  
  
That same day you agreed to stand guard fur me...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
The Phantom Cat was busy paw-nishing the wicked then, too.  
Krook'd & Co. were a tough bunch...  
or so I heard.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Isn't the Phantom Cat a little too active lately?  
`Tag 2`  
**Tamaki：**  
Hm? True, the Phantom Cat's been purr-ty active lately.  
What about it...?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
What's that? If she gets carried away,  
she'll have the rug swept out from under her?  
She should be more... claw-tious?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyo worries!  
The Phantom Cat is too paw-some to go down that easily!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Just look at the request box!  
Everyone is counting on the Phantom Cat!  
She's gotta cat-isfy everyone's expectations!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
The Phantom Cat is fighting fur everyone!  
There's nyo wrong in that!  
If something is right, why nyot do it every day!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
You really ought to try following in her pawsteps!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
If you'd pre-fur to avoid illegal acts of thievery,  
there's always requests fur watchmen  
on the notice board!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Any-meow, I'm going to get a little busy,  
so I gotta scram.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Well, cat-cha later!  
  
**Narration：**  
Taking Tamaki's advice, {player} accepts a request  
from the notice boards and goes to visit the client.  
  
**Man 1：**  
You must be the individual who agreed to offer your services  
as a watchman.  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Um, we thank you sincerely for accepting our request...  
I wish we had more to offer in terms of payment.  
  
**Man 1：**  
We received an anonymous threat from a thief  
that they would attempt to rob our house tonight...  
That is why we requested a watchman.  
  
**Woman 1：**  
But why would someone bother to threaten us...?  
  
**Man 1：**  
Indeed, we know of no one who bears a grudge  
against our family. Nor does a humble household like ours  
possess much money...  
  
**Man 1：**  
Well, there's no point in trying to make sense of it.  
Uh... Please keep us safe tonight.  
  
**Narration：**  
That night.  
  
**???：**  
Myaaahhh!  
  
**???：**  
Myeheh... I've come to rain justice on this mouse-hold,  
just like I warned them. Time to get my paws  
on their valuables!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Oh no you won't, thief.  
`Tag 3`  
**???：**  
A watchman?  
Myah?! Nyo way am I getting caught!  
  
**???：**  
Meowiee!  
Hey, quit touching me there! You purr-vert!  
  
**???：**  
Stop, wait... Pulling on my tail makes me weak in the knees...  
Th-they'll cat-ch me, at this rate!  
  
**???：**  
But there's nyot a cat in hell's chance I'm giving up!  
  
**???：**  
Urghh... Y-you gotta be kitten me. I actually got caught.  
It was as if that watchman  
could purr-ceive my moves...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Time to reveal who you are, thief.  
`Tag 4`  
**???：**  
Nyo, my mask...!  
{player}...?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
F-fur real?!  
What're you doing here?  
  
**Old Man：**  
What's with all the ruckus?  
  
**Man 2：**  
Isn't that the Phantom Cat thief everyone's talking about?  
  
**Woman 2：**  
What?  
Then the Phantom Cat tried to steal from that house?  
  
**Woman 2：**  
I can't believe it... The people who live there  
are such nice folks.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
What?  
That's im-paw-sible!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Aren't these people making money paw over fist using fishy tactics?  
I'm paw-sitive this is the place I was supposed to steal from!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
The request said so...  
Th-this has gotta be some claw-ful mistake!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Why, Tamaki?  
`Tag 5`  
**Tamaki：**  
I guess nyow you know, too, {player}.  
That's right. I am the one knyown as the Phantom Cat.  
...I didn't want you to find out about it.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
But I want you to believe me!  
I would never purr-posely go after innocent people...  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
I heard you caught the Phantom Cat.  
I'll take it from here.  
Well done.  
  
**Man 1：**  
Huh? Oh, yes, right.  
Much obliged.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myah-Myaaahhh!  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
H-hey, quit struggling!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ny-nyo...  
Myaaah...  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Whew. I'm glad they managed to arrest the thief.  
By the way, during that altercation, the knight  
dropped this paper...  
What should we do with it?  
  
**Man 1：**  
What does it say? \"Krook'd & Co\"...  
Why would a royal knight have this on hand?  
Excuse me, sir. What do you make of this?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I'd like to borrow that business card.  
`Tag 6`  
**Narration：**  
With concern for Tamaki playing on his mind,  
{player} decided to investigate the mystery  
left behind from the night's events.
