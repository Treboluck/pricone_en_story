## Subtitle: The Phantom Cat Returns
  
**Narration：**  
Prompted by Tamaki, who once defeated the villainous  
Krook'd & Co., {player} becomes a watchman  
for a house targetted by a thief.  
  
**Narration：**  
But the thief, whom he catches, turns out to be Tamaki.  
She asserts that it's a mistake, but the identity of the young  
and beautiful thief, the Phantom Cat, is exposed to the public.  
  
**Narration：**  
Tamaki is taken away by a royal knight,  
but after they leave, a business card for Krook'd & Co.  
is mysteriously found on the ground.  
  
**Man 1：**  
Hey, did you hear about the Phantom Cat?  
Rumor has it she tried to rob an innocent house  
and got caught by Nightmare...  
  
**Man 2：**  
Yeah.  
Stealing from the innocent...  
She's finally revealed her true colors.  
  
**Woman：**  
I was actually a big believer in the Phantom Cat.  
I feel betrayed...  
  
**Man 1：**  
Guess the whole \"rob from the rich, give to the poor\"  
shtick was just a ploy.  
  
**Narration：**  
That night, as talk of the disgraced thief  
spreads throughout the city—  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Tamaki.  
`Tag 1`  
**Tamaki：**  
...Huh?  
I hear a voice outside my purr-ison cell.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It sounds fur-miliar... {player}?!  
What're you doing here?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
You came to talk with me...?  
I see... You came all the way to the purr-ison  
just for that.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hey, {player}.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
After this, I may nyot be able to talk with you anymore...  
so I just want to apologize fur everything that's happened.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'm sorry for nyot telling you that I was the thief.  
And I'm sorry for dragging you into this cat-astrophe.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Everything was going so well recently,  
and I guess it got me feeling conceited as a barber's cat...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
That's why I fur-got to do enough research,  
and I nearly robbed an innocent purr-son's house...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Thinking back nyow, I'm really glad you stopped me.  
If only I had listened to you earlier and taken more  
purr-cautions...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'm really sorry...  
Moving fur-ward, it's paw-sible they'll trace my steps,  
and place you under scrutiny as well.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
But don't you worry.  
Nyo matter what happens, I'll do my best to make sure  
you don't pay fur anything I've done.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'll make it purrr-fectly clear that it was *all* my fault...  
I'll even testify at my own trial,  
so...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
So {player}, after this conversation...  
you and I need to go back to being complete strangers fur-ever.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Thank you... fur everything.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Looking back, it was always you saving my tail.  
The day we first met... when the kitten disappeared...  
even when I was busy being a thief...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hey, {player}.  
The time we spent together... I'll never fur-get it.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Thank you.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyow then, in three seconds,  
you and I will become complete strangers.  
Three, two,  
one...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Throw what you are holding against the wall.  
`Tag 2`

**Tamaki：**  
Meowr?  
Myaaahhh!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
*cough*  
Meowr!  
Wh-what in the whiskers just happened?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myah! The wall of the purr-ison...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
{player}!  
Did you come to break me out of here?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
*sniff, sniff*... Is that the smell of gunpowder?  
Don't tell me you blew up the purr-ison...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
{player}, you idiot!  
You destroyed a purr-fectly good cell wall to help me escape.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It's paw-ssible that you'll get arrested, too.  
Are you sure... it was worth it?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...What?  
Look behind me?  
Oh! Nyo way!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
This is the mansion I stole from nyot long ago...  
The mansion of Krook'd & Co.!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Then it wasn't a purr-ison?  
So that knight was one of Krook'd's underlings?  
But why would Krook'd do something so extreme...?  
  
**???：**  
Hold it right there, you two!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
*gasp*  
Well, if it isn't... Krook'd!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Krook'd, why go to such lengths?  
If it was revenge you wanted, you could've just  
purr-suaded me to come here.  
  
**Krook'd：**  
Heheh... Thank you for dropping by the other day, Miss Tamaki.  
Why go to such lengths, you ask?  
Because simply killing you will hardly satisfy my revenge!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Cat-isfy your revenge...?  
  
**Krook'd：**  
My aim was to take the new-found reputation  
you've been enjoying as the Phantom Cat and tear it to shreds.  
  
**Krook'd：**  
I figured if I left a letter for you in your request box,  
you'd get ahead of yourself and rob that poor family.  
And you did exactly that.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
You're one a-paw-llingly devious bastard!  
  
**Krook'd：**  
And yet, my dear Phantom Cat.  
There's no denying your habit of getting ahead of yourself.  
Do you really think you're cut out to be a professional thief?  
  
**Krook'd：**  
Who knows when you'll fall victim to someone like me again!  
Haaahahahah!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyo doubt, I got my whiskers  
twisted up in that little scheme of yours.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...But you see, there's something  
dif-fur-ent about me nyow.  
  
**Krook'd：**  
Something different about you...?  
What on earth do you mean?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyow I have {player} with me, standing by my side!  
I know I'm unpredictable, and I tend to nip off more than  
I can chew...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I may fur-ever be messing up on my own...  
but—!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
But if I have {player} next to me...  
That makes all the dif-fur-ence!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
And even if we *both* mess up,  
I'm purr-pared to face the jaws of hell together!  
  
**Krook'd：**  
Damn you... you little brat!  
Time to die!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Tamaki, watch out!  
**Choice: (4)**  Protect Tamaki.  
`Tag 3`  
**Tamaki：**  
I'm okay!  
Nyow then!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Krook'd：**  
Damn it!  
Out of my way, boy!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Tamaki：**  
Meow, meow, meowza!  
How do you like... this!  
  
**Krook'd：**  
Urgh! Re-release me!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyow, {player}!  
  
**Krook'd：**  
Gragh! That's im-possible...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Paw-some job, {player}.  
Looks like Krook'd has fainted.  
Nyow let's scram while we can!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh... Right, might as well!  
Wait here fur a second, {player}!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...There we go.  
Whew.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Cat-ch a load of these sacks, will ya?  
Myahah! They're paw-sitively stuffed to the brink.  
This is all the crooked money Krook'd & Co. had stashed away.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
If we scatter it around town, it'll make others happy  
while Krook'd suf-furs!  
So I'll just start—  
Oh, wait!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Is it okay... fur me to distribute the money, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Let's make a show of it!  
`Tag 6`  
**Tamaki：**  
Thanks a bunch, {player}.  
Nyow then, here goes!  
  

---  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Come on, my furry friends!  
Let's fill the streets with meow-ntains of money!  
  
**Cats：**  
Meow!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
All righty!  
Let's get this show on the road!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hear meow-t! All you folks out there!  
I am the Phantom Cat! And this is my way of making amends!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...Nyow that should do it.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Meow, meow, meowww!  
I made sure to leave an extra generous amount  
fur the house I nearly robbed!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hey, {player}!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I may be erratic, quick to pounce...  
and something of a cat-astrophe, but...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Thanks fur always putting up with me!  
  
**Narration：**  
Tamaki smiled as she said this, and the two returned to  
scattering the gold across the sleeping town.
