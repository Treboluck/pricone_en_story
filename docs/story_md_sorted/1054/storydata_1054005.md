**Narration：**  
In preparation for Carmina's debut concert,  
Tsumugi is hard at work on their stage costumes.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I can't believe we need *three* costumes...  
They got me good!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Carmina's first concert was supposed to be just  
Nozomi and Chika up on stage!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
But somehow the poster we released listed me as a third member!  
This is the worst! Nozomi totally tricked me!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Well, I *do* appreciate the opportunity to make an extra costume...  
And I guess whining will get me nowhere, so I should get to work.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Looks like I'm short on materials...  
I'll have to hire some help and go collect more.  
  
**Narration：**  
A few days later...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm here to apply for the job you listed!  
**Choice: (2)**  Hire me, please!  
`Tag 1`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Wow, I really appreciate the help~! ♪  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ugh. Why do you always show up at times like this?!

`Tag 2`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Of course! I'd be happy to!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...is what I'd say for literally anyone else!  
Why is it you again?!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Somehow it's like you're always there when I'm in trouble...  
I can't decide if you have the best timing ever or the worst...  
Not that it matters!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Still, I guess having someone around who knows my situation  
actually makes things easier.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I need to make an extra costume for our concert,  
so today we're going to catch some thread-spinning monsters.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
You can hold onto this for now. It's a cage to keep the monsters in.  
Now then, let's head out!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Now listen up, Mr. Knight.  
I can't have you going, \"Oops, I killed the monsters!\"  
instead of capturing them, got that?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Once I've got the thread I need, I'm going to release them into the wild.  
Reducing their population would only make my business more difficult.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
There they are right now...  
First, let's catch the one that's a different color.  
That's a female, so all the males will come and try to rescue it.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Mr. Knight, while you use your power to support me,  
keep an eye on the cage to make sure the monsters don't escape.  
Now, let's go!  
  

---  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
There!  
Mr. Knight! Open the cage up now!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
First, let's get that female!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
My body feels so light!  
I can move more easily, and with more power too!  
I'm glad it was Mr. Knight who showed up today!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Hiyaaaaahhhh!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Looks like the males are taking the bait!  
Let's keep it up and capture as many as we can!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
That's two! Three!  
I'm not done yet!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Isn't that enough?  
`Tag 4`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Not even close!  
The more thread I have, the better, so let's keep it up!

**Monster：**  
SHPRRRTTTTT!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Nice try!  
But you won't hit me that easily!  
  
**Monster：**  
SHPRRRTTTTT!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Whoa! Was that last one a decoy?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ngh... I can't move!  
No way...!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Urnghh!  
I'm tied up pretty tight... At this rate, I'll...!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Rush over to save Tsumugi.  
**Choice: (6)**  Try to get Tsumugi free.  
`Tag 5`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Thank you, Mr. Knight! No need to unravel these threads yet—  
just get me out of here as quickly as you can!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Owwwww! Mr. Knight! Don't pull on my legs like that!  
My head! My head's dragging on the ground!

`Tag 6`  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'm sorry... We need to hurry before they get you too,  
so could you carry me out of here like this for now?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Aaahhh! Where do you think you're grabbing?!  
A-are you a pervert?! You are, aren't you?!  
I've changed my mind! Put me down!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ahhhh! Wait, wait, wait, I didn't mean it!  
Don't take me seriously right now, just run!  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Whew... That went less smoothly than expected,  
but we did capture a few of them, so let's call it a win.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
When I was caught up in those threads,  
I kind of understood how you must feel when I tie you up...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I didn't realize it felt so suffocating and horrible...  
Mr. Knight, I... I'm sorry I tied you up back when we first met.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  That's OK. It doesn't bother me.  
**Choice: (9)**  You should take better care of yourself.  
`Tag 8`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Maybe not... but it does bother me.

`Tag 9`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Wh-why would you say that all of a sudden?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I-it's more painful watching me put myself in danger?  
  
`Tag 10`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Why is this guy always so nice to me...?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
No... He's the same way with Rei.  
I think Mr. Knight must just be nice to everyone...  
That's got to be it.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Mr. Knight! I promise I won't do anything rash like that again!  
If I get in trouble from now on, I'll ask you for help, OK?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Here—take today's payment!  
Thank you for everything you did today.  
 I'll see you later!  
  
**Narration：**  
For some reason, Tsumugi rushed away from the scene in a hurry,  
unable to look {player} in the eye.
