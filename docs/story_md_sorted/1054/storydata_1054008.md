**Narration：**  
Today, Tsumugi has left her agenda completely clear,  
taking a break from both Carmina and her tailoring work.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ahhh... This sense of freedom... It's so refreshing.  
I can do anything today!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
What kind of things do I actually do on days off, again?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I know! I'll just do something I enjoy doing!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Maybe sewing? Nah, I do that at work.  
 Let's see...  
Uhhh... Ummm... What do I like...?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I know, I like Rei! I want to see her!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Actually, it's been quite a while since the last time I saw her...  
Ahhhh... I miss you so much, my beloved Rei!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Lately I've been seeing Mr. Knight all the time instead, huh...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Hard to believe I used to think he was just  
a nasty parasite hanging around Rei...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I wonder what Mr. Knight does on his days off...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Wait, why am I thinking about *that* guy now?!  
That's all wrong! Rei is the one I like! Just Rei!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hi there, Tsumugi.  
**Choice: (2)**  What're you up to today?  
`Tag 1`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Guaahhhh! M-Mr. Knight?!  
Why do you always show up at the weirdest times...?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Actually, I was just thinking about...  
 Nothing! Nothing at all!  
You do know what \"nothing\" means, right?!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tsumugi：**  
C-can you try not to pop up out of nowhere?!  
I mean, I could use some time to prepare myself!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Huh? What's this light?  
Is someone wearing a truly dazzling outfit?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Actually, didn't this happen once... before...?

**Tsumugi：**  
Oh, I showed up too early... I'll just wait at this cafe.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Hello?  
  
**Friend：**  
I'm terribly sorry, Tsumugi.  
A friend of my father's from overseas suddenly decided to pay us a visit,  
and Father was quite insistent that I join them for lunch.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh, I see... Well, I can't keep you from your family duties.  
We can always go shopping another time!  
  
**Friend：**  
Thank you so much!  
I will make up for this at the earliest opportunity!  
Well then, good day to you!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Good day!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Lunch with a foreign guest, huh?  
Life at this fancy rich-girl school is trickier than I expected...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
It'd be a shame to head straight home,  
so I guess I could do a bit of shopping on my own...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
No, I should at least invite someone...  
But do I know anyone who'd be free right now...?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
What I wouldn't give to go shopping with Rei...  
I could dress her up in all sorts of wonderful outfits...!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ahh! These fantasies tend to go on for hours, so that can wait!  
Now who else do I know...? Who else...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Wait, I know just the guy! Someone with no life at all!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Hello there, Mr. Knight? You're free now, right?  
Yes, of course you are!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Actually, I'm super busy right now.  
**Choice: (5)**  I'm not [i]totally[/i] free...  
`Tag 4`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Nuh-uh! You hesitated for a second, so that's a lie!  
So come on—you're meeting me here! I'll send the location!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Tsumugi：**  
\"Not totally\" means you're basically free, right?  
Then get out the door and come meet me here!  
I just sent you the location!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Don't be too late, now!  
  
**Narration：**  
About half an hour later...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Mr. Knight! You're late!  
But thank you for coming like I asked!  
 The thing is...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...And that's the situation!  
So of course, you were the first person that came to mind!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
My old friends from elementary school are all busy with clubs,  
and my classmates at Orindo are all very proper young ladies,  
so it feels awkward...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
But then there's you—the perfect option!  
You can carry bags for me, and you never seem remotely busy...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Point is, you're coming with me on a shopping trip!  
I'll pick out some outfits for you too!  
You're fine with that, right? Right?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Um, I'm not so sure...  
**Choice: (8)**  Well, I suppose...  
`Tag 7`  
**Tsumugi：**  
You say that, but you came all this way already,  
so I'm sure you'll join me, right?  
I'll help you fix those fashion crimes you're committing!  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Then it's settled! Thank you very much!  
I'll do my best to drill the basics of fashion sense into you!  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Now, let's get moving! Ooh, where should we go first?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh! Mr. Knight, look over there!  
Isn't that dress the absolute cutest?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
The frills on the hem are so elaborate!  
C'mon, let's go take a closer look!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Don't tell me you're embarrassed to go in there?  
Heheh... Don't worry, it's fine!  
This store sells men's clothing as well, see?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ahhh! This is adorable! This one's great too! Ooh, I love this one!  
Sorry, can you wait here a minute while I go try them on?!

**Tsumugi：**  
Ta-daaaa! How do I look? Totally stunning?  
I do, don't I? Thanks for the honest assessment!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Well then, out of these two and the one I'm wearing,  
which do you think suits me best?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Hurry up and answer!  
 And if you say \"They're all good,\"  
I'll tie you up and drag you out of the store!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  You look gorgeous in that one.  
**Choice: (11)**  I like the simple one on the right.  
`Tag 10`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Gorgeous...?! Ohhh, you mean the clothes, not me...  
Honestly, you should think before you say these things!  
  
Jump to tag 12  
`Tag 11`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ohoh... So that's the style you're into, is it?  
I see... Iiiiinteresting.  
  
`Tag 12`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Very well, then!  
I've decided! I'll buy this one!  
  
**Staff：**  
Your girlfriend looks great in anything, doesn't she?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
G-girlfriend...?! W-w-w-we're not like that at all!  
You really think I'd go out with such a disaster?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Um, I mean... It's only his clothes that are a disaster...  
A-anyway, my heart already belongs to Rei, so...!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Mr. Knight, can't you say something as well?!  
W-we're really not like that, OK?!

`image display end`  
**Ameth：**  
Aaaand... welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That Tsumugi sure seemed to be having fun.  
I guess that's because she was with a certain someone.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Practically skipping as she walked...  
She must have really been longing to see you, huh?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I guess your job for now is to watch over her  
and see how she grows as a person.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Will she continue down that difficult path, or else...?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, if it comes down to it, I hope you'll be ready to accept her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
When you wake up, you may get to see her in another flustered frenzy.  
She always struggles to hide those feelings of hers...  
  

---  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Unnhhh... You're wrong... We're not like that at all...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ahh! Wh-where am I? Huh?  
Was all that just now a dream?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Y-you were dreaming too? Same here...  
I think we were shopping for clothes, and then...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Then someone mistook him for my boyfriend...  
...Wait, no! That was just in the dream, OK?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Could it be that I... wanted to go shopping with him on my day off?  
Just the two of us? That's why I had a...  
a dream like that?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
N-now, listen up, Mr. Knight! And make sure you don't forget it!  
My heart... My heart belongs to Rei, got that?!  
  
**Narration：**  
And with her face going redder than the reddest tomato,  
Tsumugi fled until {player} was far out of sight.
