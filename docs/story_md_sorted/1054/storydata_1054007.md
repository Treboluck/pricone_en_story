## Subtitle: My Contrary Heart!
  
**Narration：**  
Outside her store, Tsumugi is approached by an adoring fan.  
  
**Girl：**  
Tsumugi! I can't wait for your solo concert!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Thank you very much! I'll do my best!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
*sigh*... My solo concert...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Damn that Nozomi! How could she organize a solo concert without asking me?!  
And a new single for me to release, too...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
All I wanted was to be a supporting act  
to the real stars, Nozomi and Chika...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Will anyone really come just to see me perform on my own?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Me, up on stage alone? That's such a weird thought...  
I can't imagine it at all. Oh, what am I going to do...?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
*sigh*...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That was quite the deep sigh.  
**Choice: (2)**  Are you angry?  
`Tag 1`  
**Tsumugi：**  
*sigh*... Wait,  
 Mr. Knight?!  
Where did you come from?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
E-even I feel like sighing every now and again!  
I don't have my head in the clouds like you do!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'm not angry! I'm just in a bind!  
Sorry for shouting... It's nice to see you, Mr. Knight.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I know it's not good for me to look grumpy...  
But I'm really not sure what to do right now!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Aw, geez...  
Thanks to you, I'm feeling even more anxious now!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh, it's not like this is anything you can help me with, though.  
Don't worry about it. It's my own personal issue.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
The thing is, I have a solo concert coming up...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  A concert? I want to go!  
`Tag 4`  
**Tsumugi：**  
No, please don't! Wait, hold up!  
Are you leaving already?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I can't believe he just ran off...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I couldn't possibly sing those lyrics in front of Mr. Knight,  
so I really hope he doesn't come...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
And besides... If he keeps being so nice to me,  
I might be tempted... to rely on him...  
  
**Narration：**  
That evening...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
That makes two full rehearsals...  
Wow, I'm beat...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I need a break...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
*sigh*...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
My singing and dancing are OK now...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
This new song's lyrics... It was Nozomi who wrote them, right?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
A song about a girl struggling to share her real feelings...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
And she thought it was perfect for me...?  
Sometimes it feels like Nozomi is almost too perceptive...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
It's almost like she thinks I have feelings for Mr...  
No, no, that's ridiculous... Ahhh, but...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Besides, Mr. Knight already has Rei, so...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Wait, no! I have to focus on the concert!  
And I decided this song is a love song for Rei and my fans!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Yes! I'm dedicating it to everyone who supports me!  
So it's definitely not about anyone in particular...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Huh...? Someone's coming this way?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Good evening.  
`Tag 5`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Mr. Knight?! Why do you always show up so suddenly?!  
W-well, suddenly means suddenly!  
It felt sudden to me, all right?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Could it be you've been following me around?  
You'd better not try anything funny!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Do you do this to all the girls you meet?!  
Oh, you creeper! What am I going to do with you?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
You really are hopeless...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Mr. Knight... Is it OK if I talk to you about something?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Come to think of it, you helped me before  
when I wasn't sure what to do, didn't you?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Back then, I never dreamed for a moment  
that I'd end up doing a solo concert...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Now, I don't want to back out of being an idol.  
I made my decision, and I'll follow through.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
But I like to help other people shine, not take center stage myself.  
I feel like I'm already doing enough of my own work.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
So I'm not sure if it's really my place to put on a solo performance...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Your fans want to see you.  
`Tag 6`  
**Tsumugi：**  
My fans, huh...?  
Now that you mention it, I guess  
that guy we captured before was a fan of mine, too...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Maybe I have more fans than I realized...  
Did you know? It actually feels kind of good  
to have people cheer you on.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
If there really are people who'd do that for me...  
People who care about my performing...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I guess I might be able to try a little harder...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I mean, I did work hard to put this costume together!  
It would be a waste not to wear it.  
 And besides...  
  

---  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Even if I can't dance like Nozomi or sing as beautifully as Chika,  
I want to at least understand them, so I can discuss their performances  
and help them however I can.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
No matter how hard it is, that's what I need to do right now.  
To help them shine even brighter in the costumes I design,  
I can't spare any effort!  
  

---  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
There are people I want to see shine up there...  
And people who want to see me shine, too...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Anything that'll help someone shine in my costumes  
is something worth doing.  
 Even if that \"someone\" is me...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
To achieve that, I think... I can do just about anything!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Somehow I feel much more motivated now!  
All right! Let's make this solo concert a massive success!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I'm glad you're back to normal.  
`Tag 7`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Haha. Seeing me in my element makes you happy, does it?  
Then you must be satisfied now! No need to come to the concert!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
But when the day rolls around, if you're horribly bored,  
with so little to do you feel like you might drop dead from sheer tedium,  
I guess you could come and watch just a little bit!  
  
**Narration：**  
The day of the concert...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'm going to be on my own out there,  
but I know I can make this a success!  
Here we go!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Hey, everyone! Welcome to my very first solo concert!  
Thank you for coming!  
I'm gonna give it my all, so I hope you have a great time!  
  
**Fans：**  
Tsumugiiiii!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Wow, all that cheering... And the smiles of my fans...!  
It's just like Mr. Knight said...  
With all these people supporting me, I can do anything!

**Tsumugi：**  
All right, for the first song... I'd like to introduce my new single!  
  
**Fans：**  
Wooooo!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I've just gotta sing, and dance, and perform!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I don't know how this will go, but I'll give it my all!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'm ready to convey my feelings... to you!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
So I hope you're listening out there!  
  
**Fans：**  
Yeaaahhhh!  
  
**Fans：**  
Tsumugiiiiiiii!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
These people are all my fans... and they're having so much fun...  
Mr. Knight, you were right all along...  
I'm so glad I worked hard to do this!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
We're only just getting started here!  
I hope you're ready for a heck of a show!  
  
**Fans：**  
Yeeeahhhh!

`image display end`  
**Tsumugi：**  
And that's a wrap, team!  
  
**Staff：**  
Great work out there!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Whew... I'm beat...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Nicely done.  
`Tag 8`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Mr. Knight?! Ambushing the star is forbidden, you know?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'm kidding. So you actually came, huh.  
 Thank you.  
So, about today's performance... How... was it?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I was so relieved that everyone seemed to like my new song.  
You thought it was good too, right?  
 The lyrics are—  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...A-actually, forget that part! Don't say anything at all!  
Ummm... It's not like you have much in the way of taste!  
Your opinions are sure to be lame!  
  
**Narration：**  
Failing to ask {player} for his honest opinion,  
Tsumugi scrambled to cover for herself.
