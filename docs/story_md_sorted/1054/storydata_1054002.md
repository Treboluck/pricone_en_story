**Narration：**  
{player} needs some clothes mended,  
so he makes his way to Tsumugi's store.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
*sigh*...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Welcome to Tsumugi's Apparel!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh. It's you, Mr. Knight. What do you want?  
If you're here to taunt me, don't bother.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I tore these clothes during a job...  
**Choice: (2)**  You do clothing repairs, right?  
`Tag 1`  
**Tsumugi：**  
A-all right, all right!  
You don't have to shove them right in my face!

`Tag 2`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Let me have a look.  
...Oh, I can fix this up in no time.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tsumugi：**  
To be honest, I'd rather not deal with you ever again,  
but I do feel sorry for your clothes. Go on, hand them over.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Uerghh... What have you done to this thing? It's frayed and torn all over.  
Hold on a minute.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
There. That should do it.  
Try to be more careful with this in the future.  
No need for payment—just promise me you'll take care of your clothing.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
You've got a another job now?  
Wh-why should I give a flying flip about your work?  
It's none of my business!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Come on, hurry and get out of my sight! Shoo, shoo!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Arghhh, he seriously drives me crazy!  
What does Rei see in a guy like that?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
When Rei dropped by the other day, she was practically glowing.  
I'd never seen her like that before.  
How does Mr. Knight manage to have that effect on her?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Thinking about it is just making me more annoyed!  
I wish he'd mess up his job and wind up the laughingstock of the town!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...Wait, that's it!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'll set him up for an embarrassing failure,  
and when word gets around, Rei will lose her trust in him!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Talk about a foolproof plan!  
All right, work's over for today! Let's put this plan into action!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Now, where did Mr. Knight go...  
 There he is!  
I'd better get ahead of him before he leaves the city!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Past the gates, it's a straight path across the plains...  
I've gotta set something up before he arrives!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
This spot should do nicely.  
Now then...  
 Let's make this the perfect trap!  
I'll set a trip wire with this translucent thread I wove from monster fur...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
There. All ready!  
There's no way he'll see this one coming!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Now to watch and wait!  
I'll keep that nasty parasite away from my Rei!  
  
**Narration：**  
Tsumugi waits by her perfect trap for over an hour,  
but {player} is nowhere to be seen.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Where is he? He should definitely be here by now...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Could something have happened to him?  
  
A monster attack, maybe?! ...Wait, why am I worrying about him?  
Anyway, I should investigate!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
There he is!  
 Why's he all the way back here?  
Did he pass out while standing up, or what?  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Thank you kindly, young man.  
I hope my bags aren't too heavy...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
I'm so sorry I can't offer you anything in return...  
I really do appreciate it...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Who's he trying to fool with the good-guy act?!  
He's just some dirty creep with his eyes on Rei...!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
No. I know that's not true. I'm sure he really is a good guy.  
And to think I was plotting to ruin his life...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I guess... I'll clear away this trap.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Aw, man...  
What possessed me to come up with such a stupid idea?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Aaaaahhh!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Owwww...  
 What's the big idea?!  
Who dug a pitfall trap in a place like this?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...It was me, of course.  
And then I fell into my own trap like an idiot...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Are you OK?  
**Choice: (5)**  What happened to you?  
`Tag 4`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Well, do I *look* like I'm OK?!  
Whose fault do you think it is I ended up in this mess?!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Don't look at me with that genuinely worried face!  
If it weren't for you, none of this would have happened!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Tsumugi：**  
You just had to help that little old lady!  
And now I'm stuck at the bottom of my own stupid pitfall!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Why did you dig a pitfall?  
`Tag 7`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Because I... Because I didn't want to see you  
getting any closer to my Rei!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
That's the only reason! So leave me alone, why don't you?!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Help Tsumugi out of the pit.  
`Tag 8`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Weren't you listening to a word I said...?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Look at me, getting saved by the guy I was trying to sabotage...  
It's so pathetic, I want to curl up and die...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Um...! Thank you... very much.  
And, um, I'm sorry for trying to set a trap for you.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
But I'm still not letting you have Rei, you got that?!  
  
**Rei：**  
I wasn't aware I was your property to give away, Tsumugi.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
R-Rei?! Wh-why are you...?!  
  
**Rei：**  
I came to check on our friend here, since he wasn't showing up.  
And where should I find him but peering into a pit  
in the middle of the road?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
You were heading to a job with Rei...?  
Why didn't you mention that in the first place?!  
  
**Rei：**  
I hope you're ready to give a proper explanation  
for how all this happened?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...Yes. The truth is...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...And that's how I wound up in this pit.  
  
**Rei：**  
*sigh*... This young man isn't the scoundrel you imagine.  
You realize that now, right? Why did you go to such lengths?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I just couldn't bear to see you and him together, that's all!  
When you're with him... you smile like I've never seen you smile before!  
  
**Rei：**  
Wha...?! I-I don't know what you mean!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Now you're even blushing over him!  
 I can't take any of this!  
It's not fair at all!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
A monster?! Why's there a monster around here?!  
  
**Rei：**  
That's what we were sent to do today—  
take care of a nasty monster sighted in these parts.  
So this works out nicely. Back us up, Tsumugi!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'm fighting too?!  
 B-but what should I do?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Let's set a trap for the monster.  
`Tag 9`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Mr. Knight... Are you serious?  
I'm not sure if I can...  
  
**Rei：**  
That's a fine idea. The two of us will lure the monster to this spot,  
so you set up the trap, Tsumugi!  
 All right, let's move!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ahh! But, Rei...! Mr. Knight...!  
...They both trust me, even after what I did...?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Honestly! You're both far too purehearted!  
Fine, I'll do it! You just wait and see!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRUOOOGGGHHH!  
  
**Rei：**  
Tsumugi! Is the trap ready?  
{player}, power me up!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Everything's ready here! Take a couple more steps backward,  
and then jump!  
 Now!  
  
**Rei：**  
Right, here goes! Hahhh!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Come on... This has to work!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRRAAAAAOOOGGHH!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
All riiight! Rei, I'll let you do the honors!  
  
**Rei：**  
Very well!  
I'll end this in an instant! Hurricane Slash!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRRAAAAAOOOGGHH!  
  
**Rei：**  
Whew. That's the end of that.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Incredible...! You're amazing, Rei!  
And Mr. Knight, what was that weird magic you just used?!  
  
**Rei：**  
That's a special ability he possesses.  
You did well too, Tsumugi.  
Now, could you carry the monster back to town?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
This heavy monster? On my own?  
Y-you're so funny, Rei! What a joker you can be sometimes...  
  
**Rei：**  
I mean it. You need to make up for what you tried to do.  
Now, hurry up, or it'll be dark before you reach the city.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
No waaaay! Please forgive me, Rei!  
I'm sorry, Mr. Knight! I'll never do it agaaaain!  
  
**Narration：**  
Seeing Tsumugi's eyes fill with tears of desperation,  
{player} too asked Rei to let her off the hook.
