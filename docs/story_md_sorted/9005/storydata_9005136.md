*cough*... *cough*...  
My deepest apologies, my lord.  
It appears as though I have been afflicted by the monster's poison.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That's what you get for calling it \"cute\" and letting your guard down...  
Let me see.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, it doesn't look like you've breathed too much of it in.  
The insides  
of your mouth are a little swollen, so that must be where you absorbed  
most of it.  
Chew on these medicinal herbs for a while.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*munch, munch*  
Thank you very much.  
It appears as though I will come out of this mostly unscathed... *munch* Thanks to your assistance.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh please, stop being so dramatic.  
A certain \"lord\" would be pretty lonely without you, right?  
Anyway, that's a job complete!
