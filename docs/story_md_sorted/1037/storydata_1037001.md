**Tomo：**  
Ahhhh...  
This place is so quiet, I'm getting a little bored.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Well, I suppose I am only manning this counter  
while the usual assistant's on her lunch break...  
  
**Tomo：**  
So it would actually be quite awkward if any problems were to come up.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I don't think they left me here  
to actually deal with the job center's customers...  
  
**Tomo：**  
More like just to watch over the important documents  
and make sure nobody steals them.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Although, even if the royal palace has seen better days,  
I can't imagine anyone would really pick a fight with the government.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'm not achieving much just sitting here, though,  
so frankly, I'd welcome a robbery or a monster attack right now.  
  
**Tomo：**  
A little fighting would be good exercise, and pass the time too!  
  
**Tomo：**  
But of course, it's bad form to wish for conflict.  
I guess I'm still a foolish, hotheaded youth. I've got to be more careful.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hm?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oops, I let my mind wander off.  
Someone's sitting right in front of the counter...  
  
**Tomo：**  
A customer, I guess?  
I should greet him, at the very least.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hello there.  
What's your business at this job center?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Well... I suppose you must be looking for work.  
Helping people find jobs is the whole point  
of this public service, after all.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Let's see... Here are the documents you need,  
so you can go ahead and fill them out.  
If you can't actually write, you can dictate for me instead.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha.  
This country has a high literacy rate,  
but there's still the occasional person who can't read or write.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Travelers from abroad and the like.  
So you see, we offer a dictation service just in case.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Also, I should probably let you know in advance,  
but I'm not actually a full employee here,  
so I might not be able to take care of everything you need.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Well, just think of me as a sort of stopgap  
until the proper assistant gets back from her lunch break.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I should be able to handle basic questions, though.  
I did complete the training course.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha. I'm a member of a guild called Nightmare...  
Well, I'm basically a soldier in the military here.  
  
**Tomo：**  
But before I joined up, I wasn't sure what I wanted to become,  
so I tried my hand working at a variety of offices and guilds.  
  
**Tomo：**  
This job center was one of the places where I worked briefly,  
so I'm familiar with the basic procedures.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh, but I guess you don't need to hear my life story!  
Sorry about that.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I was getting so bored, I was dying for someone to talk to.  
You know, chatting is my favorite activity.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I especially enjoy teasing people who are older than me, like you! ♪  
  
**Tomo：**  
Anyway.  
...  
It looks like you really can't write, huh?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Huh, you've got amnesia, have you?  
Can't even remember how to do  
basic things like reading and writing?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hang on...  
 I feel like I heard about someone like that,  
not so long ago. Hmmm...?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh well, whatever.  
All right, I'll fill the form out for you then,  
so let's go through the questions one by one.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hope that's all right with you!  
First up, can you tell me your name?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Answer the questions properly.  
**Choice: (2)**  Play dumb.  
`Tag 1`  
**Tomo：**  
Hmm. So your name's {player}?  
You're not registered with a guild,  
and have no permanent address?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmm... In that case,  
finding work for you might be a little bit difficult.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Short-term physical labor contracts might be your best bet...  
Do you have anyone to serve as a guarantor?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Tomo：**  
Hmm.  
So your name's \"Landosol\"?  
Whoa there, now. That's this city's name, not yours!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh? Was that supposed to be a little joke?  
Haha. You're a pretty funny guy. ♪  
  
**Tomo：**  
This isn't the place for silly antics, though!  
Try to answer the questions properly, OK?  
  
**Tomo：**  
If I was off duty,  
I'd be perfectly happy to joke around with you, but...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Right, right.  
So your real name is {player}.  
That's a cute sort of name. ♪  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tomo：**  
Oh, look!  
The proper assistant is back from her break already,  
so I'll let her handle the rest.  
  
**Tomo：**  
In the end,  
all I managed to fill in was your name...  
  
**Tomo：**  
I guess that's what happens  
when I get too chatty instead of focusing on the job.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmm?  
You actually enjoyed our little chat, did you?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Are you thanking me?  
You really are a funny one, {player}.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Actually, though, I enjoyed chatting with you too.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Eheheh.  
For some reason, I feel somewhat intrigued by you, as well...  
  
**Tomo：**  
If we run into each other again,  
I hope we can have ourselves a lengthier chat! ♪
