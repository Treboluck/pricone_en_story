Tomo visits the forest to gather materials for maintaining weapons. She runs into {player}, and finds herself telling him about her daily complaints. His kindness leaves her stumbling over her words.
  
## Subtitle: Respect and Affection
  
**Tomo：**  
*sigh*...  
Somehow I feel like I'm in a rut lately.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I know it takes time to work your way up. That much I understand.  
The greatest achievements are the result of diligent day-to-day effort.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I've got to hold onto that belief  
to make it through these difficult periods.  
  
**Tomo：**  
But everything's a mess.  
I keep spacing out during training and getting chewed out by the  
instructor, or submitting reports full of careless mistakes.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I just can't seem to focus. Why is that?  
Honestly, I always thought I was pretty good  
at getting things done well.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Could it be... because of {player}, I guess?  
Ever since I met him, I haven't felt like myself.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I've spotted him around town a few times,  
but I get too nervous to actually approach him.  
  
**Tomo：**  
And when I do talk to him,  
my voice always sounds strained and awkward...  
  
**Tomo：**  
What is all this...?  
Can it really be a case of the famous \"lovesickness\"?  
  
**Tomo：**  
No, no... A musclebrained oaf like me couldn't possibly feel that way...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Urgh... This is driving me crazy.  
I'm still supposed to be investigating him,  
but I keep avoiding him instead.  
  
**Tomo：**  
This is no good.  
It's not like me at all.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hm?  
Wh-wha...? {player}!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Huh? What are you doing in this forest?  
Have I been thinking about you so much,  
I'm starting to see hallucinations?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm not a hallucination.  
**Choice: (2)**  What are [i]you[/i] doing in the forest?  
`Tag 1`  
**Tomo：**  
Wahhh!  
Hey—{player}?  
Don't touch me so suddenly!  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'm sure you were just trying to prove  
that you're not an illusion or anything...  
  
**Tomo：**  
But even so!  
You shouldn't touch a girl's body without warning.  
In some cases, that's even a crime.  
  
**Tomo：**  
As a member of Nightmare, sworn to protect the law,  
I'd hate to have to arrest you!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Tomo：**  
Huh...?  
Don't answer a question with a question!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Urgh...  
Talking to you really is a struggle.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh—I don't mean that in a bad way!  
You're just so... different from other people, somehow.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tomo：**  
At any rate.  
I came to the Mysterion Woods on a certain official mission.  
  
**Tomo：**  
That's right.  
It's a job for Nightmare, the guild I belong to.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Just a simple chore for the new recruit.  
It's nothing too important or exciting.  
  
**Tomo：**  
See, there's a plant in this forest that produces a natural  
sharpening agent. My job is to collect it using some special tools,  
and bring a supply of it back.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha.  
But of course, you've got amnesia, don't you...  
Do you even know what a sharpening agent is?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Well, to put it simply,  
it's a substance we use to polish our weapons.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I don't know what's gotten into Her Majesty lately,  
but she's been gathering a lot of military supplies to bolster our forces.  
At this point, it feels like we're ready for a full-on war.  
  
**Tomo：**  
But when you collect weapons,  
you can't just throw them in a storehouse and leave them there.  
  
**Tomo：**  
You've got to keep them all properly maintained,  
or they'll be no use when it's time to take up arms.  
  
**Tomo：**  
And that work generally falls to the low-ranking soldiers.  
In other words, newer recruits to the guild, like me.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Only thing is, Nightmare's been suffering  
from a chronic lack of funds for the past few years.  
We don't have the resources to keep all these weapons maintained.  
  
**Tomo：**  
So, well... Our only choice is to gather materials  
and make the tools for the job ourselves.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Honestly, I swear.  
When the big shots get an idea in their heads,  
it's always us at the bottom who suffer.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahaha...  
Sorry, I'm just grumbling and griping.  
  
**Tomo：**  
This kind of complaining is tantamount to criticizing the throne itself...  
So I can't really say this stuff to my guildmates.  
  
**Tomo：**  
You're about the only person  
I can really share my daily grievances with.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I know it's no fun on your end.  
Sorry, sorry.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Let's lighten the mood with some lighthearted banter.  
There's nothing like a good chat to get you feeling  
comfortable and happy.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Um... {player}?  
Why are you looking at me like that?  
  
**Tomo：**  
\"You poor thing\"? \"You've had it so rough\"? \"Hang in there\"?  
  
**Tomo：**  
W-well... Thanks.  
  
**Tomo：**  
That's pretty nice of you, to try and cheer me up.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahhhhh...  
{player} really is such a swell guy.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I like him so much...  
Um, I mean, I respect him. As a person.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Wahhh?!  
Wh-why are you leaning in so close?  
I'm not ready for a k-kiss...!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Huh? You couldn't hear what I was saying?  
  
**Tomo：**  
It's surprising how noisy the forest can be, huh.  
And when I'm with you, I can never seem to get my words out clearly...  
  
**Tomo：**  
You're asking me why?!  
I don't think I can answer that...  
Honestly, I wish I even knew the answer myself.
