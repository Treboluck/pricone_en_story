After a pleasant meal together, Tomo is caught in a bind when {player} glimpses a photo of him that she was carrying. Scrambling for an excuse, she pretends that she fell in love with him at first sight.
  
## Subtitle: Truths and Half-Lies
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahaha!  
Ahhh, that was fun!  
  
**Tomo：**  
I just couldn't stop talking!  
My whole body's glowing with energy...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Eheheh.  
 The guild I belong to, Nightmare,  
is a pretty stuffy place, and I'm still pretty new there...  
  
**Tomo：**  
So it's tough for me to chat casually with my guildmates.  
  
**Tomo：**  
As a greenhorn who's still learning the ropes,  
I'd rather not draw the wrong kind of attention, you know?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Only thing is, *not* being chatty goes against every fibre of my being...  
So I guess I've been building up a fair bit of stress.  
  
**Tomo：**  
This conversation opportunity was just what I needed  
to let it all come flooding out!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahh, that's a weight off my chest!  
I feel so light and airy, I could break out dancing in the street!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha. Actually, I'm sorry.  
Originally, I was hoping to hear more about you today...  
  
**Tomo：**  
But in the end, I didn't really let you get a word in edgewise.  
Talk about defeating my own purpose!  
 I guess that's mission failed.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Still, {player}, amnesia or no amnesia,  
you could've been a little bit more talkative yourself!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Plus, no matter what I was saying,  
you kept on acting so impressed and interested...  
  
**Tomo：**  
It made it hard to stop talking.  
I'm sorry.  
It must have been boring, listening to me go on and on.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It was fun.  
**Choice: (2)**  Sorry for not speaking up more.  
`Tag 1`  
**Tomo：**  
Really?  
Well, it's nice to hear you say that, at least.  
You really are a nice guy, {player}.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I could almost fall for you.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Yeesh, I'm hopeless.  
Getting all buddy-buddy with you  
wasn't exactly the idea...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Tomo：**  
Ahaha. No need to apologize, really!  
  
**Tomo：**  
I should've led the flow of the conversation better  
to get you to open up a little.  
  
**Tomo：**  
It's weird, though.  
Usually I'm pretty good at getting people to chat.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tomo：**  
Heheh.  
Well, it's all good.  
Not like there was any specific information I needed in a hurry.  
  
**Tomo：**  
We got to know each other a little better,  
so let's call that a success for now.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Even if I was mostly just talking your ear off,  
it's not like I learned nothing.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I got to see what subjects interest you,  
and I learned what food and drinks you like, too!  
  
**Tomo：**  
So this meal wasn't a waste.  
I'll just tell myself that and head home satisfied for today.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Heheh. I'd like it a lot if we could meet up again sometime,  
and have ourselves another chat.  
  
**Tomo：**  
As long as that's all right with you, of course.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Maybe next time, you can finally tell me a little bit more about yourself.  
  
**Tomo：**  
No need to hurry. One step at a time...  
That's the best way to reach any destination.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Well then! My place is right down here,  
so let's call this goodbye for today.  
  
**Tomo：**  
...Actually, I just noticed,  
but could it be... you came this way to walk me home?  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'm pretty sure the place you're staying  
is in the opposite direction, right?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Wow, gallantry without a word...  
I'm impressed you know how to be such a gentleman.  
  
**Tomo：**  
You really are trying to make me fall for you, huh?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmm? You were just following along  
without thinking about where we were going?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha.  
That's a cute excuse!  
  
**Tomo：**  
If you insist that's the reason,  
I suppose I can take you at your word.  
  
**Tomo：**  
But these streets are pretty dark and gloomy at night,  
so thank you for keeping me company.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I suppose for you, this wasn't so much escorting a lady  
as it was walking a little kid back home to her parents.  
  
**Tomo：**  
You've got to be quite a few years older than me, after all.  
  
**Tomo：**  
You know, I grew up in a strict martial arts dojo...  
So my parents never treated me much like a girl, or like a child.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Whether you intended to play the gentleman or not,  
I really appreciated it.  
  
**Tomo：**  
That's all.  
Well then, let's say bye-bye for real this time!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Wh-wha?  
What was that?  
  
**Tomo：**  
{player}, did you just throw something at me?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Don't do things like that out of nowhere...  
You caught me totally off guard.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I guess if you were an assassin,  
I'd be a goner right about now!  
  
**Tomo：**  
You really are full of surprises.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahh, it was all so sudden,  
I didn't even manage to catch whatever it was you threw...  
The contents are spilled all over the ground.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Wait...  
Is this my bag?  
  
**Tomo：**  
{player}... I didn't even notice  
you were carrying my bag for me too.  
You really are a natural gentleman.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Though you might want to try  
handing it over gently instead of throwing it.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Aw, geez...  
All my documents have scattered in a mess on the street...  
  
**Tomo：**  
O-oh, crap.  
There's some papers he definitely shouldn't see.  
  
**Tomo：**  
The mission briefings instructing me to investigate him,  
and the covert photo of his face attached to the initial outline...  
  
**Tomo：**  
If he sees any of that, it's all over.  
He'll get suspicious, think I'm creepy, and never talk to me again...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Nobody likes to find out someone's been  
investigating them behind their back.  
I know I'd be pretty creeped out if it happened to me.  
  
**Tomo：**  
S-sorry!  
I'll pick these up myself!  
Don't worry about me! You just head on home!  
  
**Tomo：**  
What? You couldn't possibly do that?  
You're the one who spilled them all over the ground,  
so you'll at least help gather the papers?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahhh, you're so upstanding!  
It really does come naturally to you, doesn't it?  
  
**Tomo：**  
But right now that's, uh, not ideal? I mean—  
Aargh, please don't look at that!  
  
**Tomo：**  
...  
Did you... see it?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Urgh...  
I tried to gather them all up quickly,  
but he saw the photo. The most damning evidence of all!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Wh-what now? What can I do?  
There has to be something!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Um...  
Listen, {player}...  
There's a... very good explanation for this...  
  
**Tomo：**  
That's right!  
Actually, the truth is...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ever since I first met you, {player},  
I can't get you out of my mind...  
What do they call this? Love at first sight?  
  
**Tomo：**  
That's why I found excuses  
to see you again and talk like this!  
Ahahah...  
  
**Tomo：**  
I-is this excuse a good idea?  
I feel like I'm digging a pretty crazy hole for myself...  
But I can't exactly turn back now!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Th-that's the only reason!  
So, um, don't get any funny ideas!  
  
**Tomo：**  
It's just that I'm... head-over-heels crazy about you!  
  
**Tomo：**  
I... I'm not joking!  
So it was, um... really nice to see you!  
  
**Tomo：**  
That's all!  
I-I guess I'll see you around, then!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Bye-bye!  
Until next time, {player}...!
