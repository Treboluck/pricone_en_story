**Rino：**  
Heh heh!  
That new sewing set was a sponge and a half! ♪  
A gleaningful purchase, if there ever was one!  
  
**Rino：**  
Wait, did I get that right? A sponge... A purge?  
Gleaningful doesn't sound right, either... Uhh...  
Oh well, whatever!  
  
**Rino：**  
Anyway! With this newfound power in my hands,  
I'll be able to make any sort of outfit I want!  
Which means even more cute clothes! Lots and lots of them. ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
More than worth it, if I'm being honest.  
The old set my mom gave me's pretty worn out.  
  
**Rino：**  
The needle's all rusted,  
which is bad enough on its own, but I keep pricking my fingers thanks to it.  
  
**Rino：**  
You know what they say, though. Every ground has a spider lining!  
Pricked fingers means bandages.  
Lots of bandages.  
  
**Rino：**  
I always go to the same store,  
 so the clerk noticed and got curious.  
Then when I told her about it,  
she decided to give me a little discount. Lucky! ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Bless your heart, you lovely person!  
What was her name again... Tsumugi?  
  
**Rino：**  
She's an amazing designer as it is,  
but she's also so kind!  
What a goddess...☆  
  
**Rino：**  
Yup! I'm a huge fan!  
I owe her one,  
so I'll be sure to repay her by working hard and buying some new stuff! ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Or, uh... I'll try, at least.  
Hard to ignore just how pricey the clothes there are.  
  
**Rino：**  
Ohh, but here's an idea!  
If I get really good at sewing,  
then maybe I can ask Labyrista to start selling my stuff! That'd be cool!  
  
**Rino：**  
It'd also be another source of money! It'd even make up for material costs!  
Phew, just thinking about it is getting me all giddy. ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
That said, I should finish her apron up before getting ahead of myself.  
A brand-new apron should help  
make the store more approachable. I think.  
 Maybe with a bit of luck.  
  
**Rino：**  
Her getup's definitely the biggest issue, at least.  
Crepe stores are popular by nature.  
  
**Rino：**  
So once we fix that, it'll start making money.  
And so will I! Then I can buy some good-quality fabric  
and make some nice stuff. And wear it, of course! ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
I'll dress up all nice and pretty, then woo Big Bro with my cute looks! ♪  
Though me and Big Sis Shizuru promised not to make any moves for  
now, so it'll be a while before that happens.

**Shizuru：**  
Hey, {player}!  
Look over here,  
look over here! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Can you tell? I got to try out some makeup from the store over there!  
How does it look?  
Be blunt with me. Do I look even prettier now?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I do?  
I knew it!  
Eheheh, you're so honest, {player}! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yeah!  
Don't worry,  
I'll become even prettier for your sake, {player}!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, I love you, {player}! Hey, how about we go clothes  
shopping after this?  
Don't worry, you'll be head  
over heels for me by the end of the day, {player}. ♪

**Rino：**  
Hmm...?!  
What. The.  
HECK?!  
  
**Rino：**  
I-I knew I could hear something going on nearby, but... That's…  
That's Big Sis Shizuru, isn't it? And the person she's locking arms  
with is...  
Big Bro {player}?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Wh-what are they up to? The way they're acting...  
It uh... It sure looks like they're on a date!  
Hey now! So much for not making any moves!  
  
**Rino：**  
No fair, no fair!  
Actually, that's just straight up mean!  
  
**Rino：**  
I... I've been fighting the temptation off all this time!  
Not just that!  
I've been putting tons of effort into becoming his ideal little sister!  
  
**Rino：**  
And then, when the time was right, we'd meet again! And he'd be all like  
\"Wow, you sure got a lot cuter.\"  
 That's what I was hoping for!  
I kept strong, forcing myself not to approach him when I could!  
  
**Rino：**  
I wanna be spoiled as well, but I held it in...  
B-but what about Big Sis Shizuru?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Wait,  
Shizuru's my partner!  
I should trust her a bit more!  
  
**Rino：**  
We're allies! With bonds thicker than blood!  
Scratch that, we're family!  
I gotta trust her! She'd do the same for me!  
  
**Rino：**  
Right, there has to be something going on.  
Big Sis Shizuru would never break a promise.  
She probably just bumped into him by chance!  
  
**Rino：**  
He's lost all his memories,  
so she's probably showing him around town.  
Yup, that has to be it! Oh, she's so kind.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Eheheh.  
How about we go to the theme park after this?  
We can lock arms like a lovely couple, too!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
That's not enough, though. How about a romantic dinner  
by the seaside after it? And then we can...  
Oh, my! I can't say that out loud!

`image display end`  
**Rino：**  
Wha—?! No way!  
Urgh, unbelievable!  
I dd my best to paint her in a good light, but so much for that!  
  
**Rino：**  
They're on a date, no doubt about it!  
Honestly, what's the deal here?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Actually,  
can you even call that a date?  
It's just her getting ahead of herself!  
  
**Rino：**  
More importantly, she's forgotten about our promise!  
Oh, Big Sis of mine. You really are dumb as bricks sometimes. ☆  
  
**Rino：**  
A-Anyway...  
 The guildmaster was pretty adamant  
about staying away from him for now.  
Until we're ready, at least.  
  
**Rino：**  
And that includes going on dates.  
Yup, checks out!  
  
**Rino：**  
Right, first thing's first...  
I gotta set her straight,  
then make her remember what our goal is!  
  
**Rino：**  
Thing is, though, I can't just go interrupt them myself.  
Then she'll think I got jealous  
and came to spoil her fun.  
 Can't be having that!  
  
**Rino：**  
Big Bro sure seems to be enjoying it as well,  
so the last thing I want is him thinking I'm a nuisance.  
  
**Rino：**  
Luckily for me, though, I'm an awesome archer and certified genius.  
So I'll deliver a little message to them! ☆  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, hey!  
Look over there! That store's lineup looks great.♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Woah?!  
Did something just fly past us?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hmm... Well, that sure is an arrow.  
But what's this? A letter?  
  
**Rino：**  
\"To my dearest big sister, from your loveable little sister.\"  
  
**Rino：**  
\"Alas, I must request that you call off this date right now.  
By the way, what happened to holding off for now?\"  
  
**Rino：**  
\"Worry not, I trust you.  
We can pretend today didn't happen.  
So really, stop flirting with him.\"  
  
**Rino：**  
\"You know the rule, right?  
We're not allowed to influence him right now.\"  
  
**Shizuru：**  
...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh,  
imagine that. Guess this is how they hand out flyers now, haha.  
They get points for creativity, but let's throw it away.  
  
**Rino：**  
You gotta be kidding me!  
She's going all in, isn't she?!  
Man, so much for trusting her!  
  
**Rino：**  
No can do, though!  
This date's gotta end,  
one way or another! ☆  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Wow! It sure is raining arrows and letters.  
Terrifying!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hey {player}. I need a knight to save me from these scary arrows. ♪  
So give me a nice, big hug! *squeeze* ☆  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh no she didn't!  
Th—that's it! I'm done playing nice!  
  
**Rino：**  
B-Big Sis!  
You can't just leave a sister on read like that!  
At least give me a response!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, if it isn't Rino. Funny coincidence that we're both here, isn't it?  
I hope you've been keeping well, because honestly,  
I'm probably the happiest I've ever been right now. ☆  
  
**Rino：**  
Trust me, I can tell!  
Sorry, but can we have a little chat? Like right now?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Wow, look at you being all aggressive!  
Sorry, {player}, I'll be just a minute.  
Then we can get back to it, ehehe. ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
So, what is it?  
You're looking awfully scary, you know.  
Come on, give Big Sis a nice smile. ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
A nice smile...?  
I-I dunno how you can say that after breaking our promise.  
  
**Rino：**  
Tell me,  
what's the deal here?  
I need an explanation!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, don't worry.  
It's not what it looks like.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Labyrista got in touch with me, you see.  
She said that {player} might be in a bit of a pickle.  
So it's my job to be his personal escort for the day.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
So yeah, this is a proper mission.  
I mean it, too! You can check in with her too, if you want.  
Look, I've even got the papers to prove it!  
  
**Rino：**  
Wait, really?  
This is like, totally official?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yup.  
Hey,  
how about you join me?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You know what they say, the more the merrier.  
Wait, no.  
The more people, the easier it is to deal with  
possible assassins and stuff. Yeah.  
  
**Rino：**  
Wait,  
he's got assassins going after him?!  
That's not good!  
  
**Rino：**  
O-okay, I'm in!  
For the sake of the mission,  
of course. Absolutely not because I want to go on a date with Big Bro!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yup,  
sounds good. Let's do this together.  
Also, let me say this.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
The whole date thing? I had to set things up like that.  
Think about it. He'd be super confused if I told him the truth.  
So I thought, how about I propose something that feels natural?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
And now here we are, doing stuff like we're on actual date.  
So yeah, don't worry that pretty head of yours.  
I haven't gone back on our promise. ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
If anything, this is super stressful for me.  
I've finally got some alone time with {player},  
but I can't even enjoy it since I'm on edge for potential assailants.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
So yeah, having you around would be a big help.  
I'd be able to relax, and you'd get to spend time with him.  
Sounds good, doesn't it?  
  
**Rino：**  
R-right, got it.  
Phew though, that's a big relief. ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
I don't think my poor, fragile heart could handle it, you know?  
No one wants a traitorous scumbag for a sister. ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yup.  
I'd appreciate it if you trusted me more.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
More importantly,  
we shouldn't keep {player} waiting any longer.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Leaving him alone's too dangerous,  
so let's hurry back.  
Together, that is.  ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Don't worry,  
I'll explain the situation to him.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Two birds, one stone and all that.  
Our priority is to keep him safe,  
but we can also enjoy our time together while we do it.♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Aye-aye, Big Sis!☆  
  
**Rino：**  
Ehehe.  
This'll have to do, for now.  
  
**Rino：**  
First, we need to uncover the secrets of this world.  
Once we do,  
we can have a proper reunion and date with {player}. ♪
