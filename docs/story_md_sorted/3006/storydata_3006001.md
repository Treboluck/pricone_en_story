**Rino：**  
Big Sis!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Whoa!  
Hey there, Rino! Been a while, hasn’t it?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
What have I told you about surprising people from behind, though?  
You gave me a little fright. ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hmm?  
What’s wrong?  
You should get back up before your clothes  
get dirty! ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Whoa there!  
 I can take a scolding,  
but at least think before you try and stomp on someone!  
I was THAT close to dying just now!  
  
**Rino：**  
Really now,  
what is it with you and those violent tendencies?  
Abuse is a big no-no!  
  
**Rino：**  
Also!  
Let’s not forget that punch right to the gut that you gave me! On instinct, no less!  
  
**Rino：**  
That one legit felt like it was gonna kill me!  
*cough, cough*  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Sorry, sorry.  
I figured some hoodlums were coming to snatch me away. ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
There’d be some major issues to address  
if people like that were floating around town in the middle of the day.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hey! Let’s not forget that Labyrinth  
is a super secret organization! Who knows what sort of  
feisty fiends would be willing to target us whenever, wherever!  
  
**Rino：**  
That’s no excuse to beat up your allies!  
I do get what you mean, though.  
Life is a cornfield, and all that. ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Uh, \"life is a battlefield\" is what you were looking for.  
Anyway, I think this is the spot.  
  
**Rino：**  
It's not everyday that the guildmaster calls for a meeting.  
Actually, it's been so long since we had to do  
anything that I almost forgot I'm even a part of Labyrinth. ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Same here.  
Sheesh,  
I'd appreciate it if she put in a little bit more effort.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Then again, it'll all be worth it when I'm reunited with  
my precious little brother.  
Fate tore us apart, but I'll be sure to fix that. ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Same here! I wanna see Big Bro again as well,  
so putting the effort in is a no-brainer! ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Hey-o!  
I've pinpointed her location, Big Sis! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Wow! Wouldn't expect any less of our resident archer.  
Oh, I assume she's the one running that crepe store?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Our guildmaster really does get by through selling crepes, huh?  
Who'd have thunk it?  
  
**Rino：**  
Yet behind that mask lays a deep secret!  
The friendly crepe lady is in fact, the leader of Labyrinth!  
A ridiculously overpowered swordsman and sorceress!  
  
**Rino：**  
Sounds so cool, doesn't it?  
It's right out of some fairytale! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Just a suggestion,  
but maybe don't go about saying \"Labyrinth\" out loud in public.  
We are technically a secret organization, you know.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Goodest of days.  
We got your summons, loud and clear. ♪  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Hey there, welcome!  
What'll you—  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Oh, it's just you two.  
Sorry, I forgot that  
I even called for a meeting in the first place. Oopsies! ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Say whaaat?!  
Honestly,  
some things never change. ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
More importantly.  
Is there, uh,  
any specific reason for that getup?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I'll be honest here,  
you look like you're about to storm the enemy's headquarters at any moment.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Just to be clear, we ARE a secret organization.  
Right? I'd say you're standing out just a tad too much.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Excuse the frankness, but you're a little dumb in the brain, aren't you?  
Even with that aside, no one in their right mind would deal with customers looking like that.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Aww, but it's so cool!  
You just can't beat a good dash of red!  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Then again, it's true that I ain't getting any customers!  
Ahahah.  
  
**Rino：**  
No surprises there.  
That getup's gonna scare any potential customers off.  
  
**Rino：**  
Don't forget the other important details.  
This is a popular date spot for the youngsters, too.  
Meanwhile there's you, who's the exact opposite of all that.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Well that explains a lot.  
Have to admit, it's been awfully quiet around here.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Urgh, this sucks!  
One bite! Just one bite!  
That's all they'd need to understand why my crepes are the best!  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Where did I go wrong?!  
Did I choose the wrong spot? Was it my sales approach?  
Did the local trends get the best of me?!  
  
**Labyrista：**  
No, I'm not wrong! The world itself is! My crepes should be  
flying off the shelves! Who do I blame for this injustice?!  
Our almighty God in the sky?!  
  
**Rino：**  
First thing's first, I think you should change.  
Maybe into a cute little apron or something.  
  
**Rino：**  
I'm pretty good at sewing, so how about I fix you something up?  
It'll look great on you.  
  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Oh, that'd be great!  
Sure am glad I asked you to come now. ♪  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Oh yeah, how about you bring in some customers as well?  
You know how it is,  
a cute girl always helps the masses bite. ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Umm, quick question.  
Is this all you wanted?  
If so, can I go home?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Don't forget that I just moved here.  
I'm busy enough that I'd rather, you know,  
not have my time wasted.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Oh, don't worry.  
That's just part of it, so don't scuttle off home yet.  
Ta-da! Here's a little top secret mission for you. ♪  
  
**Labyrista：**  
I need you two to get in touch with someone.  
Her name's Novem, and apparently she's got  
some connection to the mysteries surrounding this world.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
That said, she's also on the wanted list.  
That means you're on a time limit of sorts.  
Find her and bring her into our care before any other guilds catch her.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
She's a key piece to the puzzle we're trying to assemble.  
I can't stress that enough.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh?  
Color me surprised.  
I thought you might have forgot about Labyrinth's purpose already.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Well, count me in for this mission.  
First things first,  
we need information.  
Do you have any idea where she is at the moment?  
  
**Rino：**  
Wew!  
You really get in the zone when push comes to shove,  
don't you?  
  
**Rino：**  
Goes without saying that I'm in, too.  
I take it you won't be able to join us, though?  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Alas.  
I wish I could,  
but my position means I can't make any careless moves.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Much as it annoys me,  
I'm just as important a piece of this puzzle as she is.  
Talk about having your life tied to a crappy world.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Sorry, but it's all in your hands.  
It might not seem obvious, but I'm really thankful to the both of you.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, please.  
We're more than aware of your circumstances.  
So long as our goals align, we're more than willing to help out.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Eheh! Just leave it to Big Sis! ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh man, this is exciting!  
Ready or not,  
Labyrinth is about to rock!  
  
**Rino：**  
Now I'm motivated!  
Eheheh, I should do some upkeep on my bow and stock up on arrows. ♪  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Thanks,  
you two. I really mean it.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
We're going up against something far beyond us.  
The sort of enemy that, if we were alone, would crush us in an instant.  
But we're not alone.We can work together.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
If it's the gods we have to face, then let's show them  
what humans are made of. We'll unravel the strings of fate,  
unveiling the secrets this world's trying to hide.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
This mystery won't go unsolved.  
That much I swear.
