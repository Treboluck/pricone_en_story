## Subtitle: Brilliant Smile
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is staying at the village with \"New Generations.\"  
After waking up early one morning, he goes for a walk...  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh—you're awake.  
 Morning.  
What are you doing at this hour?  
  
**Rin：**  
...Oh, you just happened to wake up early?  
As for me, I was going for a run before my lessons.  
  
**Rin：**  
I like the rays of the morning sun...  
 Wait, aren't they a bit bright?  
...No, it's not the sun—why are *you* shining?!  
How does that work?! A-aaahhh!  
  

---  
  
**Narration：**  
One lazy weekend,  
{player} heads over to the shopping district...  
  
**Rin：**  
Look, I really don't think I can...  
  
**Man：**  
I'm begging you! At least take my card!  
  
**Rin：**  
Uh, are cards relevant right now?  
Listen, I'd help you if I could, but... ahhh...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Call out to Rin.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rin：**  
Huh?  
 ...Oh, you're out shopping too, huh?  
Perfect timing. Can you help me convince this guy?  
  
**Man：**  
It's like I've been telling you this whole time!  
We absolutely need your help to make this event a success!  
  
**Rin：**  
...Apparently, there's an event being held here today.  
But the idol who was supposed to appear couldn't come.  
  
**Man：**  
She got a fever and couldn't make it in time...  
Of course, I can't blame her for falling sick,  
but we've got nobody to replace her!  
  
**Rin：**  
Normally, if a performer can't make it on the day,  
I'd expect the agency to send someone to fill in...  
 Isn't there anyone?  
  
**Man：**  
Thing is, all their performers around the same age as her are busy.  
They did say they could send someone if we relax the conditions...  
  
**Man：**  
But they just don't fit the image of Cooking Idol☆Tsubaki!  
Can you believe their best offer was a pro-wrestler idol?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Even so, asking me out of nowhere seems a bit crazy...  
  
**Man：**  
It's not crazy at all! The second I saw you, my radar went DING!  
I sensed your idol aura—the hidden talent you conceal!  
  
**Man：**  
So I'm begging you! Please perform in this event!  
This is our big chance to raise awareness  
of Tsubakigaoka's new original character!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's do it. I'll help out too.  
`Tag 2`  
**Rin：**  
Hmm... I mean, I don't really mind helping,  
but something's still bugging me.  
 I'm really not sure...  
  
**Rin：**  
...I know. Can you play along with me for a bit?  
This will be easier if I introduce you as my manager.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey, mister. I'm willing to take on this role on one condition.  
The thing is, I already work as a performer for an agency.  
  
**Man：**  
Huh?! Then you really are a bona fide idol?!  
I-I'm terribly sorry...  
  
**Rin：**  
No, no. I'm still just a rookie really, so don't worry.  
This guy's my manager. We're off duty today, you see.  
  
**Rin：**  
So listen. Since I belong to an agency,  
I'd rather avoid any photographs or recordings of the performance.  
My agency probably wouldn't like it...  
  
**Rin：**  
That's why I can only do this if there are no cameras.  
My manager agrees that it should be OK in that case.  
  
**Man：**  
If that's all you ask, then by all means!  
The show begins in two hours—let me show you to the dressing room!  
  
**Rin：**  
\"Gather around, kids, and make some miracle-tasty treats with Tsubaki.  
Cooking, cooking, Tsuba-kirarin.  
The secret ingredient is a happy smile...\"  
  
**Rin：**  
...So it's like this, huh...  
Surely someone else would be a better fit than me...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm looking forward to your pro performance.  
`Tag 3`  
**Rin：**  
Hey, don't pile on the pressure!  
Still, I'd hate to disappoint the kids, so I'll give it my all.  
  
**Rin：**  
Are you sure *you're* OK?  
They kind of sweet-talked you into a costume mascot role...  
  
**Rin：**  
...You'll give it your best shot?  
 Haha. I guess that works.  
It's not like you'll have any lines, so just try to act nice and lively.  
  
**Man：**  
You two, have you got the script down pat?  
The audience should be here soon, so get your costumes ready!  
  
**Rin：**  
Understood.  
 Well then. Let's get into acting mode.  
  
**Man：**  
Okay, kiddies! Let's hear you call nice and loud!  
Ready, and... Tsubaki~!  
  
**Children：**  
Tsu-ba-ki!

Cooking, cooking, Tsuba-kirarin! ☆  
Thanks so much for coming to my cooking event today!  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Wow! Tsubaki's so cuuute!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Wave at the little girl.  
`Tag 4`  
**Girl 2：**  
Taterman! Yay! Yaaay!  
  
**Rin：**  
I hope you'll all cook with me today  
as we make some delicious pudding! ♪  
Now, kids, did you all bring your aprons?  
  
**Children：**  
Yeah!

**Rin：**  
Whew... I'm glad the event worked out all right.  
The children seemed to be having fun.  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh—don't go telling Uzuki and Mio about this, OK?  
...I bet they'd never let me hear the end of it.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Your smile was amazing back there.  
`Tag 5`  
**Rin：**  
...Well, it's like our producer always tells us.  
A smile is an idol's most important feature.  
So I want to hold on to mine wherever I go.  
  
**Rin：**  
Thanks again for all your help today.  
That mascot costume really suited you. Hee hee.

**Ameth：**  
And that's a wrap.  
Hmm... What's going on with this dream, though?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I can't figure out what it really is or where it came from.  
Those girls originally come from somewhere else, after all...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Maybe that's exactly why it seemed a bit different from usual?  
I've never dealt with cases like this before, so it's all a mystery.  
  

---  
  
**Rin：**  
...Huh? Did we fall asleep here?  
It's already evening, too...  
 Maybe these lessons are getting to me...  
  
**Rin：**  
Also, I... had a pretty weird dream.  
I can't imagine ever putting on a performance like *that*.  
  
**Rin：**  
...Still, that smile in my dream felt like just what an idol needs.  
A smile full of joy to share with everyone...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I'm sure you can do it.  
`Tag 6`  
**Rin：**  
...Yeah. Thank you. I'll find myself a smile  
that's a match for anything Uzuki or Mio can pull off.  
  
**Narration：**  
And as she told {player} those words,  
a soft smile was already spreading across Rin's face...
