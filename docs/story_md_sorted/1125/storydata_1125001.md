# Rin (IM@S CG) Episode 1
Before meeting {player}, Rin is exterminating monsters when she spots a rookie adventurer being attacked by bandits. Gallantly leaping into the fray, she defeats the attackers. Thanks to her recent efforts of this type, Rin is spoken of in whispers as the mysterious \"Violet Fencer\"...
  
## Subtitle: Violet Fencer
  
**Narration：**  
A little while before the \"New Generations\" girls  
had their fateful encounter with {player}...  
  
**Rin：**  
This... should do for preparations.  
Well then, I should get going.  
  
**Mio：**  
Oh, right.  
 It's your turn to handle a job today.  
Is this one gonna take a while?  
  
**Rin：**  
Hard to say for sure.  
It's just hunting monsters,  
 but I heard rumors that it's a nasty area,  
so it might take time if there are a lot of them.  
  
**Rin：**  
Still, I'm heading out early, so even if it takes a while,  
I expect I'll be back by around evening.  
  
**Mio：**  
Right, right.  
 Gotcha!  
Shimamu was wondering if you'd be eating out, so I'll let her know.  
  
**Rin：**  
Mm, thanks.  
I'll try to make it back promptly to enjoy Uzuki's home cooking.  
  
**Mio：**  
It'd be a shame if your portion went cold, so do your best!  
Go, go, Shiburin! Kick some monster butt! ☆  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRRRRRRRHHH...  
  
**Rin：**  
So there's... four of them. Fewer than I thought.  
Maybe this won't take so long after all...  
 Okay!  
  
**Rin：**  
Haahhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
—GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Rin：**  
Hngh! Hahhh! Yahhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
—GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Rin：**  
Whew...  
 Well, that should do it.  
  
**Rin：**  
Wasn't that a little bit too easy?  
I don't see any other monsters,  
 so what were the rumors about?  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Aaaaaaghhhhhh!  
  
**Rin：**  
...?!  
 That voice came from... this way?!  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Ngh... D-  
don't come any closer! I'll use my sword!  
  
**Bandit：**  
You're not scarin' anyone with those quaking knees!  
Ain't you a rookie?  
 It's dangerous to go alone, you know!  
  
**Rin：**  
Found them!  
But at this distance...  
 I'd better try to sneak closer.  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
I-I just came to take care of some monsters!  
If you leave now, I-I'll let you go unharmed!  
  
**Bandit：**  
Bwahahah! Let us go?!  
You think you're in a position to say that?!  
  
**Bandit Leader：**  
If you came for the monsters, we definitely can't let you go.  
It'd make our jobs more difficult if those beasts weren't at large.  
  
**Rin：**  
I see... They've been passing their crimes off as monster attacks.  
In that case, I guess my job's not done until I handle them too.  
  
**Rin：**  
...OK. This should be close enough!  
  
**Bandit：**  
Just give it up! Come with us and—  
  
**Rin：**  
Hold it right there!  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Huh?!  
  
**Bandit：**  
Wha—?!  
 Who the hell are you?!  
  
**Rin：**  
I don't introduce myself to petty criminals.  
Picking on rookie adventurers isn't a good look, you know.  
  
**Bandit Leader：**  
Oh...? You sure think a lot of yourself, girlie.  
Looks to me like we just found an extra victim.  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
F-forget about me! Just run for it!  
You can't handle these men alone!  
  
**Rin：**  
Don't worry. I've got this.  
I'm sure these cowards only attack girls who seem like easy targets.  
  
**Bandit：**  
The hell was that?! I'll bash that cheeky face of yours outta shape!  
  
**Rin：**  
...Too slow.  
 Haahhh!  
  
**Bandit：**  
Guaaarghhh?!  
  
**Bandit Leader：**  
In one strike...?!  
 D-dammit! Hey, boys! You're up!  
  
**Rin：**  
One, two... three of them.  
Aren't you ashamed, sending all these men to fight one little \"girlie\"?  
  
**Bandit Leader：**  
Shaddup! Get her! Take the girl out!  
  
**Rin：**  
Then maybe I'll try a little harder...  
 Haaahhhh!  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
All three at once...? Sh-she's strong!  
  
**Rin：**  
So? What's your plan now?  
If you surrender, I'll be happy to escort you to Nightmare HQ.  
  
**Bandit Leader：**  
Dangit... This isn't over!  
  
**Rin：**  
I thought as much.  
 You're not getting away.  
  
**Rin：**  
Tranquil breath of violet...  
Empower my blade and dispatch the foe!  
Lazuli Leo!  
  
**Bandit Leader：**  
Nguaaahhhh!  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
A \"violet\" incantation... Could this girl be...?  
  
**Rin：**  
Thank you for helping with my report to Nightmare.  
Without a witness, the process would have taken a lot longer.  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Oh, no! It's me who should be grateful!  
Thank you so much for saving me from those people!  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Um... I'd like to give you some kind of reward,  
but I don't have much on hand... I'm so sorry.  
  
**Rin：**  
Helping is its own reward.  
I really don't mind, so please don't worry.  
  
**Rin：**  
...Actually, what about the job rewards?  
Since I took care of the monsters,  
will she not get anything for her trouble?  
  
**Rin：**  
If after that whole ordeal she doesn't even get paid,  
I'll feel a little sorry for her...  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
I swear I'll repay you somehow.  
 Well then—  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh—wait a moment.  
 Here. The reward for the monster job.  
I split it equally, so it's only half, but please take it.  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Huh...?! Oh, no, I can't accept that!  
I didn't do a single thing in the end...  
  
**Rin：**  
I was only able to complete this job thanks to you.  
On my own, I might never have uncovered those bandits.  
  
**Rin：**  
We handled the job together, so it's only fair to share the rewards.  
So please. I want you to have it.  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
...  
Okay then. Thank you so much.  
I really don't know how to thank you enough...  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Oh—I know!  
Could you let me know your name, at least?  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh... I guess I never mentioned it.  
 I'm Rin.  
I hope we get to work together again sometime.  
 See you later.  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Rin... Violet...  
 I knew it! I have to tell everyone about this!  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Hey, guys! Listen to this! While I was out on a job,  
I actually got rescued by Rin the Violet Fencer!  
  
**Male Adventurer：**  
Huh? For real?!  
Did she do the incantation and everything?!  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Yeah! She chanted something about \"violet\" and took down the enemy!  
And she wasn't just strong—she was so kind, too...  
  
**Narration：**  
Rin the Violet Fencer, wielder of incredible sword skills  
and bizarrely long incantations. Unbeknownst to the girl herself,  
this mysterious figure is the talk of the town in certain circles...
