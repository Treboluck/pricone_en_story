## Subtitle: Lost in the Sweet World of Friendship
  
**Narration：**  
Lou begs {player} to take her  
shopping for sweets, which leads them to the business district.  
  
**Lou：**  
Wooo! There's so many stores here!  
But which ones sell the goods?  
  
**Lou：**  
This one?  
That one?  
Or maybe...  
down this back alley!  
  
**Lou：**  
Oh, over there?  
Ehehe. It's hard to stay on track when there's this many stores.  
  
**Lou：**  
Is this place your personal pick, {player}?  
Wow! Look at all these sweets!  
  
**Lou：**  
Some stuff reminds me of Rivenbrandt.  
Some stuff you can only find here.  
I want it all!  
  
**Lou：**  
Um, um... I want this,  
and this...  
Oh! That looks good!  
And so does that!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're going all out.  
**Choice: (2)**  You might want to hold back a little.  
`Tag 1`  
**Lou：**  
Heh heh heh. Never understimate me, my friend!  
I'm just getting started!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Lou：**  
I've barely even bought anything!  
My belly demands more!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Lou：**  
You might not know it,  
but sweets are super amazing!  
  
**Lou：**  
I can feel the energy flowing through  
me whenever I eat them!  
  
**Lou：**  
Oh! I want all of that, too!  
Chocolate, candy, caramels!  
Give me it all!  
  
**Lou：**  
But wait!  
My pocket money'll be all gone if I buy this much!  
  
**Lou：**  
...Hey, {player}.  
Can you lend me some of yours? Just a teeny, tiny bit.  
I'll pay you back!  
As quick as I can!  
  
**Lou：**  
Huh? You don't have any money on you?  
You leave it all up to Kokkoro?  
  
**Lou：**  
That's... kind of lame, you know.  
  
**Lou：**  
Oh well. I'll just have to make some sacrifices.  
Farewell, my beloved sweets...  
  
**Lou：**  
That said!  
I still got a good haul,  
so I'm satisfied!  
Let's have a sweets party when we get back!  
  
**Lou：**  
By the way, {player}.  
I actually learned a quick way back to the orphanage!  
Leave the road home to me!  
  
**Lou：**  
Hm? What's with that face?  
You don't look satsified.  
Oh! Maybe you're hungry?  
Sheesh. You're a handful, you know that?  
  
**Lou：**  
But worry not!  
I'll get us home nice and quick,  
like the dependable person I am!  
  
**Lou：**  
Come on! This way!  
  
**Lou：**  
There's a shortcut just around here!  
Hehe. I'm so cerebral, aren't I?  
  
**Lou：**  
Huh? We're veering off the main street?  
So we are.  
Okay, let's go back through that alley.  
  
**Lou：**  
Huh? You think we're getting further and further from the orphanage?  
Heh. Amateur. Just watch and learn.  
  
**Lou：**  
The real shortcut starts now,  
partner!  
Leave this to a pro.  
I'll get us to where we need to be!  
  
**Lou：**  
We're lost! Super lost!  
I'm so sorry!  
  
**Lou：**  
Urgh! Where are we, even?!  
Where's the orphanage?  
Here?  
There? Anywhere?!  
  
**Lou：**  
Actually. Is this... a farm?  
How'd we even end up here?  
  
**Lou：**  
This feels familiar, now that I think about it.  
Like when I first entered the academy.  
Or when we went out to the coast...  
  
**Lou：**  
Things kind of worked out in the end,  
but I don't remember much.  
How'd I even get back after getting lost?  
  
**Lou：**  
Hm... This is troubling.  
How do get back from here?  
  
**Man：**  
Oh?  
Is something the matter?  
  
**Lou：**  
Ohh! Do you work here, mister?!  
Please help us!  
  
**Lou：**  
We might never get back home if you abandon us here!  
Our bodies'll wither away, then we'll end up like the cows!  
Let that weigh on your conscience!  
  
**Man：**  
Wahahaha!  
Talk about an overstatement, kid. I like it!  
Where you trying to get back to, anyway?  
  
**Lou：**  
The Mysteria Academy of...  
Wait, no.  
The Sarendia Orphanage! It's close by Landosol!  
  
**Man：**  
Oh. Then it's not too far off.  
I can guide back onto the highway, if you'd like.  
  
**Lou：**  
Wow!  
You're so nice!  
Thanks!  
  
**Lou：**  
Hey, look!  
Cows!  
  
**Man：**  
I was just in the middle of milking them.  
  
**Lou：**  
Wow!  
Milking!  
I'd love to give it a shot!  
  
**Man：**  
Haha. Well, you're already here.  
Might as well go for it. Follow me.  
  
**Lou：**  
That was so,  
so fun!  
  
**Lou：**  
Oh! The people over there are carrying something!  
I wanna try that out as well!  
  
**Man：**  
That's straw they're carrying.  
Feel free to help if you want.  
It'd be a big help.  
  
**Lou：**  
Leave it to me!  
Ehehe. I've never really been to a farm before,  
but it's super duper fun!  
  
**Lou：**  
Ahhh!  
That really was fun!  
  
**Man：**  
Good to hear.  
Now then. Just follow the highway from here.  
That'll take you right to Landosol.  
  
**Lou：**  
Ehehe.  
I'm glad I got to meet such a nice person!  
I've got some sweets here. Please take one!  
  
**Man：**  
Oh? You sure?  
  
**Lou：**  
Of course!  
I really, really can't thank you enough!  
Bye-bye!  
  
**Lou：**  
Hm?  
This place seems awfully foresty.  
  
**Lou：**  
We walked pretty far, too...  
Don't tell me...  
Did we get lost again?  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Hm?  
What brings you all the way out here?  
  
**Lou：**  
Oh! We bumped into someone else!  
Now that's lucky!  
Could you tell us how to get home, miss?  
  
**Lou：**  
Thanks for showing us the way!  
We should be able to get back home now!  
  
**Lou：**  
Here! Have this!  
I got it from {player}'s favorite store,  
so it should be deliciouis!  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.  
Make sure you get home safe okay?  
  
**Lou：**  
Will do!  
You too!  
  
**Narration：**  
Even after being shown the way, however,  
Lou and {player} still  
struggle to make it back to the Sarendia Orphanage.  
  
**Lou：**  
Phew...  
Forests, mouintains, oceans...  
I'm beat after all this walking. We've been everywhere.  
  
**Lou：**  
I've been giving sweets to everyone that helps us, too.  
Now I'm down to my last one.  
  
**Lou：**  
That said, we're back at Landosol!  
Everyone always says I can do it if I try. And they were right!  
  
**Lou：**  
We're not that far off now!  
No way we can get lost!  
I'll be fine with my last sweet!  
  
**Lou：**  
Uhhh...?  
I definitely don't know where this is.  
  
**Lou：**  
This is odd.  
Did we...  
did we really get lost again?!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
You two look quite flustered.  
Are you lost, perhaps?  
  
**Lou：**  
Wow!  
Yet another nice person with nice timing!  
Excuse me. Can you tell us how to get back to the Sarendia Orphanage?  
  
**Lou：**  
We're finally back!  
That sure was a journey and a half.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Your sweets...  
`Tag 4`  
**Lou：**  
Hm?  
Oh.  
Yeah, I guess I ended up giving her the last one.  
  
**Lou：**  
But it's okay!  
I met lots and lots of nice people on the way.  
It was actually real fun!  
  
**Lou：**  
Cow milking, mushroom collecting, surfing...  
I got to experience all sorts of new stuff!  
I might be out of sweets,  
but my heart's full of satisfaction!  
  
**Lou：**  
That said, I'm pretty hungry.  
I wonder what's for dinner today?  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day...  
  
**Lou：**  
I got some pocket money from Kokkoro!  
Ehehe.  
Let's head out and buy more sweets!  
  
**Anne：**  
Wait up, Lou!  
We're coming with you!  
  
**Grea：**  
The last thing we want is you getting lost again...  
  
**Lou：**  
Oh, please. You're just being overprotective.  
I know more about Landosol now than I ever have!  
Follow me!  
  
**Anne：**  
Aaand stop!  
You should be going the opposite way!  
  
**Man：**  
Oh?  
Is that little Lou I spy over there?  
  
**Lou：**  
Hey! You're from the farm!  
Didn't think I'd see you in Landosol!  
  
**Man：**  
I'm just out on a little shopping trip.  
Glad to see you made it back home, though.  
  
**Lou：**  
I can do it if I try!  
Getting home is easy-peasy!  
  
**Man：**  
Good to hear.  
Oh, right.  
This is for you.  
  
**Lou：**  
What's this?  
Oh!  
It's candy! And it looks delicious!  
  
**Man：**  
You gave me one of your sweets the other day,  
so this is my way of returning the favor.  
  
**Lou：**  
Wow!  
Thanks so much!  
  
**Lou：**  
Hee hee!  
Delicious candy, just for me! Now that's lucky!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Well, if it isn't Lou!  
Glad to bump into you again.  
  
**Lou：**  
Oh! It's the lady that tought us the way back home!  
Hello!  
  
**Grea：**  
Wow.  
She made a lot of friends while she was gone, didn't she?  
  
**Anne：**  
Ahaha!  
That's what makes her special.  
She can get along with pretty much everyone.  
  
**Lou：**  
Hm? I'm kind of lost here,  
but I can tell I'm being praised!  
That's enough for me!  
  
**Narration：**  
Today was the story of how Lou made all sorts of friends in Landosol.
