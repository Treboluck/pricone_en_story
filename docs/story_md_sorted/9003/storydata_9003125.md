**Pecorine：**  
Ooh!  
Fancy finding some dinner around here!  
Prepare to be munched!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
She sure raced off without warning.  
However, that must be what we are after.  
The bandits, or what have you, wreaking havoc around these parts.  
  
**Karyl：**  
So we'll complete our request from the Guild Association to defeat  
the bandits by taking that thing down?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. Perhaps easier said than done. Look at that orc there.  
I feel as though there is something different about it.  
Not merely in terms of appearance, but perhaps its vigor?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It has the air of a warrior who has survived through many a battle.  
Let us keep our wits about us as we take it on.  
Have at you!
