**Pecorine：**  
Oh yeah! We won, we won!  
Just a casual total annihilation, no big deal!  
  
**Karyl：**  
What was \"casual\" about that?!  
It thumped you pretty hard!  
Did that blow knock you silly or something?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wow! I never would've expected you to worry about me like that, Karyl.  
I’m... so touched!  
I'll cherish this memory for the rest of my days!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Argh, come on!  
If you don't do something about that sickening positivity of yours,  
I swear it's gonna come back and bite you  
one day...
