**Narration：**  
{player} and Illya arrive in the city center,  
where Illya is taken aback by the bright festive decorations.  
  
**Illya：**  
Wh-what is all this?  
The city lights are more blinding than ever.  
'Tis almost as though night has turned into day!  
  
**Illya：**  
And these trinkets on the houses and trees...  
The entire city is a work of art!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm glad you like it.  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
Indeed!  
The festive season has changed much during my slumber!  
Even merely looking around is enjoyable.  
  
**Illya：**  
...Still, this is not what we came here to enjoy tonight.  
I intend to teach you how an adult enjoys the night's pleasures.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  An adult's... pleasures?  
`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
Rather than explain, perhaps I should show you.  
Look—observe those two over there.  
  
**Boyfriend：**  
Let's have a wonderful night, my sweetheart! ♪  
  
**Girlfriend：**  
Yes! I can hardly wait, darling! ♪  
  
**Illya：**  
That's the idea.  
The very picture of a man and woman enjoying this season's delights.  
Let us follow their example and—  
  
**Boyfriend：**  
We'll be together... all night long.  
  
**Girlfriend：**  
Hee hee... But of course! ♪  
  
**Illya：**  
Wha...? A-Akari had told me such tales,  
but the youth of today really say such things in public?!  
Ahh... Waahhh...?!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Something wrong?  
**Choice: (4)**  We'll be together... all night long.  
`Tag 3`  
**Illya：**  
N-n-n-nothing at all!  
I am not fazed by any indecent behavior!  
  
**Illya：**  
I-I'll have you know, as a mature woman, I'm used to such things!  
'Tis no lie! ...I-I speak the truth!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Illya：**  
...Wha—?! Wh-wh-what madness is this now?!  
Th-that sounds p... p... positively indecent!  
  
**Illya：**  
Oh...? You were simply copying him as I suggested?  
S-say so sooner, then! Of course, I am a mature woman!  
So such words do not a-a-a-affect me at all!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Illya：**  
Honestly! Those shameless deviants are a bad example!  
Yes—let us enjoy this fine evening in our own way!  
  
**Illya：**  
Let's see... First, we should have a meal together.  
Come, {player}! Guide me to an appropriate venue!  
  
**Illya：**  
Yes, this is perfect.  
Despite certain unexpected developments,  
 I've nonetheless succeeded  
in leading him to invite me out to dinner!  
  
**Illya：**  
In a restaurant, I will be able to execute my master plan  
with a minimum of embarrassment.  
  
**Illya：**  
This grand scheme that I prepared for him alone...  
I must not fail to present him with...  
 Hmm?  
  
**Illya：**  
M-minion? Where exactly are you taking me?  
There are few restaurants that way...  
 H-hey!  
D-do not pull me so roughly!  
  
**Illya：**  
...Ah, I see.  
You wish to eat at a festive market stall.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  The soup here is delicious.  
`Tag 6`  
**Illya：**  
Considering your volume of part-timing experience,  
your praise for this tomato soup inspires faith.  
  
**Illya：**  
To think he would take my suggestion of a meal  
and twist it into a scene like this...  
He truly is a difficult one to read.  
  
**Illya：**  
Well, no matter... *slurp*  
  
**Illya：**  
Ahh! Aughh!  
Th-this soup is hot!  
Wh-why is it so boiling hot?!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  A-are you OK?!  
`Tag 7`  
**Illya：**  
Urghhh... That was an ordeal...  
What fool prepared such a scalding dish?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Ah... you've shrunk...  
`Tag 8`  
**Illya：**  
I-I've done what?!  
Can it be... my shock at the soup's heat disturbed my magic flow?!  
  
**Illya：**  
I doubt it will last long...  
But this too is the soup's fault!  
Take this foul dish for yourself, minion!  
  
**Illya：**  
...Huh?  
Wh-what now? Why tug my hand?  
Hm? I should join you upon the bench?  
  
**Illya：**  
W-wait a moment.  
Why are you placing me on your lap?!  
Haven't I warned you not to treat me like a child?!  
  
**Illya：**  
Are you listening?  
Cease that blowing on the soup, and heed my...  
Hm? Blowing on the soup?  
  
**Illya：**  
C-could it be...?  
Are you planning to feed me that soup by your own hand?!  
  
**Illya：**  
I-I refuse to say \"ah\" for you!  
Here in public, such a mortifying deed is out of the question!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Say \"ah.\"  
`Tag 9`  
**Illya：**  
I-I told you, I will say no such thing!  
As a legendary vampire and esteemed Ruler of the Night,  
'twould be beneath me to...  
  
**Illya：**  
Huh...? It's delicious, so just one sip?  
Despite the harm it caused me,  
I did taste the soup just now, so I'm aware of the flavor.  
  
**Illya：**  
The rich tang of tomato...  
That enticing aroma drifting this way...  
Were it not for the heat, I would long to taste it again...  
  
**Illya：**  
...*drool*  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Say \"ah.\"  
`Tag 10`  
**Illya：**  
D-do not tempt me, minion!  
I refuse! I will never submit!  
I shall... never... never consume this delectable...  
  
**Illya：**  
...  
  
**Illya：**  
...A-ahhhh...!  
  
**Illya：**  
Urghh...  
I-I hate to admit it, but it is delicious...  
  
**Illya：**  
...Ngh! The shame!  
This minion... He thinks me no more than a child!  
  
**Illya：**  
N-now he pats me upon the head...  
 Urgh.  
Why must my body betray me at times like this...?  
  
**Illya：**  
Ah...! Th-this form!  
My magical energies are finally restored to me!  
  
**Choice: (11)**  C-can you get off now?  
`Tag 11`  
**Illya：**  
A-ah! Of course.  
I am still seated atop your lap.  
Then let me just shift...  
  
**Illya：**  
...Heheh. ♪

**Illya：**  
...Say, dear {player}.  
While I was small, you doted on me most fervently, did you not?  
  
**Illya：**  
Of course, I'm not angry!  
Far from it—I am grateful to you!  
  
**Illya：**  
So to show my thanks, I would be happy  
to give you the same treatment in return! ♪  
  
**Choice: (12)**  You're acting kind of scary...  
`Tag 12`  
**Illya：**  
Don't worry.  
I don't intend to consume your mortal blood.  
  
**Illya：**  
As I explained, I merely intend to dote on you as you did me.  
Yes... Just as you did for me,  
it is my turn to feed you this tomato soup myself! ♪  
  
**Illya：**  
Well? I can't begin until you open your mouth.  
I recall you insisted I do the same when I was the smaller, yes? ♪  
  
**Illya：**  
Say... \"ah\"! ♪  
  
**Illya：**  
Very well done.  
Let me reward you by patting your little head. ♪  
  
**Illya：**  
That should be enough payback for his behavior.  
Heheh! He always treats me like a small child,  
so I enjoy turning the tables! ♪  
  
**Girlfriend：**  
L-look...  
That couple over there... They're so daring...!  
  
**Boyfriend：**  
Y-yes... That's... quite the sight...  
  
**Illya：**  
Hm? Quite the sight...?  
  
**Boyfriend：**  
L-leaning in so close and feeding him soup by hand...  
  
**Girlfriend：**  
Even I don't think I could do that in public...  
  
**Illya：**  
Come to think of it, this situation is...  
  
![111700202.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/111700202.webp)  
**Illya：**  
...Ahhhh!  
  
**Illya：**  
M-m-m-minion!  
Get away from me at once!  
  
**Narration：**  
Illya's screams echoed through the festive market.  
And in the days that followed, a superstition emerged in the city  
that sharing this bench would bring a couple closer than ever before.
