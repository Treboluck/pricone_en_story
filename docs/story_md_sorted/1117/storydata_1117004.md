## Subtitle: A Little Holiday Miracle
  
**Narration：**  
After accidentally eating a piece of garlic-laced chicken,  
Illya's extreme aversion to garlic leaves her weaker than ever.  
{player} takes her to a quiet spot to rest on a bench.  
  
**Illya：**  
Urgh... Garlic...  
Garlic's the worst...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  A-are you OK?  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
Y-yes...  
I suppose the worst of it is past...  
'Twill not be long before I regain my true form...  
  
**Illya：**  
Urgh... To think I would so disgrace myself...  
Curse you, garlic!  
Why does such a beastly thing exist in this world...?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Pat her head and comfort her.  
`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
...Ordinarily, such childish treatment would irk me,  
but alas, in this situation,  
 this warmth is just what I need...  
  
**Illya：**  
Urgh... It pains me to let him see me like this...  
But no matter my state,  
I cannot allow today's great plan to fail!  
  
**Illya：**  
...{player}!  
About what I was saying before...  
 Huh?  
M-minion, is your body... glowing...?!

**Illya：**  
Now, townsfolk!  
I am here to sell you delicious cakes, so hand over your money!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmm... Even with my boundless charisma, it seems we can sell no more.  
Well, by this time of day,  
most people will have begun their festive parties.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Thanks for lending a hand with my work.  
`Tag 3`  
**Illya：**  
I will hear no thanks from you!  
I merely wished to see what kind of errand  
could possess you to refuse my invitation!  
  
**Illya：**  
I-it's not that I wanted to spend today with you,  
or anything of that sort!  
I-is that clear?!  
  
**Illya：**  
At any rate, {player}.  
Should you really be working so hard at this time of year?  
  
**Illya：**  
Huh...? The shop was sorely short-staffed? And needed your help?  
*sigh*... Even during the holidays, you never change...  
  
**Illya：**  
I see your reasoning, but even so, you work too hard!  
Don't you have, ah...  
a-anyone you want to spend this occasion with?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  ...O-of course I do...  
**Choice: (5)**  I'm with someone right now.  
`Tag 4`  
**Illya：**  
Hahahah! What's wrong? You seem very evasive!  
Well, I'll take pity on you and keep you company, so be thankful! ♪

`Tag 5`  
**Illya：**  
...Wha?!  
Ehmm... W-well, true. I suppose we are together...  
Y-you should be eternally grateful for the honor of my company!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Store Owner：**  
Oh—you two!  
I doubt we'll sell any more today,  
so you can close up the stall and go home!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmm...  
It seems our time selling cakes is over.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Guess I'll head home, then.  
`Tag 7`

**Illya：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Something wrong?  
`Tag 8`  
**Illya：**  
...D-do not look at me!  
S-stay like that and listen.  
  
**Illya：**  
In truth... there was  
a reason why I offered to help you today.  
  
**Illya：**  
You see... It seems you do nothing but help me,  
so I prepared a special plan to show you my gratitude.  
  
**Illya：**  
This is my grand scheme...  
To bestow on you a personal gift  
on the most special day of the year.  
  
**Illya：**  
O-originally, rather than pulling it out of nowhere,  
I had hoped to reveal it while sharing a meal or the like!  
B-but you had to insist on attending to your work instead...!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hey! I-I told you not to look this way!  
A-actually, don't lean so close!  
My face right now is... p-probably twisted in sheer embarrassment...  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Thank you.  
`Tag 9`  
**Illya：**  
...Mm.  
Well, ah... Happy holidays, I suppose...

**Ameth：**  
...I-Illya is so cuuuuute!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Wh-what a sweetheart!  
I never realized she had a side like this...  
I might be doing a 180 on her right now!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Or what, is it you that made her change?  
I mean, you spent the holidays together,  
and even received a special gift! ♪  
  
**Ameth：**  
Now, hurry on back to her!  
I'm sure \"our\" Illya is waiting for you too! ♪

**Illya：**  
...Wha—?!  
J-just a dream...  
Yet again, I find myself dreaming of him somehow...  
  
**Illya：**  
...My body seems to be large again,  
so I must deduce I was asleep for some time.  
This always is such a strange phenomenon.  
  
**Illya：**  
Still, how odd.  
To think my dream self would prepare the same great scheme  
to express my gratitude through a gift...  
  
**Illya：**  
Though of course, I will not execute it so clumsily.  
Becoming so abashed that I cannot look him in the eyes?  
And that final sheepish-sounding \"happy holidays\"? Ridiculous!  
  
**Illya：**  
I am a legendary vampire and Ruler of the Night!  
Not some excitable youth!  
I will present this to him with decorum befitting my noble status!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Oh, it's the present from my dream.  
`Tag 10`  
**Illya：**  
...Whaaaaa?!  
A-ahh... When did you awaken?!  
N-no, forget that. Did you just say \"from my dream\"...?!  
  
**Illya：**  
Did you have the same dream as me again?!  
Which means the plan I am about to execute...  
  
**Choice: (11)**  You mean your \"grand scheme\"?  
`Tag 11`  
**Illya：**  
H... he knows it all!  
Ehm, this is, ah... Oh, there's no point hesitating!  
  

---  
  
**Illya：**  
U-um... As I tried to say before,  
you have proven a fairly faithful minion to me,  
a-and I appreciate all you've done...  
  
**Illya：**  
S-so listen... A-as a legendary vampire  
and esteemed Ruler of the Night...  
This reward...  
 wait, no,  
 this expression of thanks... is for...  
  
**Illya：**  
Y-y-y-you can have this gift!  
Go on—t-take it, and be suitably grateful!  
  
**Illya：**  
...Wh-what the heck was that?!  
There wasn't a shred of dignity in that entire scene!  
  
**Illya：**  
Ahhh... Now that I've made a fool of myself,  
he will surely lose respect for me and...  
  
**Choice: (12)**  Thank you.  
`Tag 12`  
**Illya：**  
Ah...  
  
**Illya：**  
...When he directs that smile toward me,  
even in the depths of embarrassment,  
I feel an indescribable satisfaction...  
  
**Illya：**  
This feeling must explain my dream self's actions...  
Hahah... In the end, it seems I am not so different after all...  
  
**Illya：**  
...Happy holidays, minion.  
I trust you will serve me well  
 and remain by my side forever.  
  
**Narration：**  
As the city of Landosol gleamed with countless festive decorations,  
it seemed as though each colorful light  
was blessing the two of them with a magical glow.
