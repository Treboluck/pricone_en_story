**Narration：**  
{player} and Illya are out on the town for the holidays.  
As they have their fun, the night grows late,  
and for some reason Illya begins to lose her cool.  
  
**Illya：**  
I-it's already this late...?  
It appears this glorious night can only last a little longer.  
  
**Illya：**  
Ngh... At this rate, my plan will end unfulfilled!  
But it would not do to make him stay out too late...  
  
**Illya：**  
S-say, {player}!  
I have a certain proposition for—  
 Wha?!  
  
**Illya：**  
D-do not take my hand so suddenly!  
O-of course, I do not dislike it, but I need you to listen to...  
  
**Illya：**  
Wh-what now?  
Why are you closing in with that intent gaze?  
  
**Illya：**  
Wh-wh-wh-what is this?!  
What exactly is he about to do to me?!  
Can it be... a k-k-k-kiss? Surely not...?!  
  
**Illya：**  
O-out here in the city?!  
I mean, it seems not uncommon nowadays... Arghhh!  
If it's come to this, I must ready myself!  
  
**Illya：**  
...I-if this is your desire, go ahead!  
As I said initially, tonight is my reward for you.  
Whatever you do, I will accept it with noble grace...  
  
**Illya：**  
...N-now! Do what you will with me!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's go and help out.  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
O-of course...  
 Huh?  
  
**Illya：**  
Er, wait a minute.  
 Help out with what, exactly?  
W-wait, you're pulling my hand...  
 Ahh!  
I-is this...  
 another scene where I get dragged off somewhere?!  
  
**Woman：**  
Hi there, kids! This is the present handout station!  
I hope you're all good boys and girls who can line up nicely?  
  
**Children's Voices：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Woman：**  
The presents will be handed out  
by this nice lad and lady by the tree!  
There's enough for everyone, so try not to rush!  
  
**Children's Voices：**  
Okay!  
  
**Illya：**  
Of all the sudden turns,  
I didn't expect to be roped into handing out presents to children.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It looked like they were short on staff.  
`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
I see that now, but in the middle of our night together?  
A-and even after making me prepare for you-know-what?  
You bring me to a place like this? It's preposterous!  
  
**Illya：**  
...Still...  
Being unable to ignore the sight of those in need...  
It's so very like him.  
  
**Illya：**  
Well, I suppose I'll hand out presents...  
Come! Accept your gifts from the dark ruler  
who will one day conquer Landosol!  
  
**Woman：**  
Aaaand that's a wrap for the present event!  
Thank you so, so much, everyone who agreed to help out!  
  
**Woman：**  
As a small token of thanks,  
we've prepared a festive meal for you all to enjoy!  
We'll hand the food out now, so hang tight and wait, okay~? ♪  
  
**Illya：**  
Oh?  
This was volunteer work, so I did not expect compensation,  
but it seems we're to be fed!  
  
**Woman：**  
Here, this is for the nice lady!  
Your portion's coming soon, sir, so hold on a little longer!  
  
**Woman：**  
Oh, and if you can't wait,  
feel free to go over there and help yourself!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'll go and get some.  
`Tag 3`  
**Illya：**  
W-wait!  
  
**Illya：**  
L-listen... I need you to remain.  
I still have important business with you.  
  
**Illya：**  
...Much time has passed now since we met,  
and you have proven a worthy minion.  
  
**Illya：**  
Tonight's activities were my way of rewarding you for your loyalty,  
but the truth is, I have one other reward.  
  
**Illya：**  
A grand scheme that I conceived  
to express my gratitude to you in full...  
  
**Illya：**  
L-listen! And listen well!  
My grand plan's objective  
 is to give you—  
  
**Man 1：**  
Go for it! Tell him how you feel!  
  
**Illya：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Man 2：**  
A love confession from such a beauty... Ngh!  
Be still, my envious heart!  
  
**Illya：**  
Wh-wh-wh... What do you...?  
  
**Woman：**  
Oh, don't worry about us! Just keep going!  
  
**Illya：**  
This is not a public show, you foolish spectators!  
  
**Onlookers：**  
...Ahhhhh!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmph!  
A few magical snowy projectiles for you!  
Perhaps that will teach you a lesson!  
  
**Woman：**  
S-so coooold!  
Good boys and girls, don't copy her!  
  
**Illya：**  
...Honestly.  
I suppose every era has its inconsiderate dolts!  
  
**Illya：**  
Come, {player}!  
We chose the wrong location. Let us find another!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  We shouldn't waste the food...  
`Tag 4`  
**Illya：**  
Ohhh, forget the food! I'll down it in no time at all!  
Give me that chicken!  
  
**Illya：**  
I'll gobble it up and find... another...  
place to... continue... our...  
  
**Illya：**  
...Eurghhhh...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I-is something wrong?!  
`Tag 5`  
**Illya：**  
Th-this has... garlic in it...!  
  
**Illya：**  
I can't...  
I can't stand the taste of garlic!  
  
**Narration：**  
And as Illya's wails echoed into the night sky,  
{player} was forced to attend to her collapsed form.
