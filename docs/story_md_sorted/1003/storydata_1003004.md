**Narration：**  
{player} and Rei are stocking up on food  
for their upcoming training session.  
  
**Rei：**  
Erm... What was next on the list?  
You've got the list, righ—  
  
**Rei：**  
Oh no!  
Quick, follow me!  
  
**Rei：**  
Phew... We should be okay here.  
  
**Rei：**  
Sorry about that.  
A certain someone I know was passing by.  
  
**Rei：**  
Don't get the wrong idea. I'm not trying to avoid them.  
It's just... awkward if they see us together.  
  
**Rei：**  
Urgh... W-where did this light come from?!  
It's so bright!  
  
**Rei：**  
Everything's going...  
So fuzzy...

**School Girl：**  
You're of the same opinion, are you not?  
  
**Rei：**  
In terms of what happened with the committee?  
Worry not. You have nothing to feel responsible for.  
  
**Rei：**  
As for how to deal with it going forward,  
would you be willing to let me handle it?  
I'll be sure to organize everyone's input on the matter.  
  
**School Girl：**  
Goodness! That would be a  
tremendous help, indeed.  
  
**School Girl：**  
Thank you very much, Miss Shijo.  
Would you happen to be free after this, perchance?  
I, umm, would like to repay you for your help today.  
  
**Rei：**  
Oh, pay it no mind. The thought is enough.  
What's more, I have something scheduled already, I'm afraid.  
  
**School Girl：**  
Is that so?  
Very well. See you tomorrow, then.  
Good day.  
  
**Rei：**  
Good day to you, as well.  
  
**Rei：**  
Phew...  
I don't mind helping out, but that took a little longer than expected.  
It's almost time for us to meet up.  
  
**Rei：**  
Hey there. Here already? I guess that's not too surprising.  
Let's get going.  
  
**Rei：**  
About the next quest, by the way.  
Don't you think it's time we bump the difficulty up somewhat?  
  
**Rei：**  
You're much stronger than you used to be, plus  
we more or less understand what each other's next move will be.  
If anything,  
this feels like the best time to step things up.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Have I really gotten that strong?  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll protect you if anything goes wrong.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rei：**  
Hmm...  
That sounds like a genuine question.  
To which I say, you should have more confidence in yourself.  
  
**Rei：**  
If anyone can vouch for you,  
it's me.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Rei：**  
I appreciate the sentiment,  
but I'm sure those roles would be reversed if anything were to happen.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rei：**  
Either way.  
Assuming that upping the difficulty is a given,  
we need to decide on which quest to do. Plenty of them seem nice and challenging. ♪  
  
**Rei：**  
...  
Is something the matter? You've been looking a bit concerned.  
If it's that much of an issue, then we can stick to a lower difficulty for now.  
  
**Rei：**  
That's not the issue?  
What is it, then?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  It's about that conversation at the station...  
`Tag 4`  
**Rei：**  
Oh... I guess you saw us.  
  
**Rei：**  
We're from the same school,  
you see.  
As you know,  
the school I go to is a pretty prestigious one.  
That carries certain expectations with it.  
  
**Rei：**  
We're all expected to speak like that,  
even among friends.  
  
**Rei：**  
Though in my case, I'm the same at home as well.  
It's not as bad once you get used to it, but well...  
  
**Rei：**  
It's a real pain, if I'm being honest.  
The expectations and attitude at that school are just not for me.  
  
**Rei：**  
That's why I love being in Astrum so much.  
I get to be my actual self around you all.  
  
**Rei：**  
And well. That goes double when I'm with you.  
  
**Rei：**  
Uh, w-wait. That's not what I meant.  
I just let my thoughts slip ou—  
  
**Rei：**  
...  
  
**Rei：**  
A-anyway!  
Back on topic!  
Come on, give me some input on these quests!

**Ameth：**  
And there we have it. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That little episode? Think of it as a dream of sorts.  
You'll probably forget about it after you wake up,  
so no real need to worry about it for now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Actually, that reminds me.  
I completely forgot about Rei's pampered upbringing.  
Mostly thanks to how she acts around you and the others.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Man, I wouldn't mind living that life at least once.  
But well, I guess it's not all tea and roses.  
There's probably plenty of baggage that comes with it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Guess that makes sense, considering how much fun she has  
around you. She seems happy about that as well,  
so do her a favor and keep hanging out with her as usual.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, that's enough chatter for today.  
Catch you later. ♪  
  

---  
  
**Rei：**  
Hmm? Where are we...?  
Are we still in the same place as before?  
  
**Rei：**  
Seems like you fell asleep as well.  
I'm... I'm not really sure what happened there.  
I had an odd dream, too.  
  
**Rei：**  
That's right, we were both in a coffee shop together...  
Wait, did you have the same dream as me?  
  
**Rei：**  
Well then... That's kind of embarrassing, to be honest.  
It was just a dream, but I still let my household issues get to me.  
  
**Rei：**  
I dragged you along here before we collapsed, didn't I?  
All because I spotted someone I knew.  
  
**Rei：**  
As much as I hide it, I'm part of the nobility.  
If I meet anyone connected to my family, I need to act as such.  
  
**Rei：**  
I didn't want you to see that side of me.  
The fact that I can be myself around you means a lot to me.  
Moreso considering how I used to be.  
  
**Rei：**  
You saw how I spoke to people in that dream, right?  
That's how I always acted when I still lived at home.  
Always polite. Always uptight.  
  
**Rei：**  
Bizarre, isn't it?  
Or maybe... Maybe you prefer it when I speak like that?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I prefer your usual self.  
`Tag 5`  
**Rei：**  
Thank goodness... Like I said,  
I don't want to be someone I'm not when I'm around you.  
I want things to stay the way they always have.  
  
**Rei：**  
If you're willing to accept me for how I am, though, then that's perfect. Thank you.  
  
**Narration：**  
Having shared her concerns and been accepted for who she is,  
Rei couldn't help but smile from the bottom of her heart.
