**Narration：**  
A few days after {player} and Rei's duel,  
Rei asks {player} to come and meet her.  
  
**Rei：**  
Hey. Over here.  
Sorry for calling you out so suddenly.  
I felt it was about time we settled on something already, though.  
  
**Rei：**  
Settle on what, you say?  
Come on,  
don't tell me you forgot about something that important.  
  
**Rei：**  
You remember our duel, don't you?  
And most importantly, the reward you were supposed to get for winning.  
  
**Rei：**  
You still haven't given me an answer yet,  
so I decided to get things moving.  
And now that you're here, let's get someth—  
  
**Rei：**  
U-urgh!  
Where did that light come from?! It's so bright!  
  
**Rei：**  
Wait, this has happened before!  
...  
J-just what in the world is it?!

**???：**  
Hmm?  
I knew I recognized that figure. Fancy meeting you here.

**Rei：**  
Good day. Are you on a walk?  
So am I, funnily enough.  
  
**Rei：**  
You... seem awfully surprised.  
Did something other than me catch your eye?  
  
**Rei：**  
Oh, right.  
You've never met Marengo before, have you?  
He's my trusted steed.  
  
**Rei：**  
I felt like taking him for a walk,  
so here I am.  
  
**Rei：**  
That said, I did forget that most people would be surprised  
to see a horse at the park.  
It's rather ideal, though.  
Moreso when I can ride down the road on him.  
  
**Rei：**  
Are you interested, by any chance?  
If so, how about you try riding him?  
He's quite the docile one, so it shouldn't be that hard at all.  
  
**Rei：**  
Don't worry, I won't leave you on your own.  
All you need to do is sit on his back.  
I'll guide him along, nice and gently.  
  
**Rei：**  
No time like the present. Put your foot on that pedestal.  
I'll push you from behind.  
Up... you go!

**Rei：**  
Well done.  
So? How does it feel?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I sure am high up.  
**Choice: (2)**  Kind of scared it'll start running.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rei：**  
Hehe. You are on a horse, after all.  
I'm glad you're enjoying it already, though.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Rei：**  
Don't worry.  
I've got a firm hold on the reigns.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rei：**  
Whoa! H-hey, Marengo!  
Settle down!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I-I'm gonna fall!  
`Tag 4`  
**Rei：**  
Don't let go!  
You'll get hurt badly if you fall off!  
I'll calm him down!  
  
**Rei：**  
Come on, Marengo! Settle down for me!  
  
**Rei：**  
I don't get it...  
He's usually so docile. This doesn't make sense.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I can't... hold on...  
`Tag 5`  
**Rei：**  
Oh no! He's going to fall!  
  
**Rei：**  
Marengo.  
You don't plan on injuring someone dear to me, do you?  
  
**Rei：**  
There we go.  
Looks like I finally got through to you. Thank you, Marengo.  
  
**Rei：**  
You're fine as well, I assume?  
Thank goodness. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if anything ha—  
  
**Rei：**  
Ah!  
 N-no, you've got it all wrong!  
By \"dear\" I meant—!  
  
**Rei：**  
W-well. You ARE dear to me.  
But that's just as, umm, a friend...  
  
**Rei：**  
Anyway! I only said that to make Marengo calm down!  
Th-there wasn't any special meaning behind it!

**Ameth：**  
And there we have it. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Horse riding, huh? Talk about a fancy pastime.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's funny, though. She hates that lifestyle enough \"over here\"  
to leave home entirely,  
but I guess that's not the case \"over there.\"  
  
**Ameth：**  
Makes sense, though.  
She's all about her responsibilities.  
She might not like it, but she'll still get whatever's needed done.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She'll prove to be a great ally, in that regard.  
Especially in the near future.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Make no mistake, though.  
Just because she can pull it off  
doesn't mean she's not pushing herself.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Then again, she should be fine. She's got you by her side.  
Guess I shouldn't worry about it too much.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, that's enough chat for today.  
Catch you later. Byesies. ♪

**Rei：**  
Mmm... Huh?  
Did I... collapse again?  
Seems like you did the same, too.  
  
**Rei：**  
That's odd.  
We were in the middle of an important conversation, too.  
Hasn't this happened before?  
  
**Rei：**  
Err, where were we?  
Ah, that's right.  
The promise I made you. You remember it, right?  
If so, have you decided what you want yet?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I already got it.  
`Tag 6`  
**Rei：**  
You've lost me, I'm afraid.  
Hmm? You wanted me to teach you how to ride a horse?  
And I just did?  
  
**Rei：**  
Wait a minute. Did we have the same dream again?!  
Well then... And that's how you've already gotten what you wanted?  
  
**Rei：**  
Oh...  
And here I was, having steeled myself for any and all requests...  
  
**Rei：**  
Even worse, I'd have preferred to teach you in person.  
But somehow I stole that role away from myself.  
  
**Rei：**  
If horses interest you that much, though, then I see no reason  
to leave it at that. There's plenty of opportunities from here on out.  
  
**Rei：**  
For example...  
We could go riding together sometime soon. How does that sound?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Sounds fun.  
`Tag 7`  
**Rei：**  
That settles it, then!  
Let's go over our schedules, then arrange something from there!  
  
**Rei：**  
I can't wait...  
  
**Narration：**  
Rei, full of excitement over their new plans,  
couldn't hide the gleaming smile on her face.
