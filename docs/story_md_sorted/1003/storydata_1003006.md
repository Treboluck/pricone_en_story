Rei collapses from a cold during a training session with {player}. He takes care of her the entire day after carrying her home, only to collapse himself afterwards, leading Rei to repay the favor.
  
## Subtitle: A Moment of Weakness
  
**Narration：**  
{player} and Rei are training as always,  
when things suddenly take an unexpected turn.  
  
**Rei：**  
Okay, let's go!  
Hah!  
  
**Rei：**  
...Yup.  
 You're improving more and more.  
Your movements especially so.  
  
**Rei：**  
Something feels... odd, though.  
  
**Rei：**  
Oh, sorry. That's not directed at you.  
I'm talking about myself here.  
  
**Rei：**  
I haven't been as on point today for some reason.  
Something just doesn't feel right, even right now.  
  
**Rei：**  
I make sure to train everyday,  
so I can't imagine I've suddenly regressed out of nowhere.  
  
**Rei：**  
Urgh...!  
W-what in the world? Now my head's aching...  
  
**Rei：**  
This isn't good...I can...barely keep my... balance...  
  
**Rei：**  
...Where am... I...?  
Isn't this our guildhouse?  
  
**Rei：**  
Oh... Now I remember. I collapsed while we were training.  
You must have carried me back here. Thank you.  
  
**Rei：**  
I can't believe I never even noticed until I was at my limit...  
I'm such a fool, aren't I?  
  
**Rei：**  
What's going on, though?  
I thought I'd be better, but I still feel so weak.  
  
**Rei：**  
This is the first time this has ever happened, I'm sure.  
  
**Rei：**  
I've always had one priority. To better myself. To get stronger.  
Maybe that's why. Did I push myself just a bit too far?  
That's the only reason I can think of.  
  
**Rei：**  
What if this doesn't go away?  
What if... What if I'm like this forever?  
  
**Rei：**  
If that's the case, then please.  
Forget about me. Keep pushing on.  
Keep aiming for the Tower of Sol's peak, together with Hiyori and Yui.  
  
**Rei：**  
I don't want to be responsible for dragging you all down...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  We'd never abandon a comrade.  
**Choice: (2)**  Drag us down as much as you want.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rei：**  
...  
Somehow I figured you'd say that.  
You really are kind, aren't you?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Rei：**  
You have to be.  
I'm a liability now, yet you're fine with that.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rei：**  
I'm not, though. I can't forgive myself.  
So plea—  
  
**Rei：**  
*cough, cough*  
This isn't good... Not having any energy was bad enough,  
but now my entire body feels cold.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You sure it's not just a common cold?  
`Tag 4`  
**Rei：**  
A... common cold?  
  
**Rei：**  
O-oh...right.  
That makes sense, now that I think about it.  
A sore throat. Hardly any energy.  
 *cough*  
  
**Rei：**  
I've never actually caught one before.  
That explains why something felt off earlier, too.  
  
**Rei：**  
Well then. Leave it to me to overthink things.  
I, uh, got a little overdramatic. Didn't I?  
  
**Rei：**  
Err... C-can you do me a favor and forget everything I just said?  
It was just the cold talking. I wasn't in the right frame of mind.  
  
**Rei：**  
Don't worry, I'm sure I'll be fine after some proper sleep.  
I'd hate to spread it to you as well, so you should get going.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I can't just leave you alone.  
`Tag 5`  
**Rei：**  
You really are too kind for your own good,  
aren't you? I doubt anything will convince you to leave.  
  
**Rei：**  
Fine. If I can trust anyone to take care of me, it's you.  
  
**Rei：**  
*yawn* Good morning.  
As I thought, a good night's rest has me feeling better than ever.  
That and your capable nursing, of course.  
  
**Rei：**  
Hmm? You're looking rather pale.  
Wait, don't tell me—  
  
**Rei：**  
Hey! Are you okay?!  
Sheesh, what good is a nurse if they collapse?  
  
**Rei：**  
Don't worry. I value my comrades as much as you do.  
You took care of me, so now it's my turn to do the same.  
  
**Narration：**  
Rei, ever so thankful for being taken care of,  
stuck by {player}'s side until he made a full recovery.
