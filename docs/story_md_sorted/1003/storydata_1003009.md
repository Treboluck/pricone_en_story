## Subtitle: Today's Catch
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is invited by Rei  
to go fishing at the beach near the harbor.  
But Rei is acting a little awkward.  
  
**Rei：**  
...Not a bite.  
I don't get it. The weather's not bad, and the sea's rather calm...  
  
**Rei：**  
...It'll be fine. I'm sure the fish are just on the move right now.  
It's supposed to be a good tide today...  
  
**Rei：**  
So I...  
  
I'd quite like it if you could stay here with me. Even if it is a little dull...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're acting weird.  
**Choice: (2)**  Did something happen?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rei：**  
I-I don't know what you're talking about.  
There's nothing unusual about me...  
  
No, I guess there's no point hiding it from you, is there?

`Tag 2`  
**Rei：**  
...It's not easy keeping secrets from you. I was hoping to talk  
about it after putting my mind at ease with a spot of fishing...  
  
But as things are, it's not looking likely.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rei：**  
...Actually, an emissary from my father arrived the other day.  
I've been requested to conduct inspections in numerous areas as his  
representative.  
  
**Rei：**  
During the battle with Omniscient Kaiser, Landosol sustained serious  
damage. For the sake of the kingdom, reconstruction must be completed  
quickly.  
  
**Rei：**  
That said, if we prioritize reconstruction, we won't be able to maintain  
order across the land.  
Even now, we're short on workers and  
resources.  
  
**Rei：**  
So he wants to use me, his daughter, to show those around him  
that he's doing what they want, even if it's just a formality.  
  
**Rei：**  
And if possible, he'd like me to negotiate with the people who live  
outside of Landosol to see if they'll help with the reconstruction effort...  
  
Or some such purpose, I imagine.  
  
**Rei：**  
...He's a rather selfish person.  
He always expects me to do as he says, without ever considering how I  
might feel.  
  
**Rei：**  
...But I understand. I know I have to accept his request.  
  
**Rei：**  
There are many people currently suffering from the destruction  
in Landosol. He's doing all that he can for their sake.  
It's the right thing to do, wouldn't you agree?  
  
**Rei：**  
Yeah... My father's doing the right thing.  
I too must help those people, even if it's just a little.  
  
**Rei：**  
...But somewhere deep down,  
doing his bidding makes me feel uneasy.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  That's not like you.  
**Choice: (5)**  You want to help people in need.  
`Tag 4`  
**Rei：**  
It's not like me...?  
  
**Rei：**  
Maybe... Yeah, you're absolutely right.  
If I want to help people, then this is the right thing to do.  
That's reason enough to take action.

`Tag 5`  
**Rei：**  
...You're right.  
What was I even hesitating about?  
  
**Rei：**  
When I ran away from home for the first time...  
I did it because I wanted to. And it felt like the right thing to do.  
I want to help people in any way I can... and that's  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Rei：**  
...Okay, I've made up my mind.  
I'll go and do the inspections. Not for my father's sake,  
but of my own volition.  
  
**Rei：**  
I'm sure my mother and father, who think of my free spirit as nothing  
more than delusions, will see me agreeing to conduct these inspections  
and think \"We told you so.  We were right all along.\"  
  
**Rei：**  
Heheh, but I'm not delusional, I'm serious.  
I'm looking forward to the opportunity to tell them as such.  
  
**Rei：**  
...Thank you. Whenever I'm feeling lost or disheartened, you're always  
there to encourage me.  
I'm starting to wonder which of us is the actual  
master.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  You're the special one.  
**Choice: (8)**  Do you wanna be my apprentice?  
`Tag 7`  
**Rei：**  
Heheh, I'm glad you think so.  
But the student must become the master one day.  
I want you to achieve greatness I could never hope to.  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Rei：**  
Heheh... that's maybe not a bad idea.  
Under your guidance, I would surely have the chance to look at  
myself anew.  
If it ever comes to that, please take me on.  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Rei：**  
Additionally...  
I don't mean to bring this up so abruptly, but...  
  
**Rei：**  
Would you mind... coming with me to carry out my inspections?  
  
**Rei：**  
The inspections must be conducted in a small party.  
But the monsters  
outside of the city are becoming rather ferocious.  
So I have reservations  
about going alone...  
I'd feel much better with you accompanying me.  
  
**Rei：**  
Oh, but it's not like we'll be fighting the whole time.  
In fact, at worst, the monsters will only appear on the road,  
and I'll be the one taking care of them anyway.  
  
**Rei：**  
As I said before, we won't be going on horseback, but by coach instead.  
The views from the coach will be beautiful...  
And who knows, you might even find clues to your memory.  
  
**Rei：**  
So, well... How about it?  
  
**Choice: (10)**  I wanna go with you.  
`Tag 10`  
**Rei：**  
Wonderful...  
What a relief... I was worried you were going to say no.  
I don't think I've been this nervous since the time I was alone and  
surrounded by monsters.  
  
**Rei：**  
It's not every day that I get to travel with you.  
Heheh, I'm already getting excited.  
  
**Rei：**  
All right! To celebrate our upcoming trip, we have to catch a whopper  
by any means necessary. Let's give it our all...  
  
Speak of the devil!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Rei：**  
A monster?! So that thing's to blame for our poor catch!  
...Sorry, but I must ask you to leave! Haaah!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Rei：**  
It dodged my attack?!  
Well then, how about this?! Hah!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Rei：**  
Phew... That's the end of that...  
But I'm all soaked now.  
  
**Rei：**  
If we conduct an inspection at the seaside, this kind of thing might  
happen again.  
Maybe I'll take my bathing suit—  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Rei：**  
What?! There are more? With that many...  
  
Please power me up!  
  
**Choice: (11)**  You got it!  
`Tag 11`  
**Rei：**  
...Thanks!  
I'll make short work of them! Haaaah!  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Rei：**  
...Phew. That went well.  
Be that as it may, I never would've suspected there'd be this many  
monsters by the sea so close to civilization...  
  
**Rei：**  
This calls for a thorough examinati...  
Achoo!  
  
**Rei：**  
S-sorry!  
Getting wet can really do one on your body if you're not careful.  
I need to find warmth somewhere...  
  
**Choice: (12)**  Wrap your arms around Rei.  
`Tag 12`  
**Rei：**  
W-what are you doing?!  
You can't! Things like this are...  
  
**Choice: (13)**  But you looked cold...  
`Tag 13`  
**Rei：**  
You're trying to warm me up...?  
Oh, I see...  
If that's the case, then...  
thank you.  
  
**Rei：**  
But you're going to get wet too.  
Fortunately, the harbor's nearby, so I'll get warmed up there.  
You can let go now.  
  
**Rei：**  
But I guess I am happy that he hugged me...  
...W-what on earth am I thinking?!  
  
**Rei：**  
Anyway, I need to regain my composure...  
Deep breaths, Rei... deep breaths...  
  
Okay, everything's fine now.  
  
**Rei：**  
Now then, once I've warmed up, we'll return to the city and prepare  
for our trip. Regardless of the fact that we'll be taking a coach on the  
highway, we have to be prepared.  
  
**Rei：**  
Any trip with you is bound to be a lot of fun.  
I'm absolutely certain of it.  
So let's make this trip a good one.  
  
**Narration：**  
As Rei thought about the journey that awaited her and  
{player}, a smile naturally broke out across her face.
