## Subtitle: Aim for the Open Sea
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is accompanying Rei on her inspection tour.  
After finishing the inspection at the first village,  
they ride in their carriage towards the next.  
  
**Rei：**  
...All right. I guess this is how the report should go.  
  
**Rei：**  
I want to keep up the pace and head to the next village...  
But aren't you bored?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm happy to be helping you.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rei：**  
Thank you.  
That's sweet...  
but it's somewhat embarrassing.  
  
**Rei：**  
Anyway, this report is going to be a lot of work.  
I'll finish it after we arrive at the next village.  
  
**Rei：**  
Now then, let's take a break and have a light meal.  
I bought some sandwiches before we left the last village.  
Would you like to—...  
  
**Rei：**  
This light! I can't believe it appears this far from Landosol!  
Ngh... Losing consciousness...

**Rei：**  
Good day.  
I never thought I'd see you here on a day off. What luck.  
  
**Rei：**  
Are you out shopping? I'm...  
  
Well... if I have to say, I'm distracting myself, I guess.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  What's happened?  
`Tag 2`  
**Rei：**  
...My father tricked me again today.  
I thought he was just forcing me to go to lunch with him, but it turns  
out it was actually a meeting with a politician and his sons.  
  
**Rei：**  
So I fibbed about having an appointment to get to  
and managed to extract myself from the situation quickly.  
  
**Rei：**  
Having to just sit there silently feigning obedience  
is a fate worse than death, you see.  
  
**Rei：**  
Honestly, I'm so sick of how my father tries to get me to do his bidding  
in every conceivable way.  
  
**Rei：**  
...Anyway. Are you free right now?  
We shouldn't waste our chance encounter.  
Do you want to go somewhere together?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'd love to.  
**Choice: (4)**  Let's go!  
`Tag 3`  
**Rei：**  
Thank you.  
Sorry for dragging you into my business.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Rei：**  
I-I didn't think you'd be this happy.  
But... I think I understand how you feel.  
The thought of going out with you gets me all excited too.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Rei：**  
Then how about we go somewhere a little far?  
I want to see the sea with you again. Sound good?

**Rei：**  
Hardly a wave in sight...  
Heheh.  
We finally made it to the sea together.  
  
**Rei：**  
The breeze is so nice...  
If only I had my fishing gear—...  
Ah!  
  
**Rei：**  
...Argh.  
I did think the breeze felt good, but it's actually a bit strong.  
Is my hair all messed up?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  It looks fine.  
**Choice: (7)**  It's cute.  
`Tag 6`  
**Rei：**  
Really? Thank goodness.  
I don't want to look like a train wreck around you.  
  
Jump to tag 8  
`Tag 7`  
**Rei：**  
...What?!  
Y-you know, you shouldn't tease people like that.  
  
`Tag 8`  
**Rei：**  
Look. The sea is so wide and free...  
  
**Rei：**  
...\"No child of mine will be ridiculed as a hereditary politician.\"  
My whole life I've been subject to this mantra of my father's.  
  
**Rei：**  
Education, school, friendships... even my own will.  
There wasn't one thing I could say I'd ever chosen for myself.  
I was nothing more than a fish in an aquarium.  
  
**Rei：**  
But now I'm different. Astrum—the world that I chose to enter—  
and all the friends that I've made there have changed me.  
  
**Rei：**  
And more than anything, I want to cherish these bonds.  
My friends are there for me.  
That alone gives me the courage to live by  
my own will.  
  
**Rei：**  
Even just a little at a time. I'll resist and resist...  
until the day  
I'm finally able to live in a world as free as this great ocean...!  
  
**Rei：**  
...Well, if I were a freshwater fish,  
I'd die the instant I entered the ocean, though.  
  
**Rei：**  
But I wouldn't mind if that happened. Because it wouldn't be a result  
that was chosen for me by my parents, but one I that chose for myself...  
  
**Choice: (9)**  You can't die!  
`Tag 9`  
**Rei：**  
Oh... sorry. Don't worry, I'm not really going to die.  
I'm just telling you how far I'm willing to go.  
  
**Rei：**  
But if there ever really is a situation where it looks like I might die,  
if you're there with me like you are today,  
I know that, no matter what happens, I'll live on...  
  
**Rei：**  
It's not like I'd want you to get caught up in it, though.  
It's just... having you by my side gives me strength.  
  
**Choice: (10)**  I'm always here for you.  
`Tag 10`  
![100301102.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/100301102.webp)  
**Rei：**  
...Thank you.  
I've always known you would help if I asked,  
but I'm really happy to hear you say it.  
  
**Rei：**  
Oh yeah... If I'm ever disowned by my father, I think I'll crash at your  
place.  
Oh, of course I'll help with the chores, so don't worry about that.  
  
**Choice: (11)**  Huh?!  
`Tag 11`  
**Rei：**  
Heheh... I'm just joking.  
No matter how much I'd like to, I don't think I'll ever have the drive to go  
that far.  
  
**Rei：**  
That's how much I'm willing to rely on you.  
...And I hope I can continue to do so. Thanks for today.

**Ameth：**  
Well, isn't it nice to see me again?  
Wow... a date by the sea? Who knew you had it in you?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, it would seem you're slowly chipping away at Rei's tough  
exterior and exposing her soft underside.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Keep up the good work!  
...  
Or so I'd like to say, but there are still large obstacles on the road  
ahead for her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
For little fishy Rei to make it to the great ocean of freedom, you have to  
stay by her side.  
With you there to support her, I'm sure she can swim  
anywhere she wants to go.

**Rei：**  
...This is...  
I thought I saw that light, and then I lost consciousness...  
  
**Rei：**  
Oh, that's right! What about...  
Oh, good, he's just sleeping.  
  
**Rei：**  
...I know it happened suddenly, but I can't believe I fell asleep on his shoulder...  
  
I guess I was too relaxed.  
  
**Rei：**  
...Heheh, he looks so happy.  
Seeing his resting face somehow makes me feel sleepy...  
  
**Rei：**  
...But really, you're a wonder, you know.  
  
**Rei：**  
Just by being at your side... or by looking at your face...  
no matter what difficulties I may endure, my heart will remain calm...  
  
**Rei：**  
You really are a wonder...Truly.  
  
**Narration：**  
Enveloped in tranquility, Rei borrowed {player}'s  
shoulder and fell asleep once again.
