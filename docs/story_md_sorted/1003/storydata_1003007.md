# Rei Episode 7
Rei challenges {player} to get one hit in on her before the sun sets. He succeeds, but only by abandoning any intent to protect himself. Though the strategy itself upsets her, she finds herself delighted by his growth.
  
## Subtitle: Before the Sun Sets
  
**Narration：**  
{player} and Rei are in the middle of training as usual,  
but today things turn out to be a little bit different...  
  
**Rei：**  
Training's all well and good, but there's little point  
in doing the same routine over and over.  
How about we change things up a little bit?  
  
**Rei：**  
That begs the question of what to do, though.  
...  
Oh, how about this?  
  
**Rei：**  
Try and land one proper hit on me. I'll give you until sunset.  
If you manage that, then I'll listen to one request from you.  
  
**Rei：**  
Can't hurt to give you a little motivation boost,  
can it?  
  
**Rei：**  
What's that? You don't think you can manage it?  
  
**Rei：**  
Well, I do understand where you're coming from.  
You wouldn't stand a chance if I went all-out.  
  
**Rei：**  
How about this, then?  
I won't retaliate at all.  
I'll focus purely on blocking and evasion, nothing else.  
  
**Rei：**  
That's fair, wouldn't you say?  
Though I'm more than confident in my ability to pull through.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'll give it a shot.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rei：**  
Heh. That's what I like to hear.  
Right then. Let's get started.  
Give me your best shot!  
  
**Rei：**  
Hah! Hyah! Yah!  
  
**Rei：**  
You won't get anywhere with strikes like those.  
Keep your focus, or else—  
  
**Rei：**  
See? Your back ends up wide open.  
  
**Rei：**  
I'm not allowed to retaliate, of course,  
but it'd be over already if I could.  
  
**Rei：**  
...  
Splendid. The difference in skill between us is like night and day,  
but that expression tells me you're far from giving up.  
That sort of determination is more important than you'd think.  
  
**Rei：**  
Enough talk, though. Let's get back to it!  
  
**Rei：**  
The sun's almost set.  
This isn't the best you've got, is it?  
  
**Rei：**  
You haven't even came close to landing a hit.  
Is this really how you want it to end?  
  
**Rei：**  
I respect your tenacity,  
but let me be honest here.  
You'll never manage at this rate. Not unless you change things up.  
  
**Rei：**  
There's not much time left, so this is your last chance.  
Come on, show me what you're made of!  
  
**Rei：**  
Wow!  
This is the most vigor you've shown all day!  
  
**Rei：**  
That's not all, though.  
You're a lot more relentless, too.  
  
**Rei：**  
That's it. You're not making any attempt to protect yourself.  
  
**Rei：**  
Abandoning defense in favor of pure offense...  
You've thought it through, at least.  
That won't be enough, though!  
  
**Rei：**  
All that momentum has to go somewhere when deflected!  
And that leaves you ripe for the picking!  
  
**Rei：**  
Uh-oh!  
I forgot I wasn't meant to retaliate!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Got you!  
`Tag 2`  
**Rei：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Rei：**  
Oh.  
You... You did indeed get me.  
  
**Rei：**  
Congratulations.  
That last attack was the clincher, I'd say.  
You put so much into it that I was forced to retaliate.  
  
**Rei：**  
Yeah. You've definitely come a long way.  
  
**Rei：**  
That said. While it might have worked out here,  
brute-forcing like that is no real strategy at all.  
If you keep that up, things will take a turn for the worse soon enough.  
  
**Rei：**  
No victory is worth the cost of losing those important to me.  
You especially.  
  
**Rei：**  
If anything were to happen to you, I...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'll be careful from now on.  
`Tag 3`  
**Rei：**  
Hmm...  
I guess I can forgive you.  
  
**Rei：**  
A good boy that reflects on his actions deserves a treat,  
wouldn't you say?  
  
**Rei：**  
As promised, I'll listen to any request you have.  
Is there anything you'd like me to do for you?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Let me get my list out.  
**Choice: (5)**  Nope.  
`Tag 4`  
**Rei：**  
Uh-oh.  
Now you've got me a bit worried.  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Rei：**  
Then it wouldn't be much of a reward, would it?  
There has to be something.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Rei：**  
Feel free to take your time, I guess.  
You worked hard for it,  
so there'd be no sense in wasting it.  
  
**Rei：**  
I did give you a handicap, but landing a hit on me is still  
an impressive feat.  
You really have gotten a lot stronger.  
  
**Rei：**  
I've got high hopes for you.  
In fact, I'd say we're almost at the stage where I can  
rely on you to have my back.  
  
**Rei：**  
Now then. It's about time we make our way back.  
Are you free after this, by any chance?  
  
**Rei：**  
You're always working hard,  
so me, Hiyori and Yui planned to take you out for a meal.  
  
**Narration：**  
With the promise of a delicious meal in the near future,  
{player} and Rei slowly made their way back to town.
