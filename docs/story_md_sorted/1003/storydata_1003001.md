## Subtitle: A Reliable Teacher
  
**Narration：**  
Rei, as part of her routine training,  
has made her way to the forest near town.  
  
**Rei：**  
Hah!  
  
**Monster：**  
Rrrrghhhhh!  
  
**Rei：**  
There we go. These monsters should be a good warm-up.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH!  
  
**Rei：**  
More of them?  
Wait.  
  
**Rei：**  
Someone's over there...  
Wait, I know that figure!  
  
**Rei：**  
Well, look who it is.  
What brings you here?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Monster hunting.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rei：**  
On your own?  
The monsters here aren't that strong, but still...  
Oh well. I'm sure you can manage.  
  
**Rei：**  
Me? No, this isn't for work.  
I like to keep my skills in check, so this is part of my training.  
  
**Rei：**  
You're more than welcome to do your work here,  
but promise you won't disturb me.  
Okay?  
  
**Monster：**  
GGGRRAAAAGHHHH!  
  
**Rei：**  
Ah, there it is.  
Sorry, but I'll be taking this one! See you later, maybe!  
  
**Rei：**  
Take this! Hah!  
  
**Monster：**  
Rrrrghhhhh!  
  
**Rei：**  
Okay. Rather good so far.  
Going a bit further in feels like the righ—  
  
**Monster：**  
GGGRRAAAAGHHHH!  
  
**Rei：**  
Looks like he found himself a monster as well.  
Now that he's here, I might as well see how he performs.  
  
**Rei：**  
Hmm... That one's rather weak, even for this area.  
He shouldn't have any issue with it.  
  
**Rei：**  
Its movements are dull, too. Now's his cha—  
Why wouldn't you attack there...?  
  
**Rei：**  
Oh no! Here comes the counterattack!  
But he should be able to dodge i—  
  
**Rei：**  
Argh! This is driving me crazy! Yah!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH!  
  
**Rei：**  
Don't even think about it!  
Are you okay, {player}?  
Let me help out!  
  
**Rei：**  
Sorry. I tried to mind my own business,  
but I never would have been able to focus with the way you're fighting.  
  
**Rei：**  
That said, it's up to you to finish this job. I can't do it for you.  
What I can do, though, is give you proper instructions.  
So follow them closely.  
  
**Rei：**  
This monster, for example, leaves itself wide open after attacking.  
Dodge it first, then counterattack.  
Understood?  
  
**Rei：**  
Pay close attention to it... Now!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Dodge, then counter.  
`Tag 2`  
**Monster：**  
Rrrrghhhhh!  
  
**Rei：**  
Well done! That was a lot better than expected.  
I only gave you some simple advice, but you followed it perfectly.  
You might be more adept at this than you think.  
  
**Rei：**  
Now then. On to the next one!  
  
**Rei：**  
Phew... That's the last of them.  
The sun's starting to set, so we should make our way back.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Sorry for using up your time.  
**Choice: (4)**  Thanks for helping me out.  
`Tag 3`  
**Rei：**  
No need to apologize.  
If anything, it was a nice chance to go back to basics.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Rei：**  
I only gave you some advice here and there.  
No need to thank me.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Rei：**  
On the flip side, I'd say this was a valuable experience for you.  
You've already made leaps and bounds.  
  
**Rei：**  
And like I said, you seem more adept at this than I thought.  
You'll become quite the capable fighter with further training.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Would you be willing to do that?  
`Tag 6`  
**Rei：**  
Hmm, I'm not sure.  
...  
Hehe. Just kidding.  
Very well. I'll gladly help out.  
  
**Rei：**  
We're both aiming for the Tower of Sol's peak.  
It only makes sense to help you brush up your skills.  
  
**Rei：**  
Did I say something funny?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  That smile was really cute.  
`Tag 7`  
**Rei：**  
D-don't tease people like that!  
Really now. You ought to learn a thing or two about delicacy.  
  
**Rei：**  
It's not every day that someone compliments me on my smile.  
But, well... Hearing it from you is hardly worth complaining about.  
  
**Rei：**  
Either way. If you want to be a proper knight,  
then I hope you're ready for me to whip you into proper shape!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus began Rei's tutelage of {player}.
