## Subtitle: Sword Salvation
  
**Narration：**  
{player} heads to meet Rei  
before departing with her on her inspection tour.  
Rei has already arrived at the meeting place.  
  
**Rei：**  
Hey, over here!  
Hey there. Glad to see you arrived safely.  
  
**Rei：**  
Heheh, looks like you're all prepared.  
You seem more dependable than usual.  
  
**Rei：**  
Now then, shall we head to where our carriage is waiting for us?  
  
**Old Man：**  
N-no way...!  
That's not what you told me!  
  
**Rei：**  
...What was that? Are you curious too?  
Then let's investigate.  
  
**Old Man：**  
I only asked you to fix my roof because you said you'd do it for free.  
And now you're suddenly asking for remuneration...!  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
I see! In that case, there's only one thing to be done!  
Hey, guys! Smash that roof up so it's all filled with holes like  
it was before!  
  
**Ruffians：**  
Yes, sir!  
  
**Old Man：**  
Ah...!  
Why would you...? Just when it can finally keep out the wind and rain!  
  
**Rei：**  
Don't tell me it's them...  
Recently, there's been a group of grifters roaming around  
scamming people by pretending to be volunteers.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Aren't you gonna catch them?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rei：**  
...I can't do that.  
Even though the situation's turning sour, nobody's  
pulling out a contract.  
I imagine it was a verbal contract in the form  
of a promise.  
  
**Rei：**  
As it is, we can't tell if the client's skipping out on the bill, or if he's in  
the middle of getting scammed... We just don't know who's playing who.  
Without proof of the crime, we can't force a conclusion.  
  
**Rei：**  
Also, the royal knights sent out a directive to each guild instructing us  
not to carelessly get involved in such situations.  
Worst case scenario, we could cause a miscarriage of justice.  
  
**Rei：**  
...And with the palace in its weakened state, situations like this are  
becoming a daily occurrence all over Landosol.  
That's why we have  
to quickly ascertain the situation and restore law and order...  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
We don't remember how the roof looked before...  
So I guess we'll just tear the whole thing down!  
  
**Old Man：**  
N-no, please stop!  
  
**Rei：**  
...  
  
**Rei：**  
...Sorry. I guess we'll have to delay our departure.  
No matter how you look at it, what they're doing is wrong.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm ready.  
`Tag 2`  
**Rei：**  
Heheh, you saw that coming, did you?  
...Let's go!  
  
**Old Man：**  
Ahhh... At this rate, my house will...  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Heheheh. If yer gonna pay, now would be the time.  
  
**Rei：**  
...Stop right there.  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Huh? Who the hell are you?  
  
**Rei：**  
I'm just a passerby.  
More importantly, get away from that house, now.  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Hey, hey, hey... We really did carry out repairs, you know?  
And we're not forcing him to pay either.  
Have we done anything wrong?  
  
**Rei：**  
...Only guilds with permission from the palace are allowed to carry  
out repairs. Can you show me proof that you're one of those guilds?  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
P-permission...? I've not heard about that... I-  
I mean, yeah, of course!  
  
**Rei：**  
...{player}, power me up.  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
...It is what it is, huh?  
Guess I'll just have to show you.  
  
**Rei：**  
The permission bit was just a bluff... So these are the villains!  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Here's... your damn proof!  
  
**Rei：**  
Hah! Pathetic!  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Gahhh!  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Boss!  
  
**Rei：**  
Such sly conduct... Now it's obvious who the criminals are.  
  
**Rei：**  
I'll cut you all down right here and now!  
Haaaaah!  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Eeeeeek!  
  
**Rei：**  
...I took the liberty of tying them to that board over there.  
I'll leave the rest to the royal knights.  
  
**Old Man：**  
I'm ever so grateful for your help.  
I honestly can't thank you enough...  
  
**Rei：**  
I'm just glad damage was kept to a minimum.  
But there are a lot of scams like that these days.  
You have to be more careful.  
  
**Old Man：**  
Yes... I knew this, but...  
The truth is, my wife, who I've been with for many years,  
is anxious and downhearted about the current state of the city.  
  
**Old Man：**  
I thought that if I could help her remember our old life even a little,  
then her health might improve, so I tried to get the house back to its  
old self as quickly as possible.  
  
**Old Man：**  
...If I'd known this would happen,  
I wouldn't have done anything at all...  
  
**Rei：**  
...You're wrong.  
  
**Old Man：**  
Eh?  
  
**Rei：**  
If it's an act of love, your wife surely realizes...  
  
Or is it that neither of you can convey your feelings, even though you  
share a bond?  
  
**Old Man：**  
O-of course not!  
  
**Rei：**  
If that's the case, then be proud.  
And please don't regret the actions you take  
for the sake of your beloved wife.  
  
**Old Man：**  
I suppose you're right...  
Thank you.  
My wife and I will continue to work hard together.  
  
**Old Man：**  
Well then, I'd better go and inform the royal knights.  
Thank you so much for everything you've done for me today.  
  
**Rei：**  
...I just can't seem to get it right.  
I feel like I'm too heavy-handed.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  What's the matter?  
`Tag 3`  
**Rei：**  
I just think there must've been a better way to resolve the situation.  
  
**Rei：**  
If it were Hiyori, she might've settled it more skillfully.  
If it were Yui, she would've talked through the problem with them first.  
...But me, all I could do was fight.  
  
**Rei：**  
...But it's okay. I don't necessarily regret what I did.  
It's just... there are times when I envy others.  
  
**Rei：**  
For me, when there's someone right in front of me who could use my  
help, I tend to resort to using power without thinking.  
  
**Rei：**  
Even if I come to regret it later, I don't want to get lost in judgement  
once I've decide to swing my sword.  
  
**Rei：**  
Because of that, I want to become the type of person who is attentive  
and doesn't lament their decisions...  
No matter what.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I know you can become that person.  
`Tag 4`  
**Rei：**  
...Thank you.  
As always, your words give me strength...  
Just having you by my side, I...  
  
**Attendant 1：**  
...Ahem!  
  
**Attendant 2：**  
...Lady Rei, sorry to interrupt.  
  
**Rei：**  
You're my father's...  
What are you doing here?  
  
**Attendant 1：**  
...Your father charged us with ensuring your departure, so we've been  
waiting in front of your carriage.  
But you never showed up, hence why  
we've come to get you now.  
  
**Attendant 2：**  
We've informed the driver that we're ready to leave at anytime.  
  
**Rei：**  
Thank you. You're a real help.  
  
**Attendant 1：**  
We're unworthy of your gratitude.  
But Lady Rei...  
  
**Rei：**  
Is there something else?  
  
**Attendant 1：**  
Ahem... With your close \"friend\" accompanying you,  
during the inspections, um, please try not to get carried away...  
  
**Rei：**  
What?! D-don't be ridiculous! We have no such intentions in the least!  
I have no idea what you're trying to say...  
And tell my father as much!  
  
**Attendant 1：**  
...Yes, ma'am.  
  
**Attendant 2：**  
Well then, we shall take our leave.  
  
**Rei：**  
Damn those two...  
I never noticed it before, but now that it's been pointed out...  
  
**Rei：**  
...It's got my emotions all in a stir.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Did you say something?  
`Tag 5`  
**Rei：**  
N-no, nothing! Nothing at all!  
Now then, let's get going!  
  
**Narration：**  
Holding uncertain feelings in her heart,  
Rei embarked upon her journey with {player}.
