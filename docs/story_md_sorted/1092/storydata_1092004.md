**Narration：**  
Anne bursts onto the scene as {player}  
is relaxing at the Sarendia Orphanage.  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh, {player}!  
Any idea where that lovely voice is coming from?  
  
**Anne：**  
It's so clear and pristine. The melody speaks right to your heart.  
This has to be someone singing, right?  
But I can't even guess who it is.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's Kokkoro.  
`Tag 1`  
**Anne：**  
Wait, for real?!  
I had no idea she was this good at singing!  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh!  
I've got a great idea!  
But I gotta go speak to Kokkoro first!  
  
**Anne：**  
Hm? You want to join?  
Ehehe. Thanks.  
Let's go together!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh. Hello, my lord.  
Miss Anne, too.  
What brings you here?  
  
**Anne：**  
Your singing's so lovely, Kokkoro!  
It almost moved me to tears!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Huh? Th-thank you very much.  
That's pleasing to hear, though a little embarrassing as well.  
  
**Anne：**  
I really, really mean it!  
That's the most beautiful melody I've ever heard!  
  
**Anne：**  
I take it you like singing?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed.  
That is my main motivation for doing it, of course, but...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Singing is a crucial part of elvenfolk culture.  
We're taught how to do so from a young age.  
  
**Anne：**  
Elvenfolk, huh?  
Makes sense!  
  
**Anne：**  
I've got a friend named Hanna.  
She's an elf, and also really good at singing,  
so I guess it's the same here and back home.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I wasn't aware that elves are present in Rivenbrant, too.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Though it is part of my culture, the village from which  
I hail is also somewhat special. We have many songs, all passed down from ancient times.  
  
**Anne：**  
Wow.  
Ancient songs of Astraea, huh?  
  
**Anne：**  
Hey, Kokkoro.  
How would you feel about teaching me how to sing?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Not only would you like to sing,  
but you'd like me to personally teach you?  
  
**Anne：**  
Yup.  
Am I asking a bit much?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Not at all.  
I do find myself curious as to where the proposal came from, though.  
  
**Anne：**  
It's Grea. She really loves music, you know?  
I figured she'd be happy if I learned a song or two from Astraea.  
  
**Anne：**  
Then, when we get back home, we could play  
the piano and sing together.  
That'd be a lot of fun.  
Ehehe.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see.  
Quite the lovely thought.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Very well. Leave it to me.  
I'm more than willing to teach you any songs I know.  
  
**Anne：**  
Thanks so much!  
Woo! It's singing time!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You really do love Grea, don't you?  
**Choice: (3)**  I can tell how well you two get along.  
`Tag 2`  
**Anne：**  
Hehe. Yup!  
She means the whole wide world to me!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Anne：**  
Really?  
Hehe.  
It's true and all,  
but the fact that you see it that way makes me happy.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Anne：**  
I told you about how everyone at the academy started  
treating me like I was different from them all, right?  
  
**Anne：**  
Truth is, I felt a wall go up between us all at that point.  
Not that they were mean or anything, of course.  
But every time they praised me, I felt that wall grow taller.  
  
**Anne：**  
Until a certain day, that is.  
I was just wandering around the academy, when I heard the sound of music.  
  
**Anne：**  
Music from a piano. It was such a kind sound.  
And yet, overwhelmingly lonely.  
  
**Anne：**  
My curiosity was piqued. I had to find the source.  
So I traced it all the way to the concert hall.  
  
**Anne：**  
And that's where I first met Grea.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My goodness.  
That's quite the fated meeting, if I do say so myself.  
  
**Anne：**  
Hehe. You think?  
Fate, huh...  
That might actually be the case.  
  
**Anne：**  
I know it sounds farfetched, but I just had this uncontrollable desire to  
be friends with her from the very first second we met.  
  
I'd always approach her,  
make sure we spent time together.  
  
**Anne：**  
And as time went on,  
she gradually started opening herself up to me!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see.  
And thus you became as close as you are now.  
  
**Anne：**  
Ehehe.  
Yeah.  
Grea's not the super talkative type, as you can tell.  
But she's kind. Delicate. And she cares so much about her friends.  
  
**Anne：**  
Normally I'm always telling myself to keep it together.  
But when it's the two of us, it's different.  
I'm always letting her spoil me.  
  
**Anne：**  
I just feel so... at ease when I'm with her.  
Like everything's going to be all right.  
  
**Anne：**  
She's always there for me, supporting me.  
That's why I want to do the same for her.  
I want to support and help her.  
  
**Anne：**  
I want her to understand just how much I appreciate it.  
How much her support has meant to me all this time.  
Hence my request today.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Understood.  
Your feelings toward her resound deep within my soul.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This is a mere suggestion on my part, but...  
  
Rather than simply learning a song,  
what say you dedicate one specifically to her?  
  
**Anne：**  
Huh?  
Dedicate a song to her?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed. And I have just the perfect one.  
A song created to express thanks and love to those dear to you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What say you,  
Miss Anne?  
Would you like to learn and sing that for her sake?  
  
**Anne：**  
Kokkoro!  
  
**Anne：**  
I do! I really do!  
I'll give her the best performance I can!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Very well.  
Then I'll be sure to teach you not only the song,  
but how to sing it properly as well.  
  
**Anne：**  
Okay!  
Teach me your ways, Miss Kokkoro!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
I shall indeed.  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh, right. {player}.  
I'll try singing after she teaches me what I need to know,  
and I'll need you to listen as well!  
  
**Anne：**  
If you've got any pointers, then don't hold back!  
Tell me where I'm going wrong, what I need to address and the like.  
  
**Anne：**  
This is important, after all.  
I want to give Grea the best I've got.  
  
**Anne：**  
So yeah.  
I'm relying on you, {player}!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus, on a certain day...

**Grea：**  
I'll be honest. I never expected Lou to cook us a meal like this.  
It's amazing, isn't it, Anne?  
  
**Grea：**  
Anne?  
You seem a bit fidgety. Is something wrong?  
  
**Anne：**  
Huh?! E-err, uhh... Kind of!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
She's feeling nervous, Miss Grea.  
Worry not, Miss Anne.  
I'm positive she'll be overwhelmed with joy.  
  
**Anne：**  
Aww! Miss Kokkoro!  
Okay! I'll give it my best shot!  
  
**Grea：**  
H-huh?  
What's going on here?  
  
**Anne：**  
Well, Grea.  
There's something I'd like you to hear.  
  
**Grea：**  
A song?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed. She's been practicing for quite some time now.  
All for your sake, Miss Grea.  
  
**Grea：**  
For my sake...?  
Is that true, Anne?  
  
**Anne：**  
Yeah.  
So, Grea...  
Would you be willing to listen?  
  
**Anne：**  
This is from me to you.  
From the bottom of my heart.  
  
**Grea：**  
Anne...  
  
**Grea：**  
Yeah. I'd love to.  
Please go ahead.  
  
**Anne：**  
Grea!  
Thanks. In that case... I'll sing as best as I can!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so after singing to her heart's content,  
Anne enjoyed a festive party with the others.
