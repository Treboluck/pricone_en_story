# Anne Episode 1
Anne's desire to read Astraea's books leads the crew to a certain store. Caught up in her bookworm tendencies, Grea is left with no choice but to tempt Anne into going back home by offering up her tail.
  
## Subtitle: The Ever-Curious Princess
  
**Narration：**  
Left with no choice but to wait for the Guild Association  
to prepare a magic tracer for them, Anne and co. decide  
to spend the time checking out Landosol.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Anything you want to see in particular, Anne?  
We've got the time, so I'm cool with showing you around.  
  
**Anne：**  
Really?  
Thanks so much!  
There's actually something I've been really, really curious about!  
  
**Anne：**  
Books!  
I wanna read as many of Landosol's books as possible!  
Ideally all of them!  
  
**Grea：**  
Hehe.  
You really do love books, don't you?  
  
**Anne：**  
Can you blame me? We're in a whole different world!  
There's gotta be all sorts of books I  
haven't heard of,  
yet alone read!  
  
**Anne：**  
Just thinking about what's written in them has me all excited!  
And I just can't hide it!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Cool, cool. Might want to calm down a little bit, though.  
I guess you really do love books, huh?  
  
**Anne：**  
Yup! I do!  
Oh. But there's one thing I love more.  
  
**Grea：**  
Huh? Now that's a first, even to me.  
There's something you love more than books? What is it?  
  
**Anne：**  
Grea's tail! ♪  
  
**Grea：**  
Wha?! W-wait a minute!  
Y-you can't touch it, okay?!  
It's really tickly!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Enough with the flirting, you two.  
...  
Anyway, you wanna go somewhere with lots of books, right?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm not actually sure what place would be good around here, though.  
You got any ideas, {player}?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh,  
that store over there?  
It does look like it'd have a good amount of books.  
Let's go check it out, then.  
  
**Lou：**  
Urgh... Books are my enemy...  
Just looking at them makes me so, so sleepy...  
  
**Lou：**  
No. It's worse than that...  
Just thinking about them... Zzz...  
  
**Anne：**  
Huh? Lou?  
D-did she genuinely fall asleep?!  
  
**Grea：**  
A-ahaha...  
I'd hate to wake her up,  
so let's let her rest here.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Guess we'll head to the store, then.  
Let's get going, {player}.  
  
**Anne：**  
Wow! They've got such a good selection!  
And look! There's all sorts of books I haven't seen before!  
I knew I it!  
  
**Grea：**  
Hehe.  
I can see the sparkle in your eyes, Anne.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Loving books is one thing, but I'd say you're a fanatic at this point.  
Actually, hold up.  
You can read our language?  
  
**Anne：**  
Yup!  
The people at the Sarendia Orphanage taught us yesterday.  
Right, Grea?  
  
**Grea：**  
Yeah. I can only read a bit though.  
Goes to show how amazing you are, Anne.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You learned to read another world's language in one day?  
You really are an oddball.  
  
**Anne：**  
Hey, can I read some of these?! Don't mind if I do!  
Let's see... \"The Foundations of Magic.\"  
Wow! It's a book about Astraea's magic!  
  
**Anne：**  
Hm, hm... Huh... I see, I see.  
So that's how magic is activated here...  
  
**Anne：**  
Spellcasting, magic circles...  
Oh! This part of the process is similar to  
how we do it in Rivenbrandt!  
  
**Karyl：**  
How should I put this...  
You're pretty earnest, aren't you?  
  
**Anne：**  
Huh? You think?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I mean, you already know how to use magic.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Let's not forget those spirits you can summon, too.  
No real sense in studying when you can already do that, right?  
  
**Anne：**  
So you'd think. But there's still so much I don't know.  
Plus, learning new stuff is just plain fun!  
  
**Anne：**  
And that's not all. The smarter I get, the stronger I get.  
That'll enable me to protect everyone I love in Mysteria!  
Not a single downside to it!  
  
**Grea：**  
That's part of the reason I enrolled in Mysteria Academy, even.  
I was motivated enough to flee the castle.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh.  
Did they not let you study magic there or something?  
  
**Anne：**  
They kind of did.  
But I wanted to learn more advanced, specific stuff as well.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That's incredible.  
**Choice: (2)**  Guess that's what makes you a princess.  
`Tag 1`  
**Anne：**  
Huh?! Come on, it's not *that* incredible!  
I just love the people of my kingdom. It's that simple.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Anne：**  
Ahaha.  
Not at all. That part's just coincidence!  
Wanting to learn, wanting to protect everyone...  
That's just how I feel as an individual.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Anne：**  
Now then. We don't have all the time in the world here,  
so I should use it to check out even more books. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Really? You're not satisfied as it is?  
  
**Anne：**  
How could I be?  
There's so many interesting ones here!  
  
**Anne：**  
Let's see...  
\"A Record of Grand Magics,\" \"Magecraft: Past to Present,\"  
\"History's Greatest Heroes: A Memoire.\"  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh! The stuff here seems interesting!  
\"Landosol Records\"!  
What else is there... \"The Mystery of Astraea's Advanced Civilization\"!  
Wow! Now I'm super curious! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey...  
What happened to studying magic?  
  
**Grea：**  
Ahaha...  
She's gone full bookworm mode on us.  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh, more interesting stuff!  
\"Landosol's Most Grotesque and Vile Vegetation\"!  
\"The Sweet Scent of the Unnatural\"!  
\"Caressed by a Vampire's Smile\"!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Okay, now she's going off the deep end...  
  
**Grea：**  
Oh.  
The sun's starting to set.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, Anne!  
That's enough reading for the day!  
  
**Anne：**  
No way! Give me a bit more time!  
At least enough for another book!  
Actually, okay. Let me finish this page, at least!  
  
**Karyl：**  
This isn't the first time you've said that today!  
  
**Karyl：**  
*sigh*  
Come on, Grea. It's your job to reign her in!  
  
**Grea：**  
Huh? I-it is?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I mean. You're her best friend, right?  
You should know how to get her head out of those books.  
  
**Grea：**  
Hm... A way to get her head out of those books...  
Oh.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I knew it!  
I dunno what it is, but get it done!  
  
**Grea：**  
Th-there is a way, but...  
Urgh. I'd, uh, really rather not...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hop to it!  
I'm begging you here! I can't handle this anymore!  
  
**Grea：**  
Urghhh...  
F-fine, I'll do it...  
  
**Grea：**  
Hey, Anne.  
It's getting dark, so let's go home.  
  
**Anne：**  
Grea! I swear I'll be done soon!  
Just let me read this passage!  
  
**Grea：**  
If we go home now, I'll...  
I'll let you touch my tail.  
  
**Anne：**  
Tail.  
  
**Grea：**  
Uh... J-just a little bit, okay?!  
It really is tickly when you touch it!  
  
**Anne：**  
...!  
{player}! Karyl!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Good lord, that's a change!  
She's getting ready to home at the speed of light!  
  
**Anne：**  
Let's get going! Don't waste any time!  
Come on! What's the hold up!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well I'll be.  
She's even more excited than when we came in here.  
  
**Grea：**  
Urghhh...  
I didn't want to have to resort to this!  
  
**Narration：**  
Though they succeeded in returning home from the store,  
Grea's ticklish cries were to be heard all through the night.
