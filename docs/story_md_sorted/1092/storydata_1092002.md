**Narration：**  
{player} finishes up breakfast and makes  
his way to the main hall, only to  
find Anne with a troubled expression on her face.  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh. Good morning, {player}!  
Huh? What's on my mind?  
Well, you see...  
  
**Anne：**  
We're staying here at the Sarendia Orphanage until the  
Guild Association gets back to us about the magic tracer, right?  
  
**Anne：**  
From my perspective,  
we've just kind of barged in.  
Yet everyone here's been super nice to us.  
That's something I really, really appreciate!  
  
**Anne：**  
Which is why I want to repay them somehow.  
Except, well,  
I'm not too sure how to do that.  
  
**Boy：**  
Good morning, Anne!  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh! Good morning!  
Hehe. You sure are full of energy today.  
  
**Boy：**  
Yup!  
We're gonna play outside today!  
  
**Girl：**  
Wait a minute!  
Playing comes after studying!  
  
**Boy：**  
Aww, but studying's so boring.  
Oh, actually!  
Anne!  
You go to a magic school, right?  
  
**Anne：**  
That I do, my little friend.  
It's called the Mysteria Academy of Magic!  
  
**Boy：**  
Awesome! Can you teach us magic, then?  
That's the one thing I do wanna study!  
  
**Girl：**  
Hey, no fair!  
Teach me too, Anne!  
Please! Pretty please!  
  
**Anne：**  
Whoa.  
I didn't realize you guys were so interested in magic.  
  
**Girl：**  
We are! Magic sounds so fun!  
I wanna use it!  
  
**Anne：**  
Fun, huh?  
Wow! I'm so glad to hear that!  
  
**Anne：**  
Leave it to me, then!  
I'll teach you a bunch!  
  
**Boy & Girl：**  
Woooooo!  
  
**Anne：**  
Time to get stuff prepared!  
Hee hee...  
I'm gonna give them the best magic lessons ever!  
  
**Grea：**  
Hm?  
You seem awfully excited, Anne.  
Did something happen?  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh, Grea!  
Guess what?  
The kids at the orphanage wanna learn magic, so I'm  
gonna teach them!  
How about you join me?  
  
**Grea：**  
I-I,  
uhh...  
I'd rather not be surrounded by children...  
  
**Anne：**  
Really? That's a shame...  
No problem, though!  
I'll give it my best on my own!  
  
**Anne：**  
How should I go about this?  
Probably best to use these books...  
Hee hee hee. ♪  
  
**Grea：**  
...And off she goes.  
Hm... I wonder if she'll be okay on her own?  
  
**Grea：**  
Um...  
Do you mind if I have a minute, {player}?  
  
**Grea：**  
I know this is a lot to ask, but, well...  
Would you be willing to help Anne out with teaching the children?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sure thing.  
**Choice: (2)**  I can't use magic, though.  
`Tag 1`  
**Grea：**  
Really?  
Thanks so much.  
Especially on such short notice.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Grea：**  
Oh, right.  
Don't worry about that.  
How do I explain this...  
I'd just like you to keep a gentle eye on her.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Grea：**  
Sorry. I realize I should be the one doing this.  
I just... don't want to scare the children.  
  
**Grea：**  
This is a rare opportunity for Anne.  
And she seems so excited about it, too.  
But that's got me a little, well, worried.  
  
**Grea：**  
Anyway, please keep an eye on her.  
  
**Anne：**  
Now then, kids!  
It's time for a fun magic lesson!  
  
**Boy & Girl：**  
Yaaay!  
  
**Anne：**  
First up, I'll explain the activation process itself.  
Don't worry. I've got the fundamentals down for how it's  
done here in Astraea.  
First off—  
  
**Anne：**  
In other words, this magic circle serves an important purpose.  
It acts as a link between the real world and our  
individual spirit worlds. Does that makes sense so far?  
  
**Girl：**  
Hey...  
Did you get any of that?  
  
**Boy：**  
Nope. Not a bit.  
I'm getting kinda sleepy...  
  
**Anne：**  
H-huh?  
Err, sorry!  
Was that a bit too difficult to understand?  
  
**Boy：**  
Hm... Magic's super complicated, huh?  
I dunno if I can use it...  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh! Th-that's not true at all!  
It's actually really easy and handy once you understand the fundamentals!  
  
**Boy：**  
Really?  
You know that big suit of armor you summon?  
Can I do that?  
  
**Anne：**  
Taken an interest in summoning magic, have we?!  
Perfect! That's my specialty!  
  
**Anne：**  
Don't worry! You'll definitely be able to do it!  
In fact, I was around your age when I first succeeded!  
  
**Boy：**  
Really?!  
Then teach me!  
  
**Anne：**  
Sure thing!  
Greater spirits require a contract to summon,  
but lesser spirits shouldn't be a problem! Let's give it a try!  
  
**Anne：**  
Okay, so. There's five processes involved in spirit summoning.  
First of all, you need to materialize the image in your head by—  
  
**Boy：**  
Ehhh...  
This sounds super difficult.  
  
**Anne：**  
Huh?!  
E-err...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Let's take a sweets break.  
`Tag 4`  
**Anne：**  
Oh... {player}...  
  
**Girl：**  
Sweets!  
Get them in my tummy!  
  
**Boy：**  
Same here!  
I'm starving!  
  
**Narration：**  
Hearing that declaration from {player},  
the children all rush inside the orphanage at once.  
  
**Anne：**  
*sigh*  
Thanks, {player}.  
That was a big help.  
  
**Anne：**  
Ahaha...  
I was all excited to teach,  
but it's a lot harder than I expected!  
I did a pretty awful job.  
  
**Anne：**  
Which sucks, considering how into they seemed.  
I hope I haven't killed their interest in magic...  
  
**Anne：**  
...  
  
**Anne：**  
Hey, um...  
The truth is, this happened back at the academy as well.  
  
**Anne：**  
There were always people asking me to teach them,  
but then it wouldn't go well in practice.  
That, or they'd just kind of stare at me blankly.  
  
**Anne：**  
And, well... That led to a certain kind of reaction.  
Now whenever I do anything, people are just like,  
\"Wow! That's a princess for you!  
Totally different from us!\"  
  
**Anne：**  
Don't get me wrong. I know they're genuinely praising me.  
But, well...  
  
**Anne：**  
What they're saying isn't true.  
We're not different at all.  
  
**Anne：**  
I enjoy studying together with everyone, too...  
I wanna talk about the stuff I like. The stuff I'm  
interested in. Same as everyone else does.  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh, silly me. I can't keep acting all gloomy!  
The kids'll be surprised if they see me like this.  
Gotta keep a smile on my face! A nice, big smile!  
  
**Anne：**  
*sigh*  
I really don't know how I should teach them, though...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I've got an idea.  
`Tag 5`  
**Anne：**  
R-really?!  
Tell me, tell me!  
  
**Anne：**  
Huh? Th-that's it?  
You think that'll be enough?  
  
**Anne：**  
Hm... But, well...  
...  
Okay, got it. I'll give it a shot!  
  
**Anne：**  
Sorry for the wait, everyone!  
Let's get back to magic lessons!  
  
**Anne：**  
All right.  
I'll try out {player}'s advice first.  
  
**Anne：**  
Will it really work out, though?  
All I'm doing is showing them some basic magic...  
  
**Anne：**  
Not that I can think of any better methods..  
Ah, to heck with it!  
I'll deal with the rest on the fly!  
  
**Anne：**  
Um...  
I kind of just talked at you all earlier,  
so let me show some actual magic this time around.  
  
**Anne：**  
Here we go.  
First up, a basic fire spell!  
  
**Boy：**  
Woah! It's hot!  
Fire just appeared out of nowhere! How come?!  
  
**Girl：**  
Wow, amazing!  
That's super cool!  
  
**Anne：**  
...!  
R-really?!  
  
**Girl：**  
Yeah! Really!  
  
**Anne：**  
Wow! They pretty much did a 180!  
They're more interested than ever now!  
  
**Girl：**  
Show us more, Anne!  
I wanna see more and more!  
  
**Anne：**  
Hehe. Of course!  
How about this, then?  
Yah!

**Girl：**  
Wow! So pretty!  
  
**Anne：**  
Reminds you of fireworks, right?  
You can do anything and everything with magic. It's true.  
So long as you can imagine it, it's possible!  
  
**Boy：**  
Wow, wow, wow!  
I wanna try! I wanna try!  
  
**Anne：**  
Really?  
That's a relief!  
  
**Anne：**  
Okay then. I'll teach you how to cast this magic.  
First up, visualize it in your head.  
  
**Boy：**  
Visualize...  
Should I just remember what you showed us?  
  
**Anne：**  
Yup! Exactly!  
That's what visualizing's all about!  
  
**Anne：**  
Think back to how it looked. The way it crackled.  
Keep that image firm in your head.  
  
**Anne：**  
Now visualize a mysterious, white light.  
Imagine it pouring out from your body.  
  
**Boy：**  
Hm...  
A white light... It's coming out of my body...  
  
**Anne：**  
Don't think too hard. Take a deep breath. Exhale...  
Stop, and then... Take that image and make it flow through your hands!  
  
**Boy：**  
Nnnnngh... Yah!  
Whoa... I-I did it! I actually did it!  
Thanks so much, Anne!  
  
**Anne：**  
...!  
Not at all... I'm so glad you pulled it off.  
I really am!  
  
**Girl：**  
Hey, hey!  
Don't forget me! Teach me to do it too!  
  
**Anne：**  
Hee hee...  
Your wish is my command!  
  
**Narration：**  
Anne's lessons help the children  
understand just how fun magic can be.

**Anne：**  
Thanks so much, {player}!  
Everyone had a bunch of fun thanks to you!  
  
**Anne：**  
Ahhh! What a relief!  
I was so worried for a minute there!  
  
**Anne：**  
I think I get what happened, though.  
Previous experiences popped in my head when they asked me to teach them.  
That got me all tense and nervous.  
  
**Anne：**  
You brought me back to my senses, though.  
Ehehe. I really can't thank you enough!  
  
**Narration：**  
A gleaming smile on her face, Anne expressed her utmost gratitude.
