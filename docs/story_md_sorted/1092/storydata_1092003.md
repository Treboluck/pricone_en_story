**Narration：**  
Anne calls out to {player}  
as he enters the main hall.  
  
**Anne：**  
Do you have a minute?  
There's something I'd like to ask you.  
  
**Anne：**  
We're working alongside the Gourmet Guild for the time being, right?  
That being the case, I wanna help you guys out with your guild activities!  
  
**Anne：**  
That said, monster cuisine is a bit... too advanced for me.  
Is that all you eat when you're out and about?  
  
**Anne：**  
You catch and eat fish, too?  
Well,  
that sounds good!  
I should be able to handle fish dishes!  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh, you'll help me out?  
Ehehe. Thanks! Let's fish up a storm.  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh. Let me, uh, confirm something.  
You fish on the shore, right?  
None of that underwater spearing stuff, I assume?  
  
**Anne：**  
Ah, don't read into that too much!  
Right, right.  
Regular fishing shouldn't be an issue!  
  
**Anne：**  
With that said,  
let's get going!  
  
**Anne：**  
Actually, before we do...  
Can I ask a favor?  
I'd like you to keep this a secret from Grea.  
  
**Anne：**  
I wanna make some food for her.  
As a surprise, of course. ♪  
So this is just between me and you!  
Okay?  
  
**Anne：**  
All right. Let's get going for real now.  
Show me the way, boss!  
  
**Anne：**  
Wow!  
The ocean here's as pretty as it is back home!  
  
**Anne：**  
But, well... The wind's pretty strong.  
And the waves look pretty big...  
Almost feels like they'll crash right onto us... Urgh.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are you cold?  
**Choice: (2)**  You don't look so good.  
`Tag 1`  
**Anne：**  
Huh?! I-  
I might be!  
Probably because of the wind. Yeah!  
That's why I'm shaking!  
Definitely!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Anne：**  
D-don't worry! I feel great!  
Just a bit cold!  
But I'll live!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Anne：**  
More importantly, fishing!  
We should do some of that!  
  
**Anne：**  
I'm gonna fish up a big one! Woo!  
  
**Anne：**  
Hm... They're not biting as much as expected.  
Looks like you've got the same issue, too.  
  
**Anne：**  
Might be best giving up for the day?  
But... I really wanna cook up something nice for Grea and everyone else.  
  
**Anne：**  
What should I do?  
  
**Fisherman：**  
Oh? Looks like I'm not the only one out of luck here.  
I guess today's just one of those no biter days.  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh, hello!  
I take it you're here to fish as well?  
  
**Fisherman：**  
Yup. Not that I'm getting much of it done.  
I've been fishing 'round these parts for a long time now,  
but days like today come around now and then.  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh...  
That's a shame.  
  
**Fisherman：**  
Now, now. Don't let yourself get down so quickly.  
I still haven't said my full piece.  
  
**Fisherman：**  
The shore's pretty much a write-off now, but days like this are  
when you head out to sea. They won't stop biting out there.  
You can  
rent a boat nearby, so why not give it is a shot?  
  
**Anne：**  
W-we need to take a boat?  
Out to sea?!  
  
**Fisherman：**  
Well, yes...  
What's wrong? You look awfully pale.  
  
**Anne：**  
N-not at all! I'm fine!  
Okay. So we just need to head out to sea?  
Thank you very much for telling us!  
  
**Anne：**  
R-right then!  
Looks like we won't be getting any catches here,  
so l-let's get ourselves a b-boat and head out to sea...  
  
**Anne：**  
Don't worry... It'll be okay!  
We're not going *in*the water itself!  
  
**Anne：**  
But...  
Urgh! Why'd it have to turn out this way?!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You really sure you're okay?  
`Tag 4`  
**Anne：**  
Huh?! Y-yeah, I'm fine!  
Sorry for making you worry, but I mean it!  
It'll be fine!  
Everything'll work out!  
  
**Anne：**  
Come on! Let's get sailing!  
Anchors aweigh! Just kidding. Ahahah!  
...Ahaha!  
  
**Anne：**  
Wow, caught another one!  
They really are biting like crazy,  
ahaha...  
  
**Anne：**  
Th-that fisherman was right on the money!  
Wh-who knew that coming out to sea...  
would yield us such a great bounty...  
  
**Anne：**  
It's... great. It really is.  
But...  
  
**Anne：**  
Woooaaah?!  
It's shaking again! U-urghhh!  
  
**Anne：**  
I... I can't do this anymore!  
  
**Anne：**  
H-hey, {player}!  
We've caught plenty at this point, right?!  
  
**Anne：**  
I-I think we should head back!  
L-let's get back to land! As quickly as possible!  
  
**Anne：**  
Wait... Aaahhhh?!  
That wave's huge!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Watch out!  
`Tag 5`  
**Anne：**  
No way...  
This can't be real... Stay away!  
  
**Anne：**  
S-stop!  
  
**Anne：**  
...  
  
**Anne：**  
H-huh? The wave's.... not coming?  
And the boat's steady... How come?  
  
**Anne：**  
Wait. WHAT?!  
  
**Fisherman：**  
What the heck happened?!  
The ocean's all frozen!  
  
**Fisherman：**  
I saw it light up all of a sudden, and then this...  
J-just what's going on here?!  
  
**Anne：**  
Don't... Don't tell me... I did this?!  
Did I use magic subconsciously?!  
  
**Anne：**  
Ahhhhhh!  
I gotta turn it back to normal!  
  
**Anne：**  
*sigh* Always good to feel the ground beneath your feet.  
I mean it. The less shaky business, the better!  
  
**Anne：**  
That said... I managed to revert the damage,  
but I still feel terrible about messing things up for the other fishers.  
  
**Anne：**  
Um... {player}!  
I'm so sorry!  
  
**Anne：**  
You've probably realized by now, but...  
I... I have a phobia when it comes to water.  
I can't swim, and boats just terrify me.  
  
**Anne：**  
It's embarrassing. Pathetic, even. That's why I stayed quiet.  
But doing so just caused a bunch of issues for you.  
  
**Anne：**  
Urgh... I'm sorry...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  We're all afraid of something.  
`Tag 6`  
**Anne：**  
I mean, sure...  
But...  
  
**Anne：**  
Huh? What's that?  
You want me to take a look at the fish we caught?  
  
**Anne：**  
How does that tie into this conversation?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  This only happened because you fought your fears.  
`Tag 7`  
**Anne：**  
{player}...  
  
**Anne：**  
Hehe. You're right.  
I really put myself out there, didn't I?  
  
**Anne：**  
Thanks, {player}!  
I feel a bit better now.  
  
**Anne：**  
All right!  
We've got plenty of fish, so let's head back!  
  
**Anne：**  
I'm gonna make us a big feast!  
Here's hoping Grea and everyone else enjoys it!  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh,  
right!  
I gotta keep Grea out of the orphanage until it's ready!  
  
**Anne：**  
As for the cooking, I wanna do that on my own,  
so you don't need to tag along anymore.  
That, plus I wanna give you a nice surprise as well.  
  
**Narration：**  
With Anne back in high spirits,  
the two of them made their way home with smiles on their faces.
