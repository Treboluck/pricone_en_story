## Subtitle: Can I Handle Being Home Alone?
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh...  
I-I'm home all by myself today...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Mama Saren and Suzume have to work,  
and Ayane always goes out somewhere  
on this day every week.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Everyone else is gone, too, so i-it's all up to me...  
I must defend the Sarendia Orphanage...  
As its only protector, it's my sworn duty.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Just kidding! I'm really just home alone...  
But I might get bored doing nothing here all by myself.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Suzume pre-made today's meals,  
and she did all the chores before going out...  
So I don't have any housework to do, either...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But I said I'd stay home,  
so I can't just go out and play...  
I should've gotten something to help pass the time indoors.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ayane is good at finding things to do,  
like ways to have fun on her own  
inside the house...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But I always end up with too much time on my hands...  
Maybe I'll read a book...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Mama Saren did say  
we could borrow any of the books in her library...  
I think there was a big, epic novel that looked interesting, before...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Eeek!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wh-wh-what...  
What was that sound?  
I-it was a really weird noise!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I'm scared!  
I knew staying home alone was a bad idea...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
*sniffle*  
Oh, was that the doorbell?  
Is someone at the door?  
Umm, what was I supposed to do in this situation, again?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I think I was told not to open the door to any strangers,  
or anyone who isn't Mama Saren and the others...  
But I should probably answer the door if it's a package delivery...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
M-maybe I'll peek at who's outside...  
If they don't look like a delivery person,  
I can just pretend nobody is home.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Let's see...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
H-huh?  
Is that you, {player}?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh, let me open the door...  
You aren't a stranger,  
so I can open the door for you.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Umm...  
W-  
welcome to the Sarendia Orphanage! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um...  
How  
may I help you today?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Uh, Mama Saren and the others aren't home right now...  
If you have any deliveries,  
I'm allowed to sign for them.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh...  
Mama Saren asked you to come check on me?  
I didn't know you knew her, too.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I thought you were all mine...  
I mean, I thought I was the only person you knew.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh, it's nothing...  
Um, if that's why you're here, please come in.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehe.  
I was getting bored, being all by myself. Will you play a game with me?  
I'd love it if we spent some time together. ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sure! What do you wanna play?  
**Choice: (2)**  Good for you, staying home alone.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kurumi：**  
Yay! You're into the idea.  
What do you want to do?  
What sort of games do grown-ups play?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Y-you probably don't play with toys, huh...  
You aren't a little kid, after all. Hmm...

`Tag 2`  
**Kurumi：**  
Ahh!  
Please don't pat my head...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehe.  
But thank you for the praise...  
I was feeling kind of lonely, so I'm happy you came to visit.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kurumi：**  
Umm... For starters, I'll make you some tea...  
Please sit down and relax...  
I'll show you some excellent hospitality.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehe. I don't have a lot of friends,  
so I'm not used to having visitors.  
This is kind of exciting!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh?! Wh-why are you following so close behind me?  
Y-you can have a seat, you know...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
What? You need to keep an eye on me?  
Y-you don't have to  
watch me so intently from up close...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
P-please stop staring...  
I hate being watched...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh dear...  
You really are troublesome...
