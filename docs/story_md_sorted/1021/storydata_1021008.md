**Kurumi：**  
Heh heh heh.  
Your Majesty,  
these clothes cannot be seen by fools.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hee hee. ♪  
I feel like I've gotten better  
at playing this part.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
If I keep this up,  
I'll be ready for the performance in no time.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
...?!  
What?!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh my gosh, {player}?!  
How long have you been standing there?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Y-y-you saw me?  
Nooo! I can never look you in the eye again!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
*sniffle*  
Hm? You want to know what I was doing?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um, well, I...  
How do I explain myself...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I was rehearsing a play!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um...  
Since you've been living with us at  
the Sarendia Orphanage lately...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You might already know this...  
I mean, you were there when it was discussed...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Anyway, business is going quite well  
at the Sarendia Orphanage.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
So we've been talking about  
doing work as a guild, right?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
That's why, um,  
we've decided to visit nearby care homes and childcare centers,  
to perform a little play for them.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I get really nervous,  
so I thought I couldn't do it.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But Mama Saren and the others  
said that I'm good at acting.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I'm... not really that good at anything, but  
I think plays are fun.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Everyone at the Orphanage always  
takes care of me, so...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I want to do my best...  
I want the play  
to be a success.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
That's why I've been secretly practicing  
where no one can see...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh?  
Wh-why are you clapping all of a sudden?  
It's too loud!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hm?  
My performance was good?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You're too kind,  
{player}... ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehehe.  
Though, for the actual performance,  
I'm gonna have to act in front of everybody...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I might get too nervous to do a good job.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
So, well...  
Could you  
help me rehearse for the play?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I need to get used to performing  
in front of people.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I feel at ease with you,  
so I'm not as scared.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-is that a bad idea?  
Am I asking for too much?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Eek!  
Y-you're, um...  
You're glowing again...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wh-what's happening?  
*sob* I take it back, you're just as scary!

**Kurumi：**  
*sob*...  
*sniffle* Oh...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
It's you...  
 *sob*... *hiccup*...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh... I... *sob*  
I-I... I'm sorry...  
I can't talk properly because I'm crying...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
L-let me  
calm down...  
*inhale* *exhale*...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
U-um...  
I have a joint rehearsal starting soon.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You see...  
The play that my school's drama club performed went really well...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
So a t-talent scout for a professional  
theater company  
gave me their business card.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I was given a small part in their next play...  
And I'm supposed to meet the rest of the cast today,  
so we can rehearse together...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
B-but I don't know  
where the rehearsal venue is...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
*sob*...  
Wh-what  
should I do?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Calm her down.  
**Choice: (2)**  Panic with her.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh?!  
I've said this before,  
but please, don't give me a noogie!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I guess I'm getting used to them,  
so your noogies  
have a calming effect on me... But still!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kurumi：**  
Eek!  
Wait,  
why are you panicking with me?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
C-c-calm down!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um, well, uh...  
Y-you'll be fine!  
See? I've calmed down!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
So please,  
stop moving around so strangely!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
E-everyone around  
is looking at us!  
I don't like this!  
  
`Tag 3`

**Kurumi：**  
*sniffle*...  
Hm? A map?  
I did bring one with me...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But i-it's difficult to read...  
I couldn't find the stores that are on the map,  
so I have no idea where I am anymore.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh?  
You come around here often, so  
you might know where to go?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Th-that's great!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh...  
So I turn at that corner,  
and it'll be on the right?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Okay!  
Thanks for your help!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I-I'd  
better hurry to the rehearsal space!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Eeek!  
I-I hurried too much and fell down!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh no...  
I'm gonna be late  
for our joint rehearsal, at this rate...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
*sob*...  
I guess it just wasn't meant to be.  
It's ridiculous that I even got a lead role in the first place...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh?!  
What?  
What are you doing?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You're reciting a charm  
to calm me down?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh, okay...  
I should close my eyes?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
And then  
repeat the words: \"Uoyni evei lebi\"?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I don't get it, but...  
you've never lied to me  
or steered me wrong before.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
O-okay.  
I'll recite this incantation.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Uoyni evei lebi!  
Uoyni evei lebi!  
Uoyni evei lebi!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I feel like it's working... ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh?  
If I'm still nervous,  
I should imagine the audience as potatoes?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Not just potatoes, but  
onions and carrots, too? It'll calm my nerves?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Potatoes, onions, carrots...  
That sounds like a recipe for curry...  
I love curry!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Thank you, {player}.  
I feel so much better.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I've got to get to my rehearsal, now.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Uoyni evei lebi!  
I think this is going to be  
my best performance yet!

**Ameth：**  
Uoyni evei lebi...  
Uoyni evei lebi...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ohh, were you saying \"I believe in you\" backwards?  
Nice job coming up with that on the fly.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, it's fine by me.  
As long as it helps Kurumi feel better,  
and gives her courage to act on stage.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Good things come to those who believe, as they say.  
You'd make a good preschool teacher.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Still, a lead role, huh.  
 She's still only in middle school,  
but she's going to play the lead in a professional theater company?  
That's incredible.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Kurumi must really be  
a talented actress.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's a terrible shame  
that her future gets cut short...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Don't you think so too,  
{player}?  
  
**Ameth：**  
You must erase all malice,  
and safely return her over \"there\".  
  
**Ameth：**  
And then you must cheer for her,  
as she proudly blossoms on center stage.  
Cheer for her with everything you've got.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Surely,  
she is eagerly awaiting that day, too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Uoyni evei lebi!  
 Do your best, okay, {player}? ♪

**Kurumi：**  
Are you okay?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
What happened? You were just standing there...  
Sh-should I call a doctor?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh?  
You're all right?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Don't push yourself too hard.  
I'm worried about you.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Since we live in the same house,  
you're family now...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You can always talk to me  
if anything is bothering you.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehehe...  
I might not be of much help, though...♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh, the sun is setting, already...  
It's time for children to go home...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I got carried away with practicing  
and lost track of time...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I should go back to my home, too...  
I can practice more there.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Mama Saren will worry  
if I'm late getting back.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hahaha...  
I just said \"my home\", didn't I...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Sarendia Orphanage  
has completely become my home. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I'm really thankful for that...  
But I do wish I could meet my real parents...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I'd at least like to tell them  
I'm living a happy life.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
This sounds kind of silly,  
but maybe if I do well in this play  
and become a well-known actor...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
And then go on to  
perform in a big theater someday...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Maybe my parents, who are out there somewhere,  
will come and find me?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Silly, right?  
Hehehe. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Well, we're headed for the same place,  
and the streets are scary at night...  
We should go home together.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Let's hold hands and  
walk side by side.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
To...  
our home. ♪
