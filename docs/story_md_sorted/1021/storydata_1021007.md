**Kurumi：**  
...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wh-what...?  
Where am I?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I don't recognize this place,  
but it somehow feels familiar...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
O-oh...  
 Someone's walking in front of me...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I can sort of tell...  
That's my mom and dad...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
My parents are Lost,  
so I can't remember their names,  
or what they look like...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
It's as though they never existed...  
There's no record of them, and no one remembers them...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But Mama Saren said that everyone else has parents,  
so mine must exist, too...  
She and the others even tried searching for them.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But my parents were never found...  
And from the sound of it, there are other kids out there just like me...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
All of their parents are Lost, too,  
and it's a big problem in our town.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I had given up hope, thinking I probably  
wouldn't ever see my mom or dad again...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
What if it wasn't some weird,  
paranormal phenomenon called being Lost?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Maybe my parents  
abandoned me because they didn't want me...  
And I ended up forgetting them because I was so sad...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I didn't want to learn the horrible truth,  
so I never helped search for my parents.  
Besides, everyone at the Sarendia Orphanage is really nice...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I kept thinking I didn't need to find my parents...  
Things were fine the way they were...  
And I pretended that I didn't mind.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I was lying to myself...  
The truth is, I really, really wanted to see them...  
Mom...! Dad...!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I was so alone! I wanted to see you!  
Please look at me, hold me, and call me by my name!  
Please don't leave me, Mom and Dad!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wh-what?  
I can't touch them?  
My arms pass right through them. Why?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Why is this happening?  
Neither of them have even noticed me...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
They just keep walking away, and they look so sad...  
W-wait...!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Don't go! I'm right here!  
Please notice me, Mom and Dad!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
M...om...  
D...ad...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
...Huh?  
What?  
Was I asleep?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh, you're here...  
Um, I was, uh...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Umm...  
Right, I was home alone...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Then you came to check on me,  
and we played together...  
and then I got too excited and fell asleep?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I'm so embarrassed...  
I'm like a little kid...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You must've carried me to bed  
after I fell asleep...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Th-thank you...  
Sorry to trouble you...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh...  
Did you  
wake me up because I was having a bad dream?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I'm sorry...  
I don't remember it very well, but I think I had a nightmare.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What sort of nightmare?  
**Choice: (2)**  Don't be afraid.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh...  
I'm sorry. I forget my dreams really easily...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I just remember feeling really scared and lonely...  
and really sad, too.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kurumi：**  
Ahh...  
Please don't pat my head...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Yeah, you're right...  
It was just a dream. I have nothing to be scared about.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehehe. I can't believe I was crying about a nightmare.  
I really am just a little kid.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kurumi：**  
{player}...  
Can you  
please do something for me?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Please hold me close...  
I can't stop shivering...  
Please. I'm really scared, for some reason.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh...  
Hehehe, you're nice and warm...♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Thank you for worrying about me.  
But I'll be all right.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Everyone at Sarendia Orphanage,  
and you, too... You're always warm towards me.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I'm not alone...  
And I'm not cold, so I shouldn't be shivering.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I have a happy life.  
Wouldn't you agree?
