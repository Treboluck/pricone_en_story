# Kurumi Episode 2
While Kurumi is out grocery shopping, she spots {player}, who is being accused of stealing since he can't remember how to use money. She pays the shopkeeper, and is relieved to learn that she is more self-sufficient than she had once thought.
  
## Subtitle: You're a Thief?
  
**Kurumi：**  
Uh...  
Um, let's see...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Eggs, carrots,  
cabbage, and mustard spinach?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh...  
Meat, too...  
One boneless cut, and some ribs on the bone...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehehe.  
I'm on shopping duty again today! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I feel bad that everyone's always taking care of me.  
And I've always wanted to help.  
I'm really happy. I'll do my best!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I hate crowds, and I'm not used to the area yet.  
I hope I don't get lost again...  
N-no, I'll be okay. I brought a map with me this time.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Yeah, I know my way home.  
I'll get the shopping done and go back to the Sarendia Orphanage.  
Everyone will praise me... I mean, they'll be pleased. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I'll say, \"I'm home!\" And everyone will welcome me back.  
I can't wait.  
That will be the best reward!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wait, huh?  
My map is here, but my shopping list is missing...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wh-what?  
Where'd it go? Did I lose it?  
Wh-what do I do?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um, ummm... It'll be all right.  
I remember what to buy.  
Eggs, carrots, and... what was it again?  
  
**Staff：**  
THIEF!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Eek! I-I'm not a thief!  
I may have looked suspicious because I was lost in thought,  
but I'm not a thief. Look, I have money...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh?  
Hey, is that you, {player}?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
It's nice to see you again...  
Do you remember me?  
I'm Kurumi, from the Sarendia Orphanage. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um, what's going on?  
The shopkeeper seems to have you by the collar, but...  
V-violence isn't the answer.  
  
**Staff：**  
Oh, do you know this man, young lady?  
He was trying to make off with my wares without paying.  
Damn thief, I oughtta turn you over to the police or Caon!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh? Oh my...  
Um, you know, stealing is wrong...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Y-you have to pay,  
or you'll g-get arrested!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um, here, let me pay instead!  
So please... could you, um, let him go?  
  
**Staff：**  
Hmm...  
Fine,  
but just this once.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
O-okay...  
I'm very sorry! Hey, you should apologize too.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um...  
Tell me, why were you stealing?  
You're supposed to pay for things...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh? You...  
look kinda confused.  
Um, do you know what \"money\" is?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I've heard of it.  
**Choice: (2)**  Is this money?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh, okay, but...  
I think everyone has heard of money before.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh, yes, that's it.  
Wait, you had money all along?  
W-why didn't you pay the shopkeeper?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
When you pay, you can take the items home in exchange for money...  
Um, do you understand what I'm saying?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kurumi：**  
U-umm...  
Tell me, what country are you from?  
Do you really not know how to buy things?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh? You have amnesia?  
Th-that's where you can't remember anything, right?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I can't say I can relate, but that must be tough...  
D-does that mean you're sick?  
  
**Staff：**  
Hellooo.  
You're bad for business, loitering in front of my shop like that.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh my...  
Um, I'm sorry...  
D-do you sell groceries here?  
  
**Staff：**  
Yup! Want to buy something?  
I'll give you a good deal.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh, but...  
With everything going on, I forgot what I was supposed to buy...  
A-and I gave all my money away...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh?  
You're gonna pay for me?  
But in exchange, you want me to show you how to shop?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehehe...  
Okay, I accept.  
I'll show you lots of things you don't know about.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
It's funny... Watching you,  
I feel like maybe I know more than I give myself credit for...  
It's kind of a relief...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh, I remember what to buy now...  
I think it was carrots, eggs, and...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehehe.  
This is a carrot. Got that?  
Did I help you remember?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You can ask me anything if you need any help. ♪
