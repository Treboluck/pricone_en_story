**Kurumi：**  
Hi! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehehe.  
I still have some cookies I baked the other day. Want one?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh...  
I've been learning  
how to cook and bake...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
At the Sarendia Orphanage,  
Suzume makes all of our meals.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Suzume is rather clumsy,  
so there are often explosions in the kitchen, as well as broken dishes...  
She creates some, um, i-interesting flavors...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
That's why I want to learn how to cook.  
If I can help out around the house, Suzume won't have to work so hard...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I'm not very good just yet, but...  
I've learned how to make  
some easy recipes, and some sweets, too. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
W-will you please taste test them for me?  
I hope you like them...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  They're delicious. Thanks.  
**Choice: (2)**  More, please!  
`Tag 1`  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehehe...  
I'm glad.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Some are a little burnt  
or misshapen...  
So they're not as good as the ones you can buy at a store...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh... You ate them all, already?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You have a healthy appetite, huh?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kurumi：**  
Please drink your tea while it's still hot...  
 That was the last of the cookies, so maybe I'll go bake some more...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh, but...  
You'll probably get bored  
waiting for the cookies to be ready.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um, would you like to bake with me?  
 Baking is a lot of fun, you know. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh...  
Gosh, I'm out of ingredients...  
I'm supposed to watch the house, so I can't go shopping now...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hmm?  
You'll go shopping for me?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
N-no...  
I don't want you to leave...  
Please stay here with me...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um... D-do you want to chat?  
Oh, but I'm not very good at conversation...  
W-would you like to play with toys?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh dear... What do I do...  
Is he bored, spending time with me?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh no...  
If he's bored, he might go home...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I don't want that...  
I need to show him a good time...  
Wh-what... What do I do?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh, I just remembered...  
Ayane made a board game a little while ago...  
W-would you like to play it with me?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-it's a game where you pretend to live a different life...  
You start out as a baby,  
then grow up to an adult,  
then you get m-married...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
That's the gist of it.  
We don't have a lot of ways to pass time at the Orphanage, so...  
Ayane makes us these games to play.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
She drew a game board on a big sheet of paper,  
and we use a pencil marked with numbers instead of a die...  
I-it's quite fun...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um... But a grown-up like you  
probably doesn't want to play a game made by children...  
And besides, a board game isn't fun with only two players...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Y-you want to play?  
Are you curious about living a different life?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I forgot—you have amnesia, don't you...  
I know it's just a board game, but if you experience a lifetime in it,  
maybe it will help you remember things from your own life?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But...  
will he forget about me  
if he regains his memory?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I don't want that...  
I don't want to be forgotten,  
or lose someone close to me, ever again...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I hope  
he never regains his memory...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
No, no. What a horrible thing to think...  
He's really bothered by his amnesia...  
I need to help him remember all sorts of things.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Even if he does forget about me,  
I can just become his friend all over again.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
There's no hope for me since my parents are Lost, but  
{player} still has a chance of recovering what was  
important to him.  
 I should show my support, if that's the case...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh?  
Wh-what is it?  
Why are you reaching out for me?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh?  
You forgot to give me  
a present?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You didn't have to get me anything.  
You coming to visit me  
is the only present I need. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Can I open it now?  
Oh!  
Is this... a ribbon?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ohh...  
It's the ribbon I wanted at the store the other day...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You happened to spot it,  
so you thought you'd buy it  
for me as a present?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Thanks to me, you found a part-time job  
and earned some money?  
So you got this present to thank me?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Th-thank you so much...  
I'm so, so happy... ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I can't believe you remembered  
that I wanted this ribbon...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I missed out on buying it then,  
so I'd already given up, thinking it wasn't meant to be...  
Hehehe.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Thank you so much.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Even if you regain your memories  
and forget all about the time we spent together,  
like this moment...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I'll always remember  
how kind you've been to me. ♪
