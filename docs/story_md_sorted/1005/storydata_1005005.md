**Matsuri：**  
Hm-hm-hmmm~♪  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Onward, Tora Tiger!  
To defend peace and justice!  
 Hm-hm-hmm~♪  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh?  
{player}!  
 Fancy running into you here!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eheheh.  
What're you doing out here in the forest?  
Foraging for ingredients again?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'd love to lend a hand,  
 but I'm in the middle of a mission!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Heheh.  
I know I'm still only an apprentice at Nightmare...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But they're short on manpower, so I'm a valuable asset!  
Lately, they've been letting me handle simple missions on my own!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I mean, they're more like chores and errands really,  
but it beats doing nothing but training every day!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Anyway! For today's big mission,  
I'm heading to a farm up in the mountains.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? That sounds just like where you're going?  
Ohhh...  
 You're delivering mail to the farm for a job of your own?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
That explains why I bumped into you, then!  
It all makes sense!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
If our destination's the same, let's go together!  
It's more fun that way!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Take my hand, and off we go!  
Hm-hm-hmm~♪  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hmm?  
Oh, my mission's just to do a little inspection.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I think you know about this already,  
but that farm was pretty badly damaged recently.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
As part of the rebuilding efforts,  
 us members of Nightmare  
donated relief funds and sent people to help them out.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
From what we've heard, repairs have been going smoothly,  
but you can never be sure with just a written report.  
So they've sent me over to check things out in person.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
We need to confirm that the funds we donated  
are being used for the right purposes...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
And if there are any problems, we might still need  
to loan them more funds or organize extra support.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Those farm folk are trustworthy, so it's just a formality.  
The plan is just to check in, give the place a once-over,  
have tea at the farm, and then head straight back.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But that's no fun,  
 so I'm sort of hoping some kind of trouble comes up!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...Well, uh.  
I guess it's not a good thing to hope for trouble!  
I know that, really!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Nobody should want trouble to happen.  
**Choice: (2)**  You sure seem to be working hard.  
`Tag 1`  
**Matsuri：**  
Yeah!  
I dunno what I was thinking there.  
Forget I said anything!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
It's always best if the world's at peace.  
Wishing for bad stuff is the last thing a hero should do!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'll never say a thing like that again!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Matsuri：**  
Yeah!  
I'm really fired up to do a good job!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
This is my chance to be a useful member of Nightmare!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
No... to fight for peace and justice in the world!  
Just like I always wanted! ☆  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Waahh?  
D-don't pat my head and call me a good girl!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I mean, it's nice, but you're gonna knock my hat off!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Matsuri：**  
Mmm?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? I think I just felt water on my cheek!  
You don't think it's starting to rain, do you?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
That's not good.  
The farm's up in the mountains...  
Hiking up a mountain in the rain sounds dangerous!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
The ground gets all slippery,  
and up there, that can mean falling right off a cliff!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
As for this Elven Forest...  
I hear there's a guild devoted to protecting it,  
so it's a safer forest than most...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But that doesn't mean there's no monsters,  
so we can't just hang around here in the open.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
And we've come too far to head straight back to the city...  
What now?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Th-this is awful!  
I didn't plan for a situation like this!  
Ummm... Uhhh...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wahhh?!  
{player}, don't suddenly lift me up like that!  
You scared the life outta me!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? Let's find some kind of shelter?  
Yeah, I guess that's our best move!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
The weather forecast didn't say anything about rain,  
so it's probably just a passing shower!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
We can wait for it to stop,  
and think about our next move afterwards.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
If things still look bad, we can always cut our losses  
and head back to the city for today.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eheheh.  
You're so calm and decisive!  
That's really cool. I gotta be more like you!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Atchoo!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Urgh... I'm soaked all over...  
It's making me shiver from the cold. Atchoo!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Yeesh... It really did start pouring down out of nowhere.  
It's a good thing you managed to find a handy cave like this so quickly.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eheheh.  
If I'd been on my own, I'd've started panicking for sure.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
{player}?  
What're you doing over there?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wahhh?!  
Wh-why're you taking off your clothes?  
S-stop! That's totally indecent and stuff!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? Your clothes are soaked,  
so you thought you'd start a fire and hang them up to dry?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Oh...  
 The guys in the guild you're staying with,  
the \"Sarendia Orphanage\", packed some magical seals  
for you to use in emergencies.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
And one of them is good for starting fires?  
Wow... Magical seals don't come cheap, you know!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I've never actually seen one before.  
You sure do have some generous friends, {player}.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Heheh.  
Starting a fire in a cave like this  
makes me worry about using up the oxygen...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But well, if you leave your clothes wet,  
I guess you'll catch your death of cold...  
Atchoo!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? I should take my clothes off too?  
No way, no way! I can't do that!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I mean, my clothes do need drying too...  
But if I stripped in front of you, the embarrassment would kill me first!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Urgh...  
You don't think of me as just some little kid, now, do you?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I am a girl, you know!  
You've gotta show a *little* delicacy!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Besides...  
I can't put my ears and tail right out in the open.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Well, it's not like {player}'s  
a member of Nightmare or anything,  
so it wouldn't be *that* big a deal if he found out, but...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Waaahh?!  
What're you grabbing my hand for?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Y-you're not gonna strip me, are you?  
N-no way!  
You'd never do anything that cruel, would you?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh?  
You managed to get the fire started,  
so I should come over and sit by it?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
It'll keep my body warm,  
and dry off my clothes at least a little bit?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
W-well, good point.  
I guess I'll do that, then.  
Sorry... I got a bit carried away there.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eheheh.  
That does feel good.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
You always have been a really kind guy.  
I should've known you'd never do anything nasty to me.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Y'know, {player}, I'm really glad it was you  
that I ran into in the forest.
