# Matsuri Episode 6
When Matsuri gets covered in dirt, {player} fetches a change of clothes, but it turns out to be a magical girl costume. Though embarrassed, she gives in and puts it on, only to realize that her beastgirl ears are on full display.
  
## Subtitle: A Mortifying Transformation
  
**Matsuri：**  
Whoa!  
Check it out, {player}!  
I think we actually made it to the farm! ☆  
  
**Matsuri：**  
What a relief!  
I gotta say, that took longer than I thought!  
I set out first thing in the morning, but the sun's almost setting already!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eheheh.  
I guess it's the rain's fault for forcing us to take that break.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I know we decided to march on  
'cause we were more than halfway there already...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But for a while there, I sure regretted it!  
Those mountain trails were a nightmare to climb!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
The paths were all wet from the rain, too,  
so we had to take it slow to make sure we didn't fall...  
I guess it's no wonder it took us all day.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Not much chance of us making it back to the city this evening, huh?  
We'll just have to ask the folks here if there's somewhere we can stay...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Navigating those mountain trails after sundown  
really would be suicide.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I gotta use a messenger pigeon or some magic  
to let my mom and dad know I can't make it home today.  
I just know they'll be worried sick if I don't.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But for the moment...  
I've got a mission to finish,  
so let's see if there's anyone around.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Uhhh, where would we find the people who live here?  
In that building off in the distance, maybe?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Only one way to find out, I guess.  
C'mon!  
 Just a little more work, and we're home free!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Mrguahh?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Owww...  
Talk about a total faceplant.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I guess I was so relieved to make it here  
that I let my guard down.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I wasn't paying attention, and I tripped up in the wet mud.  
Urgh... I'm such an idiot.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Bleghh...  
I fell face-first into a muddy puddle, too...  
Now I'm covered in the stuff.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Well, not that I was very clean in the first place,  
after our trek through the mountains...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
B-but I can't go and meet our clients  
in a state like this, can I?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
What now?  
I need to find a change of clothes...  
You don't think there are any shops around here, do you?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
If there's a little gift shop or something,  
they might at least have some shirts...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? You'll go ask the people at the farm  
if they've got anything I could use?  
Well, uh, I appreciate it, but...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Oh...?  
You actually know a girl who lives here  
who looks like she'd be just my size?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So you'll see if she's got any spare clothes I could borrow?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
All right! Thanks a bunch!  
I'll just wait here and try to wash some of this dirt off in the stream!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Urgh...  
It's like I can't do anything without his help today.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
If I'd been on my own, I'd've failed this mission for sure...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'm such a hopeless failure.  
How am I gonna be a hero if I'm the one who needs saving?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Oh...  
Looks like {player}'s back already.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
You sure didn't take long!  
Didja find me some clothes already?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
That's amazing!  
You're pretty slick when it comes to helping people!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...Hmm?  
Uhhh, {player}?  
What the heck's that outfit you're holding there?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I-it's got more frills than fabric...  
And... something about it looks really familiar...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ahh!  
 It's Bella-Lou!  
That's totally Magical Girl Bella-Lou's outfit!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
What's a costume like that  
doing out here on a farm in the mountains?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Oh...?  
That friend you mentioned, a girl called Rin,  
won it as some sort of prize?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
She didn't want to wear it, but throwing it away seemed wrong,  
so she said we oughtta take it off her hands?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wh-what are we, the garbage disposal crew?  
So you, uh... want me to... *wear* this thing?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
H-hasn't she got anything more normal I could wear?!  
I know it's hard to refuse such a generous offer, but still...!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It'll look great on you.  
**Choice: (2)**  It beats being covered in mud.  
`Tag 1`  
**Matsuri：**  
Uergh...  
Y-you think so?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I mean, you know me...  
This kind of girly stuff's not my style at all!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Have you *seen* how many frills are on this thing?!  
And I've never been a big fan of skirts...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'll just look like a cross-dressing boy!  
I don't wanna make a fool of myself...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Th... that's not true at all?  
You're sure I'll look really cute?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Really, though?  
Are you sure you're not just saying that?  
Can I actually trust you on this?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Matsuri：**  
W-well, I mean, yeah, but...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Actually, how's showing up in a costume for kids  
any better than being covered in mud?!  
They're both totally unprofessional!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I came here on an official mission for Nightmare!  
I can't show up looking like a clown!  
But... it *is* my own dumb fault that I got all dirty...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Matsuri：**  
Urgh.  
I guess I've got no choice.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Gotta grin and bear it!  
A hero never runs from any challenge!  
If I have to become Magical Girl Bella-Lou, so be it.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Bella-Lou is a defender of justice just like Tora Tiger!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So if I transform into her,  
that's basically a dream come true, right?  
Yeah. I'm just gonna keep telling myself that.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
W-well then, I'm gonna get changed.  
I've gotta strip, clean off this mud in the stream,  
and wipe myself down with a towel...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So don't you dare look this way till I say the word, got that?

**Matsuri：**  
Ummm, {player}...  
I finished getting changed.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Urgh...  
I'm so embarrassed I could die!  
My head's about to explode!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I never get this embarrassed when I do Tora Tiger impressions...  
What makes this so different?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Uwahh?  
{player},  
 why the round of applause?  
  
![100500602.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/100500602.webp)  
**Matsuri：**  
Y-you think it suits me? It's really cute?  
E... eheheh...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
W-wait, huh?  
Why're you looking at me with that...  
starry-eyed gaze of anticipation?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Oh... Right.  
Since I just transformed, I guess a catchphrase *is* in order...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Magical girls are just like heroes in that way!  
When you transform, you gotta do it with style!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hahah...  
Actually, y'know, since we saw that Bella-Lou show the other day...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I've become a bit of a fan,  
so I did try my hand at doing a few impressions!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
If I hadn't met you that day,  
I don't think I'd ever have realized I like this stuff.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I was so stubbornly sure that girly stuff wasn't for me,  
I almost ended up missing out.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So I guess I owe you one.  
Thanks!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
No,  
 I should show my gratitude  
by putting on a hero act just for you!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
\"As long as you have love in your heart,  
my bell will bring you good fortune!\"  
  
**Matsuri：**  
\"Hi there, everybody!  
It's me,  
 Magical Girl Bella-Lou! ☆\"  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eh... eheheh...  
He's clapping like he just saw the world's best performance.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'm still embarrassed to death,  
but I guess maybe this was worth it.  
Mission successful! I live to fight another day!  
  
![100500603.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/100500603.webp)  
**Matsuri：**  
Wait, wait, wait!  
I'm not wearing my hat right now...  
so aren't my animal ears in full view?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Even {player} must have noticed  
that I'm a beastgirl now!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wh-what should I do?  
Aaargh... It's just one disaster after another!
