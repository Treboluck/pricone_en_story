## Subtitle: It's a Pinky Promise!
  
**Matsuri：**  
I... I'm coming in!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh?  
Isn't there anyone around?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hello~?  
I'm visiting from Nightmare, and I've got  
business with a guy called {player} who's living here!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Whoa! {player}!  
Phew. I thought you might not be home!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eheheh.  
Thanks again for all your help the other day.  
Hiking up to the farm with me and stuff, I mean.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Thanks to you, I managed to complete my mission  
and impress the guys back at Nightmare!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But putting that aside...  
I thought I'd probably find you here  
'cause Tomo told me this is where you're staying.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ummm... Is this a good time for you?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I see!  
You don't have any jobs today, so you're basically free.  
Just what I wanted to hear!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
In that case...  
Sorry about this, but you gotta let me attack you!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Don't worry, I'll use the flat side of my sword!  
You probably won't die or anything!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Now, prepare yourself!  
Take this! Super... Tiger Slash!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Dodge.  
**Choice: (2)**  Stand and take it.  
`Tag 1`  
**Matsuri：**  
Whoaaa?!  
Hey! You're not s'posed to dodge!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
If you move, I might hit you in the wrong spot!  
Worst case, I could end up killing you!  
So I need you to hold still!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Matsuri：**  
Whoa...  
You're just gonna accept it  
without even asking the reason why?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Impressive! You're a man among men!  
Well, can't let your courage go to waste.  
I'd better hit you with all I've got!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wuooghh?!  
Urgh! I failed!  
My sword hit the wall instead of you!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I haven't actually been trained in indoor fighting yet...  
I wasn't ready for that!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
H... huh?  
The blade's stuck in the wall, and I can't get it out! What a pain!  
Hrrrnnnnghh!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Matsuri：**  
...Hmmm.  
{player}, you're looking a bit unsure about all this.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Like you don't know why you're being attacked.  
Well, I guess there's no way you *would* know.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I didn't think it was worth explaining,  
since you're just gonna forget it afterwards...  
But I guess that wasn't very upstanding of me.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So, um...  
You're suffering from amnesia, right?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Amnesia plots come up a lot in hero stories, so I know the drill.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
You hit your head or whatever,  
and lose all your memories up till that point, right?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
And I heard you're working hard to get your memories back.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So, uh, as thanks for all the help you gave me...  
I thought I'd give you a hand!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
The usual pattern in hero stories  
is that the memories come back in the same way they were lost!  
It tends to be triggered by hitting your head on something!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So that's why I was trying to hit you really hard just now.  
A good whack to the head should bring your memories back!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...Hmm? What's that face for?  
I'll have you know heroes are the source of all the world's wisdom!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
If I follow their teachings,  
I know I can solve any problem!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So it's time for me to whack you on the head!  
Let's get your memories back right now!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I hope you're ready!  
Hyaaahhhh!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Urgh... Why are you dodging?!  
Huh? You don't think that's a good reason to hit someone?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
And you don't wanna get hurt?  
Well... that does make sense.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Bah...  
I really thought I might be able to get your memories back...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
And even if it didn't do that,  
I thought it might at least make you forget  
what you saw the other day...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? Was the magical girl costume really that embarrassing?  
Well, yeah, I thought I was gonna blush to death,  
but that's not what I wanted you to forget!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
You must've seen the ears that were on top of my head  
back there, right? That's what I need you to forget.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
If I can't knock the memories out of you,  
you've gotta promise me you won't tell anyone!  
I'm begging you here!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
As you must've guessed, I'm a beastgirl.  
But the guild I belong to, Nightmare,  
has always been at odds with beastfolk.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
If they find out what I really am,  
I'll be in big trouble.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
In the worst case...  
 The people I call my comrades  
might end up attacking me as an enemy.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
And that would really hurt.  
I don't want it to come to that. I couldn't bear it...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So please, {player}!  
Promise me you won't say a word!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
If you can't promise me that...  
I'll have no choice but to thwack you on the head  
till those memories go away!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I thought long and hard,  
but I couldn't come up with any other way!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Whaaa?  
Um, {player}?  
Why're you suddenly hugging me like that?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh?  
 \"It must've been so tough\"?  
\"Don't worry, I swear I won't tell a soul\"...?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Y-you really mean that?  
You'll keep the fact that I'm a beastgirl  
a secret from everyone?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...OK.  
 I believe you.  
You've always been a good guy.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
You wouldn't lie to me.  
'Cause you're just like  
 a defender of justice out of a story!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'm real sorry, {player}.  
For trying to hit you and stuff...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Trying to solve my problems with violence  
isn't heroic at all.  
I might as well be a dirty villain.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But I really didn't know what I oughtta do...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...Eheheh.  
I'm glad it was you that found out my secret.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Let's make it official.  
You gotta pinky swear that you won't breathe a word of this!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
It's a pinky promise~♪  
Never to be broken till the day we die! ♪  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hmm?  
Wha...? Why're you thanking me now?  
It's me that should be grateful!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Oh...  
You know how it feels to lose your memories,  
so you don't wanna forget anything ever again.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
That's why you hated the idea  
of me thwacking those memories out of you.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So... you're thanking me for letting you keep them.  
That's what you meant.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eheheh.  
I guess what I was doing was crueler than I realized.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I've learned my lesson.  
I'm gonna turn over a new leaf  
and be a good girl from now on!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? \"You've always been a good girl\"...?  
No, I've still got a long way to go!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eheheh.  
I just want to better myself as a person.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hey, {player}.  
If you wouldn't mind, could I help you get your old memories back?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Actually, I wanna help with all sorts of things.  
Whatever you need me for, just say the word!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
There might not be a whole lot I can do right now...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But now that we share a secret, we're best buds!  
And best buds are always there for each other!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Any hero could tell you that!
