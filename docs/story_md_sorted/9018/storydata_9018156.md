**Karyl：**  
*huff*... *puff*... We did it...  
That big brute was... pretty tough...  
If this is just our first day... this job's gonna be a real struggle...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
For an animal, it was pretty handy with a weapon...  
The monsters here seem more ferocious than Landosol's, too.  
Maybe it isn't quite the paradise of opportunity we were hoping for?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahh...! That thing's sneaking around and picking stuff up again!  
It's gonna run off with a pile of treasure if we're not careful!  
Hey! Get back here, monster! Pecorine, after it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh...?  
Oh! Right!  
Wait right there, you rascally thief!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, you fought admirably. The village will surely be safe now.  
Doing battle so soon after our long voyage... You must be very tired.  
I will prepare a meal at the village, so let us rest ourselves for today.
