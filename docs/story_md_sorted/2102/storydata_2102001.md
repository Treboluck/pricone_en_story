### Place: Landosol: Diner
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Still, I must say,  
 far too much about this situation remains unclear.  
The young boy's objective... the strange new forms you both took...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It sounded like Peco knew something about all this...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah, and she's been keeping us waiting long enough!  
We need to hear the details,  
so can you two finish your meals already?!  
  
**Yui：**  
I... I'm so sorryyyy!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Just a bit more! Hold on just a minute longer, Karyl!  
Just till I finish this peperoncino pasta, crab stir-fry, onion gratin,  
and three more plates of tuna sushi!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...My lord, Miss Sheffy.  
You have eaten your fill most wonderfully.  
Well done to you both.  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Yay!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Yay!  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well then, please join me in giving thanks to Lady Ameth.  
Thank you for the food.  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Thankoo for food!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Thankoo for food!  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Thanks for the food! ♪  
Mmm~!  
 It feels great to eat my fill  
without worrying about food tasters or manners! ♪  
  
**Yui：**  
Ahhh...  
Th-thanks for the meal...  
  
**Rei：**  
Yui...  
 Is your stomach all right after all that?  
I'm honestly worried that it might burst...  
  
**Yui：**  
Y-yeah... I'm actually fine.  
I don't really understand how...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Isn't it the funniest feeling?  
When I first used my Royal Equipment,  
I was all \"This is crazy! ☆\"  
 at my own appetite too!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I don't think Yui used any special equipment like yours...  
Does this mean the same thing happened to her for a different reason?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Another reason...  
 Then the obvious candidate  
would have to be that strange new form she assumed,  
 I presume.  
  
**Rei：**  
Yes.  
The boost in power was phenomenal...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Mmmm~! ♪  
This fruity anmitsu dessert has never tasted better! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, you!  
Less eating, more explaining!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh—yes, of course!  
 It's a new, upgraded stage  
of {player}'s Princess Knight powers  
called a Princess Form!  
 ...Or so I'm told! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A \"Princess Form\"...  
So it was indeed my lord who granted you that strength.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But what do you mean, \"so you're told\"?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It was Neneka who came up with the name.  
\"Since we'll need a way to refer to it,\" she said.  
  
**Yui：**  
Neneka is, um...  
that girl who helped us out before in the Kaiser battle—  
she's one of the Seven Crowns...  
 right?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What details precisely did Miss Neneka provide you with?  
Was there anything about my lord's current state?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes!  
I only learned that you'd all been imprisoned  
because Neneka snuck into the palace in disguise to tell me...  
  

---  
  
**Narration：**  
A few hours earlier...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Thank you for the meat bun! It was the yummiest!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So, um... What exactly are you here about?  
If you snuck past all the palace security,  
I'm guessing you've got something important to tell me?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Well, yes.  
I suppose I should begin by getting directly to the point.  
  
**Neneka：**  
The world is in peril, Your Majesty.  
And {player} may be the only one who can save it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huhhhh?!  
The whole world's in peril?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And... did you say only {player} can save it?  
I'm not sure if he can do much saving right now...  
He's more likely to wield a pacifier than a sword,  
 to be honest!  
  
**Neneka：**  
True enough.  
I'm quite aware.  
  
**Neneka：**  
In the first place...  
The fact that he is still alive is nothing short of a miracle.  
Shouldn't you know that very well, Your Majesty?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes... you're right.  
In the battle with the Kaiser... he shielded me with his own body...  
For a little while, I really thought we'd lost him forever...  
  
**Neneka：**  
I suspect it was none other than Akira Mosakuji...  
no, the woman known as Labyrista who wrought that miracle.  
  
**Neneka：**  
But using incompatible powers comes with a price.  
To be entirely frank,  
your young friend has suffered damage to his very soul.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whaaa...?  
I-it's his soul that's hurt?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Yes, his soul.  
The source of magical energy and core of the mind.  
The central element that gives rise to Shadows...  
  
**Neneka：**  
I did a little of my own research...  
but it seems that no effective treatment exists.  
To begin with, suffering damage to the soul is extremely rare...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No way...  
But then what can we do to bring him back to normal?  
  
**Neneka：**  
For his linguistic abilities and mental capacity...  
They can be relearned, or some manner of trigger could cause them  
to repair themselves. I wouldn't even mind teaching him myself.  
  
**Neneka：**  
However... He'll never be completely the same as before.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Ahhh...  
  
**Neneka：**  
...I don't only mean that in a bad way.  
His Princess Knight ability has become more powerful...  
I believe you've experienced that firsthand, Your Majesty.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Yes. It's thanks to the increased power he gave me  
that I was able to protect everyone  
from the Kaiser's all-out attack.  
  
**Neneka：**  
This upgraded form of the power he bestows...  
Yes, let's see.  
Why don't we call it a \"Princess Form\"?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A Princess Form...  
  
**Neneka：**  
In the days to come, {player} and all of you  
will need to draw out the full potential of that new power.  
  
**Neneka：**  
If you hope to save this world,  
 that is.
