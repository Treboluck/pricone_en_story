# Interlude 1
After the battle, the group enjoys a hearty meal. They form an alliance with Twilight Caravan, and Nanaka tries to attain a Princess Form of her own. But it fails, instead shrinking her to the size of a fairy, and everyone is more mystified than ever.

**Kokkoro：**  
*munch munch*... *munch munch*...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*gobble gobble*... *chomp chomp*...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Phew...  
Thank you for the meal.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Sure you've had enough, Kokkoro?  
This seafood bowl looks super delicious as well! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Ahh...  
  
**Yui：**  
Urghhh... I shouldn't be eating at this time at all, but...!  
Ahhh, I just can't stop!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...I am terribly sorry.  
May I ask for just... one more bowl?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*snarf snarf*... *nom nom*...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Watching Pecorine stuff her face just bores me now,  
but Koro eating just as much right next to her  
is a little bit scary...  
  
**Rei：**  
The aftereffects of the Princess Form, huh...?  
According to Labyrista, it's just because {player}  
isn't used to this power yet, but...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
D'you think Yui and Peco transforming back so fast  
was because of that, too...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
We could use an answer to that.  
If we don't get used to using {player}'s power,  
the battles ahead will be tough for sure...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I hadn't seen my \"test subject\" for a little while,  
but to think he'd ended up like this...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ah, what a crying shame!  
After my love returned to an infant state,  
I may have had the chance to make him imprint upon me...!  
  
**Eriko：**  
...No, it's still not too late to try.  
If I whisper my name over and over  
right next to his sweet sleeping face...!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Yes, yes... We don't want to wake him up, so I think that's enough.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Eheheh! ☆  
At times like this, the classic trope is to draw stuff on his face! ☆  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Still...  
I know heroes are cursed with troubled fates,  
but personally I have to hope the true Sigurd will return to us soon...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
While his words are limited to those of a child,  
how can we converse together of the deeper secrets we share?!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Well, yes...  
I wouldn't mind taking this chance to dabble in pediatrics...  
But seeking a cure for damage to the soul sounds far more exciting!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*sigh*...  
Even though we had already eaten dinner,  
it seems that I've consumed far more than my fill...  
  
**Yui：**  
Urghhh...  
I barely even got to fight,  
so why's the hunger part as strong as ever?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Thanks for the food! ♪  
Man, chowing down is even more fun  
when I have friends to compete with! ☆  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
...Say, princess of the Gourmet Guild.  
I have a small proposition for you. Would you care to listen?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm? What's this now?  
Oh—if it's about the bill, you don't need to worry! ♪  
We're not splitting it—I'm gonna charge my share to the palace!  
  
**Karyl：**  
If we were splitting bills, nobody in their right mind  
would come anywhere near a diner with you...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
So listen.  
About our friend {player}...  
Would you be willing to let us assist with restoring him to normal?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
You know, as an unlicensed doctor, I do a lot of research.  
I may be able to find hints in areas that don't usually see the light of day.  
And after all our experiments, I'm extremely familiar with his body... ♪  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ahh...!  
I couldn't possibly let Mitsuki handle such important research alone!  
I insist that you allow me to assist as well.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
There could be a hint or three in my tome collection, too! ☆  
I swear... I won't rest till this mystery is solved! The game is afoot!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hmm.  
Seems like my girls are all raring to go.  
  
**Ruka：**  
What do you say, Rei?  
We could try pursuing the same target  
in a field other than fishing for once.  
  
**Rei：**  
Personally, I'd welcome the idea...  
But what do you say, Gourmet Guild members?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh, I'd love to have your help! ☆  
Neneka's looking into it for us too,  
but the more people on the case, the better! ♪  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Yes, you can leave this to us!  
 The contract is bound!  
I shall restore Sigurd to his primal form!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Aw yeah! ☆ Then for starters...  
!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Here comes Lovely Nanaka!  
Let's try a transformation, shall we?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
...Nanaka?  
What's this now...?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Like, for reals, as a magic nerd, I can't miss a chance to nab a new form!  
Wake up! Wake up, {player}!  
This ain't no time for sleeping!  
 Believe it!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  ...?  
`Tag 1`  
**Karyl：**  
Um, are you mad?  
We still hardly know a thing about this ability!  
If you force him into it, who knows what'll happen?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
No objections!  
I'll show you the power of courage! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Can you try listening to me?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Change! Princess Foooorm! ♪

**Nanaka：**  
...Oh?  
Whoooaaaa?!  
It's over 9000!!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Urgh! She beat me to it!  
  
**Eriko：**  
I'm so jealous...!  
My turn must be next!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
...Hm?  
Hmm?  
This feels... a little bit weird...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hmm?  
What's wrong, Nanaka?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Could the energy have gone out of control?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Huhhhh?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahhh, geez! What did I try to tell you?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Bl... bl... bl bl...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Bloooork!

Ohhh... that's so cute!  
Wait, forget cute!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Did that girl just get really tiny?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
She's like a fairy! ☆  
I could eat her up in one mouthful!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As we thought... this Princess Form ability is rife with mysteries.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You can say that again.  
Who knows what kind of other risks it comes with?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Ahaha.  
Now, this does seem worth researching! ♪  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Waaahhh!  
Isn't anybody gonna help me become a real girl again?!

A few hours later, Nanaka spontaneously returned to full size.

In a fortress far away from Landosol...

Right now, when I think about {player}...  
it gives me a strange feeling...
