# Part 2: Chapter 2 Episode 11
Dispelling the crystals restraining them, Kokkoro calls her friends to battle once more, until Ranpha retreats out of concern for {player}, who has fallen asleep atop her. Kokkoro, meanwhile, finds herself terribly hungry due to the aftereffects of her new Princess Form.

**Ranpha：**  
...  
A \"Princess Form\"...  
So this... is {player}'s power...?  
  
**Ranpha：**  
Such pure... and lovely radiance...  
It's almost... blinding...  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
Look out!  
Three of them are coming at once!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Worry not.  
I swear I will protect all of you without fail!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That leaves just you alone to face me.  
Miss Ranpha of Rage Legion!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This time, it is my turn to request this of you.  
Please see sense and retreat peacefully.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You will not harm my lord, our friends here, or this city of Landosol.  
I will not allow you to do further harm to any of them!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
If I... could have the choice...  
I'd rather not do any fighting...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
Especially with people like you and {player}...  
who are always so kind...  
...But...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
I'm afraid... these unending voices...  
This awful noise... won't let me rest...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...So I...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Waahhh!  
This looks really dangerous again!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes! This magical energy...  
It might be a match for the Kaiser at full strength!  
How crazy is that?! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Everyone, fall back!  
I will handle this myself!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...!  
  
**Both：**  
Annanaka Infinite Catastrophe!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Turnabout Version!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Waaahhh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
*cough* *cough*...  
An attack spell?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The decrystallized members of Twilight Caravan  
appear to have directed a magical burst at Miss Ranpha...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Um, they kind of blasted all of us away in the impact, too...!  
And now... *cough* *cough*  
...there's so much dust, I can't see anything!  
  
**Yui：**  
...Huh?  
Where's Mr. Knight?  
  
**Rei：**  
He's not here?  
Don't tell me he's gotten lost again?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait, huh?  
Koro, you're not in your Princess Form anymore!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...!  
It's true...  
 Could something have happened to my lord...?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Heeey! Mr. Knight!  
Where did you go?!  
  
**Rei：**  
{player}, please answer us!  
...Hmm...?  
  
**Sheffy：**  
...  
  
**Rei：**  
Was that...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Where are you, {player}?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, geez...!  
I'll just blast this dust away with my magic!

**Ranpha：**  
...Oh...?  
  
**Ranpha：**  
Ummm...  
Have you...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...fallen... asleep...?  
  
![210201102.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/210201102.webp)  
**Ranpha：**  
I'm... supposed to be your enemy...  
But you're so trusting...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
Ahh...  
...So warm...  
  
`image display end`  
**Nanaka：**  
Sha-boom! ☆  
 Here's Nanaka!  
Kinda confused but back in action!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Even if the fires of hell consume this flesh,  
from the ashes I arise triumphant!  
Such is the nature of a true hero!  
  
**Ruka：**  
...Ahh, my shoulders ache.  
That wasn't a pleasant experience...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Thanks to my drugs, you're all fighting fit for now...  
But I hope you're ready for some nasty side effects later! ♪  
  
**Eriko：**  
More importantly... You there!  
Tell me... what are you doing with my one true beloved...?!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...Ahh... You're all back again...  
The very noisy people...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Ranpha!  
Please step away from my lord!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...  
...  
...All right...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
H-huh?  
That was a lot easier than I expected...  
I thought she might try to take him as a hostage.  
  
**Ranpha：**  
Can you all...  
 please try to be... quiet...?  
  
**Ranpha：**  
After all, this boy...  
He's sleeping so very  
 peacefully right now...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Oh, she's right!  
Mr. Knight's fast asleep!  
  
**Yui：**  
I can't blame him.  
Usually, he'd be tucked in bed and dreaming by this time...  
  
**Yui：**  
...Wait, huh?  
Um, that Ranpha girl... Where did she go?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Just now, she disappeared all of a sudden into thin air.  
Like a misty mirage.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
A magical transportation item, perhaps...?  
That's a rare and precious effect...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hah hah hah!  
Clearly she ran in abject terror in the face of our ultimate power!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Hah-hahahah!  
This surely qualifies as a glorious victory for our forces!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ahh... How frustrating.  
For daring to harm us,  
 daring to touch him, and various other crimes,  
I was hoping to slay her where she stood...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
For my own part, to be honest...  
I am relieved that she willingly retreated.  
My Princess Form has already expired, after all...  
  
**Rei：**  
True enough.  
We've yet to see the full extent of her strength.  
If the battle had continued, who knows what may have happened...  
  
**Rei：**  
...Ah—but wait!  
  
**Yui：**  
Rei? Is something wrong?  
  
**Rei：**  
Just now, I thought I saw Sheffy standing in these shadows...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Aw, don't be silly, Rei!  
Why would she be here?  
  
**Rei：**  
Ahh...  
She's... not here.  
Perhaps I did imagine it...  
  
**Yui：**  
Yeah.  
Sheffy should still be fast asleep in bed, after all!  
  
**Rei：**  
True enough.  
She can't have been here...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmmm... This was a pretty big commotion.  
I expect the knights of Nightmare  
and the nobles' troops will be showing up soon.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ugh...  
We've got nothing to hide, but... I'd rather not stick around.  
Who'd want to see Gorschin's ugly mug before bed?  
  
**Eriko：**  
We would also prefer not to attract the attention of such guilds.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Indeed! We are denizens of the darkness!  
Eternally opposed to all authorities!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And then we have Miss Pecorine...  
Should you even be here away from the palace?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, I already found a solution for that! ♪  
But listen, Kokkoro—  
thank you so much!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yep, yep!  
If it weren't for Kokkoro, we'd have been in so much trouble!  
  
**Rei：**  
Yes, you fought most bravely for us...  
 Hm?  
  
**Rei：**  
What's wrong?  
Kokkoro, your face is looking pale...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...I am terribly sorry.  
I have been doing my best to bear the strain for a while, but...  
I fear I may have reached my limit.  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh?!  
Are you okay, Kokkoro?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Koro..?!  
Did the monsters get you?  
Tell us these things sooner!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
No, I have not sustained any damage...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But ever since assuming my Princess Form,  
I feel... more hungry than I have ever known.  
A level of strain verging on \"perpetually peckish\"... Yes...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Perhaps you should call me \"Peccoro\"...
