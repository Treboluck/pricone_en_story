### Place: Landosol City: Downtown
  
**Narration：**  
A few days later, in the downtown streets of Landosol...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Okay, are you ready? You might feel a tiny sting.  
  
**Boy：**  
Ah... aahhh...!  
  
**Girl：**  
Big Bro, you can do it!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
...Ahaha. It's all done.  
You did very well. What a good boy.  
  
**Boy：**  
Ahhhh...!  
That...  
 didn't even hurt!  
  
**Girl：**  
Wow, Big Bro! You're amazing!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
There was monster venom in the wound, so it'll still take time to heal,  
but you're looking much better now.  
Tell your mother I gave my regards.  
  
**Girl：**  
Dr. Mitsuki!  
 Thank you so much!  
  
**Boy：**  
...But, Dr. Mitsuki...  
Our mom and dad don't have much money...  
And we're still fixing our house after the monsters smashed it...  
  
**Girl：**  
So instead of money...  
Can you use me and Big Bro as your \"guinea pigs\"?! Please!  
  
**Boy：**  
Yeah!  
We'll take any nasty injections  
and drink any bitter medicines you want!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
...I see, I see!  
You're such good kids! I'm touched.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
But... the medicine I'm testing now is only for adults.  
So we'll have to wait until you're a little older! ♪  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh—little ones!  
If you're heading home, take this with you!  
  
**Girl：**  
Whoa!  
 Fresh fish!  
  
**Boy：**  
Can we really have all these?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
I fished up a few dozen too many.  
We won't be able to eat them all, so it'll help a lot if you take some!  
  
**Girl：**  
Thanks, Miss Ruka!  
  
**Boy：**  
We'll eat lots and lots and grow up super fast!  
Then we can be Dr. Mitsuki's \"guinea pigs\"!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Those little ones were the last of today's patients.  
You should take a rest.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Thank you, Eriko. You've been so helpful.  
  
**Eriko：**  
You're very welcome, Mitsuki.  
  
**Eriko：**  
After the battle with the Kaiser, the injured filled the streets.  
It was like a wartime field hospital...  
But lately, things have calmed down a lot.  
  
**Ruka：**  
That's what happens when you have a good doctor at work.  
The downtown citizens are all grateful. How's about it?  
You could drop the illicit angle and be a regular local physician.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
A doctor of shining justice!  
Ooh, so blinding!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
It's a tempting thought... but I'll pass.  
My real calling will always be experiments and research.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
This medical aid is just my way of testing  
how effective my knowledge and medicines can be in the field.  
And also...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Also... well, yes.  
Young {player}'s good nature can be infectious.  
But if I said that... what would Eriko think, I wonder?  
 Hee hee hee...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Still, I have to say...  
My archnemesis the Institute has fallen silent,  
and even our lead on the Twilight City proved to be a deception...!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
With all this peace, my Evil Eye will be obscured by the mists of disuse!  
Where will I find new inspiration for my writi—  
I mean, world-shaking exploits to thrill my soul?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
In other words:  
 lol, we're so bored!  
Though it's no laughing matter...  
Aw, there's gotta be something fun to do!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Something fun, you say...  
 Well, let's see.  
Shall we visit a hot spring together again?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Oh, that sounds lovely!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Yes, a splendid thought!  
Although... hot springs are nice,  
but I feel like  
 the sea is calling me next!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Oh, Rukie!  
You just wanna do more fishing, don'tcha? ☆  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Wha—?!  
Hold the ring-a-ling!  
Did we just catch a whopper?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
From the sound of that impact...  
It would need to be a Kraken, at the very least.  
  
**Ruka：**  
In the middle of town?  
 Well, that wouldn't be pretty.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Is it the Institute?!  
Or perhaps... the Syndicate arises once more?!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Guys! Over there!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Is it... a bird?! An airship?!  
No...  
 It's a flying Dragontooth Warrior!  
 ...I think?  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
A skeletal Wyvern...?  
But those aren't real dragon bones.  
They're made of a mineral substance... More like a type of golem.  
  
**Eriko：**  
But whyever would such a beast be here?  
A lingering minion of the Omniscient Kaiser, perhaps...?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Analyzing can wait!  
If that hulking thing goes wild here,  
it'll wreck the whole district! Let's move!  
  
**Eriko：**  
...You leave me no choice.  
I'll have to crush your bones to dust!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Ruka & Eriko：**  
...?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
It deflected Eriko's mighty axe?!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Even Ruka's blades left no scratch...  
We're not dealing with a feeble minion.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Eriko：**  
...Aaaghhh!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Eriko!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Honestly... How aggravating...!  
A mere pile of bones dares resist my will to destroy...?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Worse still, it has no vitals or even eyes to target!  
What a tricky opponent to handle!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Ruka, Eriko!  
Let's buy the others some time to cast their incantations!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Demonic Salvation: Infinity! Standby!  
Torrents of mana, flood forth from my Evil Eye...!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Primordial mana, mana of flaming darkness... I name thee...  
  
**Ruka：**  
...!  
I'm on it, Mitsuki!  
  
**Eriko：**  
And yet... we may not hold up for long!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Haahhhh! Bloody Rose!  
My deadly thorns will strangle the life from you!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Annie-girl!  
Time for the you-know-what!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Very well!  
Let us unveil the fruits of our arcane trials!  
The time is ripe to release the seal!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Final Mix Spell!  
  
**Both：**  
Annanaka Infinite Catastrophe!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
...FEVEEEER!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
*pant*... *pant*... Did we get 'em?!  
Wait, would that be a \"no-we-didn't\" flag?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Heh... Far too easy!  
...is what I'd like to say, but...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Eriko, are you all right?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Thank you very much.  
...Don't worry. I can handle a few scratches.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Looks like we've all strained ourselves.  
Well then, I'll treat you all back at the—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Wha...?! A new foe?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Guehhh?!  
I knew saying that line was a rookie mistake!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Monsters just like the last... and five of them?!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
But it took all our powers combined just to overpower one...!  
  
**Ruka：**  
I don't like those odds.  
...And yet!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Heh... Eheheheh...  
This time, I'll crush the very marrow of your crystal bones!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Ahhh... We can't fire another twin attack...  
But Hecate of the Gale knows not the name of retreat!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
As a scientist, I'd like to make a logical withdrawal...  
But as a doctor, no can do.  
There are still patients of mine in this district.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Twilight Caravan is a guild unmatched!  
As if we'd let a brainless pile of sparkly bones scare us off!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...Ahh...  
  
**Eriko：**  
...?  
That girl over there...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Are these Dragontooth Warrior clones obeying her commands...?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Then would that make her the source of this unrest?  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
All of... you...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
Could you try... to be a little quieter...?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Ruka：**  
A fine joke!  
As if you didn't cause this commotion yourself!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Indeed!  
Demon who violates my domain, the flames of Gehenna will claim you!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Everyone, on your guard.  
Her magical energy... It's denser than I've ever seen.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
What's more, she's got an unparalleled introvert aura!  
No social outcast escapes the notice of Nanaka!  
 Kyu-pi-ping!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...Ahh...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
I only... want you... to be quiet...  
But you won't listen...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Look out!  
She's about to attack!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
Well then...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...Goodbye...
