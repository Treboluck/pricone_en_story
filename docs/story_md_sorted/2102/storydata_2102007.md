### Place: ???
  
**Narration：**  
In a certain fortress, far away from Landosol...  
  

---  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...  
...  
...*sigh*...  
  
**???：**  
Oh, Ra~npha! ♪  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...Ahh...?!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...Um, Misora...?  
  
**Misora：**  
Eheheh. Welcome home, Ranpha! ★  
  
**Ranpha：**  
Ohhh...  
Hugging me when I've... just transported here...  
gives me... such a surprise...  
  
**Misora：**  
Tee-hee! ★ I'm so sorry~! ♪  
Ooh, but listen—you won't go turning me into a jade crystal, will you?  
  
**Ranpha：**  
No...  
I don't even know if I could...  
  
**Misora：**  
Hey, hey, Ranpha! How was Landosol?  
You went to check it out, right?  
  
**Ranpha：**  
Well, ah...  
It was very... noisy.  
  
**Misora：**  
Oh, is that all?  
Well, that's a shame! ★  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...Oh!  
 But... you know...  
I did find... someone.  
One boy who might... listen to... my song...  
  
**Misora：**  
Ohhh~?  
Did you really, Ranpha? ♪  
Does that mean...  
  
**???：**  
Ho ho ho!  
You young ladies certainly seem to be having fun.  
  
**Misora：**  
Oh! ♪  
Hello there, Azold! ★  
And of course... you too, Zane! ♪  
  
**Zane：**  
Excuse our intrusion.  
  
**Ranpha：**  
Y-you aren't intruding...  
It's us who should be...  
 very sorry...  
We were... being so noisy...  
  
**Azold：**  
No, no!  
We disturbed you young ladies from your delightful chat.  
Please accept my apologies.  
  
**Kariza：**  
Hah! Who're you calling delightful young ladies?  
All I see is a gloomy, muttering moron  
and a cackling ditz with perfume for brains!  
  
**Misora：**  
Ooh!  
 You're so cheeky, Kariza!  
Nobody likes a boy who says things like that, you know?  
Right, Ranpha~?  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...Mm...  
But... I can't really deny...  
that I am... very gloomy...  
  
**Kariza：**  
Don't just accept it!  
You goin' for Miss Gloomy of the Year?!  
  
**Zane：**  
...Kariza.  
Don't antagonize comrades without reason.  
  
**Kariza：**  
\"Comrades\"?  
These losers...?  
 Hah!  
  
**Misora：**  
Oh, Kariza, you naughty boy!  
Why can't we all get along?  
  
**Azold：**  
A fine point. Though each of us pursues a wish that is  
his or hers alone, our methods align. As such, is it not wisest  
to remain companionable until we reach our goals?  
  
**Kariza：**  
...Well, if you say so.  
But if anyone tries to jump the gun, I'll murder 'em myself!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
I... I wouldn't... do that...  
  
**Zane：**  
The sorcery to grant our aims is already in our hands.  
All that's left is to offer sacrifices to the cauldron  
and place it on the fire.  
  
**Kariza：**  
Why you gotta talk in riddles, Zane?!  
It ain't tricky. We've just gotta crush Landosol  
and burn the whole place to the ground, right?!  
  
**Azold：**  
Ho ho ho.  
Young Kariza, I'm afraid that answer would only earn you half credit.  
  
**Misora：**  
Yes, that's true!  
What would be the use in cooking up an empty cauldron?  
  
**Kariza：**  
Yeah, yeah, I know!  
Quit picking at details! Geez!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...K-Kariza...?  
Where are... you going?  
  
**Kariza：**  
...For a walk.  
And I guess I oughtta give my dumb pets a workout, too!  
Getting their asses kicked like that... Useless morons!  
  
**Kariza：**  
Hey, idiot slimes!  
You three're coming too!  
I'll give you a workout along with the others!  
  
**Slimes：**  
*wibble wobble*  
  
**Misora：**  
Don't bully them too much, okay~?  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...  
...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...B-but...  
Um, Misora...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
Landosol does... need to be destroyed, doesn't it...?  
  
**Misora：**  
Oh—well, yes.  
Like any recipe, what matters is the order! ♪  
  
**Zane：**  
Misora. Azold.  
What have you learned so far of the Seven Crowns' whereabouts?  
  
**Azold：**  
Sadly enough, I have little to report.  
Regina Geas is affiliated with the guild Nightmare...  
But it seems she's away on a journey to pastures unknown.  
  
**Misora：**  
As for the Metamorph Monarch, she's been active in Landosol lately...  
But like her name says, she can take any form she wants.  
Catch the tiger by the tail,  
 and it'll be a lizard's before you know it!  
  
**Azold：**  
Some may not be in \"this\" world,  
and we can't even confirm all of their aliases.  
The one solid lead we do have...  
  
**Zane：**  
...is the Omniscient Kaiser, closely guarded beneath the palace.  
  
**Misora：**  
I'm really sorry, Zane! I wish I could be more helpful...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
Yes, I'm... sorry... too.  
I'm afraid...  
 finding people isn't really my...  
  
**Zane：**  
On that particular front, Kariza and I are little better.  
We're hardly suited for gathering information.  
  
**Azold：**  
Ho ho ho.  
Covering one another's weaknesses is the mark of a healthy guild!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...  
  
**Misora：**  
...Ranpha?  
  
**Ranpha：**  
U-um, I...  
I'm always like this, so...  
I think... I'm just holding you all back...  
  
**Misora：**  
Ohhh~?  
That's not true at all!  
I'm a huge fan of your lovely songs! ★  
  
**Ranpha：**  
Thank you... Misora...  
...But...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
That's why... I think...  
I'll do what... I can, at least...  
  
**Misora：**  
Ahh~! Wait for me, silly!  
Why don't we both grab a meal before we go out? ★  
  
**Zane：**  
...  
  
**Azold：**  
Ho ho ho.  
Youngsters are always so impatient!  
My attendants were in the process of preparing tea for us all...  
  
**Zane：**  
If it will suffice, I'll join you.  
  
**Azold：**  
Oh! Well, I certainly appreciate your kind consideration.  
But of course—you too are a great deal younger than this old man!  
I'm sorry to trouble you.  
  
**Zane：**  
You deserve the respect of your years.  
Please don't defer to me.  
  
**Azold：**  
No, no. This is just the way I like to act!  
Besides, it is equally true that here in Rage Legion,  
you're the one who ably leads us as guildmaster!  
  
**Zane：**  
I'm a leader here in name only.  
To be entirely frank, I'd like to ask you  
for any insight you have on our situation.  
  
**Azold：**  
...Hmm.  
Thanks to you especially, this guild knows no equal in military might.  
And on top of that, we have the support of a powerful sponsor.  
  
**Azold：**  
If I do still have any worries... The culprit would be our own lack of trust.  
An alliance as flimsy as hastily counterfeited bills!  
  
**Zane：**  
Yes...  
Our guild was only brought together by the promise of a wish.  
There's little else to bind us.  
  
**Zane：**  
The lamentations of countless players will only grant a single wish, for now.  
If we're to avoid internal conflict, we'll need to increase that number...  
  
**Azold：**  
Indeed.  
As young Kariza said just now,  
the risk of others \"jumping the gun\" is a sorry burden!  
  
**Zane：**  
Kariza's an honest boy.  
In that respect, he offers us what we otherwise lack.  
  
**Azold：**  
Haha, very true.  
It's a fine thing to cover one another's weaknesses.  
However...  
  
**Azold：**  
We members of Rage Legion are five in number.  
If each of those five harbors a different wish...  
  
![210200701.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/210200701.webp)  
**Zane：**  
Then in our hunt for Crowns... we're still four short.  
That's where we stand.  
  
**Azold：**  
Yes.  
Another wish shall be granted for each new Crown we ensnare.  
  
**Azold：**  
That's the level of power our noble sponsor possesses.
