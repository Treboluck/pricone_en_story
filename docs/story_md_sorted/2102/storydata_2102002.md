# Part 2: Chapter 2 Episode 2
Neneka predicts that the guild Rage Legion, which has conquered the criminal underworld of Astraea, will someday mount an attack on Landosol. Amidst worries of their enemies' movements and the side effects of their Princess Forms, Labyrista appears among them.
  
## Subtitle: Neneka's Intuition
  
**Pecorine：**  
Neneka...  
You said this whole world is in peril,  
but what did you mean?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Do you remember, Your Majesty?  
At the end of your battle, Mana gave you a message  
before losing consciousness.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Of course I do.  
A warning that we'd soon have to face  
this world's \"true villain\"...  
  
**Neneka：**  
Yes...  
All the schemes that Mana pursued were in preparation to face this foe.  
Our own attempts to resist were trivial in comparison.  
  
**Neneka：**  
But sadly, the imprisoned Mana remains unconscious.  
Even I have no way to learn this villain's nature,  
or what threat they may truly pose...  
  
**Neneka：**  
But I have found a warning sign.  
Or at least, I believe I have.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A sign...  
  
**Neneka：**  
Three months ago,  
after the Kaiser who ruled this land as Princess was defeated,  
there was unrest and confusion here in the palace, yes?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes. Thanks to people like Jun  
and the nobles who had finally remembered me,  
we were able to get things in order...  
  
**Neneka：**  
But Mana's influence extended to more than just the palace.  
Thieves' guilds, assassins' guilds, guilds researching forbidden curses...  
Mana had subjugated much of this world's criminal underbelly.  
  
**Neneka：**  
If anything, the unrest there must have been greater than in the palace.  
For not just in Landosol but across the continent's furthest reaches,  
Mana had held vast influence in the criminal underworld.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I... I had no idea...  
  
**Neneka：**  
However, before that chaos could become widely apparent,  
it was rapidly suppressed.  
  
**Neneka：**  
...No.  
Not suppressed, but \"conquered.\"  
By a previously unknown guild known only as Rage Legion.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
An unknown guild...? What about the Guild Association?  
  
**Neneka：**  
They were registered, yes, but with false information.  
Well, that in itself is hardly rare in criminal society...  
  
**Neneka：**  
Using my disguises, I was able to witness Rage Legion in action.  
A group of battle-hardened mercenaries was slaughtered in seconds...  
at the hands of a single swordsman.  
  
**Neneka：**  
This guild is not normal.  
They have abilities that surpass this world's rules,  
akin to the Seven Crowns.  
 Or perhaps more formidable still...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...!  
  
**Neneka：**  
Rage Legion now rules the underworld.  
And recently, its members have been sighted in this vicinity.  
It won't be long before they mount an attack upon Landosol.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
An attack...?!  
They're going to attack this city?!  
  
**Neneka：**  
Yes... They will.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Neneka...  
Are you shaking?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Of course I'm not...  
No. I'll admit it.  
This is no imitation... It is my very own fear.  
  
**Neneka：**  
But... why...? I don't understand it myself...  
I just have a feeling that something truly terrible lies in our future...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, I see!  
Sounds like a maiden's intuition!  
  
**Neneka：**  
Intuition...  
Not a word I can claim to be fond of,  
but in this case, I do have a hunch.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Rage Legion...  
This guild may be connected to the true villain Mana feared.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And they're going to attack this city...  
Right when we're still working so hard to restore it!  
  
**Neneka：**  
I too would find this city's demise inconvenient,  
so I'm willing to offer support.  
 But don't expect too much.  
My body is still damaged from its treatment at Mana's hands.  
  
**Neneka：**  
As I mentioned before,  
the key to victory is young {player}'s new power.  
Unless you harness its full strength, defeat is inevitable.  
  
**Waitress：**  
Sorry for the wait! ♪  
Here are your ten additional anmitsu desserts!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Thankoo!  
`Tag 1`  
**Sheffy：**  
Thankoo!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh—that'll be my second dessert!  
Don't mind if I do! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait, you're still not done eating?!  
At least finish the story...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey, c'mon, Karyl.  
I think we've probably covered most of the important parts.  
  
**Rei：**  
The world in peril, huh...  
On its own, it sounds like something out of an epic tale...  
  
**Rei：**  
But if this really is the work of the Kaiser's true enemy,  
I'm sure these new foes won't be easy to defeat.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yep, yep! That Kariza boy...  
He could make monsters repel our attacks, warp through the air...  
All those powers he had were pretty amazing!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes... Just as Miss Neneka predicted,  
without my lord's new power,  
I fear we would surely have been defeated.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, I guess you're not wrong.  
But that little brat got away scot-free in the end, monsters and all!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I guess... we'll have to fight him again, won't we?  
He's still planning to attack us and try to harm the city, after all...  
  
**Rei：**  
When that time comes,  
we'll need all the aid {player} can provide...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Mmm~! ♪  
This harmony of syrup, sweet beans and ice cream  
is tastier than anything!  
 Right, {player}? ☆  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Dewishus! ♪  
`Tag 2`  
**Sheffy：**  
Dewishus! ♪  
  
**Yui：**  
Ahhh... It really is delicious.  
I had so much already, but I still can't resist...  
  
**Karyl：**  
*sigh*  
He's still no better than a little baby.  
How are we gonna keep relying on him in battle?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl... Please do not worry.  
I feel certain that my lord  
will always come to our aid in our hour of need.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Geez,  
 you're so laid-back.  
...Well, I can't deny I kind of get the same feeling...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
But these... \"Princess Forms,\" was it?  
If we use them too much, don't you think  
he might end up collapsing again?  
  
**Rei：**  
...Hmm.  
Recently he's started to learn to speak...  
Is there a danger he could fully revert to an infant again?  
  
**Karyl：**  
No, we can't let that happen again!  
Babysitting is really hard work! You can't take your eyes off them...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...True enough.  
We cannot push my lord too hard.  
He still has yet to master the full extent of this new ability...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
He hasn't mastered it yet...  
 Oh!  
Do you think the reason Peco and Yui got so hungry after the battle  
could be because of that?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's a possibility for sure!  
This feels just like when I use my Royal Equipment  
and push myself too hard.  
  
**Yui：**  
I-is that right?  
Then maybe all this eating won't make us gain any weight!  
...At least, I hope it doesn't...  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Hmm...  
I'm afraid I wouldn't get your hopes up.  
I think that princess is just naturally resistant to weight gain.  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh no...  
Wait—whaaa?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh! It's you...!
