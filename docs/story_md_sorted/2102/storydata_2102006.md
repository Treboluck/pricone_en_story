# Part 2: Chapter 2 Episode 6
Gorschin shrewdly dodges Pecorine's serious accusations, but behind her back, he is already forming an uneasy alliance with Creditta to plot new unsavory schemes. At the chairman's request, Creditta heads into the city to gather ruthless minions, only to find two ruffians encased in a crystalline substance.

### Place: Throne Room
  
**Narration：**  
The next day after the Rage Legion attack...  
As Princess of Landosol, Pecorine has summoned Marquis Gorschin,  
Chairman of the Council of Nobles, to her audience chamber.  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Princess Eustiana. As always, it is a pleasure.  
Now, first on today's agenda is...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Before we get to that, Mr. Gorschin!  
What's the meaning of all this?  
I heard you held {player} and the others prisoner?!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Hmm?  
...Ah, that incident.  
Yes indeed, it was a regrettable misunderstanding to say the least.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Misunderstanding...?!  
You threw them all into the palace dungeons!  
It's outrageous!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
If I may, Your Majesty...  
The fact remains that the young girl "Sheffy" was a wanted felon.  
  
**Gorschin：**  
And, unsuccessful or otherwise, assassination of royalty  
is a capital offense. My subordinates who took this Sheffy and her  
associates into custody were fulfilling their sworn duty under the law.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Even so...!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Hmmm...  
I have lifted the bounty upon the Sheffy girl as requested,  
but if that alone does not suffice to sate your ire...  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Please take this head from my shoulders as compensation.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
H-huhhh...?!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
My subordinates' failings are tantamount to my own!  
As Chairman of the Council, I must take full responsibility  
for all grievances owed!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
But I beg you, your illustrious Majesty!  
At least grant my men the blessing of your mercy!  
They have homes and families to return to...!  
  
**Soldier：**  
Chairman Gorschin, you mustn't...!  
  
**Noble：**  
Without your wisdom and guidance, what would become of the Council?!  
  
**Soldier：**  
Please have mercy, Princess Eustiana!  
As your humble servants, we implore you most desperately!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I-I didn't mean...!  
Listen, everyone, it's not like I'm furious with you all...  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Dear me...  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Younglings are so easy to handle.  
A basic appeal to emotion and they change their tune in seconds.  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Yet that's precisely why  
leaving that guileless whelp on the throne would be...  
  
**Creditta：**  
Well, well!  
 My, my.  
Good day to you, Chairman Gorschin.  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Merchant woman...  
I don't recall granting you permission to enter the palace.  
  
**Creditta：**  
No, no!  
I'm sure you wouldn't recall such a thing.  
After all, I was granted leave of passage by Her Majesty the Princess.  
  
**Gorschin：**  
...Hrmph.  
Honestly, Her Majesty's whims are too idle.  
This is why such striplings are...  
 Ah, excuse me!  
  
**Creditta：**  
Ho-hoh.  
I must say I share your frustrations on this matter...  
  
**Creditta：**  
But at the same time,  
 it's for precisely that reason  
that we grown-ups who know the ways of society  
are able to reap rich rewards.  
  
**Creditta：**  
A far cry from the iron fist with which our previous ruler  
kept this land mired in fear,  
 yes?  
Wouldn't you tend to agree, Chairman?  
  
**Gorschin：**  
...I can't claim to catch your drift.  
I am a faithful servant of our current Majesty.  
  
**Gorschin：**  
If I were to discern a note of disrespect in your tone...  
why, I could have you taken in for treason, Creditta Cash.  
  
**Creditta：**  
Ahaha! My, how scary.  
I'm so intimidated, I think I'll keep my report brief.  
  
**Creditta：**  
The construction works assigned to us at the Richmond Corporation—  
restoring Landosol's seventh and eighth districts—  
have been fully completed.  
  
**Creditta：**  
Also, we've removed the rubble from the monster attack in the plaza.  
I intend to dispatch all available manpower to rebuild it.  
That area is a haven for the citizenry, after all!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
...Hrmph.  
Your attitude has never pleased me, merchant,  
but I can't deny you do very efficient work.  
  
**Creditta：**  
Thank you, thank you. I appreciate the recognition!  
Now, of course, some strain will be involved on the workers' parts,  
but this *is* an emergency! Ahaha! ♪  
  
**Creditta：**  
No band of juveniles such as the oh-so-naive Mercurius Foundation  
could come close to approaching the efficacy I offer!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
...Hmm.  
Then in deference to your competence,  
might I ask you to handle one more thing?  
  
**Creditta：**  
My, my! ♪ No matter what the task, I would be all too glad to accept!  
In order to rebuild my Creditta Tower,  
I need to earn capital in droves, you understand!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
It's a simple request.  
I require personnel well versed in conflict.  
As many as possible, with the utmost urgency.  
  
**Creditta：**  
Oh-hoh?  
Just as you say, this won't be a difficult request to fulfill...  
  
**Creditta：**  
But Chairman Gorschin, don't you already have a militia of your own?  
The, ah... \"Golden Hand,\" I believe was their name?  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Certainly, the Golden Hand is one loyal instrument in my service.  
But very recently indeed,  
our esteemed Majesty gave a decree to the following effect...  
  

---  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The culprit behind yesterday's attack on the plaza  
was an agent of a criminal guild known as Rage Legion.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This guild may be planning further terrorist attacks on Landosol.  
To protect the city, I need you to restore Nightmare to full capacity  
and prepare as many other countermeasures as you can!  
  

---  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Her Majesty's concern for the city is as touching as it is noble.  
We have a duty to comply to the utmost of our abilities.  
  
**Gorschin：**  
...Haha.  
Such an ideal pretext to assemble loyal agents using public funds...  
This Princess is the kindest ruler I could wish for.  
  
**Creditta：**  
Yes, I quite agree.  
To be led by such a noble Majesty with the aid of your own wise counsel  
is a blessing for which we citizens must give thanks.  
  
**Creditta：**  
Ha-hah... I see, I see...  
So you wish to keep your own \"golden hands\" sparkling clean  
while preparing a second instrument to do your dirtier work...?  
  
**Creditta：**  
Mr. Chairman, I hereby swear to see your wishes swiftly done.  
I know of plenty of sources where I might find the personnel you seek.  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Good.  
Now, see to it without delay.  
  
**Narration：**  
Shortly afterward,  
Creditta ventures into the back streets of central Landosol  
to secure the services of a reliable group of ruffians.  
  
**Creditta：**  
Chairman Gorschin...  
He identified this incident's culprits as a guild named \"Rage Legion.\"  
  
**Creditta：**  
That accursed brat of a boy who demolished my Creditta Tower...  
I'll never let him get away with this!  
I swear I'll demolish the entire guild he belongs to!  
  
**Creditta：**  
Which requires quantity over quality, and great speed!  
I'll marshal all the crooks and rogues at my disposal  
and reap rich rewards from the palace coffers!  
  
**Creditta：**  
Listen up, louts!  
We have a job!  
  
**Ruffians：**  
...  
...  
  
**Creditta：**  
...Ahh?!  
Wh-what is this...?!  
  
**Creditta：**  
Th-their bodies are encased in jade-like crystals!  
And... the magnitude of these magical traces!  
  
**Creditta：**  
Who in the world could have done this...?!
