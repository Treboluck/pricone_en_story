# Part 2: Chapter 2 Episode 5
Kokkoro worries that participating in the battle to protect Landosol will put {player} in danger. Even helpful advice from Labyrista is not enough to quell her concerns. A few days later, Ranpha appears in Landosol for a second time.

**Ranpha：**  
...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
Because... you'll die.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
She has... vanished.  
Who in the world was that young lady just now...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Is she another of your many friends, my lord?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I dunno her.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
F-forgive my presumption.  
Even you, my lord, cannot know every young lady under the sun.  
I am... actually a little relieved.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Still, I must say...  
 I truly am so very sorry.  
It was careless of me to leave you all alone.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Your unique power now seems to be  
our only hope of protecting this city from a new threat...  
It is possible that you might find yourself targeted directly.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
From now on, I will have to take more care than ever before  
to keep you close and safe by my side.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...  
Oh, my lord.  
I must confess... it worries me.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  ...?  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
I can certainly understand Miss Pecorine's desire  
to defend this city from danger.  
And I would like to offer her all the assistance I can.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
However... when I think that this might mean  
putting you in harm's way again, my lord...  
It brings a deep dread to my heart.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I... do not ever want to relive the pain I felt that day...  
  
**Labyrista：**  
If young {player} suffers another fatal wound...  
this time, he won't survive. You can't expect miracles  
to repeat themselves.  
 I hope you understand that.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Miss Labyrista.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Hey.  
This time it didn't take long for us to meet again.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miracles are not easily repeated...  
 Quite right, I am sure.  
Nor do I have any intention of ever allowing my lord  
to fall into such a state for a second time.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And also...  
In truth, I had hoped to say this earlier, but...  
I believe I owe you an apology, Miss Labyrista.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Huh?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well...  
Before, when we met in the other world,  
you made an important request of me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
To assist with returning everyone to their own world.  
To spread word of the forgotten truth to as many people as possible.  
But I'm sorry to say I have still achieved very little...  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Oh—that!  
That's fine, that's fine. Don't worry about it.  
We can call that a project for the long term.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
In fact, just hearing that you remembered my request  
and that you're thinking about it so seriously  
makes me really happy.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
After all, you already have someone precious in your life  
whose safety you need to put first.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Indeed.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
However...  
What strength I have is minuscule in the grand scheme of things.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In our struggle against the Kaiser,  
there was nothing I could do to help,  
and I came close to losing even my lord's life.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What's more, I hear that this new threat to Landosol  
may be the same formidable foe whom the Kaiser was preparing to face.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Will I be able to fulfill my task this time?  
To protect the one life I treasure most...?  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Haha. You really are such a kind girl.  
Maybe it's the boy's influence,  
or maybe that man was better at raising a child than I realized...  
  
**Labyrista：**  
All right, then.  
I guess I'll let you in on a little secret.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
If my suspicions are right,  
 then young {player}'s power...  
this new Princess Form power he wields...  
comes with two key conditions to fulfill on the receiving side.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
\"Conditions\"... you say?  
  
**Labyrista：**  
The first is to have defeated a Seven Crowns-level enemy.  
You know—if you want to level up,  
you have to beat strong enemies first, right?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And... the other condition?  
  
**Labyrista：**  
The other one is...  
  
**Labyrista：**  
*whisper whisper whisper*  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Oh my.  
Is that... truly the requirement?  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Yeah. You'll see if you try it out!  
...Sadly enough, it might be a little bit too difficult for me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Now then.  
I think it's time I headed off.  
Gotta say hello to Rino and Shizuru as well, you know!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Labyrista...  
Thank you very much.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
No probs.  
Well then, you two.  
See you 'round!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Bye-bye!  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
...And with that, she is gone.  
As ever, she is a mysterious woman...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The \"other world\"...  
The place from which we all came.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Someday, we too must return to that home...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  ...Kokkoro?  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
...My lord.  
I am sworn to be your guide.  
My role is to protect you, lead you, and aid you in all things.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
From the bottom of my heart, I am glad to stand here as your retainer.  
Simply staying by your side brings me immeasurable joy.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If it is at all possible,  
I would like to stay forever by your...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  ...?  
`Tag 5`  
**Pecorine：**  
...Oh!  
Kokkoro~!  
  
**Yui：**  
And look—Mr. Knight's here too!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, great! So you found him!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Everyone...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Geez...  
Don't just wander off, you idiot!  
  
**Rei：**  
I'm glad he seems all right.  
Well then, shall we head back?  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Eheh.  
That seems best.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well then, my lord. Take my hand and let us return.  
To the place we call home...  
  
**Narration：**  
...  
...  
  
**Narration：**  
A few days later...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...  
...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...*sigh*...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...Landosol...  
Even from the sky... the voices... are so loud...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
But...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...I have to do this.  
So I can... grant my wish...
