## Subtitle: Queen Labyrinth's Return
  
**Labyrista：**  
Hey!  
Long time no see!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Akira...!  
No—\"Miss Labyrista\" is more appropriate, I suppose.  
I did not realize you had returned.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Well, yep! ♪  
I've managed to calm things down on the other side a little,  
and I have things to take care of here. Besides, above all...

**Labyrista：**  
Above all... I want to thank you properly.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Thank you, young {player}.  
For stopping Mana as I asked.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
And... for not taking Mana's life.  
I really can't thank you enough.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
When I think that your kindness  
has left you with such a terrible wound upon your soul...  
It pains me more than I can say.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Though things could have turned out a lot worse...  
I'm still the one who chose to give you that power.  
And yet...  
  
**Labyrista：**  
When I see you now and feel your warmth...  
The sight of you like this fills me with nothing but joy.  
I almost feel like dancing and declaring a toast!

**Choice: (1)**  ...?  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
The sight of Mr. Knight \"like this\"...?  
...Wh-what do you mean by that?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh! Do you mean you love {player} best  
when he's a baby? Is that it?  
  
**Yui：**  
Whaaaa?!  
She l-l-l-l-lov...?!  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Hm? No, no, not like that.  
What makes me so happy is how much he's grown!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord's... growth...?  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Yeah.  
\"Princess Forms,\" was it?  
Honestly, even I don't know for sure why he's gained that power.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
But it's greater than the Princess Knight ability I gave him.  
And it belongs to him alone.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
I don't know when or how,  
but he's grown beyond all my expectations...  
And that makes me so, so very happy!  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Ahaha! Is this what it feels like to be a parent?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ummm...  
I thought Neneka told me he'd powered up  
because of a power you gave him, Labyrista...  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Oh—yes.  
It's true that I restored his original Princess Knight power.  
But I think that power's merged with something else inside him.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Why could that have happened?  
Mm... I'm really curious!  
You didn't eat anything funny recently, did you?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Ummm...?  
`Tag 2`  
**Labyrista：**  
...Well, you can't answer me right now, huh?  
But at any rate—this Princess Form ability of yours  
is newly awakened, and you haven't learned to use it yet.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Hiyori was juts asking if overusing it  
could risk causing more harm to the boy who wields it...  
  
**Labyrista：**  
But at this stage, I'd say the greater risk lies with the power's recipients.  
In other words, with you girls.  
  
**Yui：**  
...That's true.  
If I have to worry about gaining weight after every battle...  
I-it'll be tough...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Though this other idiot won't have to worry about anything there.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Thanks for the food!  
The dessert was delicious too! ♪  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Thankoo for food! ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, Miss Sheffy. Let me wipe your mouth clean.  
Please excuse me.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Oh?  
Is this girl a new face?  
  
**Sheffy：**  
...?  
...!  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Urhh... Urhhh...  
Ooaahh!  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Oh, wow!  
What's this all of a sudden?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Sh-Sheffy?!  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Uuurhh!  
Aaoohh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Sheffy...?  
It is not nice to bite the sleeve of a new friend.  
Please release Miss Labyrista's clothing.  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Uurhhh...  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Wow... She really doesn't like me.  
Why's that, I wonder?  
  
Is it the smell of the fish sauce I was eating earlier?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Labyrista, I really must apologize.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
No, no, that's totally fine!  
Still, those wings and ears... Is little Sheffy one of the dragonfolk?  
  
**Labyrista：**  
That's a rare race indeed.  
What's she doing with all of you?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That may require quite a bit of explaining...  
Around two months ago, there was an incident...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  (...  
`Tag 3`  
**Labyrista：**  
Hmm, hmm. Very interesting...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  (...Gotta pee...  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
...And that is what happened.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
I see, I see...  
A girl with amnesia who fell from the Tower of Sol...  
Well, that really is intriguing!  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Urhhhh...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I do wonder... What is she, in the end?  
We ended up looking after her at the Gourmet Guild  
in case she was related to {player}'s memories...  
  
**Rei：**  
We searched for her identity  
 but didn't find any leads...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Worse still, today, the whole mess where that noble arrested us  
turned out to be her fault somehow!  
 And on charges  
of trying to assassinate Her Majes—the Omniscient Kaiser, too.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Hey, you, girl.  
Why the heck did you try to kill Her Majesty?  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Kiwwoo?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Miss Karyl.  
I'm afraid in Miss Sheffy's current state...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah, yeah.  
I can see there's not much point in asking.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh—do you think the Kaiser wiped little Sheffy's memories  
back when the assassination attempt failed?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm, I dunno...  
It doesn't sound like an impossible idea...  
  
**Karyl：**  
But if Her Majesty had to deal with an assassin,  
I feel like she'd just execute them...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh well, who cares about that old attempt?  
Forget the bounty, too. I should be able to get it lifted!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank you very much, Miss Pecorine.  
  
**Yui：**  
It was a huge help that you got us all out of that cell, too.  
Thank you, Pecorine!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No, no!  
We're all allies who fought the Kaiser together!  
You too, Sheffy! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmph.  
Must be great to be a princess.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha...  
Well, I guess! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Miss Pecorine...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You know, it took a whole lot of help from all of you guys  
to get me back home where I belong.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But from now on, as the Princess,  
I have to keep fighting to protect this whole country!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And right now, it looks like there's a dangerous guild targeting the city...  
So I'm asking you, everyone!  
Can you lend me your strength again?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I want to make sure all this land's citizens  
can eat their delicious meals in peace!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yeah!  
Of course we'll help, Peco!  
  
**Rei：**  
Yes.  
If there's anything we can do, you just have to ask.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, I can't really say no, can I?  
Not while I'm still on probation for my crimes...  
So sure, fine! I'll do whatever!  
  
**Yui：**  
U-ummm...  
Karyl, if you really don't want to,  
I don't think Pecorine would actually force you...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?  
Uhhh... well, I mean...  
 I do kind of need  
a chance to repay these guys for all sorts of stuff, so...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please do not worry too hard, Miss Yui.  
Miss Karyl is simply being a  
 \"tsundere,\"  
 or so I am informed.  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh, is that right?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Of course I'm not!  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Karoo, toon-derry?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, Miss Sheffy. She is a \"tsundere.\"  
...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Oh?  
Where is my lord...?  
  
**Rei：**  
Hm?  
Actually, I don't see him anywhere either...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Did he fill up his stomach and fall asleep?  
Let's check under the table... He's not there?!  
  
**Labyrista：**  
...Hm? Oh, if you want young {player},  
he walked out through that door.  
Were we boring him, I wonder?  
  
**All：**  
Huhhhh?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Th-this is terrible!  
My lord will become lost upon the streets!
