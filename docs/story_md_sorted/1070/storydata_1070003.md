## Subtitle: The Nice Lady's Name
  
**Narration：**  
With her research facility under attack by Nightmare forces,  
Neneka attempts to escape with Masaki.  
  
**Royal Knight 1：**  
Haahhh!  
  
**Masaki：**  
I think not! Yahh!  
  
**Royal Knight 1：**  
Guaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Masaki：**  
Are you all right, my mistress?!  
  
**Neneka：**  
Well, of course I am. Do you not have eyes?  
  
**Neneka：**  
...A direct attack on this facility  
is among the worst scenarios that I had envisioned.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Masaki. Flee this place ahead of me.  
I will remain and hold back the enemy.  
  
**Masaki：**  
But Mistress Neneka, are you not injured...?!  
  
**Neneka：**  
You really are a dolt.  
 I'm asking you to secure an escape route.  
Injured as I am, I will not last long here.  
  
**Masaki：**  
Very well! Ah, my mistress. I swear... I swear I will return for you!  
  
**Neneka：**  
...Well, that takes care of Masaki's safety.  
  
**Neneka：**  
The facility is about to collapse. The battle duplicates I prepared  
all lie defeated by the knights. Even escaping will not be easy.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Just how much of my movements did Mana uncover?  
His Astral Insight should not be nearly enough to achieve all this.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Masaki is one thing, but how could he keep track of even me  
when I barely showed myself?  
It's as though he has seen this all before...  
  
**Neneka：**  
...It can't be.  
But no, I suppose even that is not an impossibility...  
  
**Neneka：**  
Mana can perfectly predict my every movement...  
My past,  
 and even my future...?  
  
**Neneka：**  
...If that is true, perhaps I should play into his hands for once.  
  
**Royal Knight 2：**  
Target sighted! This way!  
  

---  
  
**Neneka：**  
Trying to capture *me* with mere foot soldiers?  
You will regret taking the Metamorph Monarch lightly.  
  
**Royal Knight 2：**  
Guaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Neneka：**  
Really? That's all you can manage?  
How feeble...  
 At least try to resist me.  
  
**Royal Knight 3：**  
Guaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Neneka：**  
All of them wiped out...  
 Perhaps I overdid it a little.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  ...You made that last part up, right?  
`Tag 1`  

---  
  
**Neneka：**  
...Of course you'd see through it.  
 No, I didn't wipe them all out.  
I put up a good fight, but sadly, I was captured.  
  
**Neneka：**  
The rest is as I already told you.  
Before I was bound to the brainwashing apparatus, I released a small duplicate.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Then, after making contact  
 with Princess Eustiana—Pecorine—  
this body escaped from the palace walls.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I cannot do battle in this form.  
I will sit by and watch as Masaki joins you in assaulting the palace.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I have told you of Pecorine's safety too,  
so I suppose this operation was a success.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  So... you were Neneka all along, nice lady.  
`Tag 2`  
**Neneka：**  
Yes, Neneka is my name. Surprised?  
I took pains not to reveal my name to you back then.  
  
**Neneka：**  
It was a necessary measure to ensure Mana did not find me.  
From now on, you may feel free to call me by name.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm sorry I couldn't save you back there.  
`Tag 3`  
**Neneka：**  
...  
  
**Neneka：**  
That should really be none of your concern.  
Besides, that time...  
  
**Neneka：**  
No... it is nothing.  
If you all come for me this time, I will forgive you.  
  
**Neneka：**  
But personally, do you not have someone else—  
a precious comrade—to save first?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Please do give her priority. I am tougher than I may look,  
so I can wait longer.  
 Plus, I have Masaki.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'll save you, no matter what.  
`Tag 4`  
**Neneka：**  
Good... I will be waiting.  
Now that you have promised, I trust you will not forget.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Come for me, so we may defeat Mana together.  
  
**Narration：**  
In the soft smile that crept across Neneka's face,  
{player} sensed both happiness  
and a powerful determination.
