## Subtitle: An Engineered Reunion
  
**Narration：**  
One day, {player} takes on a job to deliver a parrot,  
and sets out from Landosol to meet the recipient.  
  
**Parrot：**  
Time to hit the road! Time to hit the road!  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Well then, good luck on the trip.  
Careful on your way!  
  
**Parrot：**  
Careful on your way! Careful on your way!  
  
**Boy：**  
Ooh! A parrot!  
Hey, mister, did you bring that parrot all the way from the city?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That's right.  
`Tag 1`  
**Boy：**  
I knew it! C'mon, over here!  
I'll show you the way!  
  
**Parrot：**  
Show us where to go! Show us where to go!  
  
**Boy：**  
That nice lady told me before!  
Said she'd ordered a parrot from the city!  
  
**Boy：**  
Here we are!  
There's a cave through here where the nice lady lives!  
It's kinda dark, but don't worry!  
 Just follow me!  
  
**Boy：**  
Hey, nice lady!  
The guy with the parrot is here from the city!  
  
**Woman：**  
Oh, so he is! Thank you for bringing him here.  
  
**Boy：**  
Eheheh!  
 I'll go home now, then!  
Say hi to the boss for me!  
  
**Woman：**  
...Welcome, Princess Knight arisen from the grave.  
Our mistress awaits. Please, follow me.  
  
**Woman：**  
We have a visitor, my mistress.  
Master {player} is here to see you.

**???：**  
Welcome to my research facility. It's good to see you.  
  
**Parrot：**  
Thank you for guiding him. Return to guarding the entrance now.  
  
**Woman：**  
As you command, my mistress. I will fulfill my mission.  
  
**Parrot：**  
Now then, I will return to my main body.  
Thank you for bringing me all the way here.

**Choice: (2)**  The parrot... vanished...?!  
`Tag 2`  
**???：**  
That parrot was an imitation I created.  
It just returned to pure magical energy so that I could reclaim it.  
  
**???：**  
It's good to see you again, {player}.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Have we met before?  
`Tag 3`  
**???：**  
Could it possibly be... your memories...?  
  
**???：**  
Let me perform a quick inspection upon you.  
I'll need to touch your body briefly. All right?  
  
**???：**  
...Ah, I see. It would seem only his outer self was revived.  
Even his behavioral memory is missing...  
It's a miracle he's still alive.  
  
**???：**  
Hmm... All right, I've seen all I need to.  
You appear to be in perfect health.  
  
**???：**  
I should introduce myself. I am...  
 just a nice lady  
who happens to be a little friendlier than average. Understood?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Okay, nice lady.  
`Tag 4`  
![107000102.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/107000102.webp)  
**Nice Lady：**  
Yes, that's quite right. What a good boy.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
It would be dangerous to give him too much information,  
so I'll avoid giving my name right now.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
Actually, I was asked by a friend  
to look after you for a little while once you made this delivery.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
These fakes are my creations,  
 but I make them so authentic,  
they are not always fully obedient to my orders.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
This time, a friend recovered one of them for me,  
so it seemed convenient to request that you deliver it, you see.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Oh, so that's why.  
`Tag 5`  
**Nice Lady：**  
Yes, that's exactly why.  
Starting today, I will be teaching you about this world's ways.

**Nice Lady：**  
...All lies, of course.  
Not that you would notice in your current state.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
In truth, through my fakes stationed across the continent,  
I learned of your appearance and sent that request to lure you here.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
I was observing your actions while evading Mana's and Akira's notice,  
but I had yet to grasp the reason for your childish mannerisms.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
So, the wounds you sustained in that battle were too great...  
But I will compensate for the common sense you have lost.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
The more you grow, the sooner you will face Mana again.  
...  
I will make use of you as a tool to defeat him.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
Besides, you are the one whose place I was never able to take.  
To observe how you grow this time...  
 The prospect intrigues me.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
I look forward to spending time together.  
  
**Narration：**  
As Neneka greeted him with a faint smile,  
{player} nodded happily in agreement.
