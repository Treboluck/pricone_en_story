## Subtitle: Secret Encounter
  
**Narration：**  
Through her conversation with {player},  
the duplicate Neneka appraises the growth  
of the student she has not seen in some time.  
  
**Neneka：**  
His power as a Princess Knight is growing stronger...  
No, it's recovering the strength it once had.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Just as I had surmised, it seems your lost memories  
hold the key to your Princess Knight power.  
  
**Neneka：**  
In the battles ahead,  
 particularly when we face Mana,  
I feel certain your power will be most necessary.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Thus, from the thirty percent of memories I still retain,  
I will show you a memory of when we met in the real world.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I have never done this before. I don't know what might happen.  
Still, I believe this is a necessary step. Understood?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Understood.  
`Tag 1`  
**Neneka：**  
A fine response.  
 Well then, allow me to begin the replay.

**Narration：**  
That day, {player} was on his way to the school gym  
for a special lecture on student internet usage.  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Oh! {player}!  
I heard the next lesson got moved from the gym to our classroom!  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
The visiting lecturer, you know, that MHLW official,  
suddenly got really sick. So now they're getting someone else  
to do the lecture online! Our teacher said so!  
  
**Male Student 1：**  
It's just gonna be some boring guy droning on, right?  
Ugh, I hope it's not too long...

**???：**  
Good day, students of Tsubakigaoka High.  
Are you able to see me clearly?  
  
**Male Student 2：**  
Huh, it's a woman. Teach, can't you get the video working?!  
  
**???：**  
It appears you are unable to see my face.  
Let me adjust my settings.  
  
![107000402.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/107000402.webp)  
**Neneka：**  
...There, is that better?  
Good day. I am Neneka Utsushimi.  
I'm here to give this lecture in place of a friend.  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Wait, isn't this girl... you know...  
From Wisdom... The Seven Crowns! No way! She's the real deal!  
  
**Male Student 1：**  
Guehh?! Are you serious?!  
  
**Neneka：**  
Settle down, everyone. Yes, it is indeed I. I must apologize  
for being unable to meet you directly today.  
  
**Male Student 2：**  
Seven Crowns, my ass... She looks like a grade schooler!  
  
**Neneka：**  
For today's lesson, I was intending to give you all a rundown  
of safe internet usage...  
 But I've changed my mind.  
  
**Neneka：**  
You there, who just called me a grade schooler.  
I think I will use you as a sample case.  
  
**Male Student 2：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Second year, student ID number... five.  
In the basketball club,  
 and your home has...  
 four bedrooms.  
Ah, you have a younger sister.  
  
**Male Student 2：**  
Hey! What the—?! How did you...?!  
  
**Neneka：**  
Oh, look.  
Your last test results earned you a scolding from your mother.  
With this intellect, no wonder you struggle identifying people's ages.  
  
**Male Student 2：**  
I-I'm sorry I was rude!  
I'm really sorry! It was my bad!  
  
**Neneka：**  
Very good. I'll let you off the hook this once.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Now, everyone, do you think I gained access to his phone  
and extracted this information from his personal files?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Far from it, I'm afraid. In fact, all of these details  
are freely available to gather on the internet.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Each piece of personal information was made public by him  
or his family and friends,  
 that is, the rest of you here.  
  
**Neneka：**  
When you go home, try talking with your friends and family  
and look over the photos and videos you have uploaded to social media.  
  
**Neneka：**  
In this age, it is all too simple to farm personal information  
from the accounts of an individual and those around them.  
  
**Neneka：**  
The technical security of these services may advance rapidly,  
but the key weakness is the people using them.  
  
**Neneka：**  
VR games on the mimi are exactly the same way.  
You must be careful what information you choose to reveal.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Naturally, the security systems of the mimi and its networks  
are as close to perfect as can be.  
  
**Neneka：**  
However, this means that users themselves must take extra care  
not to become the weak link in their own privacy.

**Female Student 1：**  
Oh, there you are!  
Hey, {player}, do you have a moment?  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Thing is, Teach asked me to fetch some stuff from the school roof...  
Could you give me a hand with it?  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Ahahaha... I didn't think you'd come with me *that* easily!  
What a shocker! ...Perhaps I needn't have gone to these lengths.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I see little point in concealing myself any longer.  
Your credulity makes me question if my deception serves any purpose.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Good day, {player}.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Weren't you giving that lecture remotely?  
`Tag 2`  
**Neneka：**  
You should never implicitly trust what you are told.  
It pained me to see you follow me without a shred of suspicion.  
  
**Neneka：**  
However, that trusting nature may be, just as Akira says,  
the reason why you were able to defeat me.  
  
**Neneka：**  
For us, the \"ultimate individuals\" of the Seven Crowns,  
you represent quite the contrast...  
It is no wonder that I find myself deeply intrigued by you.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I almost forgot to mention—  
I gave that lecture today  
from an empty classroom in this very school.  
  
**Neneka：**  
As for that young man's information,  
I had gathered details on all the school's students in advance.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I know they are only high school students,  
but they are all too trusting...  
They will be told the truth tomorrow.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Why did you come to this school?  
`Tag 3`  
**Neneka：**  
I wished to take a look at the face  
of the Princess Knight who defeated me.  
  
**Neneka：**  
With the help of a certain acquaintance,  
I was able to organize an opportunity to substitute for that lecture.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  How did you find me, though...?  
`Tag 4`  
**Neneka：**  
I looked for a mimi device using a non-government-issued ID,  
and tracked said device through its network usage, that's all.  
  
**Neneka：**  
All Princess Knights' mimis are specially made by the Seven Crowns.  
As a fellow Crown myself, it was not difficult to find yours.  
  
**Neneka：**  
...Please, no need to look so wary of me.  
Why would I want to give up such juicy intel to the other Crowns?  
  
**Neneka：**  
So you see, all of this will be a secret between the two of us.  
  
**Neneka：**  
His trail was easier to uncover than it had any right to be.  
I can only assume Akira *wants* her fellow Crowns to find him...  
  
**Neneka：**  
She is not so naive as to count on our pity, though.  
...  
Oh, Akira. Your intentions are always so difficult to read.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Besides, real-life personal attacks are not my style at all.  
Just seeing your face was quite enough.  
  
**Neneka：**  
This will be the first and last time I show myself before you.  
I would not wish to show undue pity in future battles.  
  
**Neneka：**  
When next we meet, it will be in Astrum.  
Until that day, take care of yourself.  
  
**Neneka：**  
At our next encounter, I will defeat you.  
Now, this is farewell, Akira's Princess Knight.  
  

---  
  
**Neneka：**  
Playback complete.  
That was a memory that we shared in the real world.  
  
**Neneka：**  
We remained enemies even after that meeting,  
but now, to escape from this world, I will work by your side.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  ...And after we escape?  
`Tag 5`  
**Neneka：**  
A good question...  
Let us just say... that depends on your actions.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I'll try to make sure you want me as an ally.  
`Tag 6`  
**Neneka：**  
Is that so? Well, let's hope you are successful.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I do have high hopes. Only you can choose how to view  
the kaleidoscope of my being.  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} wished from the bottom of his heart  
that Neneka would stay his ally even after this conflict.
