**Pecorine：**  
Aaand down it goes!  
 Finally... Finally!  
My archenemy, the Sticky Slimy Phony Dragon, is defeated!  
Urgh... What an arduous adventure this was...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Really? This was that big a deal to you?  
All it even did was force you to go hungry last time, right?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl, surely you can see  
how cruel a fate that was for Miss Pecorine...  
Ahh, my eyes are tearing up with emotion...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Even you, Koro?!  
You're making it look like I'm the heartless one here!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Now, enough basking in the glow of victory!  
It's time to resume our Gourmet Guild activities!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Huh?!  
 D-don't tell me...!  
You want to make a meal of this Sticky Slimy Phony Dragon?!  
Are you insane?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This frilly bit on its head looks pretty juicy... ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
\"Pretty juicy,\" my butt!  
It's bursting with poison,  
 from its head to its tail!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
From head to tail...  
 That sounds like a delicious piece of taiyaki! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
One with a highly toxic filling, Miss Pecorine.  
If we fall victim to an unknown toxin in the wilderness,  
the consequences may be truly dire.  
 We really should not.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But, but... they say even poison mushrooms taste delicious!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Please stop trying to throw your life away  
in the pursuit of taste sensations...
