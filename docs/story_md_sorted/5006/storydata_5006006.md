# The Nature of Justice
The empty suits of armor turn out to be a metal-eating monster called the Living Mail. As all of the beasts fuse together into a massive monster, Christina breaks out a magical weapon to annihilate it.
  
## Subtitle: The Nature of Justice
  
**Christina：**  
Rejoice and give thanks, my dears!  
Everyone's beloved vice-captain of Nightmare,  
the fabulous Christina, is here to take charge!  
  
**Christina：**  
Your sorry hides are officially saved!  
And with that, I think I'll decorate this district with corpses!  
  
**Jun：**  
What the—?!  
Chris! I was wondering where you'd gone...  
What kept you all this time?  
  
**Jun：**  
And really, while I'm glad you're here, watch who you're slicing!  
I'm not one of the impostors!  
  
**Christina：**  
Just my little joke!  
Lighten up a little, Captain. You have such a pretty face.  
It would be a crying shame to spoil it with an ugly frown!  
  
**Jun：**  
Urgh...  
Fine, fine—just control yourself, all right?  
My helmet is lying down by your feet. Could you retrieve it?  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh dear, I think my foot slipped! ♪  
  
**Jun：**  
Why would you punt it into the distance?! That's no help!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah!  
While we're here, let's strip you of that silly mask as well!  
  
**Jun：**  
Aaaughhh!  
Why would you... What are you trying to accomplish, Chris?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahahahahah!  
I merely seek to entertain myself, and to avoid the plague of tedium!  
  
**Christina：**  
And what do you know?  
It seems our foe is willing to grant me that modest wish! ♪

**Tomo：**  
Ah...!  
What now? Something's wrong with the enemy!  
  
**Tomo：**  
All the impostors, whether they were still rampaging or incapacitated,  
are gathering and fusing together...?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Even the helmet Jun lost is melting into the mass of metal...  
Uerghh... It's making my skin crawl!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Aaagh! What *is* that thing?  
What the heck are we even up against here?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmph. As it happens, I just paid a visit to Octo—  
a rather well-informed acquaintance of mine.  
  
**Christina：**  
If his expertise in monster ecology is to be believed,  
that is a species known as the Living Mail.  
  
**Tomo：**  
\"Living Mail\"... Like armor... that's alive?  
  
**Christina：**  
Yes, that's how it is known. Technically, it's a swarm of  
microscopic monsters with a strong affinity for metal objects.  
It consumes them for food, while reforming itself to take their shape.  
  
**Christina：**  
During wartime, when metal weapons and armor were produced in bulk,  
it seems there were a number of outbreaks of these vermin.  
Though it was news to me, the historical records seem quite clear.

**Jun：**  
Ahhh...  
When I was young, I may have heard tales of this from my grandfather.  
Suits of armor roaming the halls at night... Swords floating in the air...  
  
**Jun：**  
I always thought they were just fanciful ghost stories...  
  
**Christina：**  
But perhaps not, eh?  
They do say truth is always stranger than fiction! ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
At any rate, some Living Mail must have survived all these years,  
lurking among the weapons, armor and so forth  
that Nightmare retained in storage from those days of war.  
  
**Christina：**  
Over time, they grew in number, presumably by feeding on  
the armor and weapons in our storerooms,  
and gradually replacing them.  
  
**Christina：**  
Though mindless individually,  
these creatures seem to develop some intelligence  
as the size of their swarm grows.  
  
**Christina：**  
Which allows them to coordinate their actions  
and begin actively causing trouble.  
  
**Christina：**  
Perhaps they primarily attacked the beastfolk quarter  
due to lingering memories of the persecution  
these tools have inflicted on beastfolk in decades past?  
  
**Jun：**  
Wh-why did we not notice sooner?  
 Ahhh, I should have devoted  
more resources to the maintenance of our weapon caches!  
Surely then, we would have seen that something was amiss!  
  
**Christina：**  
After all these years of peace, our vigilance was dulled.  
Still, it is in these monsters' nature to conceal themselves  
and evade detection by pretending to be lifeless objects.  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmmm...  
If that's the case, why did they suddenly stop hiding?  
  
**Christina：**  
They're still living creatures. They need nutrition to stay alive.  
Doubtless their population grew too large, and the metal  
stored in the palace was no longer enough to sustain them.  
  
**Christina：**  
Left to their own devices, they'll consume all the metal in Landosol.  
A city of monstrous metal... What a chilling thought.  
We won't be able to cook a meal without our pots turning on us!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
What's that, old lady? You can actually cook?  
I had no idea!  
  
**Christina：**  
I do have a domestic side, actually. Doesn't that just add to my charm?  
Oh, and if you call me \"old lady\" again,  
I'll tear those fuzzy ears off your head. ♪  
  
**Tomo：**  
This isn't the time for kidding around!  
Though I guess I'm the last person you want to hear that from.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I think these Living Mail beasties  
have decided to band together to crush us once and for all.  
  
**Tomo：**  
They're all merging into one great metallic titan!  
It's taller than a building...  
If it goes on the attack, it'll smash up the whole district!  
  
**Jun：**  
If they really consume metal to grow in number,  
all the metal in this vicinity may serve as food to bolster that titan's size.  
It's imperative that we defeat it before that happens.  
  
**Jun：**  
For the sake of peace in Landosol.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Got it.  
 Looking at it another way, it could work to our advantage  
that our enemies have all merged together.  
Beat that one big lunk, and our job's basically done, right?  
  
**Christina：**  
Strictly speaking, even after defeating it,  
I expect we'll need to magically scour the area for metal scraps.  
  
**Christina：**  
Any remnants must be smoked out and exterminated.  
Unless you want a repeat of this debacle?  
  
**Christina：**  
To be clear, I won't be participating in such a tedious task.  
I'm sure I can count on all of you.  
  
**Jun：**  
As you wish. But in return, I trust you'll be willing  
to help us defeat this monstrous beast.  
We need your strength right now, Chris.  
  
**Christina：**  
I'm touched you'd rely on me.  
But are you sure you won't cry  
when I betray you at the first chance I get?  
  
**Jun：**  
That still sounds better than an enemy driven by its appetite alone...  
Unlike those impostors, I have faith in you.  
  
**Jun：**  
As intelligent human beings, allies on the battlefield,  
and fellow defenders of justice in this city,  
let us prove that this monster is no match for Nightmare.  
  
**Jun：**  
All knights, to arms!  
Our mission today: to exterminate the Living Mail!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Roger that, Captain Jun!  
Hiyaaaahhh!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Justice strikes!  
Think you can take a hero's blade?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Wait!  
You can't just rush in blindly, Matsuri!  
  
**Tomo：**  
The enemy feeds on metal, right?  
Hitting it with blades might just make it stronger!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ehhh?! How else are we gonna fight, though? With our fists?  
But it's made of metal, so if I punched it, I'd break my own bones!  
  
**Jun：**  
Actually, after facing them in extended physical combat already,  
our weapons and armor may already be infected.  
My armor has begun to feel unusually heavy.  
  
**Jun：**  
I fear our enemy is controlling portions of it and resisting my motions.  
After this battle, we'll need to inspect our equipment  
and thoroughly sterilize it to remove any contamination.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Uerghh... That's kind of creepy!  
But now that you mention it, my sword swings  
have veered weirdly off-course a few times...  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah. For a force such as Nightmare,  
specializing as we do in heavily armed close-quarters combat,  
you could say this beast is our natural enemy!  
  
**Tomo：**  
You think that's funny?!  
Wh-what should we do?  
Aren't we almost out of options here?  
  
**Christina：**  
Fear not, little girl.  
 How sweet you are! ♪  
Lucky for you, I anticipated this situation, and convinced  
Her Majesty to lend me a specialized magical weapon!  
  
**Christina：**  
It's only a prototype, so it's not pretty,  
but I've brought a magical cannon made entirely of wood!  
That's the gist, anyway.  
  
**Christina：**  
I put it together in a hurry, so it'll only withstand a single blast,  
but the high-concentration heat ray it fires  
will wipe that beast from the face of Astraea!  
  
**Christina：**  
All you need to do is lead the enemy to the spot I indicate.  
I'll adjust the angle and direct the ray to avoid any harm  
to the district's residents.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hm? That's a surprise.  
With your attitude, I wouldn't have thought you'd care  
how many bystanders it hits.  
  
**Christina：**  
I have more love for humans than you might think, little Tomo.  
They're a rare and delightful source of entertainment  
in this tiresome world.  
  
**Christina：**  
At any rate... Though it's no skin off my back,  
I'd advise you to do as I say before I change my mind.  
Once in a while, you should heed your vice-captain's orders!  
  
**Tomo：**  
All right...  
I'm not sure I like taking orders from you, but no point in arguing.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let me help you fight!  
`Tag 1`  
**Tomo：**  
Yes, I'd appreciate that.  
In fact, if you hadn't offered, I might have asked you.  
  
**Christina：**  
True enough.  
Young lad, you have the power to strengthen your allies, yes?  
Use that strength to support us in battle.  
  
**Jun：**  
Yes, that seems best.  
Lend us your strength, young man.  
In the cruel world of the battlefield, only the strong can survive.  
  
**Jun：**  
I would have preferred not to bring you along to such a place...  
But do not worry. I will protect you with my very life.  
  
**Jun：**  
Not only you, but also the citizens...  
Everyone in this world who needs my protection.  
  
**Jun：**  
That is what justice means.  
What these weapons and armor, and we ourselves,  
were born to defend.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh, yes! That feels good!  
I love it... There's power coursing through me!  
  
**Tomo：**  
With this, we can win!  
Thank you, {player}!  
Matsuri, can you run around and draw that beast's attention?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ehhh?! OK, I'm on it!  
I'll do whatever you say, Tomo!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
C'mon, then!  
Demon, demon, time to play!  
Hear me clap and come this way!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'll set off a rainbow firecracker to draw its attention!  
How's that?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Perfect! The enemy's already turning to lurch over in your direction!  
Hahah... It may have a little intelligence,  
but it has no sense of fighting technique!  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'll teach it a few lessons in the Mikuma school of swordsmanship!  
Let me just grapple its legs... and shift its center of gravity!  
  
**Tomo：**  
With its feet lifted from the ground,  
it's a sitting duck for me to cook up as I please!  
Victory is as good as ours!  
  
**Jun：**  
That's so reckless...  
Diving between the legs of a rampaging monster that size,  
and even grappling them...  
  
**Jun：**  
Far be it from me to fault a daring deed,  
but one wrong step and you would have been crushed!  
  
**Jun：**  
Still, your courage will not go to waste!  
Hrnghh!  
  
**Jun：**  
Urgh... I fear my armor's contamination is spreading.  
My whole body feels heavy... But since I was a child,  
I have lived my entire life encased in heavy armor.  
  
**Jun：**  
This weight is my ally, and it will only aid my strength!  
  
**Jun：**  
Chris!  
I'll slam into the enemy and knock it into the air!  
Use that moment to fire the cannon!  
  
**Christina：**  
As you wish.  
Hahah... A united front can be fun once in a while!  
I'm enjoying this!  
  
**Jun：**  
It's our job, not a game to enjoy.  
Let us do what we must!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hahah.  
 My dears, it's time you fell back behind me.  
Touch this beam even for a second, and it'll turn your bones to ash!  
  
**Jun：**  
Whoa...  
All knights, take cover! Brace for the shockwave!  
Don't you hold anything back, Chris!  
  
**Christina：**  
Very well!  
Let's paint the sky with fireworks,  
and you can call it a beacon of justice!  
  
![500600602.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/500600602.webp)  
**Christina：**  
Oh, yeesh... These clouds of dust are dirtying my outfit.  
  
![500600603.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/500600603.webp)  
**Christina：**  
And yet somehow, my spirits are still fairly high.  
This was quite the little stress reliever!  
  
**Christina：**  
Tracking down the scraps  
and filling in the paperwork for all the damage we caused here  
will be a headache and a half...  
  
**Christina：**  
But I'll leave that nonsense to the rest of you.  
That's what comrades do!  
I'm lucky to be blessed with such fine guildmates!  
  
**Jun：**  
You only call us that when it suits you...  
But ah well. I do feel the same way.  
  
**Jun：**  
Now, ray that rends the heavens...  
May you extinguish doubts and fears as surely as you did that monster.  
I know things are never so easy in reality, but I can only pray.  
  
**Narration：**  
Thus it was that, bathed in the glow of a terrible ray,  
the unusual monster known as the Living Mail  
was most thoroughly vaporized.  
  
**Narration：**  
Thanks to the work of Nightmare, Defenders of the Throne,  
the crisis menacing the city had been averted.  
  
**Narration：**  
And after a thorough search using metal-detecting magic,  
it was determined that no threat remained. There may be no  
absolutes in this world, but this incident, at least, was over.
