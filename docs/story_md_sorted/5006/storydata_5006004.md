# Nightmares at Large
The suits of armor that caused the commotion turn out to be empty. Realizing why her guildmates have been avoiding her, Jun battles the phantoms together with Christina, but they escape the palace and begin causing chaos in the city.

**Christina：**  
Whatever their nature,  
these monsters are hardly impressive in terms of strength.  
We should have no trouble suppressing them.  
  
**Jun：**  
True enough...  
Let's split up and try to restrain them with handcuffs and ropes.  
  
**Jun：**  
Even if a fatal blow does not kill them,  
they cannot cause chaos with their movements sealed.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ehhhh...?  
I'm still denied the pleasure of a fight to the death?  
  
**Jun：**  
Such conflicts are a thing of the past, my dear Chris.  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmmm. Still, though their origins are still unclear,  
these creatures may serve to explain  
why my guildmates have been avoiding me of late.  
  
**Jun：**  
I was unsure what could have unnerved my comrades so,  
but given the situation...  
I can only assume they had unfortunate encounters with my impostor.  
  
**Jun：**  
Most likely, they were attacked without rhyme or reason.  
Given their identical appearance,  
it would be difficult to realize that I was not the culprit.  
  
**Jun：**  
To Tomo and the others, it would seem I had turned on them myself.  
Yes, that must be it.  
  
**Jun：**  
Thank goodness...  
Solving that mystery is a weight off my mind.  
Not that it helps with our current predicament.  
  
**Christina：**  
What's all this?  
 I'm not sure I follow...  
But it sounds like despite your imposing presence,  
you're still a sensitive soul at heart.  
  
**Christina：**  
You really are a cute little thing, eh, Captain?  
  
**Jun：**  
Huh...? Th-thank you.  
I don't think I've ever been called \"cute\" in my life...  
  
**Christina：**  
I didn't mean it as a compliment...  
...  
Oh! I just had the most wonderful idea!  
  
**Christina：**  
Captain...  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm?  
What is it now, Chris?  
  
**Christina：**  
Time to diiiiie! ☆  
  
**Jun：**  
Ahh...!  
That was close. What's this all of a sudden?  
Why start attacking me?  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah! Impressive dodging!  
So sorry... With all these foes that look just like you,  
it's so easy to get the wrong target!  
  
**Christina：**  
Dear me... Which is the real captain?  
I'm afraid I just can't seem to tell!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah! Is it you?!  
Are you the impostor?! Let's find out! ♪  
  
**Jun：**  
A-ahh...! Stop that!  
I'm the real Jun! The impostor's over there!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah! Isn't that what all impostors say?!  
If you're the genuine article, prove it!  
Well, I suppose slicing your head from your shoulders will suffice!  
  
**Christina：**  
If you don't die, you're fake. And if you do, you're real!  
Ahahahahahah! ☆  
  
**Jun：**  
Hold it, hold it! That's enough, Chris!  
This is no time for games!  
I know you're more intelligent than this! You can see I'm no fake!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ohhhh? What's that?  
I can't hear you over the sound of clashing blades! ♪  
  
**Jun：**  
Urghhh... I hate it when Chris gets like this.  
Why does she have such a taste for mischief?  
I can't say I know why, but she jumps at any opportunity to fight me...  
  
**Jun：**  
I suppose this situation was just the excuse she needed.  
But I can't play along right now. It's really not the time...  
H-how can I stop her, young man?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Convince her with heartfelt reasoning.  
**Choice: (2)**  Take off your helmet.  
`Tag 1`  
**Jun：**  
Urgh... If only she were the kind of opponent  
who would listen to reason.  
  
**Jun：**  
Ah, but... with a convincing-enough argument...  
Yes, I just had a good idea!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Jun：**  
Huh? Why would I...?  
Oh... I see. That might just work!  
  
`Tag 3`

**Jun：**  
Look, Chris!  
I have removed my helmet!  
  
**Jun：**  
Those fakes are empty suits of armor, yes?  
But as you can see, I have a real human face!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah! Now that's a desperate ploy!  
I thought you hated to show your face to anyone!  
  
**Jun：**  
Well, yes. It's very embarrassing...  
But I couldn't think of another way.  
  
**Christina：**  
How artless you are!  
Which only makes you all the sweeter,  
and heightens my desire to spill your blood!  
  
**Christina：**  
Come now, Captain!  
Court me with your blade!  
Let's bare our flesh and souls as you have bared your face!  
  
`image display end`  
**Jun：**  
Uaghh?! Wh-why do you not cease your attack?  
What are you trying to accomplish, Chris?!  
You're starting to make me angry!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah! That's right!  
Your anger is exactly what I desire!  
Then we can do battle at last! ☆  
  
**Monster A：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Jun：**  
A-ahh?!  
Oh no... The impostors are escaping!  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh...?  
Did my ardent thirst for blood strike fear into their hearts?  
  
**Christina：**  
I suppose even mindless vermin have primitive survival instincts.  
Though compared to humans, their meager minds bore me.  
  
**Jun：**  
Can you stop your rambling for a moment  
and help me go after them, Chris?!  
  
**Jun：**  
Any other knights who are able, follow me too!  
The enemy is heading out into the city!  
  
**Jun：**  
We cannot allow them to bring harm to any defenseless citizens!  
Defending the populace from calamities such as this  
is precisely why Nightmare exists!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah.  
 Yet it appears to be those very knights of Nightmare  
that now threaten to bathe the city in bloodshed!  
 How amusing! ♪  
  
**Jun：**  
This is no joke!  
Oh, for the... I'm giving you a proper talking-to later, Chris!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah, but no! Let me make a prediction as Her Majesty does.  
Far from lecturing me after this, you will praise me instead!  
  
**Christina：**  
And so, if I may, let me respond in advance...  
\"Think nothing of it! It was my pleasure!\" ♪  
  
**Jun：**
