**Narration：**  
Meanwhile, back at the palace...  
Heading through the gate to investigate the commotion,  
Jun finds herself faced with a disturbing sight.  
  
**Royal Knight?：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
Wh-what's wrong, soldier?  
Why're you attacking me? Is this an uprising?! ...Nguaaahhhh!  
  
**Royal Knight?：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Royal Knight?：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Jun：**  
What in the world is going on here?  
  
**Jun：**  
My fellow knights of Nightmare are attacking one another?  
And they're striking to kill? Why would they do such a thing?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Jun!  
`Tag 1`  
**Jun：**  
Hm?  
Ah—young man. I thought I told you it's too dangerous here.  
You should follow your elders' instructions.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm sorry.  
**Choice: (3)**  I was worried about you...  
`Tag 2`  
**Jun：**  
Yes, that's the right attitude.  
If you were to be injured, I would never forgive myself.  
  
**Jun：**  
This may be a selfish request...  
But I would like you to put your own safety first, for me.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Jun：**  
...I see. Your concern touches me, but it is not necessary.  
This is, after all, my job. I am prepared to face danger.  
You, however, are a mere civilian, are you not?  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Jun：**  
...Still, this is no time to stand around talking.  
  
**Jun：**  
With all these knights fighting wildly,  
we must take swift but considered action.  
You should try to stay behind me, young man.  
  
**Jun：**  
The situation is far from clear,  
but first, I should attempt to stop the fighting.  
  
**Jun：**  
Comrades! What is the meaning of this?  
I order you to desist from combat at once!  
  
**Jun：**  
The royal palace, where our esteemed monarch dwells,  
is no place for unrestrained brutality!  
Have you no shame?!  
  
**Royal Knight Captain：**  
Ahhh, Captain! Are you still yourself?  
Th-these knights started attacking us out of nowhere... Aaghh!

**Jun?：**  
...  
  
**Jun：**  
...Hmm?  
  
**Royal Knight Captain：**  
Wh-wha...?  
Am I seeing double?  
  
**Jun?：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Royal Knight Captain：**  
Aaaghhh!  
  
`image display end`  
**Jun：**  
Look out!  
Don't just run around like a headless chicken—  
put up some resistance!  
  
**Jun：**  
What do you think all your rigorous training is for?!  
It's so you can handle emergencies like this!  
  
**Royal Knight Captain：**  
R-right!  
I'm sorry! I just don't understand what's happening—?!  
  
**Jun：**  
Nor do I.  
But we must nonetheless take action!  
  
**Jun：**  
Preserving the peace within the palace  
is our very highest priority as Nightmare, Defenders of the Throne.  
  
**Jun：**  
So save your complaints for later!  
All knights of Nightmare, if you hear and understand my words,  
draw your blades and stand firm!  
  
**Jun：**  
In the name of peace and justice, we must overcome this crisis!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahahah! ☆  
You're as respectable and deathly serious as ever—  
or should I say, no fun at all! Eh, Captain?  
  
**Jun：**  
Ah—Chris! I mean, Vice-Captain Christina!  
I should have known you would not miss such a chaotic situation.  
However do you do it?  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh, I just happened to be around.  
The chaos naturally finds me!  
  
**Christina：**  
In fact, I was enjoying a cup of tea with Her Majesty,  
so this interruption is frankly quite irritating.  
  
**Jun：**  
And are you... ah, how to say... entirely sane?  
  
**Christina：**  
I get asked that a lot.  
But really, how can anyone be expected to judge their own sanity?  
  
**Christina：**  
By what standards should I measure it?  
Even a god cannot know the state of his own mind! Ahahah! ☆  
  
**Christina：**  
So for mere mortals like ourselves, the best we can do  
is to follow the ideals we believe in.  
Is that not the way of Nightmare, my dear captain? ♪  
  
**Jun：**  
Yes... I suppose so.  
I'm glad to see your mind seems clear, Chris.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmph.  
I've told you enough times,  
only my friends may address me in that way.  
  
**Christina：**  
And it irritates me to receive such praise  
just for plainly speaking my mind.  
  
**Jun?：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Christina：**  
...Well, well. Bold of you to interrupt my banter  
with our uncharacteristically agitated captain.  
  
**Christina：**  
Still, I must say, if you must imitate her, at least do a better job!  
You'll earn no applause with that third-rate act, irritating clown!  
  
**Christina：**  
Your swordplay, your movements—all unrefined and hopelessly  
inadequate! How shameful! Do you mean to kill me with laughter?  
If this is your best impression of our captain, you'll never be an actor!  
  
**Christina：**  
This is an insult to the woman I begrudgingly respect—  
no, to all knights of this realm!  
 I'll free your head from  
those shoulders, so kiss the filthy ground and repent!  
  
**Jun?：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm?  
 That felt a little *too* easy...  
  
**Jun：**  
Ahh... It's more than a little uncomfortable to stand and watch  
as a foe with my own appearance is summarily beheaded.  
  
**Jun：**  
And if I may, Chris, it seems unwise to execute the enemy  
before we are even certain of its nature.  
  
**Christina：**  
Well, aren't you the saint.  
But alas, it seems these foes may not fit so neatly  
into your preconceptions of morality.  
  
**Jun?：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Jun：**  
It stood back up?  
After its head was sliced clean off?  
  
**Royal Knight?：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm. And what's more, it seems to be gathering  
several more of its kind.  
  
**Christina：**  
What are these beings?  
Their strength is hardly impressive...  
But their nebulous nature is a little unnerving.  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm...  
They are like phantoms from a bad dream.  
Could they perhaps be the \"Shadows\" I have heard rumors of?  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah, those strange monsters that have appeared of late,  
taking the form of other living souls... I've faced them  
a few times myself, but these phantoms seem a little different.  
  
**Christina：**  
Or so it feels to me. At least, the Shadows I've encountered  
could be felled with an ordinary fatal blow.  
But these, it seems, are able to recover from any injury.  
  
**Christina：**  
What's more, if my eyes do not deceive me,  
there is nothing inside that armor.  
  
**Christina：**  
Shadows, though mere imitations, do possess physical bodies.  
But these beings are all deceptive appearances.  
  
**Christina：**  
How tedious.  
What use is a foe with no flesh to rend,  
and no screams nor blood to garnish the taste of victory?  
  
**Jun：**  
I fear I may never understand your tastes, Chris...  
But if these are not Shadows, the question remains: what are they?  
  
**Christina：**  
Who knows? Do I look like a scholar or philosopher?  
I have little interest in classifications.
