**Narration：**  
Nearly an hour later...  
  
**Monster A：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Monster B：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Jun：**  
*huff*... *puff*... Finally, I've caught up with them!  
Running has never been my strong suit,  
what with the weight of my armor...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Could you not just take it off?  
`Tag 1`  
**Jun：**  
No—as you already know, my family code forbids it...  
Wait, did you follow me all this way, young man?  
You really should get yourself to safety...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I want to help.  
`Tag 2`  
**Jun：**  
Ahhh... Well, I won't deny that your ability  
to lend power to your allies is invaluable...  
But this will be dangerous, so at least try to keep your distance.  
  
**Jun：**  
At any rate...  
There is nowhere left to run!  
Surrender yourselves to the law!  
  
**Jun：**  
All knights of Nightmare, surround the enemy!  
Pin them down and restrain them securely!  
If they resist, feel free to sever their limbs as necessary!  
  
**Jun：**  
Our enemies have no bodies of flesh...  
The armor itself seems to be their bodies, so they will not die easily!  
There will be no blood or screams to haunt you with guilt!  
  
**Jun：**  
So go forth, and like a hero slaying monsters in a fairy tale,  
strike down evil with pride!  
  
**Jun：**  
Whew... I'm not good at making speeches, but I do what I must.  
Facing enemies that look like their own comrades  
is causing hesitance and confusion amongst the knights.  
  
**Jun：**  
I must set an example of unwavering confidence,  
the better to set them at ease.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Captain Jun!  
Wh-wh-wh-what the heck's going on here?!  
  
**Jun：**  
Hm? Young Matsuri?  
Ah, come to think of it, you live in this area, don't you?  
This is dangerous, so new recruits like yourself should get to safety.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
No, I'm gonna fight too! This district is my home!  
  
**Tomo：**  
You could use some extra manpower, couldn't you, Jun?  
Let us lend you our strength.  
  
**Jun：**  
Tomo, you too...?  
Hmm? What brings both of you here?  
  
**Tomo：**  
It's plain coincidence.  
 I just went out for a meal with Matsuri,  
and I was walking her back home when we ran into this commotion.  
  
**Tomo：**  
What are all these knights?  
There seem to be two Juns...  
Are these the \"Shadows\" I've been hearing about?  
  
**Jun：**  
I don't think so, but we're not sure.  
Their nature is a mystery, but we can't let them run wild.They are terrorizing the populace in the guise of our very own knights.  
  
**Jun：**  
I can't forgive them for that.  
Thanks to their misdeeds, I was even forced to worry  
that my fellow knights had grown to hate me.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahhh...  
I see now. Suddenly everything makes sense.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Impostors taking our forms... I didn't think of that possibility.  
With all the talk of Shadows, I should have known better.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Guess I'm still a foolish child...  
It must have hurt me more than I realized  
when that fake Jun treated me so coldly.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I wasn't thinking properly. I'm sorry for doubting you.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I should've known better too...  
Nefarious impostors are a classic enemy for any hero to face!  
Why didn't I see through it right away?  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha. Please don't blame yourselves. Their appearances are truly  
identical, after all... Let's just try to strengthen our bonds from now on,  
until we are close enough that no impostor can fool us.  
  
**Jun：**  
For the sake of that future—  
for the day when we can care openly for one another  
without once falling prey to suspicion or mistrust...  
  
**Jun：**  
Let us work together to overcome this crisis.  
  
**Jun：**  
Are you with me, my friends?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
'Course I am!  
 I've gotta prove it was impostors doing all the bad stuff,  
so my mom and dad... No, so everyone living in this district  
can see the truth about you guys!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Yes. If we can defeat the enemy and clear Jun's name at the same time,  
that would be two birds with one stone.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Could it be that's why you chased them here to the beastfolk quarter?  
Wow, impressive work. I never knew you were such a strategist!  
  
**Jun：**  
Huh...?  
Ah, no... I was just chasing after them as best I could.  
  
**Jun：**  
It was quite the challenge.  
Particularly since Chris sent her personal subordinates  
to obstruct me along the way...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Christina did that? Hmmm...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  It was a real struggle.  
`Tag 3`  
**Tomo：**  
Oh...? {player}!  
I didn't even see you there. What are you, invisible?  
Hahah... Were you on a little date with Jun, perhaps? ♪  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Whaaa?! Are you two in *that* kind of relationship?!  
I-I dunno how to feel about that!  
But if it's Jun, I guess...  
  
**Jun：**  
N-not at all!  
Let's not get any funny ideas now!  
It's true that this young man is a friend of mine, but...  
  
**Jun?：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Tomo：**  
...Oh, look! I guess the time for conversation is over!  
Our enemies have realized they're cornered and started panicking!  
They're going completely berserk now!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ooh, sounds like the big climax!  
I'm getting fired up now!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Villains who disturb the peace  
are gonna wish they never messed with Nightmare!  
Hero's Code, Rule the Second! \"Justice always prevails!\"  
  
**Tomo：**  
Yes.  
For today, at least, nobody can deny that justice is on our side.  
Time for my blade to make short work of them, I think!  
  
**Monster A：**  
GRRUOOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Monster B：**  
GRRUOOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm?  
Look out, you two./7 They're acting somewhat strangely!  
  
**Jun：**  
Young Matsuri, while we do battle, can you get the civilians to safety?  
You are a neighbor and fellow to them.  
They will sooner follow you than the knights they mistrust!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
R-right! Sounds like a job only I can do!  
Hey, guys! You all gotta get indoors where it's safe!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ah...!  
Not good! There's some civilians in trouble over by that fountain!  
  
**Beastfolk Woman：**  
A-aahhh...  
  
**Beastfolk Girl：**  
Waaahhh! I'm scared!  
  
**Jun：**  
Oh dear...  
It looks like the child is hurt, and unable to flee for herself.  
  
**Jun：**  
Her mother is attempting to carry her to safety,  
but the enemy is closing in around them.  
  
**Jun：**  
Fear not!  
I will be with you at once!  
  
**Beastfolk Woman：**  
Aaahh! Stay back!  
Don't you dare harm my girl!  
  
**Jun：**  
I cannot abandon a citizen in need. That is my duty as a knight!  
In fact, I swear I will save both mother and child alike!  
  
**Monster B：**  
GRRUOOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Jun：**  
Urgh... They're moving too fast!  
I'll have to leap in and shield them with my body!  
  
**Monster B：**  
GRRUOOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Beastfolk Woman：**  
Ahhh...?!  
  
**Jun：**  
...There. Are you all right? That was awfully close.  
I apologize if this makes you uncomfortable,  
but please allow me to carry you to safety!  
  
**Beastfolk Woman：**  
B-but you... You're bleeding!  
Th-the sword went through your armor...!  
  
**Jun：**  
It's only a scratch, really. Nothing a little healing magic won't fix.  
More importantly, I'm glad the two of you are safe.  
  
**Beastfolk Woman：**  
...  
  
**Jun：**  
...Ah!  
I thought my face felt strangely bare. Where is my helmet?!  
D-did the impact knock it off just now?  
  
**Beastfolk Girl：**  
H-hey, mister...  
Is this helmet yours?  
  
**Jun：**  
Ah, so that's where it had gotten to.  
Thank you for your help.  
Although actually... I am a \"miss\" rather than a \"mister.\"  
  
**Monster B：**  
GRRUOOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm. More enemies seem to be gathering.  
I'll have to recover my helmet later.  
Ensuring everyone's safety takes priority.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Captain Jun! I'm with you!  
I'll open up an escape route, so hurry and get those civilians to safety!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Y-you can hide in this house for now!  
Don't worry—it's my house, so you'll be safe here!  
  
**Jun：**  
Right. Very good.  
Now then... Let's finish what we came here to do.
