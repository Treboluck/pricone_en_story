# Lonesome Captain
Outside the palace gate, Jun sighs to herself. She explains to {player} that her guildmates Matsuri and Tomo have been avoiding her recently, and she doesn't know why. Suddenly, an alarm rings out in the palace.
  
## Subtitle: Lonesome Captain
  
**Narration：**  
One day, {player} notices Jun  
giving a deep sigh as she stands outside the palace gate.  
  
**Narration：**  
Concerned about his friend's well-being,  
{player} walks over to ask what's wrong.  
  
**Jun：**  
*sigh*... How did this happen?  
Did I do something wrong, I wonder?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hi there, Jun.  
`Tag 1`  
**Jun：**  
Hmm?  
Ah, hello there.  
  
**Jun：**  
Young man, I've asked you before to keep your distance from the palace.  
With all the esteemed individuals living within,  
security is always very tight here.  
  
**Jun：**  
If you are seen loitering outside, you'll draw unnecessary suspicion  
and find yourself thrown into a cell.  
  
**Jun：**  
Ignorance may not be a crime,  
but sadly, the palace is not kind to potential threats.  
  
**Jun：**  
I know you're a fine young man,  
so I would not treat you harshly without reason.  
But I will restrain you if I must. I have a duty to protect the palace.  
  
**Jun：**  
*sigh*...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Is something wrong?  
`Tag 2`  
**Jun：**  
Oh, ah... I'm sorry.  
How very rude of me to sigh in front of a visitor.  
  
**Jun：**  
Are you worried about me, young man?  
As I thought, you are a kind and caring lad.  
  
**Jun：**  
Well, the truth is... There seems to be a problem  
between me and my fellow Nightmare guild members.  
  
**Jun：**  
As you know, I am something of a solitary guardian,  
so I have never been especially close to my guildmates...  
  
**Jun：**  
But lately, I had found myself enjoying conversations  
with certain people.Be it Vice-Captain Christina, the new recruit Tomo,  
or our eager apprentice Matsuri...  
  
**Jun：**  
We had started sharing meals after work,  
or even going on shopping trips on our days off.  
I'd never spent much time with friends before, so it made me happy.  
  
**Jun：**  
Ever since I was a young girl, I have always worn full armor in public,  
so others are often intimidated by me. I have never caused trouble,  
and I make an effort to be polite and friendly, but alas...  
  
**Jun：**  
...At any rate. My fellow knights of Nightmare  
are fine folk who I am lucky to call comrades.  
Not to mention  the closest thing I have to good friends.  
  
**Jun：**  
Which is why...  
It bothers me that they seem to be avoiding me recently.  
  
**Jun：**  
Many of the ordinary knights have always kept me at arm's length,  
but recently, even Tomo and Matsuri have been acting strangely distant.  
  
**Jun：**  
When I greet them, they seem to flinch and say \"Good morning\"  
as fast as they can before immediately hurrying off. The look in their  
eyes when they see me reminds me of an animal sensing danger.  
  
**Jun：**  
Why could that be? The reason eludes me entirely.  
Did I do something to scare them? I don't remember any such thing,  
and I can't ask them to explain, since they flee as soon as I approach.  
  
**Jun：**  
It's as though I have suddenly become a pariah in the ranks.  
I do not understand it.  
It concerns me so much, I cannot help but sigh at my post.  
  
**Jun：**  
Young man, do you have any idea why they are avoiding me?  
What could I have done? Why do they look at me with fear?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I don't think you're scary.  
**Choice: (4)**  Your armor [i]is[/i] kind of intimidating.  
`Tag 3`  
**Jun：**  
Th-thank you...  
It's true—just seeing you act so normally feels like such a relief.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Jun：**  
Hmm, I suppose you may be right...  
Perhaps I should find some cuter-looking armor.  
  
**Jun：**  
But no—I have a duty to guard the palace gates.  
It is my job to be intimidating.  
  
**Jun：**  
Besides, Tomo and the others are used to my appearance.  
It's hard to imagine they would suddenly be afraid of it now.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Jun：**  
...Haha. You know, speaking with you  
has helped me to calm down a little.  
  
**Jun：**  
I do not know the reason why people are avoiding me,  
but I will find out, apologize to them if necessary,  
and hopefully mend our relationship.  
  
**Jun：**  
I have no desire to be all alone.  
  
**Jun：**  
Young man... If you wouldn't mind,  
I would like to consult with you again whenever we see one another.  
  
**Jun：**  
Simply sharing my problems with you takes a load off my chest.  
It may not be much fun for you, but I would appreciate it.  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm?  
What's this? I hear a commotion within the palace.  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
Aaaarghhh!  
H-h-heeeelp! Don't kill meeeeee!  
  
**Jun：**  
Whoa! Wh-what's wrong?  
Explain yourself! What is the situation?!  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
Ahhh... Huh...?  
Arghhh! Get away from me!  
  
**Jun：**  
Dear me... Calm yourself!  
Why would you point your blade at a comrade?  
What has come over you? Do you not recognize me?  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
Th-the armor! The suits of armor!  
I thought they were fellow knights, but they're like monsters...!  
  
**Jun：**  
Armor...?  
What's this about armor?  
Calm down! Explain from the very beginning!  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
A... Aaaarghhhh!  
Help meeeee!  
  
**Jun：**  
Ahh... He ran away.  
I don't quite understand, but how shameful.  
A knight sworn to guard the palace, fleeing his post in terror...  
  
**Jun：**  
...Young man. Though the details are unclear,  
it seems something strange is afoot.  
I have a duty to protect the palace from danger, so I cannot ignore this.  
  
**Jun：**  
I must hurry to confirm the situation within these walls.  
Danger may be nearby, so you should go home quickly.  
  
**Jun：**  
Goodbye for now, young man.  
Thank you again for hearing me out.
