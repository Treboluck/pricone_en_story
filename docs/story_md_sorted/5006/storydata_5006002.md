# Mistrust and Suspicion
Matsuri explains to Tomo that Jun has been rampaging wildly in the beastfolk quarter lately, so her mother had forbidden her from going to training. Tomo reveals that she's also noticed Jun acting strangely of late.
  
## Subtitle: Mistrust and Suspicion
  
**Narration：**  
After their narrow escape,  
Tomo and Matsuri make their way to a cafe in central Landosol,  
where they sit down for a hearty lunch.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Here you go, Matsuri—the menu.  
Feel free to order whatever you like.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Yay, this hamburg steak looks delish!  
Gotta eat lots of meat to grow up strong! ☆  
  
**Tomo：**  
The hamburg steak lunch? Got it. And for your drink?  
Meat on its own isn't exactly the peak of nutrition,  
so how about some vegetable juice?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Guehhh... Veggies are my nemesis!  
Ummm, would a cream soda be out of the question...?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha. I'm not going to stop you.  
Your tastes really do match your age, don't they?  
Myself, I'll have the seasonal grilled fish with a cup of green tea.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Yeesh!  
I've been thinking this for a while, Tomo,  
but you've got the tastes of an old granny!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Well, I grew up in an old-fashioned household.  
A swordfighting dojo passed down through generations...  
Anyway, that's enough about me.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Let's get back on topic. It's time I asked the question I came here for.  
Matsuri... Why have you been skipping training?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh, I'm not here to lecture you or anything.  
I'm just worried about you.  
So I'd appreciate it if you could open up to me.  
  
**Tomo：**  
In the current Nightmare ranks,  
you're the closest to my own age, so I think of you like a sister.  
I want us to get along, and I'd like to help you if you're in trouble.  
  
**Tomo：**  
No... I just care about you, that's all.  
So please, try to trust me a little.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Like a sister...  
 That's so nice.  
Actually, I always thought of you like a real big sister too!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So, um... I guess I'll spill the beans.  
This might sound a bit weird, but have you noticed  
Jun's been acting kinda strange lately?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ah. You think so too?  
  
**Tomo：**  
I thought she might just have a problem with me,  
but if you've noticed it as well...  
She's definitely been acting very unusual recently.  
  
**Tomo：**  
As the palace gatekeeper,  
she usually doesn't move from her post outside the main gate...  
  
**Tomo：**  
But recently, I've started seeing her in town.  
Prowling around in the shadiest districts, no less.  
  
**Tomo：**  
And when I try to say hi, she just flat out ignores me.  
  
**Tomo：**  
One time I got so annoyed, I tried to get a rise out of her  
by going \"Oh, Juuuun! ♪\" and hugging her from behind.  
  
**Tomo：**  
And how d'you think she reacted?  
Without saying a word, she violently shoved me away.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Look—I've still got the scrapes on my knees to show for it.  
It hurt my heart as well as my body.  
I always thought Jun and I had a better relationship than that...  
  
**Tomo：**  
She may be stoic and duty-bound, but that's what makes her  
fun to mess with...  
 And no matter how much I tease her,  
in the end, she always lets me off with a laugh.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I've always been fond of our fine captain.  
I can't think of anyone I'd trust better  
to lead this guild down the right path.  
  
**Tomo：**  
But lately, it's like she's a whole different person.  
As though there's someone else hiding inside her armor.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I can't believe it... She's been treating you like that too, Tomo?  
It's been the same story with me. Or maybe even worse.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Thing is... for the past few days,  
she's been appearing in the beastfolk quarter where you just found me.  
Every time, she goes on a rampage, then leaves without a word.  
  
**Tomo：**  
What...?! Surely there must be some mistake...  
Could it be that she came to take care of  
someone who'd been committing crimes in the area?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
No way in heck!  
We're all honest people, living simple, quiet lives!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I mean, beastfolk can have pretty short tempers,  
so yeah, there's a bit of fighting most days...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But no one actually breaks the law!  
Besides, even if they had, Jun was going way too far!  
Smashing buildings apart left and right, attacking random passersby...!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Nobody deserves all that!  
Thankfully, there haven't been any serious injuries so far,  
but at this rate, it's only a matter of time!  
  
**Tomo：**  
I see... No wonder the local residents have become so hostile  
towards Nightmare in particular. You should have seen the glares I got  
just walking down the street today.  
  
**Tomo：**  
At the time, I thought it was just the grudge  
that the beastfolk have always held against the royal knights...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
S-sure, some people never liked Nightmare,  
but recently, it's gone to a totally different level!  
They're even starting to talk about storming the palace!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Even my mom says it's \"too dangerous\"  
for me to hang around with Nightmare...  
That's why she hasn't been letting me out of the house.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ah, so that's why you've been missing training.  
I see. That makes a lot of sense.  
  
**Tomo：**  
However, I can't understand it.  
What could have possessed Jun to do all of this?  
  
**Tomo：**  
It's not like her at all...  
I guess there's nothing left to do but ask her in person.  
  
**Tomo：**  
If worst comes to worst, I may even have to strike her down.  
Even our beloved captain has no right to persecute the innocent.  
  
**Tomo：**  
As knights of Nightmare, we have to defend the peace.
