## Subtitle: Looking to the Future
  
**Narration：**  
Once the aftermath of the incident has settled down,  
the members of Nightmare meet at a local restaurant  
and share a meal to celebrate.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Great work, everyone!  
`Tag 1`  
**Tomo：**  
Thanks, {player}.  
...  
But actually, what are you doing here with us?  
I thought this celebration was just for us Nightmare members.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ahaha, {player} really helped us a bunch back there.  
If it wasn't for him powering us up,  
I dunno how we'd ever have beaten such a nasty monster!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Actually, I work here part-time.  
**Choice: (3)**  I wanted to celebrate with you guys.  
`Tag 2`  
**Tomo：**  
Oh...? Now you mention it, I guess you are wearing this  
restaurant's uniform.  
 Suits you pretty well, too!  
You look more dashing than ever.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Matsuri：**  
Whoa, that's great!  
But you fought just as hard as the rest of us,  
so quit serving the food and come chow down too!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Jun：**  
Now, now, everyone.  
Try not to distract {player} too much.  
He's supposed to be working.  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha. Young man, once your shift is over, I do hope you will join us.  
You need plenty of nutrition at your age,  
and after all the help you gave us, I will gladly pay for your share.  
  
**Jun：**  
At any rate.  
Everyone, thank you for all your hard work.  
  
**Jun：**  
Thanks to your efforts, this crisis has been thoroughly averted,  
and peace restored to the city.  
Let us return to our duties with renewed vigor, and—

**Christina：**  
Cheers!  
That's enough long, boring speeches, Captain!  
You're dragging the mood down!  
  
**Christina：**  
Besides, where's the use in dwelling on what's in the past?  
Leave that for when you're old and gray!  
 While we're in the prime  
of our youth, we should look to our bright and shining futures!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahaha.  
You sure you're in the \"prime of your youth,\" old lady?  
  
**Christina：**  
You're so dead! ♪  
Though your attitude does please me.  
Shower me in that venomous hatred!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh, I don't hate you.  
In fact, I see you in a new light after this incident.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I always thought you were a traitor in the making,  
but I guess you do have the Nightmare spirit of justice after all.  
  
**Christina：**  
You think so? I'd hate to be mistaken for a do-gooder.  
What would I do without my mischief?  
 In this world full of frustrations,  
the more opportunity I have to let loose, the better!  
  
**Christina：**  
I'd advise the rest of you to follow your desires once in a while, too.  
It's no use preaching about justice all day long.  
How will you recognize evil if you don't know it yourself?

**Matsuri：**  
Ooh, sounds pretty deep...  
So this is the wisdom that comes with age!  
  
**Christina：**  
Why, you... It may seem like a laughing matter now,  
but you won't be laughing when your own turn comes around  
and you learn how much those comments sting.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah, the tragedy of age. Truly the cruelest of fates.  
I fear I may have grown too soft over the years.  
My exploits during this incident weren't like me at all.  
  
**Jun：**  
Yes... Chris, I should thank you.  
You drove the enemy toward the beastfolk quarter  
so that I would be able to clear my name, did you not?  
  
**Jun：**  
You showed the citizens firsthand that the ones who had  
been tormenting them were only monsters in human guise.  
Thanks to that, our reputation has begun to recover.  
  
**Jun：**  
Of course, things are never quite that simple.  
The palace has earned much resentment over the years,  
and that will not disappear overnight.  
  
**Jun：**  
But we can do our best to regain their lost trust, however gradually.As long as we act in good faith,  
there will always be those who appreciate it.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
That's right! I know I for one think that Jun...  
that everyone at Nightmare is awesome!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Oh... And you remember back there  
you saved a little beastgirl and her mother?  
Well, both of them were thankful like you wouldn't believe!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Next time anyone says bad stuff about the palace,  
you can bet they'll be setting 'em straight!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
The little girl is basically your biggest fan now, Jun!  
She's always asking me about you!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
And when she does, I'm happy to share my stories!  
Tales of the heroes I know and love! ☆  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha. I appreciate it.  
I do hope that's a sign of things to come, for all of us.  
It will take time, and it won't be easy, but that's no reason to lose hope.  
  
**Jun：**  
Someday, I believe, there will come a day  
when everyone can live in peace and harmony.  
No, we will work to ensure that such a day comes.  
  
**Jun：**  
Just as Chris so wisely said just now,  
let's look to a bright and shining future.  
With smiles on our faces.
