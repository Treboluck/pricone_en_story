**Christina：**  
My thirst for combat is far from sated!  
Are there no more foes to fight?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
It's always the heroes of justice that win in the end!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha... You're quite right, Matsuri.  
...Hmm? Look—what's that path up ahead?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
There might still be enemies down there!  
We'd better go scout it out, to make sure the city's safe!  
  
**Jun：**  
Wait, Matsuri—it's dangerous to go alone!
