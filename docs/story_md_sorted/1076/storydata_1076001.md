## Subtitle: Do You Think It Suits Me?
  
**Narration：**  
In a local lottery, the members of the Gourmet Guild  
have won tickets to a Tantalizing Tropical Tour.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, my lord!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Good evening.  
It is I, your ever-loyal attendant, Kokkoro.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Sorry to disturb you at this hour.  
Have you already retired to bed, perhaps?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If by any chance you are awake,  
I would appreciate a moment of your time...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sure thing.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank you.  
Well then, I will let myself in.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
L-let me explain, my lord.  
You may be wondering why I happen to be wearing  
an outfit of this nature...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The other day, you recall we entered a local lottery together  
and won the grand prize, so this weekend our entire guild  
is planning to participate in a Tantalizing Tropical Tour?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well, I hear this tour includes a number of beach activities.  
In which case, a swimsuit is a necessity, or so I was told  
by the Sarendia Orphanage members...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So today, I went with Miss Saren and the others to purchase one  
for myself.  
 Sadly enough, you were busy with other matters,  
so I could not ask you to accompany me...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I have been rather anxious  
about whether you would find it to your liking...  
So I, ahh, decided to come and show it to you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Umm...  
D-do you think it suits me, my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I do not have a good eye for fashion, so I am not sure  
how to judge...  
 Miss Saren and the others assured me repeatedly  
that this one was very cute, so I decided to purchase it...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But if it is not to your tastes, my lord, I cannot feel satisfied...  
Every element of my being, after all,  
exists for the sake of your happiness alone.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You look incredibly cute.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
A-are you entirely certain?  
Ahh... Thank goodness...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheheh. That is quite the relief, my lord.  
I really was very anxious to see your reaction.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah... Come to think of it,  
 we also purchased a swimsuit  
for you yourself to wear, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I took the liberty of picking it out myself,  
and I hope you will not mind that I chose one  
that closely matches my own...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If it is not to your liking, I will of course purchase a replacement.  
Our vacation itself is thankfully all-expenses paid,  
so we have a fair margin to spend on extra luxuries.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We should purchase new bags to carry our things,  
and anything else we think we might need.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh.  
I am so excited to be going on this outing, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  ...Is something wrong?  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, well...  
To tell the truth, there is one little thing concerning me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As I was raised deep in the mountains, I have no experience  
with beach activities.  
 Walking along the nearby Marjan Coast  
in recent days is the closest I have come to the sea.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So I am worried about whether I will be able to swim.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If I fail, and find myself drowning in the waves...  
It would spoil our wonderful vacation,  
for not only me, but our guildmates, too.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What's this? My lord, you look worried as well.  
But of course—you have lost all of your memories.  
Do you not recall how to swim, either?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You are a wonderful individual who is capable of anything,  
so I am sure you can swim perfectly well...  
But if you have forgotten how to do so, that is no fault of yours.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. I borrowed a book from Saren's collection  
to teach myself how to swim properly...  
It is surely better than nothing, so would you like to read it too?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I have been taking it everywhere to read when I have a spare moment.  
You see? It has some very helpful diagrams.  
It even lists a number of methods to practice effectively.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Let me demonstrate on your bed, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Kicking one's legs one after another like this creates forward thrust,  
while the hands scoop water aside to make smooth progress.  
This technique is known as the \"crawl,\" my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh?! M-my lord?  
I was not expecting you to suddenly leap onto the bed...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...You wish to practice your swimming technique as well?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. You are a very studious fellow.  
As your loyal attendant, I am filled with pride.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well then, let us prepare for our outing  
with a thorough practice session together, my lord!
