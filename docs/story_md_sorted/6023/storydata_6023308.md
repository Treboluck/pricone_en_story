The other day, when I visited Lucent Academy for our guild activities,  
I overheard male students muttering about one \"Crazy of St. T's.\"  
Were they referring to young Chieru or young Chloe, I wonder?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Probably Chieru.  
**Choice: (2)**  Probably Chloe.  
**Choice: (3)**  Probably you.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuni：**  
Young Chieru. Of course.  
 Hrm... I may not be one to judge,  
but objectively speaking, all those  
 \"Cheru~n! ♪\"  
 exclamations  
seem frankly unhinged at her age. So it's little wonder.

**Yuni：**  
Young Chloe. Of course.  
 Such a cruel assessment...  
She's positively adorable deep down,  
 so what does it matter if  
her face, voice, and most other aspects of her existence are terrifying?

**Yuni：**  
Oh my. I do hear that the word \"crazy\" has many uses in youth parlance.  
If we take it to mean \"Yo, that chick with the braids is crazy baller,\"  
I can see their point.  
 Yes, I accept my role as the Crazy of St. T's.
