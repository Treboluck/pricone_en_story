## Subtitle: The Charms of Chieru
  
**Chieru：**  
Quick! Listen up! As you know, Chierun the Adorkable's got about  
seven hundred million charms to wow and amaze the unwary,  
but tell me, which one sets your heart on fire the hottest?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Your looks.  
**Choice: (2)**  Your personality.  
**Choice: (3)**  My heart's in more of a non-burning state.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chieru：**  
Huh?  
 Did you even hear the question? Like, obviously my looks are fire!  
That's like if I asked \"What do you want to eat for lunch?\"  
and all you could come up with was \"Food.\"  
 Are you right in the head?

**Chieru：**  
Huh? Like,  
 um, for real? That's actually... kind of flattering.  
When I was little, everyone I ever met thought my personality was cute,  
but lately that's fallen off in a big way.  
 It's nice to hear it again! Eheheh.
