Hey, dude.  
Listen, I'm seriously starving right now.  
Don't s'pose you've got any food to share?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  A Kokkoro-brand packed lunch.  
**Choice: (2)**  A berry-ful cake.  
**Choice: (3)**  My pockets are as empty as my future.

**Chloe：**  
Oh wow, for real?! Don't mind if I—  
 Oh. Wait. Yeah, strike that.  
Like, I can tell these things, 'cause I make lunch for my bros.  
Whoever made this? They packed it *full* of love.  
 Too much for me.

**Chloe：**  
Ugh, you're useless!  
Oh well, time to starve. Cause of death: zero food.  
Stomach shriveling to the size of a pea. A curse on you and all your kin.
