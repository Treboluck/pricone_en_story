## Subtitle: Who's Taking Center Stage?
  
**Chieru：**  
You know me, I'm a total sucker for cute idol girls, right?  
And lately, I've been having daydreams about managing a group myself!  
Hey, if our guild was gonna debut as idols, who'd you put in the center?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You, of course!  
**Choice: (2)**  Chloe!  
**Choice: (3)**  Yuni!

Well... yes. Ask nine out of ten people, and that's the answer you'd get.  
Yeesh... I was hoping *you'd* be a bit more of a mold-breaker...  
Well, feel free to join my fan club.  
 Just don't fall in love or anything.

Building around the rebel, huh?  
 Well, it *could* give us a strong identity!  
And she's so physically fit, she could handle any performance.  
Not sure if she'd *want* to...  
 but a fat wad of cash could solve that.

Oh yeah! Putting the little one in the middle! I can see it.  
Me and Chloe are both about the same height, so it's nicely balanced.  
Problem is, can Yuni take the strain? Wait, hold up. Can she even dance?
