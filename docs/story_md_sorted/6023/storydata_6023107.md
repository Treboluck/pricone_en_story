Yuni talked me into showing her 'round Landosol.  
Well, she grew up in the mountains, so I guess the city's new to her.  
How 'bout you? You a born-and-bred Landosol guy?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I've got no home.  
**Choice: (2)**  I've got no memories.  
**Choice: (3)**  I've got no hope for the future.
