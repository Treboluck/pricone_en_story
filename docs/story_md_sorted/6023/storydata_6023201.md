Hey, actually, everyone goes on about Aoi being a new transfer,  
but you transferred in from Lucy AC too, right, {player}?  
How is it? Is life at St. T's totally different from your old Lucent life?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Lucent Academy's fun 'cause everyone's together.  
**Choice: (2)**  The lessons at St. Theresa's are so hard.  
**Choice: (3)**  There are differences, but they're both lots of fun.

 Um, so, what's the truth?

Wooow, teacher's pet much?
