## Subtitle: All About Chloe
  
**Yuni：**  
Young Chloe? She headed off earlier to a part-time job.  
These workaholic tendencies of hers do concern me at times.  
By the by, do you have any particular opinions on her character?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She's strong.  
**Choice: (2)**  She's kind.  
**Choice: (3)**  She's pretty intimidating.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuni：**  
Yes, honed in both body and mind.  
 Why is that?  
She rarely divulges a great amount about her private life,  
but she must have had her reasons for becoming this way.

`Tag 2`  
**Yuni：**  
She does have those qualities  
 often attributed to elder sisters.  
In fact, I hear she has no less than three younger brothers.  
Perhaps she thinks of you as a fourth among their number.

`Tag 3`  
**Yuni：**  
Indeed. Much like a carnivore after a meal.  
She deftly parries my daily ramblings with a minimum of effort,  
but if I were ever to truly anger her...  
 Ahhh, best not to imagine!
