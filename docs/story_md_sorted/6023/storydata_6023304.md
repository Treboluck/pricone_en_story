## Subtitle: All About Chieru
  
**Yuni：**  
Wh-what's this now? You're acting unusually eccentric today.  
I'll venture a guess that young Chieru's behind this.  
 I'm sure she only  
toys with others out of affection, but how do you feel about her?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She's cute.  
**Choice: (2)**  She's freaky.  
**Choice: (3)**  She's smart.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuni：**  
Agreed. She maximizes the appeal of her inherent attributes.  
Adopting society's image of a teenage girl and enjoying it to the fullest.  
That free and vibrant way of life is surely \"cute\" in its highest form.

Now, don't be hard on her. The baffling ways she speaks and acts are  
her way of entertaining those around her. In truth, at her core...  
 What?  
Oh, you didn't mean to doubt her stability?  
 I'm sorry, I just assumed.

**Yuni：**  
True enough. And in a wholly different way to my own accumulated  
knowledge. Her intellect is a more fundamental attribute.  
 It's a mark of  
true genius.  
 Though that can be tricky to believe, given her... behavior.
