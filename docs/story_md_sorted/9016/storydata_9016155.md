**Karyl：**  
Uergh, this doesn't look good.  
You've gone and woken that thing up with your noisy voice!  
It would've been so easy to take it out while it was hibernating, too!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Animals are hungry and irritable when woken from hibernation,  
making them far more dangerous than usual.  
My lord, there is no telling what this beast may do, so stay alert.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Actually, it still looks pretty woozy to me!  
Let's take it out before it fully wakes up!  
Hiiiyaaahhhhh!
