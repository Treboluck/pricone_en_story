We did it!  
Now *that's* the power of friendship!  
  
**Illya：**  
Indeed. Spectacular work, you two!  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh? There's a li'l path beyond here.  
Looks mighty scary, too. Maybe it's the entrance to Wonderland?  
Let's go have a look!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ahaha. Good old Maho.  
Seems interesting, though, so I'll tag along!  
  
**Illya：**  
You two!  
Where are you off to? Don't leave me behind!  
Come, my bloodkin! We must follow them!
