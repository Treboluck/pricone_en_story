## Subtitle: In Search of a Monster Horn
  
**Narration：**  
Now in search of a monster horn,  
the crew have made their way to the cave Illya spoke of.  
  
**Maho：**  
Gosh... Now the ground's all bumpy instead of squishy.  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's pitch black, too, so watch your step.  
  
**Illya：**  
'Tis paradise when compared to the jungle from hell, however.  
The chilly breeze is most comforting.  
  
**Kaori：**  
How deep is this cave, anyway?  
  
**Illya：**  
Quite deep indeed.  
I remember the way well, though, so follow in my stead!  
  
**Maho：**  
You're as reliable as they come, ain't ya?  
  
**Illya：**  
Heh. Leave it to me, my furry friends.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Honestly. You've been a massive help!  
We gotta thank you big-time once we're done.  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh! I just had a great li'l idea!  
How about you come on over to our guildhouse once this is all  
over?  
We'll treat you to a big feast!  
  
**Illya：**  
You're... inviting me over?  
  
**Kaori：**  
What's up? Didn't think you'd be that surprised.  
  
**Illya：**  
I'm just... taken aback, is all. One wouldn't normally expect  
to be willingly invited into what is essentially someone's home  
after a long life of spreading terror through the nation.  
  
**Maho：**  
Li'l bit of an exaggeration for a kid, haha.  
That said, though—you and us? We're already good friends!  
Ain't no need for reservation between us!  
  
**Illya：**  
Oh...  
So this is what it feels like.  
A relationship where power dynamics need not apply.  
Where friends are simply just... friends.  
  
**Illya：**  
Hehe.  
That sounds rather nice...  
  
**???：**  
GRRRRRAAAAGGHHH!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Huh? What was that?  
  
**Maho：**  
Hey, Illya.  
Are there any monsters that use this cave as a nest of sorts?  
  
**Illya：**  
Not that I'm aware of, at the very least.  
If we do encounter any, though,  
it's likely to be one waiting for death's embrace.  
  
**???：**  
GRRRRRAAAAGGHHH!  
  
**Maho：**  
There it is again.  
Sounds mighty lively to me, too...  
  
**Illya：**  
Maho, wait!  
Watch where you're going!  
  
**Maho：**  
Whoaaa?!  
Where'd this hole come from?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Watch out!  
**Choice: (2)**  Illya! Grab her!  
`Tag 1`  
**Maho：**  
Phew...  
Th-thank you, my prince.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
Hey! D-don't shove me like that!  
I've got you! You're not hurt, are you?  
  
**Maho：**  
Th-that was a close one...  
Th-thank you, Illya...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Illya：**  
Careful where you step.  
The terrain here is anything but safe.  
One small trip can send you into a terrifyingly large hole.  
  
**Maho：**  
U-understood!  
  
**Illya：**  
Oh? This area seems rather spacious.  
Which means...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ahhhhhh! There's a bunch of corpses!  
Now to find one with a horn...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hm?  
Is it just me, or is there something moving among them?  
  
**Illya：**  
Odd... Is it a live one, perhaps?  
  
**Illya：**  
Wait...! Now it all makes sense!  
A grave though this may be, it's also a feeding ground  
for the living! That monster is here to consume the corpses!  
  
**Illya：**  
The circle of life in its quintessential form.  
Nature truly can be cruel...  
  
**Maho：**  
This ain't no time for deep thoughts, Illya!  
That monster has its eyes right on us!  
  
**Garoog：**  
GRRRRRAAAAGGHHH!  
  
**Kaori：**  
S-sure looks like it'll be a handful!  
  
**Illya：**  
The magical energy pouring forth  
from it is as fierce as its looks, too!  
  
**Maho：**  
C-can we even handle somethin' like this?  
  
**Kaori：**  
We shouldn't bite off more than we can chew!  
  
**Illya：**  
Fear not. I have a plan in mind!  
  
**Illya：**  
There's a rather deep crevice nearby.  
I'll lure it over there, first and foremost!  
  
**Kaori：**  
That's way too dangerous!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'll go with her.  
`Tag 4`  
**Illya：**  
{player}... Very well. Having you with me  
is most reassuring! Maho, Kaori. The two of us will be fine,  
so focus your efforts on knocking it into the crevice!  
  
**Illya：**  
The two of you can do it.  
I know you can!  
  
**Kaori：**  
...Got it. And we trust in the both of you, too!  
Keep her safe, {player}!  
  
**Maho：**  
Illya! My prince!  
We're countin' on you!  
  
**Illya：**  
Heh. And thus the stage was set.  
Hark, oh vile monster! Here we stand, ready to do battle!  
Come at us, if you dare!  
  
**Garoog：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Illya：**  
This won't suffice...  
  
**Illya：**  
As far in as possible... Just a little more...  
  
**Garoog：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Illya：**  
Spectacular work, {player}!  
Keep blocking its attacks!  
Maho, Kaori! Now!  
  
**Maho：**  
I'll stop it in its tracks!  
Maho-Maho Darkness!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Nice!  
My turn now!  
Haaah! Ryukyu-Ken Knuckle Cannon!  
  
**Garoog：**  
GREEOOOUGHHHH!  
  
**Illya：**  
Ohhh!  
Straight into the crevice it goes! Splendid!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Thanks, Illya!  
**Choice: (6)**  Thanks, you two!  
`Tag 5`  
**Illya：**  
'Twas not my victory alone, though.  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Maho：**  
I didn't do much at all.  
If anything, it was all Illya and Kaori.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Nah. All I did was punch it in the back.  
This one's all Illya.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Illya：**  
Not quite.  
This victory was brought about by the four of us. Together!  
  
**Illya：**  
And with that monster out of the way,  
now's our chance to obtain the horn we seek.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Let's see here...  
Hey! This one seems pretty great!  
  
**Maho：**  
From a Wild Horn, no less...  
Thank you. Your horn will help keep Landosol safe.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Woo! We finally got both super items!  
Now all we gotta do is slay the vampire!  
  
**Illya：**  
Pardon?  
What was that about slaying a *vampire*?  
  
**Maho：**  
Huh? What's wrong, Illya?
