**Pecorine：**  
I haven't gathered food in the woods in a while!  
 Isn't this tons of fun?!  
Still, a monster trying to keep all the forest's bounty to itself, huh?  
The food scraps seem to be leading over in this direction...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah—  
I see what appears to be a rather large tanuki.  
That burly physique and silky coat that belies its wild environment...  
It must surely be the monster we seek.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It looks kind of sleepy...  
As though it couldn't care less about any of us.  
I bet all it cares about is its next meal. Like a certain someone I know.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyyyyl!  
Tell me you're not talking about me!
