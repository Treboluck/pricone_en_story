**Narration：**  
A few days have passed since Ayane helped out the Shadow that  
resembles her. Said Shadow has since disappeared,  
leaving her more than confused about it all.  
  
**Narration：**  
Though questions remain,  
Ayane is soon busy with preparations for the party,  
causing her to forget the encounter entirely.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hmhmhmhmmm~! ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
{player}! Over here!  
I found a cool toy store where we can get  
presents for Kurumi and Kokkoro!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yeah. You know how we're exchanging presents during  
the party, right?  
I kinda forgot to buy my share,  
so I figured we can do it now. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
We've gotten everything Mama Saren asked for,  
so it should be okay if we stop by, right?  
  
**Ayane：**  
I bet you haven't bought anything yet either,  
so let's choose together. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Heheh! Look at all these toys!  
I'm too old to play with them now,  
but I'm pretty sure Kurumi and everyone else would love them. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hey, which should we go for?  
You can leave Kurumi to me,  
but you've known Kokkoro longer.  
  
**Ayane：**  
And you get along so well.  
If anyone knows what'll make her happy, it's you.  
  
**Ayane：**  
So fill me in, please!  
It's up to me to choose in the end,  
but there's nothing wrong with getting some input.  
  
**Ayane：**  
What sort of toys does she like?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Stuffed animals, I guess?  
**Choice: (2)**  A toy might not be the best option.  
`Tag 1`  
**Ayane：**  
Oh! Yeah, that matches up!  
I knew I could count on you for a great idea!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ehehe. She seems like a real hugger, at least.  
She was super tired after finishing dinner the other day,  
and then she started hugging Pukichi!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"You're telling me.  
I never had her pegged as that kinda person,  
so it took me by surprise.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ehehe. She's super reliable, but she's still just a kid.  
I bet she wants to spoiled now and then.  
I'd rather not let people be all touchy-feely with Pukichi, but well...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Kokkoro's family to me now, so I'm okay with it.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Ayane：**  
Huh, really?  
She's still a kid, so I thought she'd like toys.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hm...  
You think she'd prefer a book?  
That, a pet, or a plant?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ahhh. She does read a lot, doesn't she?  
I always see her watering the plants, too.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ehehe.  
You really know what your family likes, don't you?  
Should we head to another store, then?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Royal Knight A：**  
Hurry!  
It went that way!  
Split up and surround it!  
  
**Royal Knight B：**  
We finally have you cornered, you dastardly Shadow!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Whoa!  
W-what's going on?  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Hm...  
Couldn't tell you, but it sure seems like a big deal.\"  
  
**Royal Knight A：**  
Hmm?  
Hey, you over there! Stay put!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Eeek?! M-me? Why are you pointing your sword at me?  
I didn't do anything wrong...  
  
**Royal Knight A：**  
...Forgive me. That was my mistake.  
Please accept my apologies for scaring you.  
  
**Royal Knight B：**  
What're you dillydallying for?  
The other squad has engaged the Shadow in battle.  
We need to give them backup!  
  
**Royal Knight A：**  
U-understood!  
Let's make our way there ASAP!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Errr... What was that all about?  
They were from Nightmare, weren't they?  
Almost gave me a heart attack!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Weird.  
They mentioned something about a Shadow, didn't they?\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh no!  
Don't tell me...!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Huh? What's wrong?  
Hey, slow down! You'll fall over!\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
This is bad!  
They mistook me for the Shadow, so if I'm right...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Then it's the Shadow we met before!  
They might be chasing that one!  
  
**Ayane：**  
\"Shadows are kind of like monsters, right?  
If Nightmare comes across one,  
they'll probably deal with it right then and there.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
I can't just ignore this!  
That Shadow's just like me,  
in more ways than one!  
She *is* me!  
  
**Narration：**  
Ayane and co. waste no time  
in pursuing the members of Nightmare.  
  
**Narration：**  
However, the battle is already over  
by the time they arrive at the scene.  
  
**Narration：**  
According to the members of Nightmare there,  
the Shadow is already no more.  
  
**Ayane：**  
...  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Ch-cheer up, Ayane.  
Sure, they got rid of a Shadow,  
but that doesn't mean it's the one you're thinking of.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
No. I'm pretty sure it is.  
You heard what they said, right?  
It looked just like me.  
  
**Ayane：**  
So she's gone, huh?  
Shadows are kind of like monsters,  
so it's not that surprising.  
  
**Ayane：**  
But... You remember when we first saw her, right?  
She was walking hand in hand with my mom and dad.  
  
**Ayane：**  
She was a proper daughter to them.  
Unlike me, who ran away from home.  
  
**Ayane：**  
She became real family to them. She became me.  
She went out looking for a present for them,  
all because she wanted to make them happy.  
  
**Ayane：**  
If anything, she was the real Ayane.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I started having weird thoughts about Mom and Dad being fakes.  
The more I thought about it, the more scared I got.  
Not only did I tell it to their faces, I ran away afterward.  
  
**Ayane：**  
But she was different. She did what I couldn't.  
She loved them. Cared for them. Made them happy.  
Yet she's the one that's gone now.  
  
**Ayane：**  
That's just... not fair.  
It's horrible. I'm the one those knights should've gotten rid of.  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Take that back, Ayane.  
You have no idea how sad I'd be if you were gone.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Not just me, either. {player} and  
all your family at the orphanage as well.  
So do me a favor and never, ever say that again.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Okay...  
Thanks, Pukichi.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I still can't accept this, though.  
I just don't get it. What was she?  
What are Shadows, even?  
  
**Ayane：**  
I know something scary's going on in the world.  
But I'm just a kid. A dumb kid that doesn't understand any of it.  
And I kind of hate it.  
  
**Ayane?：**  
\"...\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Huh? W-wait a minute.  
You're *that* Shadow, aren't you?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh,  
thank goodness!  
I was so sure that Nightmare had gotten rid of you...  
  
**Ayane?：**  
\"...ase.\" \"Mom, Dad...\" \"...ay?\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
What was that?  
Hey, wait! Why're you flickering like that?  
You look like you're about to fade away...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Wh-what happened?  
Did Nightmare bully you?  
Are you dying? Fading away?  
  
**Ayane?：**  
\"...is.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Wah?!  
She just threw something at me!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hey, isn't this...  
Isn't this the present I paid for the other day?  
The one you wanted to buy for Mom and Dad?  
  
**Ayane?：**  
\"Please...\" \"I...\" \"I love Mom and Dad  
so much...\"  
  

---  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ah! Ahhh!  
She disappeared! Why?!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Where'd you go?  
Don't hide! Answer me!  
  
**Ayane：**  
You can't just hand me this and disappear...!  
Am I supposed to give it to Mom and Dad?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Me? In your stead?  
That's no good. I can't.  
They'd never be happy about it.  
I'm just a bad kid that ran away from home.  
  
**Ayane：**  
It doesn't matter if you're a Shadow! You should have  
given it to them yourself!  
You were much more of a daughter  
to them than I ever was! You were the real Ayane!
