## Subtitle: Love Grows
  
**Narration：**  
Having received a present for her parents from her Shadow,  
Ayane quickly makes her way back to her real home.  
  
**Narration：**  
Her parents give her a warm welcome in spite of everything,  
and are even overjoyed with the present. What's more,  
they ask if she'd like to celebrate the holidays together with them.  
  
**Narration：**  
Unable to face the guilt if she declined, Ayane has her first  
meal together with her parents in a long time. Needless to say,  
it ends up being a blissful time for the three of them.  
  
**Narration：**  
Though they do their best to make her stay following the meal,  
Ayane has no choice but to return to the orphanage to  
deliver what Saren had asked her to buy earlier in the day.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'm back...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wah! Welcome back, Ayane.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wh-what's wrong?  
Why's {player} carrying you?  
Did you get hurt?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Don't worry. I'm fine.  
I'm just a bit tired, is all.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
O-oh.  
You were having dinner with your parents, right?  
That's what I heard earlier.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I tried not to pry too much before, but well...  
Do you not get along with your parents?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hmmm...  
They love me loads, at least.  
The issue's with me. I just can't really accept that love anymore.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Wait. Kurumi's parents are Lost,  
so I shouldn't talk about this too much around her.  
I don't want to upset her.  
  
**Ayane：**  
She doesn't even have a choice between seeing them or not.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ehehe.  
Don't worry. I'm totally fine.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hm...  
Well, I'm here to listen if you've got any worries.  
That's what family's for.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yeah.  
Thanks, Kurumi.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ehehe. Now I really do feel a lot better.  
You can put me down, {player}.  
Sorry for always making you spoil me.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Down we go.  
...  
Huh? What just fell? It made a really loud noise!  
  
**Ayane：**  
It definitely wasn't Pukichi, at least.  
I've always got a firm grip on him.  
So what was it, then?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hey, Ayane. There's something sparkly at your feet.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Something sparkly? Oh! You're right!  
Kind of looks like a jewel.  
Do you know what it is, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's a Memory Shard.  
`Tag 1`  
**Ayane：**  
A Memory... what?  
Never heard of them before. What are they?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh, okay. So they're fragments of memories that Shadows  
drop sometimes, huh? Wow. I didn't know they were even a thing.  
You  
sure know a lot of weird stuff despite that amnesia, don't you?  
  
**Ayane：**  
But if Shadows drop them, then...  
Does that mean this one came from my Shadow?  
And it somehow made its way into my clothes, I guess?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Whoa!  
Why's everything so bright all of a sudden?!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ahhh! It's that \"Memory Shard\" or whatever!  
It's glowing super bright!

\"  
Geez, {player}. Get it together.  
You're this tired already?\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Ayane's far from satisfied,  
so keep it up for a bit longer.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"We're good when it comes to shoes and hats, at least.  
Up next is regular clothes.  
Off to the next store we go!\"

\"Right, got it.  
Hey. Ayane wants to know what sort of clothes you like!\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"She's a young lady, so of course she wants to tailor  
her fashion to the person she likes! Precious, ain't she?\"

...!  
...?!

\"Ouch! Quit stretching me!  
Sorry, sorry! I didn't mean to let it slip!\"  
  
**Ayane：**

**Pukichi：**  
\"Ahaha. Look at her using me to hide her face.  
Quit it, though. You're gonna get my outfit all creased.\"  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You're dressed all cute today, Pukichi.  
**Choice: (3)**  If this is a date, then I sure am enjoying it.

**Pukichi：**  
\"Huh? You ought to be complimenting Ayane instead!  
Sheesh. What does she even see in a blockhead like you?\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Hmm? Ayane's looking real cute, too? Come on! You should  
be saying that the second you lay eyes on her!  
Praise her every  
time you blink! That's the key to a good relationship with her!\"

\"E-excuse me? A date?!  
No way! Absolutely not!\"  
  
**Pukichi：**

to a poor guy with no friends! It ain't no date!\"

\"  
Did you just laugh, Ayane?  
Well, good. Happy to see that you're in good spirits.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"  
Thanks, {player}. That's all because of you.  
She'd been feeling down ever since this morning,  
so I was pretty worried about her.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"  
You know how her parents are always super busy, right?  
They tried their best to spend the holidays with her this year.  
Even planned a party and everything.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"  
But then some urgent business came up.  
So they ended up having to cancel at the last minute,  
and now they're abroad to sort it all out.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Ayane's been down ever since, pretty much.  
Sitting around in that big mansion on her own was just depressing,  
so she decided to head out and do some shopping.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"If that tugs at your heartstrings,  
then stick around, will ya?\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
...!  
...?  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Whoa there, buddy! Who said you could touch her?  
Is patting her head your way of praising her or something?\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"  
But don't treat her like a kid. Treat her like a lady!  
Then again, she looks pretty young for her age,  
so I guess it's normal to think she's a kid.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
...♪  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"  
Oh well.  
She looks happy, so I'll let it slide.\"

Hm? Hey, Ayane.  
Your pocket's vibrating. Must be your phone!\"

What's up?  
It was your parents?  
They finished their work super quick and are coming back already,  
so they'll make it in time for the party?\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
...☆  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Haha.  
Look at her clutching onto you out of sheer happiness.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"  
Well that's a huge relief, at least.  
Last thing I wanted was her spending the holidays all alone,  
that's for sure.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"  
Hm? What's up, {player}?  
Now you're the one looking all down.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"  
What? You don't have any plans for the holidays?!  
Man. Do you really not have any friends?  
Sucks for you, huh?\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"  
Tell you what. You hung out with Ayane today,  
so I'll reward you in kind. You can come to the party as well.  
Just make sure you dress for the occasion, okay?\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"You've met my family before, right?  
But Ayane's is a whole different deal.  
This is as good an opportunity as any to introduce yourself, so might as well take it.

\"Who knows.  
You two might just end up being family one day. ♪\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
...!  
...?!

\"Ouch!  
Sorry, sorry! I got ahead of myself!  
I won't say anything else weird, I promise!\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"A-all right!  
Let's get back to business. By which I mean shopping!  
If Ayane's parents are gonna make it for the holidays,  
then we gotta get them some presents!\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"  
Help us pick them out, {player}.  
We want the best for our family. For the people we love.\"

**Ameth：**  
And there we have it. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Think of what you just saw as something of a dream.  
Chances are you'll forget about it the second you wake up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That sure caught me off guard, though.  
I normally pick and choose which memories you see,  
but things kind of went off the rails this time.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Touching that Memory Shard is what triggered it,  
from what I can tell.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The more you know, I guess. I need to be careful next time.  
On the bright side,  
it was just a regular old fun memory that you saw.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's still too early to be showing you the real important stuff,  
so I was kind of sweating buckets back there.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Though that might not be too much of a concern in  
Ayane's case.  
You've always been something of  
a reliable older brother figure to her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Your memories together with her aren't going to be related  
to the truth behind this world or any serious traumatic events.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But still, better to be safe than sorry. Especially in regards to you.  
Restoring your memories needs to be a slow, careful process.  
Not that you even get what I'm talking about right now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh well. You and Ayane are family now,  
albeit not in the way Pukichi tried to imply.  
Treasure her like family. Love her. Take care of her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And hey, it's the festive season.  
It'd be a waste to spend it being all gloomy, wouldn't it?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, that's all from me.  
Bye-bye! And while I'm at it...  
Happy holidays! ♪

**Ayane：**  
Mmm...  
H-huh? When did I fall asleep?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh, there's a letter by my pillow. This is Kurumi's handwriting.  
I fell asleep out of the blue,  
so she carried me to my bed?  
  
**Ayane：**  
I was pretty light, but carrying {player} was a real struggle?  
Whoa! He's sleeping right beside me!  
  
**Ayane：**  
I guess she didn't have it in her to take him all the way to  
his own room. I can't blame her, though.  
She did the best she could.  
  
**Ayane：**  
H-hey, {player}. Wake up.  
Kurumi won't have anywhere to sleep if you're here.  
Go sleep in your own room, okay?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Waugh?! Wh-what's the deal?  
Why're you hugging me?  
  
**Ayane：**  
I-I'm not a stuffed animal, you know...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Urgh, now I'm in a pickle. I'm not strong enough to get him  
off me.  
But I kind of don't want to.  
I feel all warm and happy right now. And sleepy.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh well.  
I'll just go back to sleep like this.  
It's been rough for me lately, so I wanna be spoiled.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Don't let go of me, okay?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Comfort me. Help me...  
The world's just out to hurt and confuse me, so please.  
At least be there for me in my dreams.  
  
**Ayane：**  
No. That's not what I want to say.  
Please. Please love me.
