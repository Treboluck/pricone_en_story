# The Landosol Tour Guide
Having given up on the search for the day, the crew returns to Landosol to rest. As the magic tracer they require won't be available for a few days, the Gourmet Guild members decide to give Anne and co. a tour of Landosol.

**Narration：**  
The crew continue their Gigas hunt.  
The further they progress up the mountain, however, the less  
effective Anne's tracing magic becomes.  
  
**Anne：**  
Hm... This isn't ideal.  
I've kind of got an idea, but it's not as clear as before...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Are you feeling tired, perhaps?  
  
**Anne：**  
I think it's the sheer number of them around here.  
I could pinpoint the next Gigas if there were fewer,  
but alas..  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The sun's setting, too.  
Should we go back to Landosol for now?  
We're in danger of getting lost if we wait until after it gets dark.  
  
**Lou：**  
Landosol?  
That's the city you all live in, I guess?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yup!  
It's a super big city, plus it has a castle!  
  
**Lou：**  
A castle?!  
Now that I want to see!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That settles it, then!  
Let's make our way back and get dinner!  
  
**Lou：**  
Woo!  
I'm gonna eat until I burst!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You'll love the restaurant I've got in mind. Trust me!  
  
**Anne：**  
Hey, Grea.  
When she says dinner, do you think she means, uh...  
*That*?  
  
**Grea：**  
Yup. I'm positive she means that.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
They'll take the ingredients we brought and cook them up nice and tasty!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And we found a bunch of rare ones today.  
I'm really looking forward to what sort of dish they become!  
  
**Woman：**  
Sorry for the wait!  
Here you go!  
  
**Karyl：**  
It really does look like normal food at a glance.  
Too bad about everything else...  
Haha... Hahahaha...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wow! Now this looks delish! ☆  
It's honestly amazing how you can take a  
big, disgusting monster like that and make a dish that looks and smells  
amazing!  
Cooking up and trying all sorts of stuff sure is worth it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Time to dig in! ☆*munch, munch*  
That's some good soup!  
And the tentacles still make their presence known in the salad!  
Incredible!  
  
**Grea：**  
...You know, it actually is delicious.  
  
**Anne：**  
Yup!  
I wouldn't mind eating this every day!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Your enjoyment of that atrocity is beyond my understanding...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I just want some normal grub... Is that so much to ask for? *munch, munch*  
A-argh! The fact that it tastes good annoys me even more!  
  
**Lou：**  
Wooow.  
Monsters really are tasty, huh?  
Maybe I should... give it a try after all... *drool*  
  
**Grea：**  
Sorry, Lou, but Mr. Gawker remains off the menu.  
  
**Lou：**  
I-I know!  
I was just joking! Really!  
  
**Grea：**  
Sheesh...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, that sure hit the spot!  
Every dish was delicious, from the main course to dessert!  
I'm super satisfied! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Our bellies are all nice and full now,  
so let's use that energy and head back to the mountain tomorrow!  
  
**Anne：**  
Sounds good.  
Thanks so much for all the help!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Anne, Grea, Lou!  
Heyas!  
Did you all get some good sleep?  
  
**Anne：**  
Yup! Helps that the beds were so nice and comfy!  
My magic's all replenished!  
  
**Anne：**  
That said, my tracing magic's still kind of funky.  
Hm...  
  
**Karin：**  
Um, excuse me.  
Do you all have a moment?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh! Good morning, Karin! ☆  
Is something the matter?  
  
**Karin：**  
There is, in fact.  
We've received reports of an unidentified monster on Mount Gastros.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It wouldn't happen to be a giant, would it?  
  
**Karin：**  
It would, actually...  
I take it you're aware of its existence.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We were actually searching the mountain as part of  
our guild activities just yesterday, you see. We came across  
said giant—which is actually called a Gigas—at that time.  
  
**Karin：**  
That explains things.  
Very well. The Guild Association will prepare a formal request,  
so can we leave the investigation and extermination in your hands?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Leave it to us!  
Oh, but wait. We're kind of facing a little issue.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey. The Guild Association wouldn't happen to have a magic tracer,  
would they? That'd help our search big time.  
  
**Karin：**  
Oh. We can get one for you if you'd like.  
  
**Karin：**  
That said, another guild is using it at the moment.  
It might take a few days before they're done with it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aww, really?  
Guess the search is off until then.  
  
**Karin：**  
I'll get in touch as soon as it's ready for use.  
Well, have a good day, everyone.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hm. A few days' wait is in order, then.  
What should we do in the meantime, my lord?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's go have some fun.  
**Choice: (2)**  Time to sleep.  
`Tag 1`  
**Lou：**  
Some fun?  
That sounds great!  
There's so much stuff I wanna ea—  
  
...  
Experience!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Karyl：**  
Let's not become the embodiment of sloth, shall we?  
If you've got the time, then why not show then around town?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Then it's decided!  
We'll show them around Landosol until the tracer's ready!  
  
**Grea：**  
...Are you okay with that?  
  
**Anne：**  
Hey, it's their idea. And I'm down with it!  
You're coming too, of course!  
  
**Karyl：**  
How about we hit up the business district first, then?  
I need you guys to understand that we've got regular,  
monster-free food.  
  
**Anne：**  
Wow!  
Cool! This is all so interesting!  
  
**Grea：**  
You should watch where you're walking, Anne.  
  
**Anne：**  
Aha! Sorry, sorry!  
Everything here is just so different, though!  
Look! We definitely don't have sweets like that!  
  
**Lou：**  
We sure don't! And I'm ready to launch them into my belly!  
Munch! Munch!  
I can't stop! I won't sto...  
*cough, cough*  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't just stuff it all down your throat like that!  
Here! Drink some water!  
  
**Lou：**  
*gulp, gulp* *cough, cough* Ph-phew...  
Thanks. I thought I was a goner there.  
But now I've got room for more!  
  
**Karyl：**  
What did I *just* tell you?!  
Slow it down, girl,  
or else you're gonna choke again!  
  
**Grea：**  
Sorry about that.  
Lou doesn't mean any harm,  
but I guess she's annoying Karyl...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't worry. Karyl might sound angry,  
but she's actually really kind and caring!  
In fact, she's just worried for Lou's safety right now!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Sh-shut it! Don't say that stuff about me!  
Especially when I can hear you!  
Not that it's ever hard to with that stupid loud voice of yours!  
  
**Grea：**  
Oh...  
Sorry for getting the wrong idea, Karyl.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You've got the wrong idea *now*, Grea!  
I'm not kind or caring!  
I never would've bothered with Lou if I hadn't happened to notice!  
  
**Lou：**  
Urgh...  
I'm dying...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Lou!  
You did it again, didn't you?!  
  
**Anne：**  
Ahaha.  
Guess it's fine to let her take care of Lou.  
Oh, Pecorine. What's that store over there?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's a general store.  
One with lots of female customers, too.  
  
**Anne：**  
Huh. Let's go check it out!  
I bet we can find something that suits you, Grea!  
Then again, everything suits you!  
  
**Grea：**  
Come on, Anne...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You look quite happy, Miss Grea.  
  
**Grea：**  
Huh?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That expression on your face when you look at Miss Anne.  
It's full of happiness.  
  
**Grea：**  
I-I made it that obvious?  
That's embarrassing...  
  
**Anne：**  
Phew! That sure was fun!  
Landosol's such an exciting place!  
  
**Grea：**  
It really is a whole different experience from Rivenbrandt,  
from the sights to the products.  
  
**Lou：**  
Landosol's so cool! I love it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hehe. I'm happy you feel that way.  
I'm glad we got to show you how nice Landosol is, too.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let's check out even more areas tomorrow!  
As long as you're here, then you might as well see it all!  
  
**Narration：**  
A few days later...  
  
**Anne：**  
All right! We've got our tracer, plus we're all rested up!  
It's time for some Gigas hunting!  
  
**Grea：**  
Yeah. But let's not forget about the magic crystals, either.  
We need to gather them so we can get back to Rivenbrandt.  
  
**Lou：**  
Wait... I'll need to finish my assignment if we go back, right?  
In that case, I... I'm gonna stay here!  
  
**Anne：**  
Hm... Yeah, Landosol's a great place.  
But you'll never be able to see all your friends again if you stay here.  
  
**Lou：**  
What?!  
Th-that sounds awful!  
Okay, I'll work hard! Let's get those magic crystals!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I take it we're all ready, then?  
If so, then let the search begin!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus the party made their way back to Mount Gastros,  
ready for another day of Gigas hunting and magic crystal gathering.
