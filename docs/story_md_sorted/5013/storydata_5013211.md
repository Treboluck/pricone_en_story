**Lou：**  
Oh, Pecorine! Did you find anything?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm over here, Lou.  
So who are you talking to—  
Huh?!  
  
**Lou：**  
What?! Why're there two of you?!  
Wh-what's going on?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The existence of entities that resemble us is puzzling.  
But why are they here, of all places?  
  
**Karyl：**  
The rift itself might be causing it.  
That, or the magic crystal?  
Doesn't matter either way, though.  
  
**Anne：**  
True enough.  
If we've got time to think,  
we've got time to fight!  
  
**Grea：**  
Here it comes, Anne!  
Be careful, everyone!
