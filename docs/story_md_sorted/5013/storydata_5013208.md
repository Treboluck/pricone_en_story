Urgh...  
This place looks and feels super scary...  
  
**Grea：**  
Don't worry, Lou.  
Just stick by me.  
There's an ominous presence lurking in here,  
so we need to do something about it quick.  
  
**Anne：**  
Yeah. This is our ticket to going back home.  
Not just that, but I want to protect the people of this world.  
It's all up to us!
