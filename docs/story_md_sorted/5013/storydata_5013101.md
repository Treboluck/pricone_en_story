**Anne：**  
A few days had passed since Mysteria Academy's traditional  
spring trip. As we were helping Lou with one of her assignments,  
though, we were caught up in a mysterious light.  
  
**Grea：**  
Where in the world is this?  
Our teleportation magic isn't working, either...  
  
**Lou：**  
Did a place like this even exist in Rivenbrandt?  
  
**Anne：**  
This... might not be Rivenbrandt at all.  
The flow of mana's completely different.  
  
**Grea：**  
W-wait...  
Does that mean we're in a whole new world?!

Waaahhh!  
Where's the academy? Here? There? Anywhere?!
