## Subtitle: Memories Are Forever
  
**Lou：**  
Urgh...  
I'm getting all sad...  
  
**Grea：**  
Hehe.  
Life was fun here, wasn't it?  
  
**Anne：**  
Don't worry!  
We might be parting ways,  
but the time we spent together won't disappear!  
  
**Anne：**  
It doesn't matter if we're apart!  
We're friends, no matter what!  
I truly believe that!
