# The Shining Rift and a World in Peril
The party make their way back to Mount Gastros after obtaining the magic tracer. Lou is attacked by a Gigas when she goes off on her own, but is saved by Karyl. By sheer coincidence, however, Lou finds the cave that can lead them to the mountain's peak.

**Narration：**  
{player} and co. plow through every  
Gigas they encounter as they scale the mountain.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm honestly amazed at how good that magic tracer is.  
We've barely run into any other monsters while using it.  
  
**Anne：**  
Yup!  
I fiddled with it a bit so it only picks up traces of the magic crystals!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You can even pull that off?  
*sigh*  
You really are something.  
  
**Grea：**  
We've collected quite a lot of fragments by now thanks to that.  
  
**Lou：**  
Does that mean we can go back home soon?  
  
**Anne：**  
Hm... Not quite yet, unfortunately.  
We're still missing the core component...  
  
**Lou：**  
Core...?  
What's that?  
  
**Anne：**  
Basically the central part of the magic crystal.  
It's a fundamental part that enables the crystal to function  
in the first place. The core serves as a reactor that—  
  
**Lou：**  
...?  
Did my brain break or something?  
I can't understand a word she's saying all of a sudden.  
  
**Karyl：**  
In layman's terms,  
we still haven't found the most important fragment yet.  
  
**Lou：**  
Ohhh.  
Now I get it.  
You're super smart, Karyl.  
Good girl,  
good girl.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Getting praised by you isn't exactly the greatest honor in the world...  
  
**Grea：**  
This sort of feels like a wild goose chase,  
though.  
It'd be nice if we had a more precise idea of—  
  
**Anne：**  
Huh?  
There's some kind of light emanating from the fragments  
we've collected so far. And it's pointing us to something!  
  
**Grea：**  
Oh?!  
Anne, look!  
  
The light's forming a rift at the peak of the mountain!  
  
**Anne：**  
It really is!  
Is that our destination, then?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thoughts, my lord?  
...  
My lord? Is something the matter?

**Ameth：**  
Sorry for pulling you in here out of nowhere.  
I know I shouldn't do this,  
but I've got urgent business this time. Please forgive me.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm aware of the situation at hand here.  
But said situation has created something of an issue within this world.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Things are going to get ugly real quick if you let that rift be.  
  
**Ameth：**  
As for why...  
A monster that shouldn't exist in this world is lurking inside it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Our world is slowly being distorted through its presence alone.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The longer it stays in there, the greater the distortion becomes.  
It could very well tear apart the fabric of our world.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's where you come in. I need you to cooperate with your new friends  
and defeat it.  
The world itself, plus the lives of everyone in it, hang in the  
balance here!  
So please make sure you tell Kokkoro and the others, too...  
  

---  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...ord! My lord!  
Oh...  
Thank goodness.  
You seemed to be in a trance-like state, so I was rather worried.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Are you feeling unwell, perhaps?  
Hm? You received an Oracle from Lady Ameth?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What did she inform you of, pray tell?  
Hm...  
A powerful monster is lurking within that rift?  
  
**Anne：**  
I can definitely sense something immense inside.  
There's a huge vortex of magic swirling around it.  
  
**Grea：**  
...That may just be where the core fragment is.  
Ideally we could go collect it, but...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, right!  
Please wait a minute.  
There's a certain cave we need to go through to reach the peak.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Really?  
I'm surprised you knew.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I just remembered.  
And I'm pretty sure that cave is somewhere around here, too—  
  
**Lou：**  
Oh ho?  
I guess it's time to search for it!  
And the Lou search squad is fit for the job!  
Let's get going!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hold up, Lou!  
Don't run off on your own!  
  
**Karyl：**  
*sigh*  
Actually, mind if I ask a question, Pecorine?  
You said you just remembered,  
so I assume you've been here before?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh?!  
Errr, maybe?  
It's kind of familiar, but it might have been another mountain!  
Ahahaha....  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh!  
Maybe I've got some kind of amnesia as well?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Nah.  
You just forgot, plain and simple.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Can you remember what you ate yesterday?  
**Choice: (2)**  Now that's our Pecorine.  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Of course! ♪  
I'll never, ever forget a delicious meal I've savored.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Anne：**  
You sure look super happy whenever you're eating, don't you?  
Just the sight of it brings a smile to my face.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Karyl：**  
Ahh, man.  
Can't we try and be a little less vague about important details?  
  
**Grea：**  
N-now, now...  
Either way, we should search for that cave.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed.  
...?  
You look perturbed, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You forgot to tell us the rest of Lady Ameth's oracle?  
What else did she have to say?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Huh? We must defeat the monster within the rift at all costs,  
lest the very fabric of our world be torn apart?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
WHAT?!  
You gotta kidding me!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Consider the circumstances, Miss Karyl.  
We have visitors from another world right in front of us.  
This may be no joking matter.  
  
**Karyl：**  
And I'm saying this whole situation is unreal—  
Ahh, whatever. Thinking about it's giving me a headache.  
  
**Anne：**  
If this world's in peril, then we better act fast!  
  
**Grea：**  
That, plus we need to find Lou.  
She ran off on her own.  
  
**Anne：**  
Ahaha...  
G-guess we should've stopped her, huh?  
  
**Lou：**  
Hm... The Lou search squad has hit a wall already.  
Where is this cave anyway?  
Hm... That's just a big old hole over there...  
  
**Lou：**  
Actually, where's everyone else?  
Don't tell me... they all got lost?  
*sigh* Why are they so hopeless when they're older than me?  
  
**Gigas：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Lou：**  
EEEEEEK?!  
I-it's a Gigas!  
  
![501300401.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/501300401.webp)  
**Karyl：**  
Lou! Get down!  
  
**Lou：**  
That I can do!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Let's do this!  
Haaahhh!  
  
**Gigas：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Lou：**  
Th-thanks so much!  
The Lou search squad is hereby disbanded!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Listen up, you! Don't go running around a mountain on your own!  
I swear...  
Well, I'm glad you're safe, at least.  
  
`image display end`  
**Lou：**  
So am I...  
All that, and I only found some weird hole...  
  
**Karyl：**  
A weird hole...?  
  
**Lou：**  
Yeah. Over there, between those boulders.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh. So there is. It's almost like a cave...  
Hey!  
It *is* a cave!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You did it! You hit the jackpot!  
Great stuff, Lou!  
  
**Lou：**  
Huh? Is that praise I hear?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Then again, you're from the same academy as Anne and Grea.  
Guess it only makes sense that you'd be able to pull off something like this.  
  
**Lou：**  
Of course!  
Anne and Grea are super duper,  
mega good students!  
  
**Karyl：**  
No doubt.  
Anne's got incredible magic power,  
while Grea's just got incredible power in general.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey.  
Does it not bother you having people like that around you?  
  
**Lou：**  
Huh?  
Never even crossed my mind.  
Why would it bother me?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, I mean...  
Your grades aren't that good, right?  
You keep going on about retakes and stuff.  
  
**Lou：**  
It's true... I'm the Empress of Retakes. The Queen of Failure.  
Soon to be the Goddess of Detention at this rate, too.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You struggle with your studies that much,  
but those two can do it so easily, you know?  
  
**Karyl：**  
That doesn't bother you?  
Make you feel like you're wasting your time?  
  
**Lou：**  
Hm?  
I really don't get what you're saying.  
  
**Lou：**  
I'm me. And I'm enjoying my youth as much as I can!  
Every single day is super, super fun!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...  
I see.  
You know, I... I'm kind of surprised.  
  
**Lou：**  
Surprised?  
How come?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I mean, you're...  
even dumber than I imagined.  
  
**Lou：**  
Was that a bait and switch?!  
You made me think you were gonna praise me!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahaha.  
...Nothing wrong with that, though. I'm even kind of jealous.  
  
**Anne：**  
Karyl! Answer me if you're here!  
  
**Lou：**  
Oh! That's Anne's voice!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, right.  
I ditched them after we agreed to split up and look for you.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Let's go meet up with them.  
Gotta tell them about your find, too.  
  
**Lou：**  
Okay!  
...  
Hey! I found the cave! It's over here!  
  
**Narration：**  
With the group reunited, they made their way into the cave.
