## Subtitle: A Whole New World
  
**Narration：**  
A few days have passed since Mysteria Academy's traditional spring  
trip to Mount Gigas. Now, though, Lou finds herself with an  
assignment she just can't finish, leaving her in quite a pickle.  
  
**Lou：**  
Urgh... This assignment's too hard! I don't get it all!  
What's all this \"fundamentals of magic\" stuff, anyway?  
Sounds like something for super geniuses...  
  
**Lou：**  
I don't get it... And now I'm all sleepy...  
...  
...Zzz.  
  
**Lou：**  
...*gasp*  
N-no sleeping allowed!  
This'll never end if I sleep!  
  
**Anne：**  
...Huh, is that Lou?  
Wonder what she's up to.  
Let's go have a look!  
  
**Grea：**  
A-Anne?! Hold up!  
  
**Lou：**  
*sigh* I'm sick of assignments.  
I wish we could go on another trip like the last one.  
That was super fun. Especially with kind Mr. Gigas around.  
  
**Anne：**  
Lou!  
What're you up to? ♪  
  
**Lou：**  
Wah?!  
Anne?!  
  
**Grea：**  
...You're going to scare people popping out like that, Anne.  
  
**Lou：**  
And Grea's here too!  
  
**Anne：**  
Ahaha...  
Sorry about that.  
It's just, you seemed like you had something on your mind.  
  
**Lou：**  
Urgh... Well, I'm actually in the worst pickle of my life.  
This assignment just. Won't. End!  
It's too hard!  
  
**Lou：**  
I need reliable seniors like you to lend a hand!  
Otherwise I'll be here forever!  
Help me out, please!  
  
**Anne：**  
Reliable seniors, huh?  
Hehe.  
That's one way to enlist to help!  
  
**Lou：**  
Really?!  
Woo! Awesome!  
This'll be easy as pie with your help!  
  
**Grea：**  
What does this assignment entail, anyway?  
  
**Lou：**  
Um...  
I need to, uh,  
use this rock as a catalyst?  
Or something along those lines!  
  
**Anne：**  
A catalyst? Ohhh. I think I've got it.  
You need to give shape to a spell by using this magical crystal  
as a catalyst, right?  
Pretty sure I've done that before!  
  
**Lou：**  
Yeah! That has to be it!  
  
**Anne：**  
Got it!  
Which part's giving you trouble, exactly?  
  
**Lou：**  
Well,  
my magic just fizzles out whenever I pour it into the stone.  
Nothing actually happens after that.  
  
**Anne：**  
Hm... You might not be pouring enough in.  
Lemme give it a shot for you!  
  
**Lou：**  
Thanks!  
It was due yesterday, so...  
It'd be great if we could get this done real quick!  
  
**Grea：**  
Oh no, you missed the due date already?  
  
**Anne：**  
Don't worry! We're as trusty as they come!  
With that said, let's get to it!

**Grea：**  
Hm?  
It started shining...  
  
**Lou：**  
Wow!  
It's all bright and shiny!  
You're so awesome, Anne!  
Make it even more shiny!

**Anne：**  
Heh!  
Don't mind... if I do!  
  
**Grea：**  
A-Anne?  
I think you might be going a little overboard here.  
  
**Anne：**  
Huh. Really?  
I mean, last time—  
  
**Lou：**  
Eeek?!  
The stone cracked!  
  
**Grea：**  
...!  
Watch out! Get away from it!  
  
**Anne：**  
H-huh?!  
What's with this light...?!  
  
**Anne & Grea & Lou：**  
Aaaaaahhhhhh!  
  

---  
  
**Grea：**  
Urgh....  
Hey. Anne, Lou!  
Are you two okay?!  
  
**Anne：**  
Y-yeah,  
don't worry. I'm fine!  
That took me by surprise, though.  
  
**Lou：**  
I'm all good, too!  
  
**Anne：**  
Hm...  
Sure didn't expect the magical crystal to act up like that.  
Maybe it was a different type before?  
  
**Lou：**  
Kind of unrelated, but, uh...  
Where are we?  
  
**Lou：**  
There's mountains everywhere.  
Maybe we're at Mount Gigas?  
Does that mean we're on another trip?!  
  
**Anne：**  
A trip, huh?  
Now that brings back memories.  
  
**Grea：**  
More importantly, we need to get back to Mysteria.  
Lou's assignment won't turn itself in.  
  
**Anne：**  
True enough! Let's get going!  
Wait, huh?  
My teleportation magic isn't activating...  
  
**Anne：**  
Maybe the flow of mana's all messed up?  
Thoughts, Grea?  
  
**Grea：**  
You're right.  
There's something slightly off.  
  
**Anne：**  
Hey. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  
  
**Lou：**  
Oh!  
Look, there's Mr. Gigas!  
I'll go ask him about it!  
  
**Anne：**  
...!  
Lou, wait!  
  
**Lou：**  
Heeey! Mr. Gigas!  
Long time no see!  
  
**Gigas：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Lou：**  
Waaaaaaahhhhh!  
  
Wh-why's he so angry?!  
  
**Anne：**  
...!  
Grea! There's something off about that Gigas!  
  
**Grea：**  
Agreed!  
We need to act quick!  
  
**Anne：**  
Lou!  
We'll need your help here!  
First off, use compound magic on it! Fire and lightning!  
  
**Anne：**  
I'll use wind magic to speed you up,  
so take that chance to restrain it with earth and dark magic!  
  
**Lou：**  
F-fire magic?! Lightning...  
Waaahhh! This is way harder than that assignment!
