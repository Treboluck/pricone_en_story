**Misaki：**  
What are you planning on doing at the beach?  
I'm looking for a tropical and gorgeous experience,  
so I would appreciate some pointers.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Just wanna swim.  
**Choice: (2)**  Summer gourmet, of course.  
**Choice: (3)**  Watermelons will be split.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misaki：**  
S-swim?!  
I can't sw—  
Err, ignore that!  
I'm willing to try it out, providing you lead the way!

**Misaki：**  
Right?!  
Shaved ice, ice-cream, not to mention  
an assortments of the island's tropical fruits! I can't wait!

`Tag 3`  
**Misaki：**  
W-watermelon splitting?  
I'd never do something so childish.  
But it's so fun?  
Urgh...  
If you're willing to go that  
far, then I might give it a shot.  
But only because you said so!
