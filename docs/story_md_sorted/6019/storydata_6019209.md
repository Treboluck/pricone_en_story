I'm looking forward to going to the beach at night.  
How come, you ask?  
The fireworks, of course!  
What sort of fireworks do you like?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Big, flashy skyrockets!

Same here. They're great! So many gorgeous patterns,  
perfect for a lady like myself.  
I can't wait to see what they've got in store for us here!

Sounds like the type that a prankster would love.  
They do have their own unique charm, though.  
If that's what you want, then I don't mind.
