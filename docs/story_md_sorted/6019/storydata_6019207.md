**Misaki：**  
You don't seem too bothered about getting a tan, do you?  
Meanwhile, I'm emptying bottles of sunscreen onto myself.  
Tans are a lady's greatest enemy!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Want me to help you out?  
**Choice: (2)**  There's nothing wrong with tans.  
**Choice: (3)**  Your effort is astonishing.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misaki：**  
Maybe I'll take you up on that...  
Hey! I know what you're doing!  
Don't find excuses to touch a lady!  
*sigh*  
I'll forgive you this time,  
but don't get any funny ideas.

`Tag 2`  
**Misaki：**  
R-really? Maybe I'll give it a shot, too.  
That said,  
it hurts when my skin gets all prickly,  
so I'm better off using sunscreen!

`Tag 3`  
**Misaki：**  
It takes a gentleman to  
understand a lady's efforts.  
In that case, how about you take a step into my shoes?  
You've got special permission to apply sunscreen on me!
