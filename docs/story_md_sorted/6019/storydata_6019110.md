We had so much fun here, didn't we?  
It'd be rad if we could all hang out again next year.  
That said, I gotta go extra hard on work.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  We're BFFs, so it'll be okay.  
**Choice: (2)**  You'll be on an even bigger stage next year.  
**Choice: (3)**  I'll keep my schedule empty for you.

For real? Thanks a ton!  
Wow though, you've really got that much free time?  
That's kinda depressing,
