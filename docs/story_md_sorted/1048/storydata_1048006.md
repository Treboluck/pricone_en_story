**Narration：**  
{player} arrives at the field to train with Mifuyu one day  
and is greeted by her proudly displaying a piece of paper.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hey, {player}!  
I got a new mercenary contract! Check it out!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
The job is to escort a carriage of flowers to a florist.  
I'm not sure why, but the pay is insanely good!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Rest assured, I need my star pupil by my side on this one!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Take a close look at the contract.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mifuyu：**  
What? There's some odd text in the contract?  
Where exactly?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
\"If the products are not kept safe, the guard shall compensate  
for the loss with their own person.  
This is not negotiable.\"  
You mean this part?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Doesn't that sound dodgy to you?  
`Tag 2`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Sure, the wording is a bit troubling,  
but no need to worry.  
All of our training has made us a force to be reckoned with.  
Garden-variety thugs could never take us!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so {player}'s concerns go unheeded.  
The day of the shipment arrives,  
and the two of them sit waiting atop the carriage.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Heheh! Traveling by carriage sure is grand, huh!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I know, I know.  
We're on the job. I haven't forgotten.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hold up, there's something headed our way. What is it?  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Yaaar, we're a bunch of scary, horrible bandits!  
We'll be takin' those flowers from ya.  
Nothin' suspicious about that!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  That sounds like bad acting.  
`Tag 3`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Heheheh, they don't stand a chance against  
veteran guards like us!  
Hiyaaah!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Argh, ya got me!  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
We're done for! Hey, pull back before you get hurt!  
We aren't gettin' any hazard pay!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Bahahah! What a bunch of cowards!  
They barely even put up a fight!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  There is definitely something off here.  
`Tag 4`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh come on, they just knew they were outmatched,  
that's all.  
Heheheh. Looks like you were just being a worrywart.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hey, I can see our destination up ahead!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh...?  
For a flower shop, it's certainly got  
some rough-looking guys hanging out in front.  
Eh, probably nothing.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hello there!  
We drove off some brigands and have delivered  
your flowers safely as asked!  
  
**Florist?：**  
Nyeheheh, we'll see about that... Hey, go check the cargo!  
  
**Florist Assistant?：**  
Aaahh! Boss—uh, I mean, shopkeep!  
The carriage is empty!  
  
**Florist?：**  
Wuh-oh! Oh, how could this be?! Hey, lady,  
take a look at the cart! There's nothin' in there!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
But that's impossible! I'm positive we fought off  
all the thieves...  
  
**Florist?：**  
I'd say they got ya while ya weren't lookin'!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I can't believe it... I—  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I kept the cart safe... I know I did.  
  
**Florist?：**  
Geheheh. Don't sound so sure of yourself anymore, do ya?  
Welp, accordin' to the contract, yer ours now to do with  
as we please.  
  
**Florist Assistant?：**  
I bet I can sell a pretty little thing like you  
for a fine price on the slaver's block!  
And I can do it, too, thanks to our agreement!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
He's got me trapped...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I'm sorry, {player}.  
Looks like my days of instructing you are over...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh? What's the matter, {player}?  
You keep glancing over at the carriage driver...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Why are you trying to slink off like that?  
**Choice: (6)**  Something isn't right here.  
`Tag 5`  
**Driver：**  
Wha—?! D-damn. He spotted me.  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh?  
Hey, hold it right there!  
I'm talking to you, driver!  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Driver：**  
Ulp!  
H-hey now, no need to get rough, lady!  
I'll tell ya everything, I swear!  
  
**Driver：**  
Th-those guys hired me!  
They aren't florists—they're a bunch of thieves,  
and that carriage was empty from the get-go!  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Y-ya fool, ya ruined everything!  
Damn it, run for it, boys!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
They were thieves...  
not florists?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Not so fast! Yaaah!  
  
**Bandits：**  
Gyeeearghh!  
  
**Narration：**  
After mopping the floor with the brigands,  
Mifuyu and {player} turn them over to the knights of Nightmare.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Whew. Well, you were right.  
That mission definitely *did not* go as planned.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Say,  
are you angry with me?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I know, I'm sorry for making you worry.  
That very nearly put an end to your training.  
I fail as a teacher once again...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
What? That's not it at all?  
It was my personal safety you were worried about?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
W-well, I, um, I don't... I don't know what to say...  
No one's ever worried about me before, aside from myself.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
U-uh...  
Th-thanks.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Next time you try to tell me something, I'm going to listen!  
You know, I think I've changed quite a bit...  
I'm not sure how to put it, it's just...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Wow, d-dang, it is just me or is it hot out here?  
Wh-what could it be!  
Ahaha!  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} watched on in amusement as Mifuyu  
nervously fanned her face.
