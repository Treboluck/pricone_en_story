## Subtitle: A Trio of Trials
  
**Narration：**  
Mifuyu asks {player} to meet up with her again.  
But rather than meeting at their normal training field,  
this time they rendezvous on the outskirts of Landosol.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Thanks for coming, {player}.  
I'm going to the battleground today.  
I assume you're up for joining me?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Battleground?! But, we're still in the city limits...  
`Tag 1`  
**Mifuyu：**  
By battleground, I mean we're diving into a massive sale!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
You see, today they're holding a big sale  
for couples only, down at the market.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
That's where you come in, {player}.  
Just for today, I need you to act like my boyfriend.  
Please!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Um, sure...  
`Tag 2`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yes! I knew I could count on my star pupil!  
Okay, let's go!  
  
**Narration：**  
There is a line of couples waiting for the shop to open.  
Soon, an employee comes out and begins to speak to the crowd.  
  
**Staff：**  
Ahem. Firstly, thank you all very much for coming today.  
I have a bit of extra special news unrelated to the sale  
for all you lovebirds.  
  
**Staff：**  
Today, we'll be holding a couples-only contest  
where the winners can take home an incredible treasure!  
There is an entry fee, but you don't want to miss this chance!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Did you hear that?! An incredible treasure...  
Even with the entry fee, I'm sure it'll be a great return  
on investment!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Of course we're going to play! Right?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Where do we sign up?  
`Tag 3`  
**Mifuyu：**  
That's the spirit!  
Hey there, we'd like to participate!  
  
**Staff：**  
And that's our last entry! Let's get this party started!  
Remember, couples only, folks! Your relationship will be  
put to the test as we see just how lovey-dovey you are!  
  
**Staff：**  
Today, we have a total of three challenges  
lined up for our contestants!  
Let's kick off with the first challenge!  
  
**Staff：**  
Despite heated opposition from the entire staff,  
the owner has remodeled the store to host  
a \"Test Your Luck and Fall in Muck\" Quiz!  
  
**Staff：**  
Listen to the question, then run to one of the doors.  
Get it right, and you're off to the next challenge!  
Get it wrong and, well, you're in for a sloppy surprise.  
  
**Staff：**  
Question! The battle axes sold in this store are priced at  
1,000 rupies. \"Yes\" or \"No\"?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Uh... \"Yes?\"  
**Choice: (5)**  Maybe... \"No?\"  
`Tag 4`  
**Mifuyu：**  
That's right!  
Now run!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Mifuyu：**  
No!  
Just follow me!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Male Lovebird：**  
Oh geez, a yes-no quiz...  
What're we gonna do, Michi?  
  
**Female Lovebird：**  
Oh, I dunno. You just pick one, Yoshi!  
  
**Male Lovebird：**  
But the only place I wanna go...  
is straight up your shirt!  
  
**Female Lovebird：**  
Oh my gosh! Yoshi, you are *such* a perv!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Comin' through!  
  
**Lovebirds：**  
Aaaaghhh!  
  
**Staff：**  
Uh-oh! Looks like that blue-haired lass and her beau  
just knocked down a pair of annoying lovebirds!  
And sure enough, the answer is... \"Yes\"!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hahah! Memorizing product prices is my favorite pastime!  
I watch them like a hawk every day!  
  
**Staff：**  
Now, we're down to half our contestants after that question.  
Next up is our second challenge! The Twisty-Wisty Maze!  
  
**Staff：**  
The owner forced another remodel for us—this time a giant maze!  
The first couple to reach the end goes to the final challenge!  
Now then, let the race... begin!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hmm, a left or right fork at the start...  
It'd hardly be efficient to make the wrong choice here.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Let's go right.  
**Choice: (8)**  I think we should go left.  
`Tag 7`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yeah, maybe... No, wait—I've got it! The optimal route!  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Sorry, but my intuition tells me the best route is...!  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Male Lovebird：**  
Yeah, that chick with the blue hair mighta messed things  
up earlier, but we can get some alone time in this maze,  
huh, Michi!  
  
**Female Lovebird：**  
Ah, I get it! You're so smart, Yoshi!  
  
**Male Lovebird：**  
Now, how about we get lost together?  
Lost... in the labyrinth of love!  
  
**Female Lovebird：**  
Seriously, Yoshi, you're *so* naughty!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Go go go!  
  
**Male Lovebird：**  
Unbelievable! The blue-haired girl is at it again,  
this time smashing right through the walls!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
The most efficient route is a straight line towards the exit!  
  
**Staff：**  
Wow, they bent the rules a bit, but they reached the goal!  
There's our winners, folks! The blue-haired girl  
and her loverboy move on to the final round!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
You bet we do! All right, that incredible treasure  
is practically ours now, {player}!  
  
**Staff：**  
And now for the ultimate challenge.  
A hand-holding test to find your boyfriend!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
...A what?!  
  
**Staff：**  
Your boyfriend will get inside a box and stick his hand out.  
Meanwhile, five of our shop staff will do the same.  
Correctly choose the hand of your lover, and you win!  
  
**Staff：**  
Okay, everyone in your boxes and... staaart!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Five boxes with hands sticking out...  
And only one of them  
is {player}.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh...  
Come to think of it, I've never actually  
held your hand before.  
  
**Staff：**  
Uh-oh, looks like she's in trouble! She's frozen in place!  
Could it be? Has she never held her boyfriend's hand before?  
Maybe there was never any love—maybe it's hopeless?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
...{player}. It's all so clear to me now.  
  
**Choice: (10)**  ...Mifuyu?  
`Tag 10`  
**Mifuyu：**  
I choose  
this hand!  
This is the hand of my beloved... {player}!  
  
**Staff：**  
And she's absolutely right!  
We have our winners, folks—  
the blue-haired beauty and her paramour!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
...Heheheh. {player}, you look like you're wondering  
how I was able to find you.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I noticed something... about your hand.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Your hand... is covered in scratches.  
You must have gotten those while training with me, right?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I did all that to you, didn't I?  
I'm sorry. From now on...  
I'll be more careful with my star pupil.  
  
**Staff：**  
Whoa, what a meaningful gaze between our winners.  
I can feel the love from here!  
But enough of the mushy stuff,  
because it's time to reveal our incrrredible treasure!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Finally! Oh man, what could it be?!  
  
**Staff：**  
And here is your priiize!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Wait... What the heck?  
A bargain bin baby bed?!  
  
**Staff：**  
Sure, it's a bit on the cheap side, but once you have a kid,  
it'd be an incredible treasure, right?  
We can't wait for you  
to bring a little bundle of joy into the world!  
  
**Staff：**  
That's what makes this such a fitting prize!  
And besides, this *is* a contest for couples, after all.  
Bwahahah!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I-I...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I paid that stupid entry fee... for this?  
  
**Staff：**  
Um, miss, is something wrong?  
  

---  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Something is very wrong! If this is your \"prize,\"  
then gimme back my money!  
I want to see whoever set this farce up.  
  
**Staff：**  
Eeep! I-I'm afraid the owner isn't here right now!  
  
**ナレーション：**  
And so {player} watched Mifuyu chase the poor  
employee around in a fury, the warmth of her touch lingering  
in his hand...
