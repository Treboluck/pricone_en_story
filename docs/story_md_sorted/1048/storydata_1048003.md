# Mifuyu Episode 3
Mifuyu brute-forces her way through an insane day of work, only to collapse from exhaustion in front of {player}. When he completes all the tasks in her place, she shows him a softer, more feminine side.
  
## Subtitle: A Toppled Teacher
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is walking through a field when he spots Mifuyu  
fixing a broken bridge over the river with extreme gusto.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hrraaagh!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Whew.  
That should fix everything.  
  
**Workman：**  
Great, I appreciate the help, missy!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Think nothing of it.  
Now, as for my fee...　That'll be 10,000 rupies.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
That's all of it.  
Thank you very much. I'll be off!  
  
**Narration：**  
Not long after, {player} finds Mifuyu collecting every  
last crop in a field on the outskirts of town.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hyaaah!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Whew. That's the last of it.  
Okay, that comes to 2,000 rupies.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Thanks! Be seeing you!  
  
**Narration：**  
And even later, {player} bumps into an ashen Mifuyu  
shouldering a huge bundle of newspapers, while attaching  
decorative dandelions to a sword as she walks.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh hey, {player}.  
What brings you around here?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
What am I up to? Well, I'm testing a new medicine,  
while delivering newspapers and attaching cute  
dandelion decorations to this sword.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I have to say, though, I am feeling a little beat...  
Oh!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Help Mifuyu sit up.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh. Th-thanks. What happened?  
I got all dizzy, and then...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Touch your forehead to her forehead.  
`Tag 2`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh? You say I'm... burning up?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Guess I pushed myself too hard... I'm in a real fix, though.  
I'm still way behind on my quota...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'll take over for you.  
`Tag 3`  
**Mifuyu：**  
What? Are you serious, {player}?  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Ohh my, if it isn't the paperboy.  
 Thank you, sonny.  
  
**Clerk：**  
Ho there! Looks like ya got all the dandelions put on!  
Addin' some flowers makes all the difference in stylin' up  
a brand new blade. Thanks, kid!  
  
**Doctor：**  
What's the matter? It better be urgen—  
What?  
A patient undergoing treatment has collapsed, and I need  
to see them right away?  
Understood. I'll head over at once.  
  
**Narration：**  
With all of Mifuyu's jobs completed, {player} heads to  
the guildhouse where she is resting to deliver the news.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Mmh... Th-thanks.  
I owe you one.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Getting saved by my own student... Some teacher I am.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Don't be so hard on yourself.  
`Tag 4`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Eheheh. Nice of you to say that.  
Hey, this may be the the fever talking here, but...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
If I promise to go straight back to whipping you into shape  
after I get better,  
is it all right if, just this once,  
I take you up on what you said the other day?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  What I said the other day?  
`Tag 5`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Just for today... is it okay if I let myself be a girl  
and have you take care of me?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I could really go for some rice porridge.  
  
**Narration：**  
And so {player} caringly nursed Mifuyu back to health,  
strengthening their bond even more.
