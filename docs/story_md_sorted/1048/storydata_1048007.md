## Subtitle: Teacher vs. Student
  
**Narration：**  
{player} arrives at the field as usual, only to find  
Mifuyu with an uncharacteristically grim look on her face.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Thanks for coming, {player}...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I've had something on my mind for a while now.  
Today... I'm challenging you to a duel!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What?!  
`Tag 1`  
**Mifuyu：**  
I don't know why... But I've felt a little strange lately.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Whenever I'm around you, I can't seem to think straight!  
Like I keep going overboard trying to impress you...  
But then it's *me* that ends up relying on *you* in the end.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I just find myself wanting to be with you for no real reason.  
I've never felt this way before. It's so... inefficient.  
So...  
I need to overcome you and get back to being myself!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Let's do this, {player}!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Defend yourself.  
`Tag 2`  
**Mifuyu：**  
You blocked it?  
Okay then, try this on for size!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Parried that one, too, eh...  
You've really improved!  
I'm happy to see it!  
Hyaaahh!  
  
**Narration：**  
After a long bout with no real winner,  
the two fall to the ground in exhaustion.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ungh!  
Whew. I think we've both had enough for today.  
I'm really impressed, {player}.  
I couldn't get the best of you... which makes this a draw.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Guess I'll keep training you as I have been for now.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Whatever you say, Teach.  
`Tag 3`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Heheheh. Thanks.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hey... I wonder if...  
I could open up to you  
about a few things?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
See, I haven't really had any close friends, boy or girl.  
Not that I don't get along with my guildmates,  
but a lot of that is just built on us working together.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Being a mercenary is all about being efficient, which means  
I'm a loner by necessity. Having to look out for others is a weakness.  
...Or so I've always told myself.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hey... Is it all right if I scoot over closer to you?  
You can stay lying where you are.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Heheh...  
{player}, I have a piece of cloth here.  
Care to guess what it is?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  A rag?  
**Choice: (5)**  Some old scrap of fabric?  
`Tag 4`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Is that what it looks like?  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Well yeah, it certainly is, but...  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Actually, this is from a while ago, back when my clothes  
got ripped while fighting monsters, and you lent me your cape  
to cover myself.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Well, all I have left is this tattered little piece  
that doesn't serve any purpose to keep...  
But for some reason, I can't throw it away. Weird, huh?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  That's not weird at all.  
**Choice: (8)**  I'm touched.  
`Tag 7`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hehehe... Thanks.  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hearing you say that makes me feel happy, too.  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hey, {player}.  
If you ever do beat me in real duel...  
If I ever stop being your teacher, do you think...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Do you think you would still... stay by my side?  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Of course.  
`Tag 10`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Eheheh. Thank you, {player}.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
All right,  
then tomorrow let's you and I tackle this  
dungeon-delving job I have lined up!  
We'll aim to finish it in the shortest time possible!  
  
**Narration：**  
Mifuyu and {player} naturally put their arms around each  
other's shoulders as they spoke, their bond clearly growing  
into one far stronger than that of a teacher and student.
