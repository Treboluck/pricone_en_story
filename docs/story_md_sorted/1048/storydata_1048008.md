## Subtitle: A \"Berry\" Sweet Time
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is out for a morning walk when he  
bumps into Mifuyu running her newspaper route.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
*huff, huff, huff*  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh, good morning, {player}.  
Out for a walk?  
I started work bright and early today.  
But I've still got  
so many papers left to drop off...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh? What's going on here? There's light coming from between the—  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Aaaahhh!  
  

---  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hey, {player}! Thanks for coming today!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I'm so excited to pick strawberries!  
You don't often find places that only charge half for couples!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Time is limited, so efficient movement is key!  
We'll get to take more home that way, too!

**Mifuyu：**  
Hmm, what's the most efficient way  
to pick the most strawberries in a short time?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Going for only the biggest won't really matter here.  
Sweetness, color, gloss... we'll have to judge all of that  
to discern the overall quality of the strawberries.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
You start over there, {player}. Fill that take-home bag  
with the most choice strawberries you can find.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Uh, this sounds difficult.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Chin up! I know you can do it!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I gotta say, though, these bags are awfully small...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I know.  
Maybe I can fit more strawberries under my arms  
and in my cleavage.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hey {player}, think you can fit some in your underwear?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Um, isn't that going a little overboard?  
`Tag 2`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yeah, that's probably bending the rules too far.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh well, we'll just settle for what fits in the bags.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Why do you want so many strawberries?  
`Tag 3`  
**Mifuyu：**  
I want to get some for my brother and sister, too.  
We've got a lot of growing mouths to feed at home.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
That's the reason I live so frugally and work so hard—  
I want to make things easier for my family.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I never knew that.  
`Tag 4`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yeah. Anyhow, you're the only person I've ever told this to,  
okay, {player}?  
Please don't go spreading it around.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
What? You'd like to help out in some way if you can?  
Heheheh, that's kind of you.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Well, let's see...  
How about joining the family?  
You can be the big breadwinner.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Um, what?  
`Tag 5`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Heheheh. I'm kidding. Oh–looks like we've picked all we can.  
Okay, {player}, open wide. Say \"Ahh.\"  
  
**Choice: (6)**  A-ahh...  
`Tag 6`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Is it good? Heheh, nice.  
  
**Narration：**  
Though Mifuyu had been a bit coy, {player} savored  
the sweet, tangy flavor of the strawberries, thinking  
it had been a good day indeed.

**Ameth：**  
So, how did you like my little present?  
Was it a sweet \"dream\"?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I made it using some of your memories with Mifuyu.  
It was interesting seeing how you act around her now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And strawberry picking? I'm *sooo* jealous!  
I wish I could've gone too...  
Just kidding, heheh.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway,  catch ya next time! ♪

**Mifuyu：**  
Oh! Is this...  
Was that a dream?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh? You saw it all, too?  
  
Heheh. Guess the secret's out then.  
Yep, all the working and saving is for my younger siblings.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
And now you've seen another new side of me, {player}.  
N-not that it really bothers me...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Anyway, I'm falling behind on my paper route!  
See you later, {player}.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
What? You're going to help me?  
Great, then let's up the efficiency and jog as we deliver  
to build up your stamina! Don't fall behind!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus Mifuyu and {player} spent another fun  
and efficiently enjoyable day together.
