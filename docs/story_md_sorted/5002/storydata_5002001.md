## Subtitle: Invitation to Exploration
  
**Narration：**  
The day after her fight with Misogi,  
Kyoka finds herself regretting the previous day's events.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
*sigh* I suppose I went a bit too far...  
Saying I wouldn't speak to her again...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
B-but... She was the one who asked me to teach her!  
She shouldn't give up just because she didn't understand...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...It was probably my fault too.  
I was so happy to be a teacher, I got carried away...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Are we really never going to play together again...?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Good morning!  
**Choice: (2)**  Tap Kyoka on the shoulder.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahhh! Wh-why, you!  
Don't speak so suddenly out of nowhere!  
You really surprised me there!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Sneaking up on a girl from behind...  
I see you're a suspicious creep as usual!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kyoka：**  
Uehh! Wh-who was that?!  
...Oh, it's you... Don't suddenly tap my shoulder from behind!  
You scared—I mean, you really surprised me!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Besides, touching a girl's body without permission...  
You really are a suspicious creep! I knew it all along!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kyoka：**  
...Huh? You thought I might be feeling bad about yesterday,  
so you came to see if I was OK?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Th-that's none of your business!  
I'm perfectly fine, don't you worry!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
As for Misogi... Who cares about her?  
It's not like we're friends anymore...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Aren't you going to make up with her?  
`Tag 4`  
**Kyoka：**  
That's an awful lot easier said than done!  
But, well... I suppose if Misogi really insisted...  
I wouldn't turn her down...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
But really, neither of us thinks we're wrong,  
so what's the use in apologizing?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I mean, I'll admit I didn't handle it perfectly...  
I could have done better.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I know that, but... I said I'd never speak to her again, so...  
Without some kind of reason, I can't exactly...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
It's not like I want to leave things the way they are!  
But... making up isn't an easy thing to do...  
And I've never fought with a friend like this before, so...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
None of my textbooks say anything about how to fix a friendship...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Right, let's go exploring!  
`Tag 5`  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh? Wh-what's this all of a sudden?  
Exploring...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Please don't try to cheer me up with distractions...  
I'm not in the mood.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Besides, Misogi's the one who loves exploring,  
so surely you should invite her, not me.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...If all of us go out exploring together, we might find  
we're friends again before we know it?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Would such a simple method really work, I wonder?  
Still, Misogi *does* love exploring...  
It might not be such a bad plan.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh, but how are we going to invite her?  
If I go see her myself, she probably won't even talk to me...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Maybe if I wrote a letter...  
 Yes, that's the answer!  
Let's send her a proper invitation for an expedition!  
Hold on a second... I'll see what I can do!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ummm... \"Exploration Invitation\"...  
\"Dear Misogi... Let's go exploring together—you, me and Mimi.  
Meet me outside the city walls. Regards, Kyoka.\" ...I guess that will do.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Um... {player}.  
Could you deliver this to Misogi for me?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Th... Thank you very much!  
Will she actually show up, though...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
It'll be fine, right?  
Misogi wouldn't miss out on a chance to go exploring!  
{player}, I'm counting on you to get that letter to her.  
  
**Narration：**  
With Kyoka's carefully written letter in hand,  
{player} set off for Landosol, determined to  
deliver it to Misogi as soon as possible.
