**Narration：**  
On the day of the expedition, Misogi and {player}  
set out for the meeting point a little early  
and await Kyoka and Mimi's arrival.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Urghh... I'm so nervous...  
What am I s'posed to say when Kyoka gets here?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Just act normal.  
**Choice: (2)**  You don't have to say anything.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misogi：**  
That's the hard part!  
Honestly, mister, you're so dumb sometimes!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Misogi：**  
I can't just stand there and say nothing!  
If I go quiet, everyone's gonna feel extra awkward!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kyoka：**  
...Hello, both of you.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Wahhh! You surprised me!  
Oh... Kyoka! Umm... Ahh... G-good morning?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Y-yes... Good morning.  
Good morning to you too, {player}.  
  
**Kyoka & Misogi：**  
...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
S-so, do you have any ideas where we should explore?  
{player}!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Y-yeah, good question! Where're we going, mister?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Let's decide when Mimi gets here.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh? Has Mimi not arrived yet?  
It's not like her to be late...  
Y-you don't think she got lost, do you?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ehhhh?! That would be real bad! We should go find her!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
L-let's try asking at her house first!  
She might have just overslept!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Mimi! Mimi! If you're in there, say something!  
  
**Mimi：**  
*cough, cough* Hello...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Mimi! Wh-what's wrong?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Oh... Hi, guys!  
 Eheheh...  
Actually, I've got a bit of a fever...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Whaaa?! A-are you OK?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Uh-huh, I'm all ri—  
 *cough, cough*  
Ahhh... I'm sorry, guys... I don't think I can go exploring today...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
That's fine, that's fine! You get some rest!  
I'm sorry—we didn't mean to disturb you!  
  
**Mimi：**  
No no, actually, seeing all of you made me feel a little bit better!  
I'm so happy that you two seem to be friends again...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Urk! A-about that...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Well then, I should get back to bed...  
See you later, guys...  
  
**Kyoka & Misogi：**  
...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Mimi looked like she was in pretty bad shape...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Yeah... She was putting on a brave face for us,  
but she looked like she was hurting...  
...Arghhh! If only I had the power to heal illnesses!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I haven't learned any magic that can defeat bacteria...  
 Oh! I know!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
One time, when I was looking through a textbook,  
I read about a herb that's good for fevers!  
It makes your temperature go down, and you feel much better!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Whoa, for real?!  
Then if we give her that herb, Mimi'll be okay again?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
That's definitely what it said in the textbook!  
  
**Misogi：**  
C'mon then! Let's go on an expedition!To find that herb!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
What?!  
But... the place where the herb grows is home to monsters...  
  
**Misogi：**  
You ready for this, mister?!  
All right! For our friend Mimi! Misogi Explorers, go go go!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahh... Misogi, wait!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
The herb we want grows on the other side of this mountain.  
There are monsters around, so let's be nice and—  
  
**Misogi：**  
All right! Let's hurry!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
That Misogi... Always rushing ahead!  
  
**Misogi：**  
I'm not rushing! You guys are just slow! Hurry it up already!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
*sigh* This isn't going very well...  
Are we really going to be able to make up like this?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi! Please slow down a little!  
At this rate, you'll leave us behind!  
  
**Misogi：**  
A... All right, all right!  
  
**Misogi：**  
I knew it... Kyoka's still mad...  
She's scarier than usual...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
She keeps running off...  
She must not want to be anywhere near me...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Geez! Pull yourself together, mister!  
I'm cheering you on here, so try to keep up!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Now {player} is leaving me behind too...  
Honestly... this is all your fault for rushing, Misogi!  
  
**Misogi：**  
What? I just want Mimi to get better soon!  
So we gotta hurry up!  
  
**Monster 1：**  
GRRAAAAAGGHHHH!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Whoaaa! What's that?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
A-a monster?! Misogi! Quickly, come over here—  
  
**Monster 2：**  
GRRAAAAAGGHHHH!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
A-another one?! Oh no...!  
But {player} is still...  
S-stay back, monsters!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Kyoka?!  
 A-all right, I'll fight too! Yahhh!  
  
**Monster 1：**  
GRRAAAAAGGHHHH!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Aaahhh! D-do you really have to roar all the time?!  
I need to work with Misogi and...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Hey, Misogi! Stop dodging around everywhere!  
It makes it hard to aim my magic!  
  
**Misogi：**  
What?! But the monster keeps attacking me!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Try to focus your attacks on one side!  
  
**Misogi：**  
That's easier said than—  
 Wahh?!  
  
**Monster 2：**  
GRUOOAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Aghh! Owwww...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi! Get back for a moment! I'll deal with this!  
  
**Misogi：**  
O-on your own...?  
 Ahh! Mister!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
{player}! Th-thank you very much!  
Please keep distracting the monster like that!  
Then I'll...  
 Now! Haaahhh!  
  
**Monster 2：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I did it! Now for the other one!  
  
**Monster 1：**  
GRUOOAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? It ran away?  
 ...H-heck yeah! That's what you get  
when you mess with Kyoka and Mister {player}!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi, you're injured right now, so stay still!  
Here, I'll fix you up, so show me where it hurts!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Owww! Urgh... Sorry...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Honestly... This is what happens when you rush off...  
  
**Misogi：**  
...Umm... Uhh...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
There. That should do it.  
The herb we want should be at the end  
of a labyrinth that lies just ahead.  
  
**Misogi：**  
...R-right! Eheheh...  
 OK then!  
Let's move, you guys! We're gonna grab that herb for sure!  
  
**Narration：**  
In search of the herb that would help Mimi,  
the Misogi Explorers forged ahead into the gloomy labyrinth.
