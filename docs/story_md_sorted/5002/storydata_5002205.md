**Misogi：**  
Waaahhh! I-it's that monster again!  
It sure is stubborn!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Did it chase us all the way down here?  
We didn't come to play tag with you!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
There's something different about it...  
I think it might have become more aggressive than before!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Eheheh... When we beat it before, it gave us all those medals, right?  
If we beat it again, maybe it'll give us even more!  
C'mon, mister, Kyoka! Let's try and take it down!  
  
**Kyoka & Misogi：**  
Ready, set, go!
