# A 100/100 Smile
As Kyoka, Mimi and {player} study together in the Elven Forest, Misogi shows up to show off her perfect grade on the test. Though she thanks Kyoka at first, she quickly goes back to playing pranks, and the two of them end up fighting once more.

**Narration：**  
Today in the Elven Forest, Kyoka is helping  
{player} and Mimi with their studies.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Kyoka... How do I do this part?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh, for this question, you can calculate it like this... You see?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ohhh! You're right!  
Eheheh... You're a good teacher, Kyoka.  
You make everything so easy to understand!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
R-really?  
 I'm glad you think that...  
By the way, are you feeling better today?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Uh-huh!  
When I drank that medicine you bought me, I felt better right away!  
You went on a big adventure, right? Mr. Nice Guy told me all about it!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
That's right! There was a labyrinth full of traps,  
and a monster thiiiis big in the shape of a lamp!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Woooow!  
I would've been so scared, I might have given up and run away...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I was scared too, but Misogi and {player} were there...  
And when I thought about making the medicine for you,  
 suddenly I didn't feel scared at all!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
So next time, you should come exploring with us too! Promise!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Sure! Exploring~♪ Exploring~♪ It sounds so much fun~! ♪  
  
**Misogi：**  
Kyoka! Kyoka!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahh! Misogi's here!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Why's she all worked up this time?  
Don't tell me she messed up on another test...

**Misogi：**  
Great Teacher Kyoka! I totally did it!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wahh! What's going on, Misogi? Wait, is that... a perfect score?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
It's all because you taught me all that stuff after our adventure!  
I wasn't hopeless after all!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I knew you could do it if you tried!  
Still, ahh, I suppose my teaching ability was also an important—  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahhh! You're getting carried away again!  
But I guess you're right! Thanks a bunch, Kyoka!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I was joking! You earned these results by working so hard!  
All I did was give you a little push in the right direction!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Kyokaaaa!  
 Ahhh... You're the best!

**Kyoka：**  
Eheheh...  
Oh, I bet your mom was pretty pleased  
when she saw those results, huh?  
  
**Misogi：**  
You bet she was! Guess what—when I showed her,  
she actually said she'd increase my allowance!  
  
**Misogi：**  
So that's why I brought...  
Here! A present for you!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
What?! O-oh, I couldn't...!  
  
**Misogi：**  
No, I insist! I bought it specially for you!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
What could it be?  
 Oh! Could she have brought one of those premium cupcakes from Landosol?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Well then, I suppose I can't say no... Thank you, Misogi—  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahahaha! You fell for it!  
This is my latest prank: the Exploding Jack-in-the-Box!  
I bought it just to see your reaction!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
M... M... Mi...so..giiiiii!!!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahahahah! Kyoka got mad again!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Of course I'm angry! This time you've gone one step too far!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Calm down, Kyoka...  
**Choice: (2)**  Misogi, you should apologize...  
`Tag 1`  
**Kyoka：**  
You can stay out of this, {player}!  
This time, Misogi's entirely in the wrong! I have to teach her a lesson!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Misogi：**  
Whoa! Sorry 'bout that, Kyoka! Ahahahahah!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi! Hold it right there!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Like I'd make it that easy! Catch me if you can!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Kyoka and Misogi really are the best of friends, huh?  
  
**Mimi：**  
I know! Since Kyoka seems busy,  
I'll help you study instead today, mister!  
  
**Narration：**  
In the end, Kyoka and Misogi found themselves fighting as usual.  
Leaving them to their own business, Mimi and {player}  
went right back to studying.
