the monster in the labyrinth a second time.  
  
**Misogi：**  
All right! First, let's take care of its little friends!  
  
**Monster：**

**Misogi：**  
All right!  
 At this rate, I bet we can take down the big guy too!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
This is going so much better than last time!  
It must be because we're in tune with each other!  
  
**Misogi：**  
You know it! Without all those worries, I'm bursting full of energy!

**Kyoka：**  
Haaaaahhh!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
It worked! The ice reflects its beams! Which means...!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Your own flashy attacks will be your doom!  
  
**Alma：**  
KKKSSSHRRRKKK!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
A direct hit! I'll keep holding the ice in place,  
so Misogi, you finish it off!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Right! I'm on it!

**Kyoka：**  
We beat it...  
 You're amazing, Misogi! You actually beat it!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Eheheh! I am a total genius, after all!  
...Is what I'd like to say, but you're the real genius, Kyoka!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Don't be ridiculous. You're the one who came up with the plan!  
  
**Misogi：**  
But you're the one who taught me about reflecting light!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Ahhh!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Eheheh! After our fight, I tried to go back over the stuff you taught me!  
I was feeling pretty down, so I didn't last long...  
But thank goodness your ice magic worked just the same as a mirror!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
No... Even so, you're the amazing one!  
I knew all about reflection, but I couldn't come up with that plan!  
That flexible thinking is one of your best points, Misogi!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Y-you think so? Eheheh... Talk about a rare compliment!  
...Ahh! Wh-what about the herb?  
We've gotta get it to Mimi, and quick!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
There's an exit right through here!  
Misogi, {player}, let's hurry!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Woooow! It's so pretty!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I never thought the other side of the mountain  
would be such a beautiful place...  
  
**Misogi：**  
There's a lot more to the world than mere textbooks  
can teach you, my dear Kyoka!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Where did that come from?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
But... You have a point. I guess you're right, Misogi.  
There are more important things than studying textbooks.  
Today, you're the one who taught me something!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Finally you get it?  
Then from now on, we can do less studying and—  
  
**Kyoka：**  
That's a different story!  
 Now, let's find the herb!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Yep, that's the Kyoka I know...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Now then, where's a herb...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Oh! This is it!  
  
**Misogi：**  
This thing? It just looks like a flower...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
The leaves and stem have powerful medicinal properties!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Then if we take this flower home, we can help Mimi, right?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Yes... We actually did it!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahhh, what a fun day!  
It was a pretty long and tricky adventure,  
but I couldn't've made it this far without both of you guys!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I only made it here thanks to the two of you, too!  
Misogi, you gave me the courage to fight!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Eheheh... It's kinda embarrassing when you say it like that...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Let's take Mimi too next time...  
All of Little Lyrical, exploring together!  
  
**Narration：**  
With their hearts united by a shared goal,  
Kyoka and Misogi made their way back to the city  
just a little bit more grown-up than they had left it.
