Eheheh... Maybe I do rush into things too much...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
*pant*... *pant*... We should be safe out here!  
Misogi, are you all right?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Yeah, I'm OK. It's just a scratch, really.  
Forget me—what about you? You aren't hurt, are you?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wh-who the heck cares about me right now?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
I do! Kyoka... Are you mad at me?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Of course I am! What were you thinking?!  
{player} and I were both so worried...!  
  
**Misogi：**  
But I... I wanted to protect you both...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
What's the use in that if it puts you in danger?! Think of yourself a little!  
You big, dumb dummy! Stupid Misogi!  
  
**Misogi：**  
...Eheheh... I made you mad again...  
 I guess I really am hopeless...  
Right when I was trying to make up with you...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahh...!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...I wanted... I wanted to make up with you too!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh...? Kyoka, you're not still mad at me?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
It wasn't your fault! I was the one who got carried away...  
I knew I went too far, but I couldn't admit it...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi... I'm sorry... I'm really, really sorry!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Kyoka...  
  
**Misogi：**  
I was an idiot...  
I shouldn't have given up right away after asking you to help me...  
And today, too, I keep making trouble for you...  
  
**Misogi：**  
I'm real sorry, Kyoka...  
I don't ever want to stop being friends with you...  
  
**Misogi：**  
'Cause... 'Cause I really like you!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Well, I... I like you  
 just as much, so there!  
  
**Kyoka & Misogi：**  
...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Eheheh... We managed to make up,  
but now it looks like I made you cry...

**Kyoka：**  
Huh? Is this... a cupcake?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Yeah! You told me eating cupcakes makes you feel better, right?  
So... I tried making one for you to say sorry.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi... Thank you! Can I eat it now?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Of course! What else are you gonna do with it?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Eheheh... You're right... Well then, I'll take a bite.  
*munch*... Ahh... it's good...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Really? Kyoka, do you feel better?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Yes! With a cupcake as delicious as this one,  
I think I could recover from anything!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Thank you so much, Misogi!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Thank goodness... I really hoped you'd like it...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Heheh... Thanks for everything, Kyoka...  
Thank you, and... good... bye...  
  
**Misogi：**

**Kyoka：**  
Misogi?  
 Hey, Misogi?! Open your eyes! Misogi!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Juuuust kidding!  
You totally fell for it!  
 Wait—owieee!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wh-why, you...  
 Misogi! Is this the time for pranks?!  
Here, show me where you're hurt! I need to treat you!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Heheheh! I knew that one'd be a shocker!  
Anyway, Kyoka, what should we do about that monster?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Honestly! The moment we've made up, you're back to your old tricks...  
Hmmm... We need to do something about its light attack...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Yeah, you're right... Light... Ligh...t...?  
 Ahhhhh!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wahh! Wh-what? What is it?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Heheheh...  
I just figured it out! How we're gonna beat that monster!  
  
**Narration：**  
Chuckling confidently about her own clever idea,  
Misogi explained to the others what she had in mind.
