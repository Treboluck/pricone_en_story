# Traps and Tribulations
As the group explores the labyrinth, Kyoka is caught in a trap. Though Kyoka is scared and starts to panic, Misogi quickly rescues her. While working together to conquer the labyrinth, they come across a monster they've never seen before.
  
## Subtitle: Traps and Tribulations
  
**Narration：**  
Trusting that the herb they seek lies within,  
the Misogi Explorers make their way into a labyrinth of tunnels.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Woooow, who knew there were tunnels like these in the mountains?!  
I always wanted to explore a labyrinth!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Apparently, these tunnels were used as a kind of fortress  
by people long ago. That's what I read in a history book...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ohhh! Then there might be treasure and stuff hidden here?  
Eheheh! Maybe we'll make a big discovery!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Any treasure hidden in places like this  
has usually long since been looted by bandits.  
Besides, our goal isn't treasure, it's a rare herb, remember?  
  
**Misogi：**  
I-I know all that, but...  
 It can't hurt to dream, right?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
It doesn't look like anyone has been here in a long time,  
so it could easily have become infested by monsters.  
Let's be very caref—  
  
**Misogi：**  
Waaahhh! Kyoka! Don't move a muscle!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh? Wh-what's this all of a sudden?  
  
**Misogi：**  
That tile you're standing on! It's a trap activation switch!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Whaaa?! Wh-what should I do? Umm... umm...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Try to calm down, Kyoka!  
If you move, you'll be blown to little bits...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
T-to little bits?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
I'm gonna get you out of there! Just hold still...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
O-oh no... Ahhh...  
{player}, am I going to perish here in this spot?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hold Kyoka's hand.  
**Choice: (2)**  Misogi will take care of the trap!  
`Tag 1`  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahh... Thank you for that...  
I'm sure Misogi will rescue me... It'll be fine, right?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kyoka：**  
I-I know... But... even so, it's scary...  
{player}, please... stay close to me...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Misogi：**  
Lessee... This bit goes here, and then...  
 Huh?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wh-what?! What's wrong?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
No, it's nothing really! It's fine, it's fine...  
 Probably.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Probably?!  
 Aaahhh...  
{player}...! *sniff*... *whimper*...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh! It's like this! Ummm... So if I do this...  
 There!  
It's all fine now! Trap deactivated!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Uwehh...?  
 Ahh... You're right... No way...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Heheh! This is nothing for a master of traps like myself!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi... Thank you.  
  
**Misogi：**  
No problem! You're always helping me out with stuff.  
Anyway, this labyrinth probably has lots more traps, huh...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Hmmm... If I look carefully, I might be able to spot them.  
Right! I'll watch out for the traps, then you can deactivate them!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Gotcha! You can count on Misogi any time!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh, Misogi! Doesn't that wall look a little different?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hmmm? It does look suspicious!  
Could this be a pitfall trap?  
 Stay back, you guys!  
  
**Misogi：**  
There! I knew it was a pitfall!  
If we'd been leaning against the wall, we'd be in trouble!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Hmm? Something's glinting near my feet...  
 Ahh!  
Misogi, there's some kind of thread on the ground!  
  
**Misogi：**  
This looks like one of those traps that triggers a flying arrow!  
Careful not to touch it! Step carefully across the thread!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Whew... I think we made it through the trap zone!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
All thanks to you, Misogi! You really do know your traps...  
  
**Misogi：**  
You're the one who managed to spot every last one!  
I just helped you deal with them!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
It was all you, really!  
  
**Misogi：**  
No, it was you, Kyoka!  
  
**Kyoka & Misogi：**  
...Pfft...  
  
**Kyoka & Misogi：**  
Ahahahahaha!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hey, I think I'm talking to Kyoka pretty normally!  
This is my chance to say sorry!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Since we entered this labyrinth, I feel like I'm talking to Misogi better...  
This is my chance to apologize, right?  
  
**Kyoka & Misogi：**  
U-umm...!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Hm? What was that...?  
  
**Misogi：**  
That's... a trap switch, mister... Don't tell me you just...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  ...Sorry.  
`Tag 4`  
**Misogi：**  
You dummy, mister!  
Waaahhh! It's a giant rolling rock!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi, {player}!  
Quick, we have to run!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Didn't I tell you the other day to watch where you walk?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
*pant*... *pant*... Ahh! There's a room up ahead!  
We can hide in there!  
  
**Misogi：**  
*huff*... *puff*...  
 We just about... made it, huh...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Y-yes. And I think we've made it to the end of the labyrinth.  
The exit should be just through here, I... think...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Kyoka? What's wrong?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
What is that thing...?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Looks like some kinda big lamp...  
Ahhh! Could it be a magic lamp?!  
Did we find the hidden treasure?!  
  
**???：**  
KKRRRKSSSHHH!  
  
**Misogi：**  
I-it moved?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahhh! Get back, Misogi! That's no treasure or artifact!  
It's... a monster!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Whaaaa?! It's so crazy huge...  
We can't beat a monster like this!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
B-but... If we don't get past it, we can't reach the exit...  
We're so close to getting the herb!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Urghh... I'm scared...  
 but... Mimi's counting on us!  
If that's what it takes to help her, I'll take this thing down!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi...  
 Yes, you're right... I'll fight too!  
{player}, back us up! We'll need your help!  
  
**Narration：**  
Though a gigantic monster blocked the way forward,  
for the sake of their friend, Kyoka and Misogi mustered  
all of their courage and drew their weapons.
