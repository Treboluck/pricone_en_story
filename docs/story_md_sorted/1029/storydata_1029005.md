## Subtitle: Lyrical Love Letter
  
**Narration：**  
Nozomi asks {player} for his opinion on something.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
What do you think of this?  
I tried writing lyrics for a new song.  
It's a love song...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
My manager asked me to do it.  
I've never written one before,  
so I wanted your opinion.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It made me hungry.  
**Choice: (2)**  Sounds powerful.  
`Tag 1`  
**Nozomi：**  
I guess... that isn't a compliment.  
Maybe lines like \"my stomach growls, hungry for your love\"  
don't really work...

`Tag 2`  
**Nozomi：**  
Urghhh....  
Maybe lyrics like \"divide and conquer\" and \"lone warrior\" are the problem?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Nozomi：**  
*sighs* Doesn't sound much like a love song, does it?  
I just don't know how to write romantic lyrics...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
*sigh*  
I thought as much,  
and now you've confirmed it...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But what am I supposed to do? Idols aren't allowed to date.  
If I've never experienced love,  
how am I supposed to write a love song?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Write with your imagination.  
**Choice: (5)**  Fall in love.  
`Tag 4`  
**Nozomi：**  
It's not that simple.  
Fake feelings won't make for good lyrics.

`Tag 5`  
**Nozomi：**  
Like I said, it's not that simple.  
I'm an idol. I'm not allowed to have a boyfriend.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Nozomi：**  
Or, what?  
Are you offering to be my practice partner, {player}?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh?! Wh-what did you just say?  
You'll actually be my practice partner?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hmm... I definitely heard you say that.  
There's no backing out!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It's decided, then!  
We're going on a date, so I can learn all about romance!  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day—  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Well then, let's start our date.  
I'd prefer if you took the lead,  
but have you actually been on a date before, {player}?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You haven't?  
So, you don't have a girlfriend?  
What a relief...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, what I mean by that is...  
It wouldn't be fair if I was the only inexperienced one.  
Th-that's all I meant, so don't read into it.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Well then, let me take the lead for today.  
I've seen plays and read books on this stuff, so I've got this!  
Okay, to start with... How about we go shopping?  
  
**Staff：**  
Welcome!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Whoa! These clothes are super cute!  
Hey, what do you think?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Really?  
Heheh. If you like it so much,  
maybe I'll go ahead and buy it!  
  
**Staff：**  
Miss, I have the perfect bag  
to go along with that outfit. It'll look even prettier.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You're right!  
Oh, and those shoes over there also match!  
But can I carry all this stuff?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You'll hold my bags for me?  
Thanks!  
I'll take you up on that.  
  
**Staff：**  
In that case, why not pair them with these accessories?  
  
**Staff：**  
This hat suits you as well!  
I'm pretty sure your boyfriend likes it, too.  
  
**Staff：**  
And what about this sword?  
There's nothing quite like couples matching outfits!  
  
**Staff：**  
This armor here is all the rage with couples right now!  
  
**Staff：**  
Thank you for shopping with us!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Clothes, bag, accessories, hat, shoes, sword, armor...  
G-  
guess I bought a little too much, didn't I?  
Isn't it heavy, {player}?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ahh!  
You're being crushed under everything!  
A-are you all right?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
S-sorry.  
I got a little carried away with the shopping.  
I think all your compliments got to my head.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
And the shop attendant even called you my boyfriend...  
These shop people always know how to talk you up.  
But... maybe she really thought we were a couple.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh! You must be hungry. Let's have lunch!  
As an apology, let me foot the bill.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You're really enjoying the food, aren't you?  
Heheh. I'm glad to see you like it.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
M-me?  
No, I'm fine with just a drink.  
You remember I'm on a diet, right?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ahh! M-my stomach just growled...  
Oh, forget it!  
{player}, let me try some of that!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
*munch, munch*...  
Ahh, so delicious!  
Hey, I'll take some of that as well!  
Heheh. Sorry, {player}.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
After this?  
Would you like to go see a play?  
The truth is, yesterday I planned out our whole date.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
After the play, how about some billiards?  
Or do you prefer bowling?  
Later, we'll ride horses, walk the beach, hike the mountain...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Even your day off is jam-packed.  
**Choice: (8)**  I don't think we have that much time...  
`Tag 7`  
**Nozomi：**  
Heheh! Look at this! My perfect schedule!  
If we average one activity an hour...  
Huh? I forgot to add travel time?  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Nozomi：**  
It'll be fine!  
Besides, I don't know when my next day off will be.  
I wanna use this chance to do everything we can while we can!  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh?! I-is it raining?  
The play will be fine, but the beach, the mountains, the farm...  
  
**Choice: (10)**  We'll do those things next time.  
`Tag 10`  
**Nozomi：**  
Yeah... What a shame.  
Well, with the extra time... How about we go somewhere and chat?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Heheh. In the end, we didn't even make it to the play.  
We just spent the whole time talking.  
But I had a lot of fun!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Thank you for today, {player}.  
I didn't know what to expect from our practice date, but...  
It turned out to be a lot of fun!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Also...  
I got to see a lot of your good qualities.  
It made me realize just how little I knew about you...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? You also discovered things you like about me?  
I-I see... That's kinda sweet.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
All righty!  
I think I can write the lyrics to my love song now!  
I'll do my best. Thank you, {player}!  
  
**Narration：**  
A few days later—  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It's finished!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I think it turned out really good!  
\"Turn around, notice me, let me confess my feelings.\"  
It totally captures  
the experience of unrequited love!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
{player} should be here soon.  
I'll have him check it out right away.  
I can't wait!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? U-um...  
I'm going to show these lyrics... to him...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wait... isn't that, like...  
super embarrassing?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Why am I even writing about  
unrequited love in the first place?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Aah!  
{player}?  
Wh-what brings you here?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? Th-the lyrics?  
R-right, I promised to show you them today...  
But, um, well... They're... not finished yet.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
There's no way I can show them to him!  
  
**ナレーション：**  
In the end, Nozomi couldn't show {player}  
the lyrics for her new song.
