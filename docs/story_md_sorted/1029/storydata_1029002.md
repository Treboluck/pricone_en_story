**Nozomi：**  
Huh?  
That person over there looks familiar...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I thought so!  
Hey, {player}!  
What're you reading?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
What? One of my photobooks?  
What're you doing with that?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...What's that?  
You thought you'd familiarize yourself with idols?  
Wait, are you doing this for me?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I see... But that photobook has swimsuit shots in it as well.  
It's kinda embarrassing having someone I know see them.  
Look, on the very next page, there's a swimsuit—  
  
**Nozomi：**  
N-no, wait! Don't look!  
I was a little chubbier back then, so it's real embarrassing...  
That's it! I'm confiscating this!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ahh! All this talking's gonna make me late for work!  
I gotta run!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, right, are you free next week?  
I don't have plans  
for my upcoming day off.  
Do you wanna go somewhere together?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Are you sure? Great!  
It's a promise!  
  
**Narration：**  
One week later—  
  
**???：**  
Hey, {player}!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? Who am I? It's me, obviously! Nozomi!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
W-well, I guess it's not that obvious looking like this.  
Th-the truth is...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Um, I gained weight...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I ate a *little* too much and put on a *little* bit of weight...  
Then I ate a *little* more and put on a *little* bit more weight...  
After that, I kinda... you know... ate too much again.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Now I've put on too much weight, and it's embarrassing...  
 Thus, the suit of armor.  
It's a costume from a shoot I did before.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
If I cover up myself like this, I can walk around outside...  
But I can't stay like this forever.  
I've still got my idol work to do.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
If this keeps up... I'm gonna have to retire from being an idol!  
Oh, what do I do?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
What's that? I just need to lose some weight...?  
A diet, huh...  
Y-you're right! I can't give up before even trying!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You went and bought a book on dieting?  
Thanks!  
In that case, I'll try out a bunch of ideas!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Go for a run.  
**Choice: (2)**  Eat something.  
`Tag 1`  
**Nozomi：**  
*huff, puff*...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
So tired...  
Running in a full suit of armor... is tough.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It says running at high altitude makes for better exercise?  
True, I've heard it's good to train where the air is thin...  
All right, let's try that.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
*huff, puff*... *huff, puff*...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I-I'm exhausted... Running up this mountain path  
in full metal armor... I-I feel like I'm gonna die.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
N-now we're gonna run all the way to *that* mountain?  
*groans* O-okay, fine.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
*huff, puff*... *huff, puff*... *huff, puff*...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It's boiling hot!  
Climbing a volcano in full metal armor? You trying to kill me?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
The book says sweating will make me lose weight?  
Right, like being in a sauna...  
So let's just go to a sauna then!

`Tag 2`  
**Nozomi：**  
What're we doing in a restaurant?  
Isn't it a bad time to eat when I've just started my diet?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
An \"apple diet\"?  
Right! Apples are low in sugar, so they won't make me fat.  
It's what the dieting book says, so I guess it can't be wrong.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...I should also try out the \"banana diet,\" \"tofu diet,\"  
\"low-carb diet,\" and \"cake diet\"?  
O-okay, I'll give them a go.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
*munch, munch*...  
*munch, munch, munch, munch*...  
*munch, munch, munch, munch, munch, munch*...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ahhh, I'm stuffed...This should help me shed a few...  
Wait, of course it doesn't work like that!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Why didn't I realize sooner?!  
I just blindly go along with whatever you say...  
Anyway, let's try something different.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Swimming exercises your whole body, so it's perfect  
for weight loss? S-swimming?!  
I-I'm not sure about swimming in full metal armor...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
F-fine, okay! It's all for the sake of losing weight...  
Cannonball!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
*blub, blub, blub*... *cough*  
I-I'm sinking! H-hel—*blub, blub, blub*...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
*cough, cough*... Th-that was horrible...  
Maybe we shouldn't trust that book too much.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Nozomi：**  
*huff, puff*... *huff, puff*... *huff, puff*... *huff*...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I-I've ran, rock climbed, chopped down trees,  
and all while wearing full metal armor...  
I-I must've at least slimmed down a little...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You have.  
**Choice: (5)**  You look the same.  
`Tag 4`  
**Nozomi：**  
How can you even tell when I've still got on this armor!  
Seriously...  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Nozomi：**  
N-no way! After all that exercise!  
...It's not like the armor is gonna get any slimmer?  
Of course! You can't tell unless I take it off. Ahaha!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
T-take it off and show you?!  
D-dummy! Perv!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Nozomi：**  
Maybe I did lose weight...  
I can't see myself while wearing this thing.  
Hmm... Oh, maybe I can catch a glimpse through this gap.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hmm... Can't see very well.  
Maybe I can widen this gap a little.  
If I just pull here—  
  

---  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? Wha... Whaaat?!  
I pulled the wrong piece, and the whole thing fell apart!  
H-how embarrassing! Don't look at me!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wahhh!  
I can't believe you saw me this fat...  
Who's gonna wanna marry me now!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Y-you can't see any difference...?  
Of course you can!  
I've gained a whole kilo!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...I look just as cute as always?  
Do you really mean that?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I-I see.  
Then I guess I don't need to try so hard to—  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wait! D-did you just call me cute?!  
Uh, um... then... well!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...Mmm!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I-I-I'm gonna do my best to diet after all!  
Because... I only want you to see me at my cutest.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Nope, didn't say anything!  
I'm gonna go jogging!I-I'll be fine by myself!  
Just need a little me time!
