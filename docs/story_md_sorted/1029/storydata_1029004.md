**Narration：**  
On her day off, Nozomi invites {player}  
to spend the day together.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It's been a while since I had a day off!  
I can finally let loose.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
So let's go all out today, {player}!  
I'm sure we'll have an awesome time together!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, but let's not get too carried away.  
If I get recognized by any fans,  
that'll be it for my day off.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? What's the matter, {player}?  
Is there something over ther—  
  
**Nozomi：**  
U-urgh! Where's this light coming from?!  
I-it's so bright... Eeeeeek!  
  

---  
  
**Nozomi：**  
{player}!  
Over here! Hurry!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Sorry for calling you out of the blue!  
One of my work plans just got canceled.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I had some free time available,  
so I wanted to do something fun before my next gig.  
That's why I asked you to come!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
We don't have much time,  
but let's enjoy it as much as we can!  
Where would you like to go?  
  
**Passerby 1：**  
Whoa! Hey, look!  
On the big screen... It's Nozomi!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hm? What is it? Maybe the music show we just recorded?  
Or the trailer for my movie?  
  
**Presenter：**  
\"Popular idol Nozomi Sakurai's love interest revealed?!\"  
That's the headline for today's issue  
of the...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
The nerve of them!  
They're airing rumors about my love life!  
Eww, yuck!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It's all a bunch of nonsense, {player}!  
That's just me talking with one of my co-stars on set.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
The photo makes it look like it's only the two of us,  
but the whole crew was there.  
They'll have to issue a retraction soon enough.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You can't trust tabloids.  
They're filled with unfounded lies from cover to cover.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Like, if someone took a photo of you and me right now,  
they'd write something like  
\"Passionate romance with mystery man!\"  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I wouldn't mind that.  
**Choice: (2)**  That would be a problem.  
`Tag 1`  
**Nozomi：**  
N-no...?  
Ahaha. Now I feel kinda embarrassed.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Nozomi：**  
...A problem, huh?  
I get how you feel, but you don't have to be so harsh...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Nozomi：**  
Anyway, since we're just talking,  
I don't think anyone will be taking our photo—  
  
**Fan 1：**  
Hey, isn't that Nozomi?  
  
**Fan 2：**  
Wow! You're right!  
I am a *huge* fan!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, shoot!  
They've spotted us!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wh-what do we do?!  
More and more people are gathering around!  
  
**Fan 1：**  
Hey, who's that next to her?  
Doesn't look like he's her manager!  
  
**Fan 2：**  
Maybe it's... her boyfriend!  
  
**Fan 1：**  
What!  
Nozomi has a boyfriend?  
I'm so envi... angry!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
{player},  
let's just get out of here!  
Nothing we can say will help in this situation!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Here, let's go this way!  
Take my hand!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
*huff, puff*...  
I don't think they'll chase us all the way here.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I-I'm sorry.  
I was holding your hand the whole time  
 and dragging you along with me...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But I didn't have a choice.  
We had to get away from there.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
If they had turned that into a news story,  
I might not have been able to see you anymore...  
I don't want that.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh! Shoot!  
It's already time for my next appointment!  
We didn't get to do anything fun...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Sorry, {player}. I'll make it up to you next time! I promise!  
So let's hang out again soon!

**Ameth：**  
Okay. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Think of what you just saw as a dream of sorts.  
Chances are you'll forget everything the second you wake up,  
so no need to brood over it too much.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That said, Nozomi has it tough...  
When you're that popular, you can't even walk around normally.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Over \"there\" and of course, over \"here\"...  
Nozomi is everyone's idol,  
so you'd best be careful.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Pay special care not to do anything that gets in the way  
of Nozomi's idol activities.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, that's enough for today.  
Catch you later. ♪

**Nozomi：**  
*yawn*  
Huh? Where am I?  
Did I fall asleep?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I had a weird dream...  
Wonder what that was all about.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
We were together,  
and my fans mistook you for my boyfriend.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
What? You had the same dream?  
Wow, how strange.  
Maybe it was a special dream.  
Like a prophecy or—  
  
**Passerby 1：**  
Ah! It's Nozomin!  
  
**Passerby 2：**  
Hey! There's a dude next to her!  
Don't tell me that's her boyfriend!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh!?  
Th-the dream really did come true!  
{player}, let's run!  
  
**Narration：**  
The two locked hands and frantically ran away.
