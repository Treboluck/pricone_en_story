**Pecorine：**  
Whew,  
the Lord of the Mountain was tough.  
I wasn't expecting that!  
  
**Karyl：**  
\"I wasn't expecting that!\"  
Are you kidding me?!  
What in the world was that thing?!  
A frog? A lizard? Or just a really nasty monster?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Easy, easy. Whatever it was, we beat it and got our hands on  
the Ultimate Egg. Everything turned out fine in the end!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Is it really safe to eat such a terrifying creature's egg?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We won't know unless we try!  
*chew* Mm-mmm!  
Dif if crathy goob!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Eww. She actually ate it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This is unbelievable!  
I don't even know if there  
are words to describe how delicious this is!  
You guys absolutely have to try some. Eat, eat!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Very well... *chomp* Mmm. What a full-bodied,  
savory aroma and flavor.  
It's the definition of delectable.  
My lord, I'm sure you'll enjoy it, too.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Uhh... W-well,  
I suppose I could at least try a bite.  
Mmph.  
Whoa, this is awesome!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yay, Karyl ate with all of us!  
You're so cute when you drop the facade and just be yourself.  
That's our Karyl!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, knock it off! Quit patting my head!  
Don't treat me like a child!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What's most important is that everyone came through  
today's food-tasting tour stop safe and sound.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Since we have been graced with this food,  
let's all take a moment to savor our brief luncheon respite.
