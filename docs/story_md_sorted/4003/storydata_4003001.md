{player} and the Gourmet Guild travel to the remote Cloudtop Peak which Pecorine claims is home to rare ingredients. Karyl complains while Kokkoro encourages her. Together, the four aim to conquer this uncharted land!
  
## Subtitle: Climb Cloudtop Peak!
  
**Pecorine：**  
C'mon, everyone! Hurry it up!  
We can finally see it from here! The uncharted land  
that appears in all sorts of legends!  
* Cloudtop Peak!*  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oof.  
Miss Pecorine, please don't stop short like that.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The road here is very narrow.  
If you lose your balance even a bit,  
you'll fall head over heels off the edge of the cliff.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oops! I'm sorry.  
I'm just really fired up,  
and I wanted to share the excitement with everyone right away!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
There is no need to apologize.  
But we are a long way from Landosol,  
and almost no one lives out here.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If someone falls off the cliff and gets hurt so badly they  
can't move, or if we get stranded, there will be no one  
around to help.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We could shout at the top of our lungs, and no one would hear.  
This place would become our grave.  
I just think we should place more importance on our safety.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Got it.  
I'm sorry. Charging ahead on my own is one of my bad habits.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Again, there's no need to apologize.  
I admire how bright and cheerful you always are,  
and the way you propel us all forward, Miss Pecorine.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aww, Kokkoro!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey...  
Sorry to interrupt the mutual admiration society,  
but slow down. Can't we take a break?  
  
**Karyl：**  
You two are ridiculously energetic. Those of us who aren't  
used to hoofing it up mountains are getting pretty annoyed  
back here. My legs feel like jelly! I wanna go home!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh dear. Miss Karyl and my lord  
fell way behind at some point.  
Please do hurry on over here, the view is magnificent.

**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
That mountain off in the distance is the one they call  
Cloudtop Peak, correct?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yup!  
It's one of many uncharted regions in this world, and  
it's said to be the highest point in all of Astraea! It's so  
crazy tall, the summit's actually higher than the clouds!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, no wonder they call it Cloudtop Peak, then.  
I imagine that as one approaches the summit,  
it would feel just like walking atop the clouds.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Exactly!  
That's our Kokkoro. You're sharp as a tack!  
Atta girl!

**Karyl：**  
*wheeze* *pant*  
F-finally caught up...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm so done.  
I feel like I'm gonna throw in the towel by the time  
we get to this so-called Cloudtop Peak.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl, {player}, you're so out of shape!  
Shame, shame. You two need to train harder!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, clam it. You can't expect a mage to have that kind of stamina!  
Anyway, Pecorine, yours is off the charts, so you don't surprise  
me. I'm impressed you're keeping up, Koro.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
I spent a lot of time walking around the mountains  
back in my hometown.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah? Can't judge a book by its cover, I guess.  
By the way...  
I know it's kinda late to be asking, but, uhh, why exactly are  
we subjecting ourselves to this grueling adventure?  
  
**Karyl：**  
We're the Gourmet Guild.  
We just walk around sampling different foods, right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Tsk, tsk, tsk!  
Why do we want to climb the mountain?  
Because there are ingredients there!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
There's supposedly at least one rare and valuable ingredient  
up there on Cloudtop Peak!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We'll get our hands on it one way or another.  
Then we’ll enjoy a one-of-a-kind meal together!  
That's my plan for this adventure!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hee hee hee.  
In the end, we'll all gather 'round the table and  
have a great time, like always!  
  
**Karyl：**  
The table... It feels like it's light-years away!  
We didn't have to bother searching for a priceless ingredient.  
I would've been fine with a five-minute fast-food restaurant...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Heh. I'd expect there to be lots of treasure hidden in these  
uncharted lands. Perhaps that could motivate you.  
I know you love everything that glitters, Miss Karyl.  
  
**Karyl：**  
*sigh* Hey, wait. Cloudtop Peak's supposed to be unexplored,  
right? How can you be so sure there are treasures and rare  
ingredients and stuff up there?  
  
**Karyl：**  
The last thing I want is for us to risk our lives to  
get up that mountain, only to find nothing!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl, stop complaining  
and use your hunger, or greed, or something to fuel you!  
Let's summit this sucker! Up, up, and away!  
  
**Karyl：**  
She's bouncier than a beach ball... I just don't get it.  
Why is she so quick to risk her life just for food?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, regardless, I'm totally exhausted. Can't I just use  
magic to fly once around the peak? If it's just ingredients  
we're after, we shouldn't need to go up to the summit.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, I wouldn't recommend that.  
For whatever reason, people have witnessed many monsters  
and Shadows roaming uncharted regions.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No one ventures out here, so the monsters have been growing  
unchecked. If you start zooming around, you'll attract a swarm  
of winged beasts. Then *you'll* be the rare treat!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In other words, there are no shortcuts.  
Miss Karyl, I'm afraid you'll have to resign yourself to  
climbing up the old-fashioned way.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Couldn't have said it better myself!  
Ahh, I can't wait! I wonder what kind of ingredients  
are up there waiting for us to claim them!  
  
**Karyl：**  
*groan*  
I just wanna get home in one piece!
