# Dungeon Episode 7
Pecorine shows up a bit late to the guild's latest remote destination—Tideborne Tower. Apparently, she was underwater undoing all the locks and barriers. Together the four face still another uncharted land!
  
## Subtitle: Top Tideborne Tower!
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Err... Ahem.  
We now begin chapter four of the Gourmet Guild's  
worldwide food-tasting tour.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Or at least, we were supposed to.  
This is strange. Miss Pecorine is nowhere to be found.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
She always keeps her word,  
so I doubt she is late or had to scrub the journey.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Scrub?  
You use the weirdest words sometimes.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm?  
Is that an odd way to say it?  
Speaking like city people still gives me trouble.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's all good, as long as you get your point across.  
Anyways, seriously, where the heck is Pecorine?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Maybe we shouldn't have planned to meet at the tower itself.  
You think she got lost?  
Or maybe attacked by monsters?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please don't say such foreboding things.  
Of course, Miss Pecorine is so strong, she could obliterate  
almost any monster foolish enough to come after her.  
  
**Karyl：**  
She's unconscionably strong.  
It's been a huge problem for me, too.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Huh?  
Miss Karyl, sometimes you say things  
that I find very difficult to interpret.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hello! Heyas, everyone!  
I'm really sorry I got here so late!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Sorry, huh? You call us all the way out here, and you have  
the nerve to be late?! Where have you been? What were  
you doing?  
And why are you soaking wet?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't tell me you swam out here?  
You're really something else.  
I didn't want to waste time,  
so I used my magic to fly over in one jump.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*chuckle* My lord and I came by boat. It was a bit trying  
because my lord got rather seasick. The seas in this area  
are terribly rough. Our boat was tossed about the whole time.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, umm...  
I came by boat too, but I had to take care of a few  
things before we'd be able to take on the tower.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The entrance to today's uncharted land—Tideborne Tower—  
won't even open unless you go through the proper steps.  
I got here early so I could knock that stuff out first!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It was a such a pain. I had to swim through underwater  
ruins to hit a bunch of switches in the right order,  
within a time limit, all in one breath!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But it's no big deal. I wanted to get all that annoying stuff  
out of the way so we'd have more time to search for food!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Geez. You really pull out all the stops when it comes to food.  
It's actually kinda remarkable. Although it does make our lives  
easier now that you cleared the way for us.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
However, if possible, please don't try to solo everything. Ask  
us for help, too.  
We're all part of the Gourmet Guild. It's  
only fair that we all share some of the burden.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yeah, but since Karyl's always moaning and groaning and  
whining and complaining, I figured I'd just take anything even  
remotely troublesome out of the equation.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, you didn't have to.  
All this happy-go-lucky exploring  
uncharted lands, getting to try out never-before-tasted foods  
and ingredients... It's not the worst thing.  
  
**Karyl：**  
From now on, no more sneaking around just to placate us.  
We face whatever challenges await us as one!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Great!  
But I doubt we'll have time to discuss our next trip.  
Tideborne Tower's full of lethal traps that've slain thousands.  
If you so much as blink at the wrong moment, you're toast!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But on the top floor awaits a miraculous delicacy that the  
gods themselves prefer above all other food! When He descends to dine  
on it, apocalyptic natural disasters happen everywhere!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Okay. We're on a food-tasting tour, right? This place sounded  
dangerous enough *before* the potential for mortal blasphemy.  
Sorry, I changed my mind. Can I go home?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Nope! You said going around with us wasn't the worst thing.  
We all heard you loud and clear, Karyl. I was really happy  
to hear you say so, by the way!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
C'mon! It's time for another fun-filled day of sampling the  
yummiest foods the world has to offer. Together, as a guild!
