# Dungeon Episode 12
By pulling a thorn from the dragon's tail, the party succeeds in subduing its violent behavior, but the tip of the tail comes off with the thorn, so Pecorine immediately starts grilling it up as usual. Though openly incredulous, Karyl doesn't pass up the chance to dig in.

**Karyl：**  
*pant*... *pant*... I can't believe we seriously had to fight a dragon...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This nasty thorn was stuck in its tail.  
The pain must have been driving it crazy!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait—forget the thorn, you've pulled off half the tail...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Will the dragon be all right...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Well, I guess it will be?  
Dragons are basically just big lizards,  
and they're full of vitality, so they can probably grow back a tail or two.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And this completes our job for Karin!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...I've gotta say, you're in weirdly high spirits.  
I figured you'd be depressed that the dragon got away...  
Wait, what are you doing?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? Well... first we've got to slice it up, right?  
Man, I can't wait to taste this dragon meat!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, you mean the dragon tail that came off with the thorn.  
Will it be safe for consumption, I wonder?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Of course it isn't safe!  
Hey, stop that! What are you doing?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We can't let perfectly good meat go to waste, Karyl! ♪  
Hm-hm-hmmm~! ♪ Tasty dragon meat! Juicy dragon meat!  
Hot and steaming dragon meat to eat~! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Now, Karyl! You too, Kokkoro!  
It may just be the tip, but it's still pretty big!  
Let's have ourselves a meaty feast together!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm not eating that stuff!  
The tip of the tail can't be tasty...  
And hang on, isn't that meat still wriggling?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That just means it's fresh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Its scent is like nothing I have ever smelled...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm gonna keep on cooking!  
We just had tons of exercise, so it'll taste even better!  
You must both be hungry too, right?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...*gulp*  
Miss Pecorine, please allow me to assist you.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Uh, Koro? Don't tell me you're...?!  
Come to your senses, girl!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aww~! Aren't you gonna join us, Karyl...?  
After we all worked hard together to get this meat...  
  
**Karyl：**  
W-well, I...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Look at it grilling to perfection!  
The meat's delicate fibers are springy and soft at the same time...  
This can't be anything but delectable!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Gahhh! All right, already! If it'll shut you up, I'll eat it!  
Koro, fetch some plates so I can serve it properly!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Of course. I will bring them at once.  
  
**Karyl：**  
What is this? What the heck *is* this?!  
Urgh, I don't wanna admit it...  
 I can't stop wolfing it down...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This meat's taste is incomparable, Miss Pecorine!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It was worth all the trouble!  
And I couldn't have done it without both of you!  
Keep eating as much as you like!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You say that, but you've eaten ten times as much as us...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
With this, our latest food-tasting tour  
 is a huge success!  
I can't wait to see what ingredients we'll find next time!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. Miss Pecorine, your enthusiasm is infectious.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait, did you say \"food-tasting tour\"?!  
I knew you just came for the meat!  
What happened to this being a job from Karin?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hey, I wasn't lying about the job!  
We got to help people, earn rewards, and eat tasty meat on top of it all!  
What better job for the Gourmet Guild?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Magnificently planned, Miss Pecorine.  
  
**Karyl：**  
*sigh*... Well, I guess I'll keep helping with your mad schemes.  
But can we do a quest that *doesn't* almost kill us next time?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Sure!  
 I'll ask Karin to keep that in mind!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I *knew* you and Karin were in cahoots on this!  
Gahhh! Pecoriiiiine!
