**Pecorine：**  
Dun-da-na-naaaa! We're back, everybody!  
We're totally keeping this going! Chapter two of the Gourmet  
Guild's worldwide food-tasting tour starts now!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
How crazy is that? I'm already raring to go!  
And why wouldn't I be? The meat we got last time on  
Cloudtop Peak was so good, I'm still dreaming about it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Boy, I wonder what unique delicacies we'll eat this time?  
I can't wait to get my hands on them!  
Oh, geez. My mouth's watering already...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hee hee. I even forced myself to only have a light  
dinner last night, so I'd have plenty of room for today's treat.  
My stomach's been growling nonstop!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*chuckle*  
Miss Pecorine, I think one of your light dinners  
would be enough to feed me for a week.  
  
**Karyl：**  
No, no, no! I don't wanna go!  
Are you all nuts? Why would you want to repeat the same mistakes?  
Didn't you learn *anything* from the disaster that was Cloudtop Peak?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahahaha. Yeah, we got attacked by a lot of Shadows and what  
not, didn't we? I was pretty sure we were gonna die.  
You know,  
I really hate Shadows. You can't even eat them.  
  
**Karyl：**  
*sigh* And to top it off, they weren't like the  
Shadows that appear in town.  
I couldn't control them with my powers at all.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm?  
What... powers, Miss Karyl?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, uhh. Nothing. Just mumbling to myself over here.  
  
**Karyl：**  
As I was saying. This uncharted land is totally gonna be  
every bit as dangerous as the last one. So I'm going home.  
Don't get me involved in another one of these disasters!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? But it's right there in front of us now!  
Stop throwing a tantrum and get moving.  
Let's stay on target and smash through this one!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Remember, a never-before-tasted gourmet delicacy awaits!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This uncharted land, \"Deepwood Oak,\"  
is supposed to be where the most delicious fruit  
in the world grows!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's the big rumor going around in the foodie circles.  
Oh, I can't wait to sink my teeth into some...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Now come on, stop complaining and keep up, Karyl!  
Go, go, go!  
Our worldwide food tour has only just begun!  
  
**Karyl：**  
No...  
This is no food tour.  
This is a deadly expedition of uncharted lands!
