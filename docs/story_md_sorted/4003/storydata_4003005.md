## Subtitle: Up Sheercliff Ruins!
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ta-daaa! The third stop on the Gourmet Guild's worldwide  
food-tasting tour begins now!  
Let's go to Kokkoro for her  
commentary and analysis. Your thoughts, Kokkoro?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
H-huh? You're putting me on the spot... What do you mean  
by commentary and analysis? Should I discuss what I  
know about this uncharted land?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Let's see.  
Today, we have come to the *Sheercliff Ruins*.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
These mysterious ruins seem to cling to the edge of a steep  
cliffside that formed from a massive volcanic eruption.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
They appear to be the remnants of a long-dead ancient  
civilization.  
Due to the surrounding cliffs being so  
unstable, archaeologists have been unable to explore them.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So, why go to such a place on our uncharted lands circuit?  
It seems a very odd choice for what is ostensibly  
a food-tasting tour.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
There is the potential that a long-lost recipe could be hidden  
somewhere within. My theory is that Miss Pecorine believes  
that to be the case, and we are here to find it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yup! You did a great job! I love how you took that totally  
seriously and did your best to come up with all that,  
even  
though you could've just brushed me off.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm.  
Sometimes you say things that confuse me,  
so I worry about whether or not I'm responding appropriately.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aww, don't overthink things.  
Just go with the flow and everything'll be fine.  
  
**Karyl：**  
............  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What's up?  
Everything okay, Karyl? You seem down.  
Are you hungry?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Have no fear! We'll cruise through these ruins, find the  
secret recipe, buy ingredients on the way home,  
and restore the ancient delicacies to their former glory!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Endure the hunger for now. I promise we'll be stuffing  
ourselves silly when this is over. I bet it'll be a meal we  
never forget!  
After all, they say hunger is the best spice!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Enough with the chit-chat. Let's do this.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh! You're actually motivated for once!  
Of course, you're a foodie at heart, too.  
  
**Karyl：**  
This time's gonna be different. I'm fully prepared. No matter  
what kinda ridiculous place this uncharted land ends up being,  
I'll survive. I've trained every single day since last time.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I *will* live through this.  
I refuse to die on such a stupid adventure.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yikes. Karyl, your eyes are glazed over.  
Don't be so  
gloomy! Everyone should have a smile on their face at mealtime.  
If you're in a bad mood, your food won't taste good!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, clam it!  
I don't wanna die, that's all!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I can't take this anymore!  
Aren't food-tasting tours supposed to be fun? And peaceful?  
Why do we have to risk our necks every single time?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hahaha! Because to eat is to live.  
Our lives are always on the line!
