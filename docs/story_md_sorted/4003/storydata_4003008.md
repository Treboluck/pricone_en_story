# Dungeon Episode 8
The gang has overcome the traps of Tideborne Tower and found the delicacy that \"God Himself prefers above all other food.\" A sudden crack of thunder that sounds suspiciously like divine wrath sends them hurrying home.

**Pecorine：**  
Whew. Tideborne Tower's even more perilous than they say! I  
think there were more land mines than regular floor tiles. One  
wrong step and we would've been blown to bits!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But somehow, we managed to get to the top.  
All's well that ends well!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*chuckle*  
We've all gotten rather used to walking harsh roads  
on our eating tour.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
More importantly, is the food still safe?  
We got buffeted so  
hard by all those bomb blasts and shockwaves. I've been worried  
about it.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's fine. I've got it well protected with magic.  
They say God prefers this above all other food, huh?  
I can't wait to see what it tastes like!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Umm... I feel like the way the clouds are rolling in is kind of  
unnatural. You think maybe God's a little miffed we snatched  
His favorite food? Listen to that thunder rumble!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? No way. It's gotta be a coincidence.  
I thought it was just a legend, not like, *GOD* God. Right?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A-at any rate, we should probably get out of here.  
After all the hard work it took to best this uncharted land,  
I'd rather not see it end with us being smited by divine wrath.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Never! I refuse to die until I've tasted that miracle food!  
Everybody run for it!  
Hurry, hurry, hurry! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Good lord, it never ends. Can't we just walk around trying  
out different food stands and street vendors  
like normal people?
