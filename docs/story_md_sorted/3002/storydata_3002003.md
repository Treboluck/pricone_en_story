**Matsuri：**  
Wheeeew!  
Today's training was super tough!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
My whole body's tingling and aching all over!  
Yeesh, Tomo, how do you look so unbothered?  
You were doing at least twice as much training as me!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
You're so cool! I wanna be like you!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahaha... Well, thank you.  
Really, I'm just used to it.  
My parents run a dojo, you see...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Besides, you're still younger than me,  
so your physical strength is naturally lower.  
  
**Tomo：**  
To be honest, I'm impressed by how hard you train.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Most kids your age are happy to rely on their parents.  
But you face the harsh Nightmare training regime,  
and never once think of giving up.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eheh! I'm proud of my physical abilities!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
My body's always been tougher than average!  
I've barely ever even caught a cold!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So I don't think I really need any of those vaccinations...  
I'd never let some measly little virus beat me!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Now, now.  
You can't skip out on vaccinations.  
  
**Tomo：**  
In places like Landosol, where the population is gathered  
within the city walls, infections spread all too easily.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Even if they don't harm you personally,  
you could pass on the virus to others,  
infecting people who aren't as lucky as you.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Preventative vaccinations play an important role  
in keeping the whole city's population safe.  
  
**Tomo：**  
If you're scared of the injections, I'll go with you  
and hold your hand while they do the deed!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Urghhh...  
 I'll... hold you to that one.  
I mean, not that I'm scared of injections!  
But just... to make sure, y'know?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Yes, yes...  
Your wish is my command, mademoiselle.  
  
**Tomo：**  
...Hmm?  
Hold on—is there a commotion at the palace?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hey, you're right! Something's off!  
There's nobody by the palace gate, where Captain Jun always stands!  
And, uh, are those shouts and clattering sounds I hear?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
D-did something big happen?  
Like bandits or monsters defeated Jun and invaded the palace?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmm... If that really happened, it would be a national incident.  
Captain Jun is the palace's ultimate line of defense, after all.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'll go and confirm the situation.  
Matsuri, you get yourself somewhere safe.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Heck no—I'm going with you!  
I may be just an apprentice,  
but I'm still a member of Nightmare!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
And heroes can't run away from the scene of an emergency!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmmm...  
I can't waste time convincing you,  
 so all right. Let's go.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I don't know if I'll be able to protect you,  
so you really should run if things go south.  
At times, withdrawal can be the best strategy.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Let's hurry, Matsuri.  
Ordinarily, only nobles are allowed inside the palace,  
but this is hardly the time for that. It's an emergency.  
  
**Tomo：**  
If we get in trouble for it later,  
we'll just have to write an apology.  
...Now, let's move!  
  
**Royal Knight A：**  
Which way did the intruder go?!  
  
**Royal Knight B：**  
This way!  
Hurry up! We can't let them escape!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hey!  
What's going on?!  
  
**Royal Knight B：**  
...Hmm?  
Why, you... What is a commoner doing inside the palace?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Is this really the time for that?  
That old rule was starting to get old-fashioned anyway.  
  
**Tomo：**  
More to the point, what exactly happened here?  
  
**Royal Knight B：**  
Well...  
It seems an unidentified intruder  
has infiltrated the palace interior.  
  
**Royal Knight A：**  
This is completely unprecedented...  
The interior isn't as heavily guarded,  
so we're having trouble pinning the rogue down.  
  
**Royal Knight A：**  
I suppose this constitutes an emergency.  
I'll allow the two of you to join the capture operation.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Understood.  
The palace defenses are heavily reliant on Jun, after all...  
If an intruder gets past her, there's not much left to stop them.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Speaking of the captain, do you know where she might be?  
I can hardly imagine she would go down without a fight...  
  
**Royal Knight A：**  
I wish I knew.  
She's as loyal and upstanding as they come,  
so I can't imagine she'd have left her station...  
  
**Royal Knight A：**  
We can only assume the intruder must have knocked her out  
and concealed her somewhere nearby.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
No way...  
No intruder could defeat Captain Jun!  
She's an invincible hero!  
  
**Royal Knight A：**  
I'd like to agree, but we have to assume the worst right now.  
  
**Royal Knight A：**  
For the moment, we're diverting most of our forces  
to evacuating Her Majesty and the rest of the palace VIPs.  
  
**Royal Knight B：**  
So your task is to hunt down the intruder.  
I won't expect you to defeat them, but at least try to  
buy some time until we complete the evacuation.  
  
**Royal Knight B：**  
Surely even new recruits like yourselves  
can handle that much?  
  
**Tomo：**  
If that's the mission, by all means. We'll fulfill our duty.  
...Though I don't think I'm so weak as to be looked down on  
by knights who've never seen combat.  
  
**Tomo：**  
But this isn't the time for arguments.  
I'll prove my own competence by completing the task at hand.  
  
**Tomo：**  
...Come on, Matsuri.  
I can hear the sounds of combat nearby.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
R-right!  
Ahhhh, I'm getting nervous!  
I'm shaking with anticipation!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha.  
This is hardly the same as exterminating monsters  
or patrolling the city like usual, after all.  
  
**Tomo：**  
But you know, defending the palace, the seat of our government,  
is the core of our official duties.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Let's face this crisis with pride, and fulfill our mission.  
We pledged our lives to the throne, so even if we fall,  
we fall with honor.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Not that I intend to die today.  
To be honest... There's a part of me that's always  
been waiting for a crisis like this.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I didn't hone my skills for all these years  
to spend my days on nothing but training and paperwork.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahahah!  
Isn't this fun?! My heart is aflame!  
This is what I have always longed for!  
  
**Christina：**  
Now, my nemesis!  
Show me the passion that binds our fates in blood! ☆  
  
**???：**  
...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Christina!  
Are you all right?! I'm here to help!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Is this the intruder?  
Who in the world is she?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah! Stay out of my way, girl!  
If you interrupt my festivities, I'll send you to the next life first of all!  
  
**Tomo：**  
This is no time to enjoy yourself!  
  
**Tomo：**  
This is the throne room, right? The palace's innermost sanctum...  
Even just allowing an intruder to reach Her Majesty's chamber  
is shameful beyond measure!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Our duty now is to eliminate the foe swiftly, and redeem  
a little of the shame we've brought upon ourselves!  
  
**Christina：**  
You certainly are passionate as ever.  
How adorable!  
  
**Christina：**  
Still, how troublesome.  
This seems to have blown all out of proportion.  
What now? They're calling you a foul intruder... my dear!  
  
**???：**  
...  
  
**???：**  
Umm...  
You're wrong. I am not an intruder. D-do you not recognize me?  
  
**Tomo：**  
I have no words for you, villain!  
Face me now! I'll take your head clean off your shoulders!  
  
**???：**  
Whoa-oa-oa...  
That's enough, Tomo!  
Are you in such a frenzy that you can't hear my voice?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Silence!  
No villain has the right to address me like a friend!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wait!  
Tomo, stop!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Whaaa?!  
Hey—you can't just leap at me out of nowhere...  
...Matsuri?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I mean it! You've gotta calm yourself down!  
You can't try to fight this woman! I know you'll regret it!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Huh? What do you mean?  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahahahah!  
Oh, how entertaining!  
  
**Christina：**  
But I suppose all good things must end.  
Causing such a great commotion in the palace,  
we may even have angered our monarch herself.  
  
**Christina：**  
...{player}! Show yourself!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Huh?  
Hang on... {player}?!  
What are you doing here?  
  
**Christina：**  
Hahah.  
You recall I recently started a business  
selling premium delicacies to the nobility?  
  
**Christina：**  
Well, since then...  
{player} has been helping me  
with the day-to-day operations.  
  
**Christina：**  
He's a hard worker, and has a surprising number of connections.  
  
**Christina：**  
So I called him to the Nightmare guard station today  
to talk business with him.  
  
**Christina：**  
And while he was here, I had him help me with a little prank!  
  
**Christina：**  
{player}, return the helmet to our captain.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Huh? Captain...?  
But then... Huh?  
Are you saying you're actually Captain Jun?

**Jun：**  
Y-yes.  
Please don't stare so much, Tomo.  
I embarrass easily.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ahhh! I knew you had to be the captain!  
I use a magical record of Captain Jun's voice  
as my wake-up alarm every morning, y'know!  
  
**Tomo：**  
H-huh?  
The intruder... was Jun?  
  
**Tomo：**  
What's going on, Christina?!  
Explain yourself properly!  
  
**Christina：**  
Try using your head a little, girl.  
Didn't I just say? It was a simple prank.  
  
**Christina：**  
Lately, I have been assisting the captain  
by taking over her guard duties occasionally.  
  
**Christina：**  
Well, to be precise, I can't bear standing by the gates all day,  
so I have my subordinates do it for me.  
  
**Christina：**  
Today, just before the time came to change the guard,  
the captain entered the shower room to wash herself,  
so I took the opportunity to seize her helmet.  
  
**Christina：**  
I gave it to {player},  
with instructions to conceal himself...  
  
**Christina：**  
And then I pursued the captain around the palace,  
telling the other knights that she was an intruder.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Wh-why would you pull such a pointless prank?  
  
**Christina：**  
I was interested to see what lay under that helmet.  
Haven't you ever wondered about it?  
  
**Christina：**  
This stick-in-the-mud never takes it off for anyone,  
going on about her family code or what-have-you.  
So... It's only natural to be curious.  
  
**Christina：**  
Still, I wasn't expecting the other knights to get so scared.  
They were so entertaining to watch,  
I may have allowed myself  
to get a little carried away.  
  
**Christina：**  
\"If you want your helmet back, you'll have to defeat me first!\"  
I told her, and led her on a merry chase.  
  
**Christina：**  
I was hoping to get her angry,  
so she might really try her utmost to kill me.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ordinarily, she seems to think of me as a comrade,  
and always holds back on me...  
So I longed for the chance to take her on for real.  
  
**Christina：**  
And I suppose I wasn't entirely unsuccessful.  
Ahh, that rampage was a whole lot of fun!  
You've left me satisfied. Thank you kindly, Captain!

`image display end`  
**Jun：**  
Never mind that...  
Please... return my helmet...  
  
**Jun：**  
Y-young man.  
Bring it here, would you now?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ahaha!  
Captain Jun's gone all fidgety!  
Is showing your real face really so embarrassing?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
You've got a beautiful face, so don't worry about it!  
  
**Jun：**  
B-by my standards, this is one step short of being naked...  
  
**Jun：**  
My face has always been hidden since birth,  
and I have never shown it to anyone but my family...  
  
**Jun：**  
P-please don't stare...  
  
**Jun：**  
Aarghh... Please don't do anything like this again.  
I will really get angry next time, Chris.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah.  
Have you forgotten that was my intention?  
  
**Christina：**  
But it pains me to torment you too much,  
so I suppose I shall withdraw for now.  
  
**Christina：**  
And Captain...  
You should try conditioning your hair.  
It's a shame to let your beauty go to waste.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hahahah.  
Next time, we should dress up together and go on a date!  
  
**Jun：**  
I think not.  
I'm quite happy remaining a plain old armored guard...  
  
**Jun：**  
I won't claim I have no interest in fashion,  
but I would be far too embarrassed...  
  
**Jun：**  
At any rate...  
Could you really return my helmet now?  
  
**Jun：**  
I hear the sound of several footsteps approaching...  
Could the other knights of Nightmare  
have come to defeat the so-called \"intruder\"?  
  
**Jun：**  
I-if I were to allow my face to be seen by all of my subordinates,  
the embarrassment might kill me.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah.  
You should flaunt it with pride!  
Your looks are nothing to be ashamed of!  
  
**Christina：**  
If your men learned what a beauty their captain is,  
it might give them quite the morale boost!  
  
**Jun：**  
Urghh...  
 Chris, stay right where you are.  
I'll make you pay for this entire incident.  
And you're not getting off with a mere pay cut or confinement.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ooh, how scary. Perhaps I provoked her a step too far...  
I'd rather not be subjected to endless lecturing,  
so I think I'll take my leave!  
  
**Christina：**  
Adios, my beloved captain!  
And of course, my merry comrades of Nightmare!  
Ahahahah! ☆  
  
**Jun：**  
Ahh! Wait!  
No running, you maniac!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahaha...  
I've told you enough times, Captain.  
That Christina was always going to go too far sooner or later.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Are you sure it isn't best to exile her already?  
  
**Jun：**  
Ahhh...  
But just now,  
Chris called us her \"comrades,\" did she not?  
  
**Jun：**  
Little by little, I think she may be growing closer to us.  
  
**Jun：**  
If she becomes a true comrade whom we can trust...  
I feel certain she will be an unparalleled asset.  
  
**Jun：**  
For that sake, I would prefer to overlook her mischief,  
in hopes of a brighter future.  
  
**Jun：**  
I can't say for sure that I will not regret my decision someday...  
But for now, this is the path I feel drawn to.  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha...  
Perhaps Chris was right about me,  
and I really am too soft...  
  
**Narration：**  
Just as Jun said those words with a faint smile,  
the other knights of Nightmare finally arrived on the scene.  
  
**Narration：**  
The revelation that their captain was a beautiful woman  
certainly improved the morale in their ranks...  
  
**Narration：**  
But Jun herself was so paralyzed with embarrassment  
that she didn't come to work for a week.
