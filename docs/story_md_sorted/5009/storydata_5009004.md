# Of Songs and Family
{player}, Kurumi, and Nozomi run to Ayane's side, only to find Chika chewing on Pukichi like an infant. Ayane herself is distressed over the fact that Pukichi won't speak anymore, causing Nozomi to hold a concert of sorts to settle everyone down.

**Kurumi：**  
Ayane!  
A-are you okay?!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Kurumi! Help!  
Pukichi's gonna be eaten alive!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh...?  
Waugh! Chika's biting right into him!  
  
**Chika：**  
*munch, munch* ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I'd say it's more like she's... getting a taste of it?  
What's the deal, Chika? Are you hungry?  
Even after devouring a few people's worth of food?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Listen up. Idols need to be careful about what they eat! And you  
can't even digest that thing in the first place! It's probably  
covered in bacteria too, so you'll make yourself extra sick!  
  
**Ayane：**  
He is *not* covered in bacteria!  
I put him in the washi—  
Er, we take baths together now and then!  
Also! He's not a \"thing\"! He's my precious family!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oops. Sorry about that.  
Guess it's normal for kids to consider  
stuffed animals part of the family.  
  
**Ayane：**  
He's not a stuffed animal!  
He's my friend! My family! My real  
mom and dad gave him to me so that I wouldn't be lonely!  
  
**Ayane：**  
He'd always talk to me and cheer me up when I was down!  
He'd use his soft, fluffy hands to wipe away  
my tears whenever I cried!  
  
**Ayane：**  
\"Don't cry, Ayane. Tomorrow'll be a great day for sure.\"  
\"You're too pretty to be crying, Ayane.\"  
That's the sort of stuff he'd always say.  
  
**Ayane：**  
But now he won't talk to me! Not a peep!  
Why? Why can't I hear his voice?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Were my fake mom and dad right? Were the doctors right?  
Is it normal for me to not be able to hear him?  
Was it all in my head this whole time?  
  
**Ayane：**  
No! He's alive! He can talk!  
I can hear him!  
Well, I *could* hear him... But now he won't talk to me!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wh-what's going on here?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I'm not sure myself....  
Can you calm down for me, Ayane?  
It'll be okay.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You've got me. And {player}, too.  
Your family'll always be here with you,  
so there's no need to feel lonely. There, there. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Waaahhh! Kurumiii!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ahaha. Look at them go.  
I bet they're always looking out for each other like this.  
Honestly? I'm kind of jealous.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
That said, I'm sure Carmina can reach this point one day. It might  
take a while, but I just know our bonds will grow as time goes by.  
We'll laugh together. Cry together. Just like a real family!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Chika! That's enough naughty business from you!  
Pukichi,  
was it?  
He's Ayane's precious family!  
How can you call yourself an idol if you're making kids cry?!  
  
**Chika：**  
Unhhh?  
  
**Chika：**  
*sob*  
Waaahhh!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh?! H-hey, why're you crying?  
Sorry! I didn't mean to sound that harsh!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
And I'm sorry for always acting so conceited! Really!  
Forgive me! My knowledge as an idol is all I've got, though!  
I just want to make sure I'm conveying it properly.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Nozomi!  
You need to hug and reassure her!  
Just like this. ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Yup. Just like this.  
`Tag 1`  
**Nozomi：**  
And why are you joining in  
like it's normal, {player}?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I get it. You're family, so there are no ill intentions.  
But just remember that she's a young, impressionable girl.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh? Did he do something wrong?  
It's normal for {player} to hug us  
and give us headpats...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Okay. Let's leave that discussion for another time.  
As for now... Chika! I'm so sorry for shouting at you!  
I'll give you a nice, big hug, so stop crying for me!  
There, there. ♪  
  
**Chika：**  
Mmm...  
*purr* Weh?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Have you calmed down now?  
Just listen to my heartbeat.  
There, there. There, theeere... ♪  
  
**Chika：**  
... ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh! She smiled!  
And she stopped crying. Thank goodness. ♪

Hehe. ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Are you kidding me?!  
This is absolutely *not* the development I was expecting.  
Chika. I'm not your mama...  
  
**Chika：**  
Huh?  
But you're so warm and cozy.  
That makes you Mama... right?

Uh-oh! She's gonna cry again!  
Urgh!  
Fine, fine! I'll go with the flow!

**Nozomi：**

Let's sing one of Carmina's songs!  
  
**Chika：**  
Carmina?  
Sorry, Mama. What's a Carmina?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Don't worry! I'll start off, so you just follow my lead!  
You've practiced this day in and day out.  
I'm sure your body remembers by now!

Sorry for the wait, everyone! ☆  
We are the all-singing, all-dancing idol guild...

Thanks! Sit by and listen, okay?  
But don't be afraid to cheer and get excited!  
In fact, I'd love it if you all sang along!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I might be going with the flow a bit too much here, but hey.  
Nothing wrong with holding a little concert for everyone!  
Yaaay! Let's do this, people! ☆  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Y-yaaay! ♪  
Wow! This is kind of fun!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yeah. I was pretty down about Pukichi not speaking,  
but this might help me forget about it for a bit. ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You two! Try not to talk too much, okay? Proper manners make  
for a proper concert! Though I guess it's not that proper without  
the instrumentals. But I'll make sure you all enjoy it anyway!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Let's do this!  
Carmina, on stage! ☆
