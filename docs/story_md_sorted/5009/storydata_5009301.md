I never anticipated that it would be this fearsome a foe.  
But we can't stand down.  
We need to win!

I'm really, really scared... But I'll still fight!  
Stealing away people's memories just isn't right!

Thank you.  
Your support means the world to me.  
Foggy! Prepare yourself!  
I won't let you do what you want with my memories any longer!
