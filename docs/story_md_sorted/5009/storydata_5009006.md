**Chika：**  
Unravelling countless legends along the way,  
I finally found myself at the land where Foggy had been sealed.  
  
**Chika：**  
Try as I may, though, it wouldn't respond to my calls.  
And then it went into a frenzy, attacking me in the process.  
  
**Chika：**  
My memories were stripped from me.  
And well... that led to what you all witnessed earlier.  
  
**Chika：**  
My memories of what it was like to be human were wiped.  
That's what caused those beastly antics when I first woke up.  
  
**Chika：**  
Primal hunger made me devour whatever I could,  
much like a wild animal would.  
  
**Chika：**  
My ability grants me some resistance to spirits' influence, though.  
That allowed me to shelter my memories deep within my psyche.  
  
**Chika：**  
But returning them to normal proved to be difficult.  
And thus I was forced to watch myself rampage in that state.

**Chika：**  
Following that...  
I'm still not quite sure how it happened, but Pukichi's appearance  
allowed me to regain a small fragment of my memories.  
  
**Chika：**  
That small fragment only included moments of early childhood, however.  
Which led to me acting like a literal child.  
Oh, how embarrassing...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ahaha. Don't worry. You were adorable.  
I'm used to you  
always acting all mature and cool, so it was nice getting to  
see you when you were still a pure, innocent soul. ♪  
  
**Chika：**  
I-I'd prefer it if you forgot all about it!  
Oh, Foggy. Please wipe their memories right this instant!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
No can do.  
Any and all memories involving you are precious to me.  
In fact, I'd say that's how most people treat their memories.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
They're not something people should try and mess with.  
That goes for you, too, even if your intents were genuine.  
  
**Chika：**  
You're absolutely right.  
Argh... I'm so ashamed of myself.  
  
**Chika：**  
A-anyway. My memories are bound to be stolen away again  
should we leave Foggy to its devices.  
And that, in turn, means I'll trouble you all once again.  
  
**Chika：**  
So please. Do what you can to defeat it.  
Or rather, try and chase it off to a faraway land  
or seal it away once again.  
  
**Chika：**  
It pains me to ask this when I'm the one who undid the seal  
and allowed it to awaken once more, but please  
save me from its malicious onslaught.  
  
**Chika：**  
Just like Nozomi said, my memories are precious to me.  
I don't want to lose them, much less have them stolen away.  
Those involving my time spent with you all in particular.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I mean... I'm all down for kicking that thing's  
rear end into the stratosphere,  
but we don't have any leads as to where it is.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
There's nothing we can do right now.  
But maybe we'll be able to meet it if we go  
to where it was sealed?  
  
**Chika：**  
No. That won't be necessary.  
Foggy is already here, at this very moment.  
  
**Chika：**  
No doubt it's watching over me,  
snickering at the behavior caused by my stolen memories.  
  
**Chika：**  
I can feel its presence.  
That's what it means to be a Song Summoner.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ugh. It's right here?  
B-but where? This is kind freaking me out!  
  
**Chika：**  
I can't pinpoint an exact location, alas.  
Foggy has no physical form to speak of,  
so it can only materialize by possessing someone or something.  
  
**Chika：**  
It should be hiding somewhere nearby.  
Ideally we could determine where, then drive it out.  
  
**Chika：**  
Once it's expelled, I can work together with  
other spirits to vanquish it completely.  
  
**Chika：**  
Unfortunately,  
I can't see it going that well.  
Foggy has likely hidden somewhere extra safe to prevent that.  
  
**Chika：**  
It's defenseless on its own,  
so it's bound to have chosen a suitable shield.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Eeek! That's one way to make me shiver!  
I-it's not hiding inside me, is it?  
  
**Chika：**  
Does anything seem... unusual around here?  
There's a chance that anything possessed by it  
could have changed shape, or even color.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hm... That's probably a question for the people that live here.  
Which would be, Kurumi, Ayane or {player}.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Uhhh, I'm not sure.  
Doesn't help that we've got the decorations up.  
The whole place looks kind of different thanks to that.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh...!  
{player} made a move.  
Did you figure out where Foggy is?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Approach Chika.  
**Choice: (2)**  Approach Pukichi.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chika：**  
Huh? M-me?  
I mean, I haven't been my usual self today...  
  
**Chika：**  
B-but it can't be me!  
I would know if a spirit was lurking inside me!  
  
**Chika：**  
So there's no need to— Huh? Are you paying attention?  
Whoa! Please don't touch me like that!  
Ahaha, ahahaha! You're tickling me! ☆  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hey there, mister! That's absolutely off-limits!  
We have a strict no touching policy!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Ayane：**  
Huh?  
What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?  
  
**Ayane：**  
D-do you think it's me?  
Am I different from usual? Do I seem like a fake?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Wah! Don't pull Pukichi away from me!  
What are you doing?! Don't bully him!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Chika：**  
Oh! Now it all makes sense!  
It's Pukichi!  
  
**Chika：**  
Or rather, the hammer itself!  
That's where Foggy's hiding!  
  
**Chika：**  
With the hammer possessed by Foggy, Pukichi's...  
soul, we'll say,  
was forced out. And I just so happened to be close by  
at the time, so Pukichi entered my body!  
  
**Chika：**  
Assuming I'm correct, the information matches up!  
And now that we know where you are...  
Show yourself, Foggy!  
  
**Foggy：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Waaahhh?! Why's my hammer moving on its own?!  
Is Foggy really inside it?!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Eeek!  
Stop it, Ayane!  
Don't get any closer! Don't hit me!  
  
**Ayane：**  
It's not me, it's not me! My hammer's running wild!  
Waaahhh! Run away!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
{player}?!  
Thank you for saving me!  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'm so sorry, {player}! Are you okay?!  
It wasn't me that did that! It was Foggy!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Let go of the hammer, Ayane! Run away!  
It might target you, and you're too close to avoid it!  
  
**Ayane：**  
I-I can't!  
I promised I'd always be with Pukichi!  
  
**Pukichi (Chika)：**  
Chika!  
Sorry, but I'm gonna have to borrow your body again!  
  
**Pukichi (Chika)：**  
Listen up, Foggy!  
Scaring my Ayane like that means I'm about to turn you  
into the Great Spirit of Getting Your Ass Kicked!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wow!  
Never thought I'd see Chika move around like *that*!  
  
**Pukichi (Chika)：**  
Ayane! That hammer isn't me! I'm right here!  
So let go of it and come to this way!  
  
**Ayane：**  
O-okay!  
I can feel it! You're really over there!  
We're always together, so I can tell!  
  
**Ayane：**  
You've always been by my side, helping and protecting me!  
You'd never try to hurt me or my family!  
Which means this hammer isn't you!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ayane!  
Throw the hammer over towards me!  
  
**Ayane：**  
U-uh...?  
I dunno what you're thinking, but sure!  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'm the elder here, so it's my job to hear you out!  
Yaaahhh!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Thank you!  
Trust me, I know that you've always felt that way!  
And that's why I love you so, so much!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I won't let anyone scare Ayane!  
Get out of here...!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ohhh! Talk about a home run!  
Using your own hammer to knock it away is such a power move!  
  
**Foggy：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Eeek!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
There's some kind of weird mist coming out of the hammer!  
Is that Foggy's main form?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh no!  
It's heading straight for Kurumi!  
And she can't run after swinging her hammer full force!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
U-Unhhh?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ugh! I wanna save her, but she's too far!  
I won't make it!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
{player}! Perfect timing!  
You're surprisingly tough, aren't you? Being able to  
power us up while protecting Kurumi is no small feat!  
  
**Chika：**  
Indeed.  
He's always so kind. So reliable.  
So dear. That's why I wanted to repay him in some fashion.  
  
**Chika：**  
And yet it resulted in this. I'm so sorry.  
I am, but I suppose apologies should be left for later.  
  
**Chika：**  
We need to chase after Foggy right now,  
before it causes any chaos in town.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yeah.  
Let's hurry, {player}!
