Misfortune looms over Landosol as it gears up for the holidays. Little do Chika and those of the Sarendia Orphanage know what awaits them this year...
  
**Ayane：**  
It's almost time for the holidays! ♪  
So hey! Let's go buy a big, delicious turkey  
and some sweet cake! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
It's still a bit too early to do that, Ayane.  
We've got other things to buy...  
Huh?  
Th-there's someone collapsed over there!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Y-you're right!  
Let's help her!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Excuse me...!  
A-are you okay?!  
  
**Chika：**  
...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh! She woke up!  
  
**Chika：**  
Who... Who am I...?

**Ayane, Kurumi & Chika：**  
Coming soon: The Carol That Never Was

**Chika：**  
Hey, miss... Who are you?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Miss...?  
Oh my gosh. It's music to my ears!  
Kurumi! Quit being shy and treat me like that, too! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
N-now's not the time for that!  
This is probably... amnesia, isn't it?  
Urgh... Someone help!
