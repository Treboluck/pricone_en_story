## Subtitle: A Carmina Carol to Be Remembered
  
**Narration：**  
With Foggy defeated,  
Chika seals it away once and for all,  
resolving the incident and bringing back their once peaceful days.  
  
**Narration：**  
Time passes as normal afterwards.  
Today, Ayane is helping Kurumi out  
with her practice for an upcoming play.  
  
**Ayane：**  
N-now, Snow White!  
Treat yourself to this poison apple!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ahaha...  
You can't just say it's a poison apple, Ayane.  
That'll give your intentions away. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh, right! This is kind of hard.  
Here's a nice, big apple for you. Gobble it up! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hm...  
That sounds a bit too energetic for an old lady.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Boo. You're too picky!  
Don't forget that I'm the one helping you out here!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
S-sorry.  
Don't get mad.  
I really do appreciate it.  
Here, have an apple. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yaaay!  
Apology accepted! Chow time!  
  
**Ayane：**  
M-mmm?!  
Hnnnghhh!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
See?  
This is how you do it. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
*cough, cough* I thought I was a goner there!  
You're terrifying, Kurumi!  
How could you try and off your loveable big sister like that?!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I, uh, didn't expect you to die from it.  
It *is* a normal apple, after all.  
I think you just ate it too fast and choked.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I'll go get you some water.  
Please forgive me, my dearest big sister. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hm?  
Are my ears deceiving me,  
or did you just treat me like your big sister?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
E-ehe.  
It's the holidays, after all. Miracles are bound to happen. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
So you're saying that it takes a miracle  
for you to treat me like that?!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehe.  
We've always been this way, right?  
It'd be kind of embarrassing to change that now. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hmm...  
Whatever. I'm still older than you,  
so I'll be mature about it. A mature and understanding lady  
ready to get lots and lots of presents from Santa. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Yeah. ♪  
This year's holiday is bound to be super fun.  
One we'll never forget!  
  
**Chika：**  
Ummm...  
Pardon the intrusion.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh! Chika! ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hey there! Welcome to the Sarendia Orphanage!  
How come you're here today of all days?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You should be more polite, Ayane.  
She's older than the both of us.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Whaaa?! That's not fair!  
I'm older than you, but you never speak that politely to me!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ehe. But we're family.  
It'd be weird to be all stiff and polite. ♪  
  
**Chika：**  
Hehe.  
You two always get along so well, don't you?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Yup! Soothes the mind and soul, doesn't it?  
All that exhaustion from work just went poof!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh, Nozomi's here too!  
Happy holidays! ☆  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ahaha. Just dove right at me there, didn't you? Actually, mind if I copy you? It'd be a big hit on stage.  
You know what,  
Ayane? You might just have what it takes to be an idol. ☆  
  
**Chika：**  
Hehe.  
Are we getting a new Carmina member, perhaps?  
  
**Ayane：**  
N-no way! No way at all!  
I'm super shy around people I don't know!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
Yup. She only acts this way at home.  
Took a good while for her to open up to  
everyone else here at the orphanage, in fact.  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh, was that Pukichi just now?  
Hello. Thank you for your help back then. ♪  
  
**Pukichi：**  
Whoa there. No need to be formal with me.  
Not like I even did much back then, to be honest.  
  
**Pukichi：**  
It was all because of you guys.  
You worked together and pulled it off.  
  
**Pukichi：**  
Be proud of that, I'd say.  
Besides, you're the reason I was able to return to normal,  
so if anything, I should be thanking you.  
  
**Chika：**  
Hehe.  
It's funny how you sound so manly in spite of being a bear.  
  
**Chika：**  
But it's also adorable.  
Is this what they mean when  
they talk about personality gaps, Nozomi?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You can be really out there sometimes, you know that?  
Either way, we shouldn't stick around too long.  
Would hate to be a bother, plus we don't have that much time.  
  
**Chika：**  
True enough.  
We're sorry for barging in on a busy day like this.  
  
**Chika：**  
It's not without reason, though.  
We brought you all gifts,  
both as an apology and as thanks for your help.  
  
**Chika：**  
Though I guess that may be an odd way to phrase it.  
Basically, Nozomi and I picked out  
presents for you. Please accept them.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh wow! That's great!  
Thanks! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ehe. Your outfit does kind of make you look like Santa,  
now that I think about it. It's the same  
one from before, isn't it?  
  
**Chika：**  
Indeed. Carmina's been holding holiday-themed concerts  
over the past few days. Tsumugi, our third member, made this outfit for me to wear during them.  
  
**Chika：**  
I'm the type to really invest myself in these things,  
so I've been wearing it as much as I can.  
Nozomi, on the other hand, says it's too cold for that.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Have you *seen* my outfit? It's way more revealing than yours. I'll  
catch a cold if I wear that thing all the time. Maybe it's Tsumugi's  
way of getting back at me for pushing extra work onto her?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hehe. You're still doing concerts, though?  
Must be tough being busy at this time of the year.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ahaha. Holidays are when we idols work hardest.  
We've been doing more than just concerts, too.  
Needless to say, I'm exhausted.  
  
**Chika：**  
Not that that's a bad thing, of course.  
But re-sealing Foggy ate up some extra time,  
so I'm also busy trying make up for that.  
  
**Chika：**  
I did bring it on myself, however.  
Speaking of which, what a truly embarrassing scenario that was.  
I don't think I'll ever be able to get over it.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Then you just need replace it with some extra fun memories!  
Are you busy after this?  
If not, then stay for our party!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Yeah...  
It'd be a waste if we didn't get to  
know each other more after all this. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
E-ehe.  
Though maybe we're getting ahead of ourselves  
saying that to popular idols.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Not at all!  
If anything, it makes us super happy!  
Right, Chika?  
  
**Chika：**  
Of course. Allow me to take back what I just said.  
Embarrassing as the situation was, it allowed me to meet you all.  
Quite the fond memory, if you ask me.  
  
**Chika：**  
One I won't forget, even if Foggy targets me again.  
My heart is full of joy and warmth right now. ♪  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh. That gives me an idea for some lyrics and a melody.  
Do you mind if I write it down?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh-ho? Let's plop that on a score ASAP.  
Then we can use it as a new song at the next concert!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
That'll be a super exciting present for our fans. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ehehe.  
You sound so excited.  
I can tell just how much you love working as an idol. ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hm... It doesn't really feel like work, to be honest.  
More like our way of life?  
Just kidding.  
Look at me trying to sound all cool!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
No, I agree.  
And I really respect you.  
I hope I can be like that someday. ♪  
  
**Chika：**  
You can. I'm sure of it.  
  
**Chika：**  
Even I never expected to become an idol, in all honesty.  
I only ever used my abilities as a Song Summoner for battle.  
  
**Chika：**  
Doing so almost made me forget just how much I loved  
singing as a child.  
But I was able to remember.  
I might even love it more now than I did back then, even. ♪  
  
**Chika：**  
Is there anything you love in particular? If there is,  
then please treasure it. Pursue it.  
And most importantly, never forget it.  
  
**Chika：**  
In doing so, you'll gain something truly irreplaceable.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Something I love?  
Pukichi! And the rest of my family!  
So I should just chase after them?  
Okay! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Waugh?!  
She didn't mean it literally!  
You don't need to chase after me!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
E-ehe.　I love my family, too.  
I've come to love acting recently as well. ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, huh. I didn't know you were into acting.  
Though you did have the big sister role down to a tee  
when you were playing with Chika, now that I think about it.  
  
**Chika：**  
I would much prefer it if you forgot about that, Nozomi.  
For both of our sakes.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Aww. I mean, I wouldn't mind forgetting about you calling  
me Mama at least.  
That was pretty weird. Definitely  
not something I ever imagined myself being called.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Though there'll come a time when I stop being an idol, won't there?  
Maybe it'll be normal to be called that  
if I get married and have kids?  
  
**Chika：**  
Hehe.  
Quite the funny thing to say while glancing  
at {player}, isn't it?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? I didn't look at him!  
Don't be a tease, Chika!  
You'll get a spanking for that!  
And naughty girls don't get any presents!  
  
**Chika：**  
Okaaay.  
I'm sorry, Mama.  
Just kidding. ♪  
  
**Chika：**  
Hehe. Jokes aside,  
we have plenty of connections with theater troupes  
thanks to our work. Would you like us to introduce you, Kurumi?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
No, it's okay.  
Even if I got a role thanks to that,  
I'm sure the anxiety  
would just make me freeze up on stage.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
For now, I'll stay in my lane and give it my all.  
That should help me grow. And once I'm ready,  
I want to be an inspiration to people. Just like you two are.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
There's plenty of people out there just like me. Lonely. Scared.  
I want them to feel proud.  
To be happy about themselves.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I'm sure my Lost parents will be proud of me if I can do that.  
I know they will. ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh my gosh! You're such a good girl, you know that?!  
And a good girl gets lots of presents from Santa!  
  
**Chika：**  
Indeed. It's about time we gave them to you.  
I just hope you like them.  
  
**Chika：**  
We weren't quite sure what you all liked,  
so we had {player} help out as well.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ohhh...  
That's explain why you kept disappearing recently.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
He's really popular, you know.  
I bet he was meeting with all sorts of people.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ehe...  
I wonder who he'll marry?  
She'll end up being our big sister.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Whoa! Who said I was getting married?  
I've still got idol things left to do!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Sheesh. Only bad girls tease their elders like that.  
And you know what bad girls don't get!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Wait, does that mean no presents?  
That's just mean! You'll make me cry!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
S-sorry!  
I didn't mean it! I want everyone to be happy and all smiles!  
  
**Chika：**  
Hehe.  
You're an easy target for teasing when  
you get all flustered like that, Nozomi. ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Urgh... I used to think you were all calm and cool,  
but you really do like to tease others now and then, don't you?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Though getting to see other sides of you is nice,  
all things considered.  
Anyway! Getting back on track.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Here you go, kids.  
Happy holidays!  
This is for you, Kurumi.  
And this is for... you, {player}.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I only got it because you helped us out.  
It'd be rude not to, wouldn't it?  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh, Nozomi. You're just asking for it if you make excuses like that.  
Perfect an idol as you are, you could do with more experience  
in these situations.  
It's adorable, though. Hehe.  
  
**Chika：**  
Regardless, this is for you, Ayane.  
And this one is for... Pukichi.  
Here you go. Happy holidays. ♪  
  
**Pukichi：**  
Huh?  
Wow, I definitely wasn't expecting one.  
Thanks.  
  
**Chika：**  
Hehe.  
You're your own being, after all.  
You have your own personality.  
It wouldn't be fair to leave you out, now would it?  
  
**Chika：**  
I do wonder what you are, though. It still puzzles me.  
You were forced out of the hammer when  
Foggy possessed it, but were able to enter my body as a result.  
  
**Chika：**  
Are you a ghost?  
A spirit of sorts, maybe?  
  
**Pukichi：**  
I'm Ayane's best friend. Her family.  
That's all that matters, right?  
  
**Pukichi：**  
More importantly, you gotta get back to work, right?  
You'll probably get an earful if you hang around here too much.  
So let's forget the boring stuff and get to partying.  
  
**Chika：**  
I'm still curious, but well... you make a fair point.  
You're just a kind bear looking after a good girl.  
May the blessings of this holiday be with you.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ehehe.  
Thanks. I really appreciate it when people talk to Pukichi normally.  
  
**Ayane：**  
There's plenty of cake, so eat up!  
Kurumi's the one that baked them,  
but I helped with the decorating!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wow! Thanks!  
Or so I'd like to say, but I'm kind of on a diet right now.  
It's easy to get fat during winter, so I need to avoid sugary stuff!  
  
**Chika：**  
Hehe.  
You can burn it off through singing, can't you?  
  
**Chika：**  
Parties and singing go hand in hand.  
This can be our way to both apologize and give thanks.  
A hymn on the holy night. ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hold up. I'm no good with hymns.  
Can't we just sing one of our songs?  
  
**Chika：**  
I'll teach you.  
Don't worry, it's simple.  
Would you mind joining us, {player}?  
  
**Chika：**  
Happy holidays!  
I couldn't have asked for a better present than being able to  
meet you all, let alone spend precious time together like this. ♪
