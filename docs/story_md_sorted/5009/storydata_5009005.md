# Foggy, the Great Evoker Spirit
With the mini-concert over, {player} and co. begin discussing the incident at hand. To everyone's surprise, Pukichi not only begins to speak through Chika's body, but he also helps bring the regular Chika back. Using the time she's been granted, Chika tells them about the root of the issue: Foggy, the Great Evoker Spirit.

**Narration：**  
Having sung for a little over an hour,  
Nozomi and co. are now taking a small break.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Phew... I'm pretty exhausted.  
  
**Ayane：**  
A-awesome concert!  
Feel free to have some tea if you want.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Thanks! ♪  
The cold puts extra pressure on my throat,  
so a bit of hydration always helps!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wait a minute.  
That's an awfully cute outfit you've got on, Ayane.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ehehe. Right?  
I won't be able to wear it once the holidays are over,  
so I've been trying to wear it as much as possible at home!  
  
**Ayane：**  
I had a bit of time on my hands, so I went and got changed.  
Though it'd be kind of weird if I was the only one  
looking like this, so I made Kurumi get changed as well.  
  
**Ayane：**  
It really suits me, doesn't it? Suzume made it  
for me to wear to the upcoming party!  
She's a  
big old klutz, but she can do all sorts of stuff! Except cooking.  
  
**Ayane：**  
She can even patch Pukichi all up if he gets hurt.  
Awesome, right? ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
She sounds pretty talented.  
We've got a formidable seamstress in Carmina, too.  
Her name's Tsumugi. You can almost always  
find her off sewing new clothes.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Tsumugi? We actually just got a package  
from someone with the same name.  
There were clothes and stuff for Chika in it!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Sure was handy, considering her other clothes were all torn up  
and dirty.  
Kurumi was having a blast getting her changed into them.  
They were kinda holiday-themed too, I think.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh...  
Leave it to Tsumugi to pull something like that off.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Handling our whole workload on her own should be taxing enough,  
but there she is helping us out from behind the scenes as well.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I was super flustered when we spoke, too,  
so I couldn't even fully explain the situation.  
She really is perfect, both as an idol and our manager.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ehehe.  
You look so pleased, Nozomi.  
It's obvious how much you care for your friends.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Of course I do.  
We're all part of the same group, so we share a common destiny.  
And most of all, we're family.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I guess you could liken our connection to you and Pukichi's.  
Speaking of which, sorry about earlier.I shouldn't have called him a stuffed animal.  
  
**Ayane：**  
No, it's fine. I'm not a clueless kid.  
I get that it's normal to think that way.  
If anything, I'm probably the weird one.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Normal people don't think they can talk to stuffed animals.  
But I mean it when I say I can hear his voice.  
Except now I can't, and I don't know why.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
That is a bit of a mystery, isn't it?  
If you take the timing into account,  
then it's entirely possible that Foggy's responsible.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Foggy, huh... What even is it?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I have no idea.  
Ideally Chika could give us a proper explanation, but that's not  
happening when she's basically reverted back to being a child.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Okay, Chika. It's your turn now. ♪  
  
**Chika：**  
Hm... Hm?  
Which one is it? Which one isn't the joker?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ehe. Who knows?  
  
**Chika：**  
This one!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wow! Amazing!  
You're so good at Old Maid!  
  
**Chika：**  
Ehehe. ♪  
Right? I'm amazing!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You sure are. ♪  
Okay, next up is Sevens!  
  
**Chika：**  
Ehehe.  
I won't lose this one either! ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Errr...  
Sorry for making you look after her, Kurumi.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh! Don't worry about it.  
I'm used to taking care of children.  
And I'm having fun myself, too. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Heh!  
There's plenty of kids younger than us living here.  
Kurumi's usually the one that looks after them.  
  
**Ayane：**  
They all look up to her,  
like she's really their big sister.  
  
**Chika：**  
I love Kurumi! She's so kind! ♪

**Kurumi：**  
E-ehehe...  
I love you too, Chika. There, there. ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**

**Kurumi：**  
Waugh. S-sorry...  
I'm no one special,  
so I shouldn't be putting my hands on an idol.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh. Nah, don't worry about it.  
{player} would get a good scolding,  
but you're more than welcome to do so.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
E-ehe. Speaking of {player},  
the way Chika is right now reminds me of  
him when he first came to the orphanage.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
He was like a little kid. A baby, even.  
Me and Ayane would always play with him  
and take care of him. ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hm... The resemblance between him back then and how Chika's  
acting now is pretty striking, now that you mention it.  
He's suffering from amnesia, which means...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ahhh! I've almost got it!  
Give me a minute! I'll make my brain go full throttle!

**Chika (Pukichi)：**  
No need for that, little miss idol.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? That was you just now, right, Chika?  
What's with the attitude shift?  
Did you get a taste of the dark side?  
  
**Chika (Pukichi)：**  
Haha. Guess I can't hide the rough upbringing when I speak, huh?  
Trust me, though. I hate to make a pretty lady  
with a pretty voice talk like this, too.  
  
**Chika (Pukichi)：**  
This situation's all messed up, though, so there ain't much we can do.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Wait.  
I-is that you, Pukichi?  
  
**Ayane：**  
It is, isn't it?  
I'd know more than anyone!  
That's how Pukichi talks!  
  
**Pukichi (Chika)：**  
I figured you'd catch on, Ayane.  
You sure know how to make a bear happy.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Pukichiii!  
  
**Pukichi (Chika)：**  
Whoa there. Let's hold back on the hugs.  
This girl's way, way more frail than a stuffed animal like me.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Pukichi, Pukichi, Pukichiii!  
I thought I'd never get to talk to you again!  
I was so scared!  
  
**Pukichi (Chika)：**  
Don't cry, Ayane. I could have every thread ripped out of me,  
and it still wouldn't compare to the pain of seeing your tears.  
I'm right here, just like I've always been.  
  
**Pukichi (Chika)：**  
And always will be. So long as you want me to be.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yeah!  
We'll be together forever! I know it! ☆  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Uhhh...  
  
**Pukichi (Chika)：**  
Ah, right. Guess I should explain myself first.  
Or well, as much as I can.  
I'm pretty clueless about how this all came about, myself.  
  
**Pukichi (Chika)：**  
Chika's soul is still in this body.  
She filled me in on the situation after I called out to her.  
  
**Pukichi (Chika)：**  
Hell, I should just let her do the talking. That'll be easier.  
Lemme switch over real quick.  
No need to be shy, Chika. Come on out.  
  
**Pukichi (Chika)：**  
They're all worried sick, so let 'em hear your actual voice.  
  
**Chika：**  
Okay.  
It's as, uh, Pukichi says.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Chika? That's you, isn't it?  
Thank goodness! Does that mean you're back to normal?  
  
**Chika：**  
*sigh*  
I'm so sorry for that pitiful display, Nozomi.  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh, however can I make it up to you?  
Not only did I do some atrocious things, I also called you \"Mama.\"  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Can't say that I minded, really.  
But save the shame for later.  
Can you explain what's going on for us?  
  
**Chika：**  
Later? That won't do!  
Argh... I can't believe how I've been acting.  
I'm so shamed.  
I can't even look you straight in the eye...!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hyah! Idol Chop! ☆  
  
**Chika：**  
Ouch!  
How could you?! There's no need to hit me!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Sorry. I respect that honest and serious side of you,  
but you also have a bad habit of kicking yourself when you're down.  
And this is absolutely not the time for that.  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh...  
Yes, you're right.  
You're always right.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Not really.  
Anyway, I'm just glad you're back to normal.  
  
**Chika：**  
This is only temporary, I'm afraid.  
Pukichi's presence is what's allowing me to appear like this.  
And I'm pushing myself rather hard, so it won't last long.  
  
**Chika：**  
With that in mind, I'll explain everything.  
It's a pitiful story in all honesty,  
but I don't have much choice but to rely on you all at this point.  
  
**Chika：**  
The root of this all is the Great Evoker Spirit, Foggy.  
A spirit so mighty and powerful that it inspired countless legends.  
Are you all aware of it?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I know the name, at least.  
But I'm pretty clueless when it comes to spirits.  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh...  
Well, I suppose that makes sense.  
Though there have been picture books and the like based on it.  
  
**Chika：**  
Regardless,  
Foggy is, as its title hints at, a spirit with power over memories.  
  
**Chika：**  
Not only can it make one forget their past,  
it can supplant entirely new memories as well.  
  
**Chika：**  
Shameful as it is to admit, that gave me an idea. What if  
that power could help bring back {player}'s  
memories? And thus I set out in search of it.  
  
**Chika：**  
As you all know, I can form pacts with spirits and have  
them lend me their power. In Foggy's case, I intended to request  
that it help restore {player}'s memories.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Chika...  
Well, now it all makes sense.  
You're always one to push yourself for the sake of others.  
And that makes you a model idol. I'm so proud of you.  
  
**Chika：**  
I'm not deserving of that much praise.  
{player} has helped me out countless times,  
so I only wanted to repay that favor somehow.  
  
**Chika：**  
But Foggy was far more dangerous than I had ever anticipated.  
It's a fearsome beast, much more akin to a monster than a spirit.  
Words are meaningless to it.
