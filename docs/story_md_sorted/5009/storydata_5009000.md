## Subtitle: Wintertide's Lament
  
**Narration：**  
Landosol is brimming with excitement as the festive season draws  
nearer, but not everything is as it seems. In an alleyway  
nearby the town center, Chika is running for dear life.

**Chika：**  
*pant, pant*  
This is awful!  
  
**Chika：**  
What have I done?!  
The Great Evoker Spirit, Foggy, is far more dangerous than  
I imagined! And I'm the one that unleashed it from its seal!  
  
**Chika：**  
Ahhh! My memories!  
  
**Chika：**  
They're fading! Slipping away by the second!  
Everything I've ever known!  
  
**Chika：**  
The joys of singing, the excitement of performing as a member  
of Carmina! My feelings towards {player}!  
  
**Chika：**  
Ahhh! I can't remember anymore!  
What was it like to walk?  
  
**Chika：**  
To breathe? To feel my own heartbeat?  
I can't recall any of it.  
  
**Chika：**  
I...? Who am I?  
*What* am I? I don't... remember anymore...  
  
**Chika：**  
Ahhh...  
U-urgh...

Meanwhile, {player} is out shopping  
for food and other daily necessities alongside  
the children from the Sarendia Orphanage.  
  
**Narration：**  
Having gotten what they set out to buy,  
they begin to make their way back.  
  
**Ayane：**  
La la laaaa! ♪  
It's almooost that time of the yeeeaaar. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ehe...  
Even the cold can't stop Ayane from being so energetic. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hey!  
How many times do I need to tell you to  
treat me more like an older sister!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
I'm on her side, Kurumi.  
You gotta stop putting distance between each other.  
  
**Pukichi：**  
You share the same bed, eat at the same table,  
and live in the same house. That makes you family, right?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Heh! ♪  
You tell her, Pukichi!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
That said, Ayane sure acts more like a kid compared to the others  
around her age. I wouldn't blame anyone for saying  
she's not really the older sister type.  
  
**Ayane：**  
What?! Come on, Pukichi!  
Why you gotta be like that?!  
Any more of your lip and you're going right in the trash!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
...  
  
**Ayane：**  
H-huh?  
Sorry!  
That was just a joke! I didn't really mean it!  
Argh! How could I even say something like that?  
Santa'll definitely take me off his list if I don't shape up!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Waaahhh! Pukichi's ignoring me!  
I'm sorry! I really am! Don't hate me!  
I won't throw you away! I wanna be together forever!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Yikes...  
You should watch out, Ayane.  
The road's all frozen and slippery. You might fall if you don't—  
Waugh?!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Kurumi?! Are you okay?!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Y-yeah...  
Ehehe. Silly me.  
There I was warning you,  
and I ended up slipping myself. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Y-you're not hurt, right?  
Be careful, okay?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Yeah. I'm fine.  
{player} managed to grab me in the nick of time. ♪  
  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ehe... Thank you.  
It'd be awful if I got hurt so close to the holidays, wouldn't it?  
  
**Ayane：**  
You betcha! Especially when we've got the party coming up!  
No one wants to be hurt or catch a cold before that!  
It'd suck real bad!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ehe. Yeah. I'm looking forward to it.  
Especially because it's the first time  
I'll spend the holidays with everyone. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yup, yup! Let's make the most of it!  
Together, as a big family! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Sure. ♪ Let's decorate the orphanage, too.  
We can put up a great big tree. ☆  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I wanna sing and dance all day,  
until I can't go on any longer. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Heee! ☆  
Don't forget the big, tasty turkey.  
And all the cake!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
It'll be so fun!  
We'll go to bed feeling all happy,  
then wake up to find presents by our bed. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
It doesn't get any better than that!  
Ahh, man! I can't wait! ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hm...? You don't look that excited, {player}.  
Are you not looking forward to it?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh. Is it your amnesia?  
Did you even forget about what the holidays are like?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hm?  
I'm pretty sure I explained it to him, though.  
  
**Ayane：**  
It's not like him to forget something once he's relearned it...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Waugh?!  
Don't take off like that without warning me, please!  
You scared me!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Wh-what's wrong?  
Why'd he start running out of nowhere?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh...?  
Ayane, look! Someone's collapsed over there!  
  
**Chika：**  
...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Whoa! You're right!  
But who is it? Someone he knows?  
He's shouting her name, at least...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I'm not sure...  
She might freeze to death in this cold, though.  
We should get her inside somewhere warm.  
  
**Ayane：**  
You carry her, {player}!  
We'll run back to the orphanage and get the  
fireplace and stuff all ready! C'mon, Kurumi!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
G-got it!  
  
**Chika：**  
Mmm... Urgh...?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh! She's awake! Hey, you okay?  
Don't worry. We'll get you somewhere nice and warm,  
so don't go and die on us.  
  
**Chika：**  
Die? What... What does that entail?  
It sounds terrifying! Horrifying!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wah! Please settle down!  
  
**Chika：**  
To die. In other words, to perish. To lose oneself.  
To fade away. To forget everything!  
Ahhh! How terrifying! Please spare me!  
  
**Chika：**  
Beware, beware! It's coming! Foggy is coming for us all!  
Our memories, our bodies will crumble! We'll all perish!
