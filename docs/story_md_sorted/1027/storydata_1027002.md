**Narration：**  
{player} has been summoned by Eriko.  
  
**Eriko：**  
My love, I've been waiting for you.  
Today... I have some gifts for you.  
Would you kindly accept them?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee... It's okay, don't be afraid.  
My gifts are very normal, common items.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Here is your first gift.  
A hand-knitted scarf, and also...  
  
**Eriko：**  
A hand-knitted sweater, hand-knitted gloves, a hand-knitted  
vest,  
 a hand-knitted beanie, hand-knitted socks, a hand-  
knitted bag,  
 and hand-knitted underwear.

**Choice: (2)**  Too... heavy!

`Tag 2`  
**Eriko：**  
Oh? That's strange.  
I don't think they should weigh that much.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Eriko：**  
And also, I put together a boxed lunch  
just for you, my love.  
It's got hamburg steak, meatballs, meatloaf...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Sandwiches, rice pilaf, risotto, paella, pasta,  
hors d'oeuvres, soup, granitas, salad, and dessert.  
Naturally, the secret ingredient in them all... is my love.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Secret ingredient?  
**Choice: (5)**  Too! Heavy!  
`Tag 4`  
**Eriko：**  
Yes. I've drenched them in a love potion.  
Just one bite of this and you'll fall madly in love with me.

`Tag 5`  
**Eriko：**  
Oh? That's strange.  
I was sure I weighed the quantities quite carefully...  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Eriko：**  
What's more... I also brought you this.  
  
**Eriko：**  
You don't know exactly what it is I'm referring to?  
This here, right in front of you.  
  
**Eriko：**  
I'm giving you this house, my love.  
And, of course, this was also built with my own two hands.  
  
**Eriko：**  
From now on  
I will take charge  
of every facet of your life, my love.  
  
**Eriko：**  
The clothes you wear, the food you eat, the place you live.  
Every. Single. Thing. You will live your life solely on what  
I arrange for you.  
  
**Eriko：**  
As such, all of your existing clothes and necessities?  
Please,  
throw them all away.  
  
**Eriko：**  
I won't take \"no\" for an answer. This has already been decided.  
You must become  
the ideal companion I have always sought after.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh, I almost forgot.  
This is also for you.  
A golden necklace. While it is quite an expensive item,  
I brought it today, because I thought it would suit you.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Go on, you should try it on.  
Teehee... I knew it would look amazing on you.  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Hey! We've finally found ya!  
We stole that necklace right there, fair and square!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
You've got some nerve stealing valuables from under the  
Thieves' Guild's noses! Are ya gonna give that necklace up,  
or do I gotta steal it back from ya?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
I think not.  
This belongs to my beloved now.  
No one else can have it.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Others' belongings belong to me...  
My belongings belong to {player} here...  
And {player} here belongs to me, of course.  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
What the heck are ya talkin' about?!  
Just give up the necklace already!

**Bandit 2：**  
Yeowch!  
Wh-what's with this weird water?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Salamander blood. It melts through even iron.  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
GUWAHHH!  
I-it burns! I-I'm melting!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Heh... You dare to pick a fight with me? The Destroyer?  
How foolish of you.  
  
**Eriko：**  
My love, in addition, I am also gifting you these rupies.  
This is enough for us to live the rest of our lives together.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Where did I get it all from?  
Well, the bank, of course.  
I helped myself from the vault just now.  
  
**Narration：**  
And so, {player} hurried back to the bank  
with Eriko to return the rupies.
