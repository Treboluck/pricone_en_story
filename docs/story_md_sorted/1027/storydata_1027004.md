**Eriko：**  
My love, who were you speaking to  
just now?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Please don't feign ignorance. I was watching the whole time.  
There was a busty woman, a small-statured woman,  
and a foul-mouthed woman...  
  
**Eriko：**  
I will not stand to have other women talking to you, my love!  
I must punish them at once.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Eek! Wh-  
what is the meaning of this light?!

Whoa, thanks for that!  
You better be careful not to bump into folks in the future!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh my, such an adorable cat.  
Come over here. I'll give you some scratches.

**Eriko：**  
As I thought... you're lost, aren't you?  
I'll help you find your mother.  
So stop crying, little one.  
  
**Child：**  
*sniff* Th-thanks, miss...  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Let me help you look.  
**Choice: (11)**  You're so kind.  
`Tag 10`  
**Eriko：**  
Oh, my love.  
You're going to help as well?  
My, aren't you kind? I expect no less from my soulmate.

**Eriko：**  
Oh, my love. You flatter me too greatly.  
It's only natural to offer one's assistance  
to small, defenseless children in need.  
  
**Eriko：**  
On the other hand, when immoral beings are in trouble,  
it fills me with joy and elation...  
Teehee.

**Brutish Man：**  
Hey there, little missy! Wanna come hang out with me?  
  
**Eriko：**  
And just who might you be?  
If you can't tell, I'm talking to my love right now.  
  
**Brutish Man：**  
Ditch that dunce, why don'tcha!  
You should come with me inst—  
  
**Eriko：**  
SILENCE, MAGGOT!  
  
**Eriko：**  
How dare the likes of a foolish piece of trash insult my love.  
You disgust me.  
You are deserving of instant death!

**Brutish Man：**  
Urk!  
What's with this stinky water?!  
You trying to pick a fight, or something?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Silence!  
  
**Brutish Man：**  
.........  
  
**Eriko：**  
You should punch yourself in the face to reflect on  
the horrible crime you've committed!  
  
**Brutish Man：**  
*THUMP* *THWACK* *WHOMP*  
  
**Eriko：**  
Apologize to {player} for your rudeness!  
  
**Brutish Man：**  
Sorry! So sorry! Please forgive me!  
My bad! You have my deepest apologies!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Get out of my sight!  
  
**Brutish Man：**  
.........  
  
**Child：**  
He left...  
What just happened to him?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee. Dear child, that medicine I used...  
It allows me to control people as I wish.  
  
**Child：**  
Wow! Miss, you're awesome!  
  
**Eriko：**  
After I went to the trouble of making it  
just for {player}...  
Now I have to start from scratch...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Well then, my love.  
Let's go find this little boy's mom, shall we?

**Ameth：**  
And that's it. Welcome back!  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you saw just now  
was a dream I created  
using memory fragments from you and Eriko.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I thought Eriko was the embodiment of terror,  
but it looks like she has a kind side to her as well.  
I see her in a different light now!  
  
**Ameth：**  
B-but then there's that medicine to control others...  
So that's another side to her.  
I guess she's still pretty scary.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway! Keep doing your best to avoid getting killed  
by Eriko's love!  
Bye now!  
  

---  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ugh... Hm? What just happened to me?  
I suddenly got drowsy and found myself in a dream.  
  
**Eriko：**  
It was such a strange dream. You were there,  
and we were in an unfamiliar place.  
  
**Eriko：**  
You had the same dream, my love?  
Well then, this calls for further research.  
A potion to see the dreams you wish to have... Teehee.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ah! But now is not the time for that!  
I must deal with the wretches clinging to you—  
  
**Child：**  
Wahhh!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh? A lost child, perhaps?  
  
**Eriko：**  
I suppose what must be done, must be done.  
Let's forget about the three hussies for now,  
and search for this child's parents, shall we?  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} seemed to have discovered  
a kinder side of Eriko that day.
