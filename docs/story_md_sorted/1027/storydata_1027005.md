## Subtitle: The Finest Birthday Gift
  
**Narration：**  
{player} receives a letter from Eriko.  
  
**Letter：**  
\"Today is my birthday, so I would love to see you.\"  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Go see her.  
`Tag 1`  
**Eriko：**  
Ah, my love.  
You came to see me?  
Thank you very much. I'm so happy.  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Eek! A monster!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Protect Eriko.  
`Tag 2`  
**Eriko：**  
My love!  
You've been hurt trying to protect me!  
  
**Eriko：**  
How dare you lay a finger on my love.  
I assume you are ready to meet your doom?  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Eriko：**  
I've defeated the monster.  
I'm so sorry you had to get injured  
in the act of protecting me, my love...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh no! You're bleeding!  
I will tend to you right away! Please don't move!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Thanks for treating my injuries.  
**Choice: (4)**  I know I'm late, but happy birthday.  
`Tag 3`  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee. The blood of my love...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Treatment?  
Ah, yes. This is treatment, of course.  
I definitely didn't do anything other than that.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Eriko：**  
Birthday?  
Oh... right. That.  
I did say it was my birthday, didn't I?  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Tch. Another monster. One was all I really needed...  
This potion to create a monster-attracting scent  
is a little TOO effective.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Well, whatever.  
I've managed to collect {player}'s blood,  
so I'll just go ahead and destroy this beast.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Eriko：**  
This is all going just as planned.  
Hm? My love.  
You seem to be giving me a look of distrust. Teehee.  
  
**Eriko：**  
The truth is,  
I put on a little act for you to collect your blood.  
  
**Eriko：**  
I lied about it being my birthday.  
It's actually July 30th.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Also, the monsters just now were summoned by me.  
I'm so sorry.  
I did all of this for our future... Teehee.  
  
**Eriko：**  
A vial of my blood and a vial of yours.  
I will combine them using alchemy  
to produce our offspring!  
  
**Eriko：**  
This gift of your blood is most welcome, my love.  
I couldn't ask for a finer birthday present!  
  
**Eriko：**  
The next time we meet, I will bring our child as well.  
Please do think of a name in the meantime. Teehee...  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Eek!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh no! The vial of {player}'s blood!  
Curse this festering pest!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Eriko：**  
...My love.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Tomorrow just so happens to be my birthday...  
  
**Narration：**  
Naturally, {player} saw right through  
Eriko's lie the second time.
