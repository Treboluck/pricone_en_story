**Narration：**  
The story begins as a girl walks through town.  
  
**???：**  
*sigh* My soulmate...  
I wonder where you are and what you're doing?  
I can't wait to meet you. Teehee.  
  
**Fortune Teller：**  
Um, excuse me, miss.  
Would you like to have your fortune read?  
  
**???：**  
My fortune?  
While I am a little curious, I don't have any money on me.  
  
**Fortune Teller：**  
No payment is required.  
My father merely wishes to give you a reading,  
so please do come in.  
  
**???：**  
Your... father?  
  
**Skullfather：**  
She's talking about me!  
I figured I'd go and give you a reading on the house!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Lemme see. Hmm. Ah-hah, I see it!  
Young lass, you'll meet your soulmate today!  
  
**???：**  
My soulmate?!  
  
**???：**  
Teehee... I see. At long last.  
Finally, we will cross paths.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
You betcha! That soulmate of yours... is me!  
How's about we grab a coffee after—  
  
**Fortune Teller：**  
Father, she's already gone.  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} comes across a girl unconscious on the side of the road.  
  
**???：**  
Urgh...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are you okay?!  
**Choice: (2)**  Look after her until she wakes up.  
`Tag 1`  
**???：**  
*groan* Urgh... H-how foolish of me.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**???：**  
Oh? And who are you?  
Was I... unconscious just now?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**???：**  
You found me collapsed on the ground? Over there?  
So... you looked after me?  
Thank you very much.  
  
**???：**  
Now, why was it that I collapsed to begin with?  
Come to think of it, my potion...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Are you sick?  
`Tag 4`  
**???：**  
Sick? Oh, you thought I collapsed because  
I'm sick and ran out of medicine?  
I can't be bothered explaining, so let's just leave it at that.  
  
**???：**  
Nevertheless, I was quite careless.  
How could I have mistakenly inhaled the fumes of my own poison?  
I must've collapsed from the potent noxious fumes.  
  
**???：**  
That's the first time I've ever passed out  
from the poisons I make for fun.  
Today is a rather strange day.

**???：**  
Oh my,  
you're going to help me up?  
How very kind of you.  
  
**???：**  
.........  
  
**???：**  
What is this?  
Holding your hand gives me... a strange sensation.  
  
**???：**  
Now that I think about it, that fortune-teller earlier said...  
  
**???：**  
...!  
  
**???：**  
I see. So this is what he was referring to.  
Teehee... Teehee...  
  
**???：**  
You'll be leaving now?  
Okay then, until next time. Teehee...

A few hours later...  
  
**???：**  
Ah, well if it isn't {player}.  
What a coincidence.  
  
**???：**  
Yes, I think I'm feeling much better now.  
Thank you very much for your concern.  
  
**???：**  
Why do I know your name, you ask?  
Please don't let that concern you.  
Teehee... Teeheehee...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ah! My name is Eriko, by the way.  
I would be so very delighted if you remembered it.

Well then, I'll be off now...  
Teehee...

My love,  
fancy seeing you here.

**Choice: (6)**  Are you following me?  
`Tag 5`  
**Eriko：**  
Yes... Chance meetings don't happen so frequently like this.  
It must be... the hand of fate.

`Tag 6`  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee.  
Please pay no mind to such small details.  
Teehee.  
  
**Eriko：**  
For so many chance meetings to happen like this...  
It must be fate.

**Eriko：**  
You and I are fated soulmates, {player}.

**Eriko：**  
{player}... Teehee.  
At last, I have finally found my soulmate.  
  
**Fortune Teller：**  
Um, excuse me, miss. Could I speak to you for a moment?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ah, you're the fortune-teller from this morning.  
  
**Fortune Teller：**  
Yes. About that reading... it was inaccurate.  
It appears as though my father told a lie  
in an attempt to woo you. My apologies.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Inaccurate? A lie?  
  
**Eriko：**  
What are you talking about? There's no need to apologize.  
After all... it wasn't inaccurate at all. Teehee...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teeheeheehee...  
I have found him. My soulmate.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
So sorry about that, young lass.  
Let me treat you to dinner to apologize!  
  
**Fortune Teller：**  
Father, she's already gone.
