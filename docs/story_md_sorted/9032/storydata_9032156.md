**Kokkoro：**  
Phew... We were able to defeat it somehow.  
Still, this chameleon... It is an intriguing creature indeed!  
I would love to examine it in detail... ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ah—hey, Koro!  
 Don't get too close to it!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We have rendered it fully docile, so I see no danger.  
Now, allow me to ascertain the texture of this unusual skin—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Aauuughhhhh?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Playing dead?!  
 For an overgrown lizard, you sure are sneaky!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Kokkoro! We'll protect you now!  
Get away from her and become my lizard stew!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Tch... It vanished and took off!  
Let's follow it! Pecorine, Koro!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...I... I must apologize. M-my legs have given out beneath me...  
Please leave me here and pursue the creature yourselves.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, don't you give us any of that.  
As if we'd leave you on your own in this forest.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's right! We might not have defeated the mealy one,  
but at least we solved the mystery! That's enough for one day! ☆
