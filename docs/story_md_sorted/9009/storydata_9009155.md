**Pecorine：**  
Ooh! That's one fine-looking chicken over there!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That is not a chicken, Miss Pecorine. That monster there is a Peakie Hen.  
It seems to be quite the menace as it attacks those bound for the  
mountain village on their descent from the snowy mountain.  
  
**Karyl：**  
So that's why the Guild Association put out a request to defeat it then.  
And, to top it off,  
its beautiful tail feathers apparently go for a pretty penny!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl... Is that why you have brought  
my lord all the way into this frigid place deep in the snow?  
  
**Karyl：**  
You guys need money, don'tcha? If you think about the rewards  
up for grabs, the cold shouldn't bother you anyway.  
Come on, let's bring all of those feathers back and make a killing!
