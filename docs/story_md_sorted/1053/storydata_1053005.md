Monika takes {player} along to her training drills with the local children. She claims that keeping up with their energetic antics is a good training method, yet {player} can't help but see it in a much more heartwarming light.

**Narration：**  
{player}, on another one of his patented walks,  
comes across Monika.  
  
**Monika：**  
Oh. Hello there.  
Is something the matter?  
  
**Monika：**  
Curious about what I'm up to, are we?  
Just part of my usual routine, really.  
  
**Monika：**  
A soldier always aims to better herself.  
Today's plan is to carry out drills with some friends.  
How about you join us?  
  
**Monika：**  
That's the spirit.  
Follow me, then.  
  
**Monika：**  
Here we go.  
This is today's spot.  
My friends should be arriving soon.  
  
**Child 1：**  
Monika!  
Sorry for the wait!  
  
**Monika：**  
Oh. Speak of the devil.  
Perfect timing.  
  
**Child 2：**  
Wow. You got here early.  
  
**Monika：**  
Of course.  
A soldier is always on time, my little friend.  
  
**Monika：**  
Now then. Let's get started!  
Line yourselves up!  
  
**Children：**  
Okay!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are you playing military again?  
**Choice: (2)**  Aww. You have some adorable friends.  
`Tag 1`  
**Monika：**  
We're not playing!  
These are proper military drills!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Monika：**  
Could you *not* mock me, perhaps?  
We're taking this very seriously!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Monika：**  
This drill requires multiple people to be done efficiently.  
And children are both fast and full of energy.  
That makes it perfect for strengthening your—  
  
**Child 1：**  
Oh! Dad's here!  
Dad! Over here!  
  
**Man：**  
Hey there, everyone. I brought you some candy.  
Think of it as thanks for playing with my daughter all the time.  
  
**Children：**  
Yay!  
  
**Monika：**  
Hmph. Imagine getting so excited over candy.  
This is the difference between adults like me and children.  
  
**Monika：**  
Th-that said. It wouldn't be fair if everyone but me got some.  
Law and order must be maintained.  
Yes. That makes perfect sense.  
  
**Man：**  
Here you go, Monika.  
  
**Monika：**  
Th-thank you.  
As always, I appreciate the gesture.  
  
**Monika：**  
...  
  
**Monika：**  
I-I can see the suspicion in your eyes, {player}.  
If you've got something to say, then say it.  
  
**Monika：**  
Oh no. You think I'm just here for the candy, don't you?!  
Th-that's slander! And absolutely not true at all!  
  
**Monika：**  
I'm a soldier. A proud one, at that.  
I would never, ever, play along with children  
for the sake of candy.  
I-I mean it!  
  
**Child 1：**  
Monika!  
Let's get back to it!  
  
**Monika：**  
I-indeed! Good idea!  
Alas, {player}, I must attend to them.  
Which means this conversation ends here!  
  
**Child 2：**  
Hey Monika, have half of mine.  
It's really yummy!  
  
**Monika：**  
What a kind gesture.  
You can have half of mine, then.  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} couldn't help but smile as he watched Monika  
look right at home while playing with the children.
