## Subtitle: Swimming Buddies
  
**Narration：**  
{player} comes across Monika while making his way through town.  
  
**Monika：**  
Oh. Fancy meeting you here.  
Are you on a shopping trip?  
I respect that. Moreso considering how hot it is.  
  
**Monika：**  
That's been the case quite a lot recently, hasn't it?  
Just going outside is a struggle.  
Maybe it's about time to go take a dip in the ocean.  
  
**Monika：**  
Wh-what's this?!  
It's so bright!  
  
**Monika：**  
Aaaaaahhhhhhh!!!

**Monika：**  
Swimming drills were normal in my squad,  
but this is the first time I've had to do it at school.  
  
**Monika：**  
I have to say, though. This school swimsuit is great.  
It's nice and easy to move around in.  
  
**Monika：**  
Come on, {player}.  
We were all paired up to avoid any possible incidents.  
  
**Monika：**  
And you're my buddy,  
so I would appreciate it if you had your wits about you.  
Stay sharp!  
  
**Monika：**  
That said. This takes me back to my days in the squad.  
Pairing up with a buddy was common there as well,  
especially during more dangerous drills.  
  
**Monika：**  
One drill in particular involved testing  
how long we could stay underwater.  
Ah, those were the days.  
  
**Monika：**  
Right then. How about we put that nostalgia into practice?  
I can hold my breath for quite a while, just so you know.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I wouldn't mind seeing that.  
**Choice: (2)**  Sounds a bit dangerous.  
`Tag 1`  
**Monika：**  
Oh ho! I figured you'd take interest!  
Then you can have the privilege of seeing it up close.  
Don't expect *too* much, though.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Monika：**  
For those without training, yes.  
Like I said, though. I've undergone plenty of that already.  
Let me prove it to you.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Monika：**  
Okay. I'm ready.  
Keep your eyes peeled!  
  

---  
  
**Monika：**  
Hmm... Seems like I still have the knack for it.  
I might even be able top my personal record.  
  
**Monika：**  
Hehe. No doubt he'll be surprised to learn that  
I can hold my breath for this long. {player}  
Behold my greatness!  
  
**Monika：**  
Hmm? That's odd.  
Why did he jump in?  
  
**Monika：**  
W-wait a minute!  
Why is he grabbing me?!  
And now he's trying to pull me up!  
  
**Monika：**  
M-more importantly!  
He needs to watch where he's touching!  
  

---  
  
**Monika：**  
*gasp*!  
H-how dare you?!  
You're in for a big shock if you think you can  
get away with doing that in public!  
  
**Monika：**  
Wh-what's that?  
You thought I was drowning?  
  
**Monika：**  
Oh... I guess being in there so long made you worry.  
W-well. I'll forgive you if that's the case. But just this once.  
  
**Monika：**  
That said! Did no one ever teach you to be more careful  
when touching a lady? If not, then I will!  
  
**Monika：**  
I get that you were in a rush to help me. I do.  
It's just... you know. I-if you touch my chest out of nowhere,  
then I might knock you out on reflex.  
  
**Monika：**  
H-hmm? Why do you look so perplexed?  
You thought you were grabbing...  
my back?  
  
**Monika：**  
Urgh... Grrr!  
Today you breathe your last breath!  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
How did you like that? A little present from me!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Really, though. As much as she may try,  
there's no getting past her looking like a kid.  
But hey. That's what makes her so cute.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway. If you wanna experience more of that,  
then go gather up some more Memory Shards.  
  
**Ameth：**  
They're way more important than you'd imagine, too.  
If anything, they're one of your best bets for understanding  
what's going on in this world.  
So yeah. Good luck. ♪  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway. Catch you later. ♪  
  

---  
  
**Monika：**  
Mmm...? Where am I?  
What in the world have I been doing?  
Hey, {player}. Do you know what's going on?  
  
**Monika：**  
I was asleep? Really?  
And you were as well? Well, that's odd.  
I can't believe we both fell asleep in the middle of the street.  
  
**Monika：**  
I had quite the interesting dream, though.  
You were in it as well.  
We were both taking swimming lessons together.  
  
**Monika：**  
You had the same dream?  
Well then. This just keeps getting stranger.  
  
**Monika：**  
It might have made sense if it was a place we both knew,  
but that wasn't the case for either of us.  
A bit too convenient to be a coincidence, I'd say.  
  
**Monika：**  
What's that? It felt oddly nostalgic, you say?  
Hmm... I felt the same way, actually.  
  
**Monika：**  
That wasn't any normal dream.  
My well-honed instincts tell me so.  
  
**Monika：**  
Most importantly, though. One's imagination plays an important  
part in the dream's content. Knowing that, I should  
have appeared to be much more... well-endowed.  
  
**Monika：**  
That would have solved some obvious problems.  
Such as you mistaking my chest for my back—  
  
  
**Monika：**  
E-err... Just ignore me!  
And forget about both the dream and its content while you're at it!  
  
**Monika：**  
A-anyway! Leave any further investigation into this to me.  
You don't need to pay it any mind.  
Not now or ever again!
