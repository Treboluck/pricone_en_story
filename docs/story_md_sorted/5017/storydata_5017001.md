## Subtitle: The Sin Archbishop of Sloth
  
**Narration：**  
In a forest somewhere on the continent of Astraea,  
the members of the Gourmet Guild are on an adventure  
in search of rare, tasty morsels as usual.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Delicious, delicious, fruity treats~! ♪  
Sweet and juicy fruity treats~! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ohhh, shut up!  
You're so distracting! I can't focus!  
Can you *stop* all that singing?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Awww, but this is the perfect song  
for an adventure in search of tasty fruit!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Sure, because you made it up just now!  
...So?  
 Do you even understand what kind of forest this is?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh please, how could I possibly forget?  
It's the forest with the world's juiciest fruit! How crazy is that?! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
I knew you'd say that...  
 Koro, tell her the deal.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Of course, Miss Karyl.  
Miss Pecorine, this forest is indeed famous for delicious fruits,  
but it is also famed for the monsters that gather to feast upon them.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh! But Kokkoro... Karyl...  
 Doesn't that mean...  
  
**Karyl：**  
That's right.  
 Glad you finally see just how dangerous—  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We have to hurry,  
or the monsters might gobble up all the fruit before we can!  
  
**Karyl：**  
How do you still not get it at all?!  
  
**Pecorine & Kokkoro：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl. If you raise your voice like that,  
you may attract the monsters toward us.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's right, Karyl!  
We're on an adventure here, so try to take it more seriously!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Why am *I* suddenly the bad guy here?!  
{player}! Set these two idiots straight!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Delicious, delicious fruity treats~! ♪  
**Choice: (2)**  Guys, it's not nice to tease.  
`Tag 1`  
**Karyl：**  
Not you too!  
 You're as bad as them!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Am I the only sane one in this world?!  
Urgh... Why does this always happen to me...?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Karyl：**  
H... huh.  
That's right. This is how sane people react.  
  
**Karyl：**  
See, you two? Show a little repentance!  
You could learn a lot from {player}!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
I sincerely apologize, Miss Karyl.  
I think I may have gone a little overboard.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll apologize too. I'm sorry, Karyl!  
Next time, I'll invite you to sing along! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
What kind of an apology do you call that?!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, *what* a surprise. Monsters!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
How very awful.  
My lord, please fall ba—  
 Oh?  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What's all this?  
Why are the monsters in a hurry?  
They all completely ignored us and ran away!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It seemed to me  
 almost as though they were afraid of something...  
  
**Karyl：**  
They came from over that way...  
Huh? Where are you going?! {player}?! Pecorine?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Something's not right!  
I have to save the delicious fruit! Yah-yah-yah-yah!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl, let us follow after our companions!  
  
**Karyl：**  
H-hold up!  
Wait for me, will you?!  
  
**???：**  
...Ahhh...  
 Aaahh.  
Whatever could this mean, pray tell?  
  
**???：**  
Moments ago, I was investigating the half-devil's movements.  
Yet now, I am in an unknown forest.  
This defies all reason. And what's more...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**???：**  
Authority of Sloth: Unseen Hand!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**???：**  
These creatures keep attacking me.  
I see no horn upon them, so they cannot be mabeasts...  
  
**???：**  
They are no mabeasts, yet they attack me on sight?  
This is instinct!  
 Purpose! A fate branded upon their very souls!  
  
**???：**  
Ahhh, truly... Truly, truly, truly!  
Loyal to their own nature! This is diligence,  
 yes!!!  
  
**???：**  
How magnificent!  
Ahhh, aaahh! Magnificent! Magnificeeeeent!!!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Uh, guys. Why did we have to find *this* weirdo?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Why indeed. He certainly seems a lively fellow,  
but I must question whether he will hear us out...  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're gonna *talk* to him?!  
No way. I'm staying out of this.  
Wait, hang on. Where's Pecorine?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine should be over...  
 Oh.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heyas~!  
How do you do?!  
 Could I ask you a little something?  
  
**???：**  
Oh my.  
 Oh my, oh my, oh my. An unfamiliar face!  
Of course I do not mind,  
 but may I ask one thing first?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes? What might that be?  
  
**???：**  
This word, \"Heyas.\" Tell me, what does it mean?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, \"Heyas\"?  
It's just my greeting!  
 Greetings are important, don't you think? ☆  
  
**???：**  
Ah, I see! Your greeting! A crucial act indeed!  
And all the more so on first meetings!  
In that case,  
 allow me to respond in turn...  
  
**???：**  
\"Heyas\"...  
 Yes!!!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahahahaha!  
Well, thank you! I really appreciate the gesture! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Why are you getting along?!  
Honestly, Pecorine, I don't know what to make of you sometimes...  
  
**???：**  
My, oh my. A friend of yours?  
Then I greet you too.  
 \"Heyas\"...  
 Yes!!!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heyas, yes!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Heyas... Yes!  
`Tag 4`  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, don't you dare start too!  
  
**???：**  
Ahhh, you have quite the large group!  
Then allow me  
 to provide a proper introduction in my own style.  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
I am a Sin Archbishop of the Witch Cult,  
 representing Sloth—  
Petelgeuse Romaneeconti,  
 yes!!!  
  
**Karyl：**  
T-talk about intense...  
What's this guy's deal...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
From the Gourmet Guild, representing massive appetites—  
the perpetually peckish Pecorine,  
 yes! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're getting into this?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
No matter the situation,  
she never falters in the slightest... That is our Miss Pecorine indeed.  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, these three over here?  
They're my fellow members of the Gourmet Guild...  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
...You there, girl.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Are you addressing me?  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Yes, girl with the silver hair.  
That hair color, those long ears...  
 Might you happen to be... an elf?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Just as you say, I am of the elvenfolk.  
A humble attendant to my lord, my name is Kokkoro.  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
...An elf.  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
An elf... I see, an elf, yes...  
And one with silver hair and amethyst eyes, no less...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hold on. Is anyone getting weird vibes right now?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmmm... This isn't giving me a very good feeling at all.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ehm, listen, Mr. Petelgeuse.  
If I have done anything at all to displease you...  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
...Yes, I see.  
I see everything so clearly now.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-why're you sounding so satisfied...?  
And what did you just pull out? A book?  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
My Gospel.  
This tome shows me my path through my lady's favor!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Yet, for some reason, it says nothing of my journey to this place.  
Its pages lie empty.  
I must think for myself and reach my own answer.  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
However, that answer has now been found. It is clear to me!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The reason you came here?  
Could it be... you came to find tasty fruits too?  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Uh, somehow I don't think so.  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
You! Yes, you alone are the reason I have been brought here!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Me, you say?  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Yes, silver-haired elf!  
The Witch has sent me to claim a new testament of faith!  
I shall make you a sacrifice and prove my undying love!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
In this land, a silver-haired elf with amethyst eyes greets me!  
How can this be anything but divine guidance?!  
Ahh, aaahh! Great Witch, all my being is for you alone!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hey! If you're planning to hurt Kokkoro,  
I won't hold anything back, even against a new friend!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I also have a duty to serve and protect my lord.  
I am afraid I cannot allow myself to become the sacrifice you seek.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I-I won't let anyone hurt Koro either...  
  
**???：**  
Everyone, lower your heads.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Get down!  
`Tag 5`  
**???：**  
Prepare to die, Witch Cultist!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
...!  
  
**???：**  
Ngh! He blocked the attack...!  
  
**???：**  
I followed the Witch's lingering scent  
hoping it would lead me to Subaru...  
I never thought I would run into a Cultist out here.  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
That was certainly an aggressive assault.  
Tell me, who are you, attacker?  
It seems you sense the love bestowed upon me...  
  
**???：**  
But of course, Witch Cultist.  
You are... No, all of your kind are enemies of the world.  
  
**???：**  
With such a fetid odor upon you,  
did you really expect I would not find you here?!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
\"Fetid\"?  
 That is but a single aspect.  
Such limited reasoning. A closed, halted mind.  
 Truly slothful!  
  
**???：**  
How dare you...!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Such slothful efforts will do you no good!  
Not against me, the ever-diligent, rigorous and dedicated!  
The loads we bear, the goals we seek, are worlds removed, yes!  
  
**???：**  
An Archbishop of Sin, judging me?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Th-things sure got super hostile all of a sudden...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That maid over there is amazingly strong!  
Did you see her swing that weapon around?! How crazy is that?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hail, fine stranger!  
Are you already acquainted with Mr. Petelgeuse?  
  
**???：**  
Yes, I know him.  
He's an Archbishop of Sin, one of the Witch Cult's leaders!  
Left to roam free, there's no telling how many people he'll harm.  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Harm? A crude expression.  
 At least refer to them as \"sacrifices.\"  
Necessary sacrifices to guide the way to the Witch's love...  
It is an honor to serve such a role.  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
All of it to reach the path of this blessed Gospel I bear!  
  
**Karyl：**  
The book again...  
Looks like that \"Gospel\" has some kind of special relevance.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I do not know its contents,  
but I do feel a special power from its pages.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But, but... a book can't fill your stomach!  
Can't we still try to settle this with words somehow?  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Regrettably, the Witch desires not such a slothful outcome!  
In which case! I now must show true diligence, and deliver—  
  
**???：**  
...That's enough.  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
...?!  
  
**???：**  
Puck, help me out!  
  
**Puck：**  
Sure thing. Leave it to me!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
More of you...  
 Who is it now?!  
  
**Puck：**  
Too late.  
 You can burn my adorable face  
into your eyes before you die! ♪  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Curse you... Curse you, curse you, curse yoooouu!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Th-that magic is truly overwhelming...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahh... Talk about a close one...  
Umm, hey,  
 thanks for protecting me, {player}.  
  
**???：**  
Th-that spell... Miss Emilia, it's you!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Yes, it's me!  
Really, Rem, you mustn't run off like that!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Leaving both me and Ram behind... We were so worried about you!  
  
**Rem：**  
I-I am very sorry.  
I thought I sensed Subaru's scent, so I couldn't restrain myself...  
  
**Emilia：**  
We're all very worried about Subaru.  
But let's try to stay calm and work together to find him!  
  
**Rem：**  
O-of course...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Now, I think we gave these people a big surprise, so...  
  
**Puck：**  
Hey hey hey, are you all OK?  
I hope we didn't hit you with any stray shots!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh, Puck! It's not nice to put it like that!  
We really are sorry. Is anyone hurt?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's a nope!  
 We're just fine and dandy!  
Ummm, Mr. Talking Cat... and his owner, I suppose?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I have never heard of cats that can float and talk.  
I presume he must be some manner of spirit or fairy...  
  
**Puck：**  
That little lady's got the right idea.  
But I'm not just a cute little kitty who can float and talk.  
I'm a kitty idol who can sing and dance as well!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I... I'm so lost right now.  
So wait, did your attack take care of that weirdo?  
  
**Emilia：**  
No... I don't think so.  
I did aim carefully, but...  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
You are...  
 slothful, yes?  
  
**Rem：**  
...?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahh! Mr. Petel, when did you get over there?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Can it be? After a spell of that caliber, he is unharmed?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Talk about resilient...!  
 Wait, no.  
I think he dodged at the last second.  
Though I have no idea how...  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Ah, such treachery! Such atrocity!  
To attack without so much as a warning is the height of cowardice!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Your attitude is sloth itself! Sloth, sloth, sloth, sloth!  
You foist your own sloth upon others while feigning diligence!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Unforgivable!  
You alone are a being of true evil, yes!  
A corrupt soul befitting  
 a silver-haired half-devil!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Hmph, I don't think I deserve all that abuse.  
True, it was wrong of me to attack so suddenly...  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're accepting that part?  
  
**Emilia：**  
But...! You were trying to hurt that poor girl, too.  
So you were being at least as naughty as I was!  
  
**Puck：**  
At any rate, a Witch Cultist has no right to preach morality.  
What now? Are you going to keep fighting in this situation?  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Just so you know, we'll be fighting back too this time.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes. We will fully exploit our numerical advantage.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We'll smack you good and then have a tasty dinner!  
Mr. Petel, if you apologize, we might still let you off with  
no dessert as punishment!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Tempting...  
 Yes, a tempting offer indeed.  
However! I have my own sworn duty to fulfill!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, Mr. Petel...  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
And yet, to attack unthinking would be a mark of sloth.  
I have discovered my role here, yes. As such...!  
  
**Rem：**  
You think you can escape?  
Faced with me, Miss Emilia, and even a Great Spirit?!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Yet again, you are held back by crude assumptions!  
Your thoughts are plagued by sloth upon sloth without end!  
  
**Rem：**  
No way...!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
For now, I will retreat, yes!  
But when we next meet, my diligence  
will bring me my goal without fail.  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Elves with silver hair and amethyst eyes!  
Both of you! At my hand! Will become sacrifices to the Witch!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Y-you're kidding me.  
He rolled up and went flying through the air!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's like something out of a dream!  
How crazy is that?! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
A dream? More like a nightmare!  
Anyway, we have other things to deal with.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes... Mr. Petelgeuse has escaped us for the time being,  
but we remain unclear on the others' intentions...  
  
**???：**  
So now, our groups must be wary of one another.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohh~? This new maid looks just like the first one!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Not another one...  
I'm guessing you're with these people too?  
  
**???：**  
Yes, obviously.  
Rem, Miss Emilia, are you all right?  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes, dear sister. I am not harmed.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Puck and I are okay, too.  
What about you, Ram? Were you all right in this dense forest?  
  
**Ram：**  
I was just leisurely waiting around for you.  
However...  
  
**Gourmet Guild：**  
*staaare*  
  
**Puck：**  
Those people seem suspicious of us.  
What now? Should I win them over with my fluffy fur?  
  
**Emilia：**  
It's true that you're adorable, Puck,  
but it seems a little unfair to use that to our advantage.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Mm... Let's try talking to them!  
Listen! We're not really suspicious people...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh? You're, um...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord?  
 It seems too soon to trust these people...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Thank you for saving us.  
`Tag 6`  
**Emilia：**  
Ah...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ugh, why are you always so simple-minded...?!  
  
**Emilia：**  
...Haha!  
  
**Emilia：**  
It's fine. You're all perfectly welcome.  
Actually, I almost hurt you, so I'm sorry.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, my lord...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh,  
 that's just like him!  
See, these other girls are looking much more relaxed already!  
  
**Ram：**  
Agreed.  
This boy seems far too empty-headed to bother being wary of.  
  
**Rem：**  
We must apologize for our initial suspicious attitude.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh no, that goes for us just the same.  
We should apologize ourselves for not greeting you properly...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Th-there goes all my tension...  
All right, so if you're not enemies, who exactly *are* you people, then?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh, of course!  
We should introduce ourselves...

Still, I've gotta say that was incredible!  
Miss Maid, how can you swing this heavy ball around  
with that slender body?!  
  
**Rem：**  
Oh... it isn't anything special, really.  
This is a portable weapon, so it's much lighter than it looks.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, I see~!  
Well, that explains everything! ♪

Do you think that little girl might be an elf?  
And her hair—it's silver, just like mine! Her eyes are similar, too!  
  
**Puck：**  
Ah, so you've finally found her, Lia.  
My other sweet daughter....  
 Your long-lost little sister!

I have a little sister? Gosh, what a surprise!

**Narration：**  
Having overcome their initial troubles and suspicions,  
the two groups gather at the Gourmet Guild's guildhouse.  
  
**Emilia：**  
So, um, I'm very sorry about back there.  
Shall we start by introducing ourselves properly?  
  
**Emilia：**  
My name is Emilia. Just plain Emilia.  
This is my contracted companion, the spirit Puck.  
  
**Puck：**  
I'm pretty much like a foster parent to Lia.  
I hope you'll get along  
 with me and my daughter!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Ahh... Just so you know,  
I still haven't forgiven you for the lie you told back there!

Sorry, sorry.  
Please accept my apology, Lia~!

Hmph! I don't think so!

Ooh, I see, I see~!  
So Emilia and the kitty are super good friends, huh?!  
A kitty cat that floats and talks is such a rare sight, too!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't forget, he's a spirit, not a cat!  
You better not let your bad habits run wild on someone else's pet!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Bad habits? That's such a cruel way to put it!  
Besides, how can I help it?  
I'm a proud member of the Gourmet Guild, after all!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't put it like that!  
You'll make them think I've got a monster appetite, too!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Now, allow us to apologize for derailing the topic.  
Please, continue with your introductions.  
  
**Ram：**  
Oh? Then I suppose I'll take my turn.  
I'm Ram.  
 Remember me as the fabulous elder twin of the adorable Rem.  
  
**Rem：**  
My name is Rem. I cannot hope to match my sister,  
but I'll do my best to be of service. I hope we can get along.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  It's great to meet you, Rem.  
**Choice: (8)**  Wait, which one's the elder twin?  
`Tag 7`  
**Rem：**  
Yes, it's lovely to meet you, Master {player}.  
Miss Pecorine, Miss Karyl, Miss Kokkoro, you too.  
  
**Ram：**  
I suppose we should thank you.  
We were all completely lost until you found us.  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Ram：**  
Weren't you listening at all?  
I'm the elder, and Rem is the younger. Isn't it patently obvious?  
  
**Rem：**  
My sister has a sophistication that defies description.  
Oh, my dear sister. You are so wonderful.  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Ram：**  
As for what we're doing here, we won't outstay our welcome...  
Or so I'd like to say, but the situation might be  
more complicated than that.  
  
**Karyl：**  
\"Ram,\" was it? From the way you're talking,  
do you know more than you're letting on?  
  
**Ram：**  
Well, I have more than a few suspicions.  
...Do you people not know anything about the Witch Cult?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Wit Shkult,\" you say?  
Hmmm... That doesn't ring any bells.  
What kind of food is it?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Not \"Wit Shkult,\"  
 you idiot, \"Witch Cult\"!  
Come on, don't you remember that flying weirdo's introduction?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh! That really was a wild trick, wasn't it?  
Karyl, can you fly like that with magic, too?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, for the love of...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So yes, perhaps you could explain  
a little more about Mr. Petelgeuse and this \"Witch Cult\"?  
  
**Rem：**  
They don't know the Witch Cult...  
Dear sister, this really must mean...  
  
**Ram：**  
Yes, it must.  
I suppose we'll have to believe the Great Spirit's wild ravings.  
  
**Puck：**  
\"Wild ravings\"? That's cruel.  
I'm always totally serious except when I'm clowning around.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Umm, could you stay calm and listen?  
We're still not sure how any of this happened ourselves, but...  
  
**Kokkoro & Karyl：**  
You came from another world?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A completely different world, huh...  
That's quite the journey! Please, make yourselves at home!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh, umm,  
 thank you.  
We're very sorry to impose like this.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Is this really the time for leisurely pleasantries?!  
Anyway, does that mean that weirdo and his Witch Cult  
are from your world too...?  
  
**Emilia：**  
That's right. They're very bad people.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
\"Very bad people,\" you say...  
Could you be a little more specific, perhaps?  
  
**Ram：**  
As a general rule, we're supposed to kill Witch Cultists on sight.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Are you savages, or what?!  
  
**Rem：**  
I'm afraid they really are just that dangerous.  
And Sin Archbishops are the group's leaders...  
We can't let one roam free.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see...  
Such a dangerous group, unleashed here in Astraea...  
  
**Karyl：**  
...  
  
**Karyl：**  
\"Witch Cult\"? You've got to be kidding me here!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Her Majesty never mentioned anything like that.  
Isn't my position complicated enough already?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Worst case, I might have to inform Her Majesty  
and get her to mobilize Nightmare...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hey, Karyl, you're spacing out!  
Are you OK?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?!  
Uh, don't worry! I'm fine!  
 It's nothing at all!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Are you sure?  
Your face just now looked very serious...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ughhh, forget about me already!  
Shouldn't we  
 be figuring out what to do with you guys?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I confess I must agree with Miss Karyl's assessment.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yeah, true!  
I think we've covered why you're here!  
But what do you want to do from here on out?  
  
**Emilia：**  
What do we want?  
...Yes, you're right.  
That's what really matters.  
  
**Rem：**  
Miss Emilia!  
I would like to propose a search for Subaru!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Of course, that's our top priority.  
For all we know, he might be crying somewhere all alone right now...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This \"Subaru\" person you mention... Is he another of your companions?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Yes, that's right.  
Let's see, he's a very cheeky rascal...  
  
**Rem：**  
He's incredibly gallant and reliable, too!  
  
**Puck：**  
Also, he's really positive  
 and knows a lot of weird things.  
  
**Ram：**  
And of course, he's a hopeless piece of trash.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Putting all that together...  
I'm not getting a picture that makes any sense at all.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Anyway, it sounds like he's an important friend of yours!  
We all got that part loud and clear,  
 so no worries!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well then,  
 do you have any idea as to the whereabouts  
of the missing Master Subaru?  
  
**Rem：**  
I'm afraid I haven't found any clues to where he is...  
But his scent is definitely in the air,  
so he must be in this world somewhere.  
  
**Karyl：**  
His scent...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Scent, huh~?  
This Subaru must have a really tasty smell about him!  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes, he positively reeks!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I-I was trying so hard not to say anything like that...!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Ahahaha...  
  
**Puck：**  
What's this?  
I think your friend wants to say something.  
 What's up?  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Do you have any way back to your world?  
`Tag 10`  
**Emilia：**  
...Yes, that's also a problem.  
We have to find Subaru and find a way back home, too.  
  
**Rem：**  
Miss Emilia has a most important duty to perform.  
Our official employer is working with her towards a noble goal.  
  
**Ram：**  
We must return as quickly as humanly possible,  
so as not to cause any trouble for Lord Roswaal.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I too am my lord's faithful servant, so I can quite understand.  
However, a means of returning to an entirely separate world...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah, that's not gonna be easy.  
I've never heard of anything like it.  
  
**Puck：**  
Now, now.  
I've got some ideas of my own on that front.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The kitty has a plan?  
  
**Puck：**  
That's right.  
I may be the most adorable little fuzzball,  
but I'm also a very capable tomcat.  
  
**Ram：**  
You do love to act mysterious, Great Spirit.  
If you have some kind of plan, why don't you tell us already.  
  
**Puck：**  
Hmm, well, about that...  
Do you all remember how we were originally sent here?  
  
**Emilia：**  
What sent us here? You mean Beatrice's Door Crossing?  
  
**Rem：**  
Actually, I think Miss Beatrice's magic  
was twisted somehow by the strange black book that Subaru found.  
  
**Puck：**  
Right, right, the black book.  
If we examined that book, I think we'd be able to find our answer...  
  
**Ram：**  
...Oh, I see.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Ram, you worked something out?  
  
**Ram：**  
Well, a certain someone has a very similar book.  
So that must be what we need.  
  
**Emilia：**  
You don't mean...  
  
**Rem：**  
The Sin Archbishop's Gospel, of course.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait, \"Gospel\"? The book that weirdo was carrying?  
That's your ticket to get back to your own world?  
  
**Ram：**  
That makes things a lot more simple.  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes!  
First, we need to find Subaru...  
  
**Emilia：**  
And then we beat the Archbishop.  
As long as we can take the book he was carrying...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You'll all be able to get back to your home sweet home! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So everything rests on finding these two individuals.  
  
**Karyl：**  
A search, huh...?  
In that case, won't you need a place to stay in the meantime?  
  
**Emilia：**  
A place to stay... Somewhere like this \"guild house,\" do you mean?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Just as Miss Karyl says, you will need a place to rest.  
Searches like this are rarely over in a day or two...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Agreed! If you don't get a proper night's sleep,  
you won't even be able to savor all this world's delicious food!  
  
**Rem：**  
A place to sleep, you say...  
That is a pressing issue.  
  
**Emilia：**  
We don't have any of this world's money,  
so it might be difficult...  
  
**Choice: (11)**  Let's try asking Saren.  
`Tag 11`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, yes.  
 A wonderful idea, my lord.  
Our friends at the Sarendia Orphanage  
would surely be happy to help travelers in need.  
  
**Emilia：**  
...? What is this \"Sarendia Orphanage\"?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The guild where my lord and I have been staying,  
which provides shelter to children who have no family to turn to.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Their guildmaster, Miss Saren,  
will help you with your troubles, I feel quite certain.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Honestly, I'd rather not trouble them so much...  
  
**Ram：**  
Miss Emilia, this may not be the time to refuse their goodwill.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's right!  
Besides,  
 friends help friends in trouble! ♪  
  
**Emilia：**  
Mm... That's true.  
All right, then. We'll accept your kind offer.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Can you introduce us to this Miss Saren?  
I'd at least like to ask her myself.  
  
**Choice: (12)**  Leave it to us.  
`Tag 12`  
**Emilia：**  
Okay! Thank you ever so much, really!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Well then, since that's settled...  
  
**Emilia, Rem & Ram：**  
It's a pleasure to be working with you.  
  
**Puck：**  
Let's all be great friends~! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Sure~! ♪ Making new friends  
 is always a happy thing! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
*sigh*... Personally, I don't want to think about where this is going...  
  
**Narration：**  
That night, in a forest just outside the city...  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Preposterous... Ah, how preposterous...!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
A situation such as this  
 beggars all belief!  
Ahhh, and yet! I cannot but accept it, yes!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
This is a world beyond the bounds of my own!  
A hellish land where beasts and elves walk the streets alongside humans!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
This wickedness must not stand.  
It is a heresy against all we stand for, against my very love for the Witch!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
If possible, I would like to take action to remedy it at once...  
Yet right now, I am all too weak!  
To act recklessly would be the height of sloth!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
I must prepare, with diligence!  
 I must be ready, in fullness!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Ahhh, Witch, great Witch!  
Light upon my soul!  
 All my undying devotion, I dedicate to thee, yes!
