# Visitors from Another Land
One day, while clearing out a storeroom in Roswaal's mansion, Subaru and the twins Ram and Rem discover a mysterious book beneath a hidden trapdoor. Due to some interference with Beatrice's Door Crossing ability, they are dragged into a strange blinding light, along with Emilia and Puck.
  
## Subtitle: Visitors from Another Land
  
**Narration：**  
This is Margrave Mathers's mansion, in the Dragon Kingdom of Lugnica.  
Subaru Natsuki, serving as an apprentice butler here, does his best to  
perform his duties under the watchful eye of the maids Ram and Rem.  
  
**Subaru：**  
Ahhhh, cleaning storerooms is tough when I'm still recovering.  
My body aches, my legs are trembling,  
my arms are heavy, and I'm clean outta breath.  
  
**Rem：**  
Are you all right, Subaru?  
This is supposed to be your day off,  
so you should really leave this to us and rest.  
  
**Subaru：**  
Nah. I appreciate the thought,  
 I really do.  
But being treated like an invalid ain't my style!  
My body still works, so doing nothing would just drive me crazy.  
  
**Rem：**  
Even so...  
  
**Ram：**  
It's fine, Rem.  
Just let Barusu do as he pleases.  
  
**Rem：**  
Not you too, dear sister...!  
  
**Ram：**  
If he wants to work, then let him.  
He's just itching to be praised for struggling through the pain.  
  
**Ram：**  
A disgusting ploy.  
  
**Subaru：**  
That's quite the interpretation, \"dear sister\"!  
I mean... I can't claim you're *totally* wrong, but still!  
  
**Subaru：**  
I-it's not like I'm dying to look cool  
in front of you two and Mili or anything!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Are you talking about me?  
  
**Subaru：**  
Whuoooghhh!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Ohh! How shocking...  
I had no idea you could jump so high, Subaru.  
  
**Subaru：**  
M-M-M-Mili...?! The heck are you doing in here?!  
The air's brimming with microparticles!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Micro... particles...?  
 I'm not sure what that means,  
but I thought I heard my name, so I was curious.  
  
**Subaru：**  
No, no, no! Talking about you?  
 None of that here!  
Not a single word! Cross my heart! I'm not lying or hiding anything!  
  
**???：**  
What's all this? I hope you don't think you're convincing anyone.  
  
**Subaru：**  
Guehh! That voice is... Puck!  
  
**Puck：**  
Don't lie now, Subaru.  
You seem desperate to change the subject.  
My instincts tell me  
 you were saying things you don't want Lia to hear!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Subaru, is that true?  
Is it like Puck says? Are you keeping secrets from me?  
  
**Subaru：**  
Those lonely eyes are my greatest weakness!  
But really, you've got it wrong! It's not like that at all...  
  
**Subaru：**  
I was just hoping that if you saw me working hard,  
you might give me a few sweet words of praise, that's all...  
  
**Ram：**  
Anyway, did you want something from us, Miss Emilia?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh, yes, that's right.  
I had a little favor to ask of Subaru...  
  
**Subaru：**  
My words've fallen on deaf ears!  
You want me to sulk?! Or run away from home?!  
  
**Rem：**  
Don't worry. I won't let your hard work won't go unnoticed!  
I'm always watching, every day from morning to night!  
  
**Subaru：**  
Something about that scares me...  
 But thanks.  
You're always the only one on my side, Rem...  
  
**Rem：**  
Ohhhh... I'm so sweet you want to marry me?  
Don't make me blush...  
  
**Subaru：**  
I never went that far!  
But hang on. It's rare for you to ask favors of me, Mili.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Really? ...Maybe it is.  
But if you're busy, it doesn't have to be right now.  
I can just play Meow-Mewly-Mewly-Meow with Puck for a while...  
  
**Subaru：**  
...Sorry? Come again?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Meow-Mewly-Mewly-Meow.  
  
**Puck：**  
It's a game Lia and I came up with back in the forest.  
First, one player goes \"meow-mewly,\" then the other one goes...  
  
**Subaru：**  
I *so* wanna hear about that,  
 but listen, we're almost done here!  
See, we just need to move this thing...  
 Wait, huh? What *is* this thing?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Is that... a trapdoor in the floor?  
  
**Subaru：**  
Couldn't be much else...  
 Not this pattern again.  
Our margrave sure loves his hidden compartments.  
  
**Ram：**  
You just have a talent for dredging up people's secrets.  
Or perhaps your gaze is always on your feet.  
  
**Subaru：**  
Spare my reputation!  
Seriously, does this mansion need all these trapdoors?  
Last time it was a liquor stash, and this time...  
  
**Puck：**  
Huh... That's an interesting book.  
Is it another of Roswaal's treasures?  
  
**Ram：**  
I doubt it. His valuable books are all in Miss Beatrice's library.  
It wouldn't be like him to treat a priceless tome this way.  
  
**Subaru：**  
Uh, you sure grabbed that book fast, dear sister.  
What if it turns out to be cursed or something?  
  
**Ram：**  
Who has time to worry about such far-fetched ideas?  
You're just a coward. How shameful. To think you call yourself a man.  
  
**Subaru：**  
You gotta go that far?!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Still, it *was* hidden in Roswaal's mansion.  
Doesn't that make it quite likely that the book's special somehow?  
  
**Ram：**  
...Very true. It's just as you say, Miss Emilia.  
Barusu, show a little more caution in the future.  
  
**Subaru：**  
And she shifts the blame without batting an eye...  
Hm? Rem, what's up? You look kinda pale.  
  
**Rem：**  
Well, ah... I can't exactly put it into words, but...  
I'm sensing some kind of worrying aura from that book.  
  
**Subaru：**  
A worrying aura? From this book?  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes. Just a faint... very faint... strongly faint... aura.  
So, I thought perhaps we should dispose of it quickly.  
  
**Ram：**  
Yes, Rem is completely correct, of course.  
Let's burn the book now.  
  
**Subaru：**  
You skipped a few steps there!  
I mean, Rem's worries bother me too, but...  
  
**Emilia：**  
With Roswaal currently away  
on an inspection of his territories and everything...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh, I know!  
Why don't we try asking Beatrice for help?  
  
**Subaru：**  
Oh, good call!  
She's basically in charge of a whole mountain of suspicious books.  
If anyone can figure out what's up with this thing, it's her.  
  
**Subaru：**  
All right! Let's take this thing straight to Beako...  
  
**Puck：**  
Will we find Betty so easily, though?  
She usually stays holed up in her hidden library...  
  
**Subaru：**  
Hey, no worries there.  
She can connect her library to any door in the mansion, right?  
Thing is, I've got a weird knack for picking the right one.  
  
**Subaru：**  
Heck, even this storeroom's door might take us straight to...  
  
**Emilia：**  
...?! Subaru, wait! The door's glowing...!  
  
**Subaru：**  
Wh-whooooaaaa?!  
  
**Ram：**  
This link isn't to Miss Beatrice's library!  
It's connecting us to somewhere else...!  
  
**Rem：**  
How awful! Subaru! Let go of the book!  
At this rate, you'll...  
  
**Subaru：**  
Th-the door's sucking me inside...?!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Aaaaahhhhhhh!  
  

---  
  
**Narration：**  
The storeroom is filled with a blinding light,  
and once the light dissipates...  
  
**Narration：**  
The room lies entirely deserted. An eerie silence fills the air,  
broken only by the sound of a book falling to the floor.  
  
**Narration：**  
The book's pages flutter wildly of their own accord,  
and words begin to appear upon its previously blank pages.  
When it settles, a single sentence lies plain to read.  
  
**Narration：**  
\"In a distant land, strange fates shall intertwine.\"  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Uh... Hmm~?  
That's odd. I sensed some kind of interference just now...  
  
**Ameth：**  
It can't just be my imagination...  
Is something going down that I'm not aware of...?  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's not good.  
I just hope it doesn't drag *him* into any trouble...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Who's causing a mess this time? Honestly...
