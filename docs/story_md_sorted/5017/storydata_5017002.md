## Subtitle: Watcher in the Shadows
  
**Narration：**  
Just a few days after their arrival at the Sarendia Orphanage,  
Emilia and her companions are already getting along well  
with the other residents.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Mmm, the weather still looks lovely!  
A perfect day for shopping!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, you are right, my lord.  
It seems Miss Emilia has become well accustomed to life in this world.

**Emilia：**  
Yes, I'm ever so grateful.  
This is all thanks to the lovely people at the Sarendia Orphanage  
and all of you who so kindly introduced us to them!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Thank you so much! Good girl, good girl~! ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
E-ehm... Please do not pat my head.  
Well, I suppose I do not dislike it, but...  
  
**Rem：**  
Just look, dear sister.  
Miss Emilia has become so attached to Miss Kokkoro.  
  
**Ram：**  
Well, their race and even appearances are so similar.  
She must feel as if she has a new little sister.  
  
**Ram：**  
As a fellow elder sister, I understand...  
Having a sweet little sister is the greatest happiness in the world.  
  
**Rem：**  
No, dear sister. That isn't quite right.  
Those who have a wonderful elder sister are the happiest of all.  
  
**Ram：**  
My, you've become assertive, Rem.  
How adorable.  
  
**Rem：**  
Oh, dear sister...

**Saren：**  
Well, well, everyone.  
Aren't you just having the sweetest conversation.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh—Miss Saren?  
  
**Saren：**  
Hello, Emilia. Ram and Rem, too.  
It's nice to see you're getting along with our Kokkoro.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh, yes. We're all such good friends! Right?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I-I think I asked you to stop patting my head...  
  
**Saren：**  
Lovely. Friendship is a beautiful thing!  
I'm glad you're getting along so well with the kids as well.  
  
**Rem：**  
We are so lucky to be guests at your orphanage.  
Miss Suzume and the children have made us feel very welcome.  
  
**Ram：**  
Suzume is such a klutz, it's always entertaining.  
I don't know how she used to manage without Rem to help her.  
  
**Saren：**  
Ayane and Kurumi often help out as well.  
But since you all arrived, Suzume's been working extra hard.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, about that...  
I, ehm... heard Miss Kurumi lamenting the recent increase  
in broken plates and charred pans...  
  
**Rem：**  
M-Miss Suzume has been doing her very best...  
  
**Emilia：**  
But thanks to her, Ayane and Kurumi are both so reliable!  
It's amazing how good they are at cooking and cleaning for their age!  
  
**Emilia：**  
None of the children are scared of me, either...  
I know it's not the time,  
 but I feel so happy here.  
  
**Saren：**  
Timing doesn't matter when it comes to happiness.  
If you feel comfortable, isn't that more than enough?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh, Miss Saren...!  
  
**Saren：**  
It makes me happy too, hearing such praise for my kids.  
Feel free to stay as long as you like.  
  
**Saren：**  
I don't like to let race sway me too much,  
but there's nothing wrong with us elves sticking together, is there?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well said, Miss Saren.  
My lord and I admire your attitude.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Yes, you made me feel a lot better.  
You're an amazing person, Miss Saren.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That's our Mama Saren!  
**Choice: (2)**  She's done so much for us, too.  
`Tag 1`  
**Saren：**  
Oh, don't you start calling me that too.  
I'm still only seventeen, you know!  
  
**Emilia：**  
S-seventeen...  
 I need to work much harder...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Saren：**  
Oh,  
 don't you start getting all polite.  
It's no big deal. We're basically family at this point.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh... Family... A fine word indeed.  
I can only pray that my lord and I too might share such a deep bond.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Still, I must say, Miss Saren,  
it is rare to see you at this hour of the day.  
  
**Saren：**  
I was called to take care of something at Nightmare...  
But I just had to drop in here on the way, to see all your faces.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Nightmare...? Are you an important person from the palace?  
  
**Saren：**  
Well, I wouldn't go that far.  
I used to be Nightmare's vice-captain, that's all.  
So they still call me in to take care of things sometimes.  
  
**Saren：**  
It seems recently, in a village near Landosol,  
there've been a few incidents involving  
strange sightings and disappearances.  
  
**Saren：**  
Nothing too awful has happened just yet,  
but we can't wait for that, can we?  
So I've been called to help look into it.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Disappearances, and strange sightings...  
Hey, Ram, Rem. You don't think this could be...  
  
**Ram：**  
I quite agree, Miss Emilia.  
It seems most likely that you're correct.  
  
**Rem：**  
The Sin Archbishop...  
  
**Saren：**  
...?  
What's the matter, all of you?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Listen, Miss Saren.  
After your meeting at the palace,  
could you share the details with us, too?  
  
**Rem：**  
The person behind those strange incidents  
might be one of the same people we're searching for.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh?  
 All right, then. Anything for you girls.  
I'll tell you all the details I can share.  
  
**Saren：**  
But don't do anything rash, all right?  
That's the one condition I really must set.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Mm, all right.  
We're counting on you, Miss Saren.  
  
**Saren：**  
Excellent. It's a promise!  
Then I'll head off now to the palace.  
You take care on your shopping trip, as well!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Miss Saren is such a splendid person.  
We're both elves, but I could never be like that...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please do not allow yourself  
to be disheartened by comparisons with others.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Saren is Miss Saren.  
And you have your own wonderful points, Miss Emilia.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh, Kokkoro...  
Yes... thank you. That does make me feel better.  
  
**Ram：**  
Our easily satisfied Miss Emilia aside,  
it sounds like word of the Witch Cult has reached the palace.  
  
**Rem：**  
Disappearances and sightings...  
What exactly could the Archbishop be plotting?  
  
**Emilia：**  
I can't answer that, but we should be careful.  
After all, we still haven't found any sign of Subaru, either.  
  
**Ram：**  
That boy causes problems wherever he goes.  
He's the king of troublemaking.  
  
**Rem：**  
Being a king of anything is a fine achievement!  
That's Subaru for you! His potential is boundless!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Rem, you certainly are fond of this Master Subaru.  
I can relate. I feel much the same way about my lord.  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes, Miss Kokkoro!  
I'm so glad to find someone who understands!  
  
**Ram：**  
Rem may be my perfect sister,  
but I will never be able to understand her taste in men.  
  
**Emilia：**  
At any rate, we should try to find Subaru quickly.  
It's almost as if he's making sure we don't find him on purpose.  
  
**Ram：**  
If he doesn't hurry, we might defeat the Archbishop  
and return home to the mansion without him.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh, silly Ram.  
You shouldn't be so mean!  
  
**???：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Hmm...?  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord? Why did you suddenly stop moving?  
The others will leave us behind at this rate.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh yes, we should move quickly!  
We have to finish the shopping Suzume asked of us,  
and get back to help out with work at the orphanage!  
  
**Rem：**  
Of course. You can leave all manner of cleaning and cooking to me!  
  
**Ram：**  
And I'll keep watch over you as you do it.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Kokkoro, will you hurry along with us?  
We need your help with all this shopping!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, of course I will.  
Well then, my lord, shall we?  
  
**???：**  
Whew, that sure was close.  
Thought I'd been spotted.  
 That guy's a sharp one...  
  
**???：**  
Now, this is where things kick off.  
I can't go messing this one up.  
 Fate, I'm coming for ya!
