**Emilia：**  
I feel a strange presence...  
The Sin Archbishop must be just ahead!  
  
**Ram：**  
Miss Emilia,  
that direction leads back to our carriage.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Huh? A-are you sure?!  
Then is he this way, maybe?  
  
**Rem：**  
Miss Emilia, I believe that path would take us  
out of the village entirely.  
  
**Emilia：**  
...  
  
**Ram：**  
Honestly. She really can be so hopeless.  
Miss Emilia, I think you had better follow after us.  
  
**Rem：**  
Um, I can smell the Witch's scent,  
so perhaps I should take the lead...  
  
**Emilia：**  
...Please, go ahead.
