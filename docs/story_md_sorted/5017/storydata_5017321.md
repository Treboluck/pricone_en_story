**Petelgeuse：**  
Curse you, curse you... Curse you, curse you, curse you!!!  
  
**Ram：**  
This seems to be working.  
Well then, let me follow up with my magic!  
  
**Rem：**  
Wait a moment, sister!  
The Witch's lingering scent is suddenly growing more potent!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
I cannot perishhhh... I cannot perish here!  
I must repay her love!  
For the Witch, the Witch, the Witch, the Witch, the Witch!!!  
  
**Emilia：**  
O-oh, no! His Unseen Hands are going wild!  
  
**Ram：**  
Perhaps he's preparing a last-ditch plan...  
Only a fool would charge in head-first.  
  
**Rem：**  
And yet we cannot keep our distance, either!  
What now...?!  
  
**Emilia：**  
It's okay. I know how we can deal with this!  
  
**Rem：**  
Miss Emilia? You have some kind of plan?  
  
**Emilia：**  
We just have to defeat him  
before his Unseen Hands can reach us!  
See? Very simple, isn't it?  
  
**Ram：**  
...I have many things I could say to that,  
but I suppose it's the best plan we've got.  
  
**Rem：**  
Then allow me to forge a path to the Sin Archbishop!
