# Sin Archbishop vs. Regina Geas
Realizing that the mysterious \"Nostradamus II\" must be Subaru, Emilia and her friends deduce from his prophecy that Petelgeuse presents an even greater threat than they thought. Together with the members of the Gourmet Guild, they set out to assist Christina and the rest of Nightmare in their battle with the Archbishop.
  
## Subtitle: Sin Archbishop vs. Regina Geas
  
**Ram：**  
Still, I must say, that noise in the night was quite a shock.  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes...  
I'm glad to hear it was nothing more  
than a toppling pile of pots.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I-I'm very sorryyy!  
It's my fault for ruining so many pots lately...  
  
**Suzume：**  
My failures caused you all to worry...  
I have no choice but to take my own life in apology...!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Don't make such strange declarations!  
It's all right. We were a little surprised, yes...  
But nothing happened in the end.  
 Right, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I met a guy called Nostradamus, but that's all.  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzume：**  
Ohhh, you're all too kind!  
I'll be more careful how I stack my broken pots in the future!  
  
**Rem：**  
Perhaps you should avoid breaking them to begin with...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Wait a minute.  
You mentioned him very casually just now,  
but who exactly is this \"Nostradamus\" person?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, true.  
My lord has so very many acquaintances,  
I almost let it slip by me as a matter of course.  
  
**Rem：**  
That's quite a remarkable-sounding name.  
Is this Mr. Nostradamus an old friend of yours, then?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Huh? You met him yesterday, outside the orphanage?  
While I was away investigating the sound of the broken pots?  
  
**Emilia：**  
But didn't you tell me  
you didn't see anyone while I was away?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, I see. You didn't see anyone \"bad,\" you said.  
That seems like a most understandable misunderstanding.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh, it's true!  
Thinking back, that was how he phrased it!  
  
**Ram：**  
Late night... A home for women and children...  
And a man lurking outside...  
 Clearly a disgusting pervert.  
  
**Emilia：**  
So...  
What did you talk to this man about?  
  
**Ram：**  
He called himself a prophet,  
and told you all sorts of far-fetched things...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Hold on, Ram.  
The way this prophet seems to talk... Could it be...?  
  
**Ram：**  
No need to finish that thought, Miss Emilia.  
My head was just starting to ache from the sound of it, as well.  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes, it has to be Subaru.  
I've actually thought something was strange since this morning.  
  
**Emilia：**  
This morning?  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes.  
I noticed it as soon as I took out the laundry.  
The Witch's scent, lingering around the orphanage.  
  
**Rem：**  
But I didn't sense any ill intent,  
and it seemed about the same strength as Subaru gives off, so...  
  
**Emilia：**  
*That's* why you've been so restless all day.  
You should have said something.  
  
**Rem：**  
But we did promise Miss Saren last night...  
And there was one thing that seemed strange...  
  
**Ram：**  
Something strange...  
Like why Barusu didn't contact us directly?  
  
**Rem：**  
If Subaru had arrived here,  
I can't see why he would not simply join us.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yet he left after speaking only to my lord...  
That does indeed seem somewhat unusual.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In the \"prophecy\" he gave, it seems he spoke of many things,  
but do his words mean anything to any of you?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Hmmm... If it was really Subaru,  
I'm sure he said those things for a very important reason, but...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I want to trust his words.  
**Choice: (3)**  He sounded really serious.  
`Tag 2`  
**Rem：**  
Yes, I wholeheartedly agree.  
Subaru does act rather strangely at times,  
but he is always working hard to help other people.  
  
**Ram：**  
I'd love to dismiss Rem's words as biased,  
but she's probably right that he has some strange plan.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Emilia：**  
Yes... he must have been.  
That's why you decided to trust him too, right?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If my lord wishes to trust this fellow,  
I too will regard the words he spoke with the utmost of significance.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Suzume：**  
Still, if we believe the prophecy,  
it means you're going to meet a green-haired man, right?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Yes... it does...  
I'm sure it can only mean that Sin Archbishop,  
but we already decided to sit back and leave him be...  
  
**Ram：**  
When you put it like that, we sound awful.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Anyway!  
I think we'll have to give this another proper discussion...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh? It sounds like someone's at the door.  
Hello~? Whoever could it be?  
  
**???：**  
Ahh! There you are! It's about time!  
We finally found you!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Karyl...?  
And is that Pecorine with you, too?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Waaahhh! Karyl's being so mean to me today!  
I was in the middle of a big meal when she dragged me out here!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, shut up!  
This is no time to sit around gobbling food!  
You're as involved as the rest of us, so lend us your brute strength!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I can't fight on an empty stomach~!  
  
**Emilia：**  
W-wait a minute. Calm down.  
It's not nice to be so rough with your friends.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I agree, Miss Karyl.  
You are making me feel sorry for Miss Pecorine.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Is this really the time to be saying that stuff?!  
We have an emergency on our hands!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  What happened?  
`Tag 5`  
**Karyl：**  
What do you think? *He* showed up!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
\"He,\"  
 referring to...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, come on!  
Why the heck do you think we came over to find you guys?!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Someone relevant to us...?  
 Do you mean...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yes, of course I do!  
We found that green-haired weirdo who bounced off through the air!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Whatever could all of this mean?  
While I was spreading my lady's good word,  
I seem to have been surrounded on all sides... How surprising.  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
I see, I see, yes. My, oh my...  
You certainly seem to have come well prepared!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah! But of course!  
Finally, I found you, black-cloaked terror!  
How I have longed for this fateful meeting!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Oh my!  
You sought after me, you say?  
 And look, you found me!  
I see... Truly, truly, truly!  
 You are a diligent soul!  
  
**Christina：**  
I am, aren't I? Keep the praise coming!  
I've been stuck with such boring missions lately.  
Nothing could make me happier than a new enemy like you!  
  
**Christina：**  
Affiliations, identity, objective, all unknown!  
A phantom cloaked in black and shrouded in mystery!  
Surely you will be the one to slay my accursed tedium!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Alas, I have my own duty to pursue!  
I did not come to this land to fulfill your wishes!  
And yet...  
  
**Christina：**  
And yet...  
 what?  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
If my path towards the goal I seek  
places the two of us in dire conflict, what choice have I?!  
If you obstruct my diligence,  
I must eliminate you and proceed, yes!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahahah!  
Good, very good! The perfect answer!  
You surpass my expectations! I was right to take on this mission!  
  
**Christina：**  
Now, let us do battle, my beloved foe!  
Do what you can to snuff out my life!  
Blades, or spells, or sinister curses? Which will it be?!  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
W-wait a minute, Vice-Captain!  
This is a recon mission. We're not supposed to engage—  
  
**Christina：**  
Do not bore me with your rules.  
Why would I need permission?  
 I'm your vice-captain!  
I decide if we advance or retreat! That is my very nature!  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
But what about the second report?!  
We have to find out more about whoever's working with him!  
  
**Christina：**  
All right, all right, I'll ask him.  
If we're both still alive, that is,  
at the end of our glorious struggle to the death!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Worthy resolve, yes. Hostility as sharp as a blade!  
Ahhh, if only the Gospel had chosen you,  
you would have made a fine believer...  
 Such a pity!  
  
**Christina：**  
I choose for myself what to believe in.  
I need nobody else's guidance.  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Then at the very least  
 you must fall here by my hand!  
When your corpse lies slothful before my diligence,  
your soul will surely become a fine offering to the Witch, yes!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hahah!  
 Let's begin, dark phantom!  
Release me from the endless tedium that plagues me so!  
  
**Karyl：**  
That weirdo is totally insane!  
There are more injuries and disappearances every day.  
Leave him at large, and things are only going to get worse.  
  
**Karyl：**  
So, Nightmare tracked him down  
and sent a unit to scout out the situation.  
Once the coast's clear, they'll take him out for good.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Take out the Sin Archbishop...?  
Still, Karyl, you're pretty amazing.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh...? Me, amazing? How d'you mean?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I quite agree. Your grasp of the situation is remarkable.  
Even learning the details of Nightmare's latest movements...  
Your keen insight is nothing less than a revelation to us all.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Seriously, you're so incredible, Karyl!  
 How crazy is that?!  
What's your secret? Is it those cute, fuzzy ears of yours?  
  
**Karyl：**  
A-  
ahahaha...  
 S-sure, that might be it!  
Really, I just caught wind of a few rumors, that's all!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Th-that was close...!  
I almost let them find out that I work at the royal palace...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Her Majesty wants me to get Pecorine and the others involved in this...  
I don't know what her reasons are, but can I convince them?  
  
**Emilia：**  
It's a little strange, though.  
Why would you bring this news straight to us, Karyl?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Urk!  
That's, uh... Um...  
 You know!  
I thought you'd want more info on the enemy from your world!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Well, you aren't wrong,  
but didn't we just decide that we would leave this to...  
  
**Rem：**  
Miss Emilia, if I may interrupt.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Rem?  
  
**Rem：**  
I do recall the promise we made to Miss Saren.  
However, Subaru's... Master Nostradamus's words...  
They concern me very deeply.  
  
**Ram：**  
A terrifying power that's dangerous to approach...  
It sounds patently ridiculous,  
but when has Barusu ever said anything that doesn't?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
At the very least, the members of Nightmare set out  
unaware of this new information we have learned.  
  
**Rem：**  
Surely that changes things.  
If the knights of Nightmare, unaware of this warning,  
were to perish at the hands of the Sin Archbishop...  
  
**Emilia：**  
That would be a very awful thing.  
But what can we do on our own?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  This is what guilds are for.  
`Tag 6`  
**Emilia：**  
Oh...  
That's just like what you said yesterday.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hm, I see. I don't really know the situation,  
but it sounds like you've all got something to do in a hurry!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Then the Gourmet Guild will lend you its strength!  
Our main objective is going on adventures to find tasty food...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But if we abandoned friends in need,  
we wouldn't even be able to enjoy our delicious meals!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-what she said!  
Okay, now quit your complaining  
and let's all head to the scene already!  
  
**Ram：**  
You're much too kind.  
But I won't hesitate to take advantage of that kindness.  
  
**Rem：**  
Ah, my wonderful sister.  
Nobody else could be so resolute and decisive!  
  
**Rem：**  
Of course, I agree as well.  
Facing the Witch Cult, and a Sin Archbishop, no less,  
is the perfect job for my portable morningstar!  
  
**Emilia：**  
You guys...  
Mm, all right. Let's do it, then.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Puck, did you hear all that?  
  
**Puck：**  
Well,  
 I did only just wake up...  
But I was listening, and it sounds pretty reckless.  
  
**Puck：**  
But I'm always on your side, Lia.  
If this is what you want, if you think it's right,  
your father will support you every step of the way.  
  
**Emilia：**  
...Thank you.  
Puck, and everyone else too!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Suzume, I'm sorry.  
I hate to disobey Miss Saren,  
 but we've made our decision.  
  
**Suzume：**  
A-all right!  
 I understand!  
I suppose I'll just have to report this to milady!  
Everyone, please try to stay safe out there!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Yes, please do.  
I'm sure Miss Saren will be very angry with us later, but...  
  
**Emilia：**  
...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Mm! All right, I think I'm ready!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Well then, let's go!  
Just for today, we're all fellow members of the Gourmet Guild!  
  
**All：**  
Yeah!
