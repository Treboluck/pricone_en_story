**Petelgeuse：**  
Impossible, impossible, impossible...!  
How can I lose... I, who am blessed with the Witch's love...?!  
  
**Ram：**  
Even after all this,  
he can still move... I have no words.  
Time for the final blow.  
  
**Emilia：**  
...Wait.  
  
**Rem：**  
Miss Emilia?  
  
**Emilia：**  
...Please, can you just surrender?  
There's still time for us to fix this.  
And there's something about you...  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
That face... Don't you talk to me with the Witch's face!!!  
  
**Rem：**  
...Miss Emilia, please dodge!  
  
**Emilia：**  
...Ahh?!  
  
**Ram：**  
Are you all right, Miss Emilia?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Y-yes...  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Ahhh, Lady Witch... Satella...!  
Give me your love, love, love, love, love!!!  
  
**Ram：**  
His Unseen Hands are writhing even wilder...  
I don't want to believe it,  
but I suppose he's powering up through sheer force of will.  
  
**Rem：**  
Please fall back, Miss Emilia.  
I will take care of that Archbishop.  
  
**Emilia：**  
It's all right, Rem.  
 I can do it. No, I think I *have* to do it.  
The Witch... And her Cult... As a candidate for the throne...  
  
**Emilia：**  
I can't let them drag this whole other world  
into our world's troubles any longer!
