Even with all those wounds, he's still attacking us...

To a Witch Cultist, pain, death... they don't mean a thing.

**Rem：**  
Miss Emilia, please fall back. It's dangerous.  
I will take care of this enemy.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Don't worry!  
I'm really strong too, you know!  
No matter who the enemy is, I'll show them what's what!
