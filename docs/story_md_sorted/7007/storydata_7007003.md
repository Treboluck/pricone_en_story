# The Gale Aficionado
Deeply impressed by Illya's knowledge of magic and the occult, Anna becomes excitable. She is overjoyed when it turns out that Illya has read The Gale Chronicles, but hastily stops {player} when he tries to reveal that she is the author.
  
## Subtitle: The Gale Aficionado
  
**Anna：**  
Now, Sigurd! Lend me your power!  
Take this! Cocytus Vein!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Anna：**  
Hah... Wretched creature!  
  
**Illya：**  
Well, well.  
 A frigid gale worthy of the name of Cocytus indeed.  
  
**Anna：**  
Ahhh... You perceive the true significance of my incantation?!  
Impressive, Lady Ornstein!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmph—more of them! Stechpalm!  
  
**Anna：**  
Next, how about...  
 Rising Zapper: VOID!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Illya：**  
Aha... \"Rising\" like the thunder god \"Raijin\"? How clever.  
A strike like lightning rising from the earth itself!  
Though the \"Void\" at the end does mystify me somewhat...  
  
**Anna：**  
Ahh... Ahhhh! You even noticed that?!  
Lady Ornstein, could we have met in a past life...?!  
  
**Illya：**  
Well, it sounded familiar somehow, is all...  
Ah, of course! That book I read the other day  
featured a remarkably similar incantation.  
  
**Anna：**  
Huh...?  
Wh-what book might that be...?!  
  
**Illya：**  
What was its name?  
 Let's see.  
Gale... Legends? Or was it \"Chronicles\"?  
  
**Anna：**  
Th... \"The Gale Chronicles\"?!  
  
**Illya：**  
Ah, yes! That was it! So you know of it also!  
Still, what a very amusing coincidence.  
To think the spell from that book is so similar to yours, Stechpalm!  
  
**Anna：**  
Um, yes... Isn't that funny...  
  
**Anna：**  
So, ah... Tell me.  
 What did a great mage like yourself  
think of these \"Gale Chronicles,\" if I might dare to ask...?  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmm. It seemed like an ancient journal of a warrior in a magical war.  
Not exactly a history book,  
 but a rewarding read nonetheless.  
  
**Illya：**  
The notion of \"memories from a past life\" particularly intrigued me!  
I may be long-lived, but even I do not predate this human world.  
Perhaps even I may possess unawakened memories from a lost age.  
  
**Anna：**  
R-really?  
 You enjoyed it?!  
  
**Illya：**  
Yes, it was fine reading material.  
A little outlandish in places, but the magic theory was most sound.  
A fabrication with elements of truth, perhaps! Or so I thought...  
  
**Illya：**  
But now, I find you, Stechpalm—a user of those exact same spells.  
It is true that legends are oft plain history with a smattering of  
embellishments. Perhaps these wild tales are not so far from the truth!  
  
**Anna：**  
I... I see... Interesting, very interesting...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You look happy.  
`Tag 1`  
**Anna：**  
I-indeed... To be acknowledged by a legendary vampire...  
It makes me feel most bashful indeed!  
  
**Illya：**  
It was so intriguing!  
'Twould be such a treat to meet this work's author.  
Would it not?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Shall I introduce you?  
`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
Hm? Truly?  
Do you actually know the wordsmith in question?  
  
**Anna：**  
Ahh! Ahh! Aaahhh!  
Sigurd! Do you see strange movements over there?!  
  
**Illya：**  
What's this? Enemies?  
Show me—where did you spy them?  
  
**Anna：**  
Now listen, Sigurd!  
The authorship of that book is to be our little secret! Understood?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  But why?  
`Tag 3`  
**Anna：**  
Because I'd die of embarrassment, of course!  
Really, don't you tell her! Don't breathe a single word!  
  
**Illya：**  
How dull. There were no enemies at all.  
Hm? Is something the matter?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  The author of that book is...  
`Tag 4`  
**Anna：**  
What did I *just* say?! Why, you... you...!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so {player} found himself pummeled  
by Anna's flailing fists.
