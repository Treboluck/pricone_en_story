# Battle of the Tome
In a dream, Illya and Anna set their sights on the same book in a library. They summon their respective minions to do battle, but are reprimanded by an angry librarian and forced to leave. Ultimately, {player} takes out the book and they read it together in the park.
  
## Subtitle: Battle of the Tome
  
**Illya：**  
Whew... Was that the last of this area's beasts?  
And yet our prize, it seems, eludes us still...  
  
**Anna：**  
Ohh...? Lady Ornstein, what's that over there?

**Illya：**  
A strange gleaming object...  
Could this be the so-called key that we seek?!  
  
**Anna：**  
Ahhh! So, Sigurd, this is your Lost Memoire!  
  
`image display end`  
**Illya：**  
Waaagh?! What is this light?!  
  
**Anna：**  
A-a blinding glare! Ngh... Is it a Syndicate attack?!  
  

---  
  
**Illya：**  
Ah! How fortuitous to meet you here.  
Are you unoccupied?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sure, I'm free.  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
Yes, yes! But of course you are!  
When have I ever seen you with plans to attend to?  
  
**Illya：**  
I was just searching for a place where many books can be found.  
Oh? You can take me to such a location? Most excellent!  
  
**Illya：**  
Ah, so this is the district library.  
Hmm... With this many tomes to inspect,  
I may indeed be able to find what I seek!  
  
**Illya：**  
What am I after exactly?  
Well, of course, as the Ruler of the Night,  
my only goal is to recover my true strength of old!  
  
**Illya：**  
I have inspected varied tomes on the subject of vampirism...  
But as you know, my true power far exceeds any ordinary vampire.  
As such, I thought writings on dark magic might better serve my needs.  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmm... Would it be that section?  
Come, let us search!  
  
**Anna：**  
Nghh... It seems I have escaped the Syndicate's claws for now...  
I must conceal myself in this house of knowledge  
to ready my counterattack.  
  
**Anna：**  
Could this be where I will uncover it, perchance?  
The tome that will unlock my sealed soul  
and unleash the true extent of my power as Hecate of the Gale?!  
  
**Anna：**  
Oh! If it isn't Sigurd!  
Could it be that you are seeking arcane tomes also?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Something like that.  
`Tag 2`  
**Anna：**  
I see! Pursuing my wishes before I say a word...  
I knew I could count on you, Sigurd!  
  
**Anna：**  
Hm?! I sense a dark presence! Is it calling out to me?  
Very well! The inimitable Annerose von Stechpalm  
will accept your shadowy invitation!  
  
**Illya：**  
How goes it? Have you found any likely volumes?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  \"Dark Powers and Where to Find Them\"  
`Tag 3`  
**Illya：**  
Th-that is it!  
That tome will surely show me the path to recover my strength!  
  
**Anna：**  
Ohhh! Is this the gospel of some stygian deity?!  
The key to my awakening lies at hand!  
  
**Both：**  
...Hm?  
  
**Illya：**  
What are you doing?  
That book is intended for me alone.  
  
**Anna：**  
Nonsense! This tome is in resonance with my Evil Eye!  
Thus, it is my fate to possess it!  
  
**Illya：**  
Nghhhh...  
  
**Anna：**  
Grrr...  
  
**Illya：**  
Minion! Remove this irritation!  
  
**Anna：**  
Sigurd! Do something about this little girl!  
  
**Illya：**  
E-excuse me?!  
 This man is my minion to command!  
Who exactly do you think you are?!  
  
**Anna：**  
Hah... You ask my true name?  
Very well! Hear it and quail in terror! For I am...  
  
**Anna：**  
Regent of the Order of Gehenna Immortals, Darkest Knight,  
and hero who tamed the fires of Ragnarök!  
 It is I, Hecate of the Gale!  
Or perhaps you know me by the name of Annerose von Stechpalm!  
  
**Illya：**  
Um, none of those sound familiar...  
Nonetheless, something about you does seem different  
from the average mortal.  
  
**Anna：**  
Oh... You sense my power?  
Then you would do well to withdraw, lest you perish at my hand!  
  
**Illya：**  
But I am the true Ruler of the Night, Illya Ornstein!  
I have naught to fear from a human!  
 Go forth, my minions!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Um, should I do something?  
`Tag 4`  
**Illya：**  
Heheheh... I speak not of you.  
Behold!  
  
**Bats：**  
Skreeeeeee!  
  
**Librarian：**  
Aaaaagh! Why is there a swarm of bats in the library?!  
  
**Anna：**  
Whaaat?! You command denizens of the dark?!  
It would seem you too are no mundane opponent!  
  
**Illya：**  
Heheheheheh!  
How's that?! Do you tremble in fear?!  
  
**Anna：**  
If this is how you wish it, I must unleash my strength as well!  
The hour is at hand! Evil Eye, Open!  
  
**Anna：**  
In accordance with the ancient covenant,  
may the forbidden gate be opened!  
Come forth from Valhalla and bare thy fangs! Hound of Purgatorio!  
  
**Dog：**  
Woof.  
  
**Librarian：**  
Aaaghh! Now there's a dog indoors!  
  
**Anna：**  
Well met, my faithful Hellhound!  
Now, unleash your wrath upon this dark being!  
...H-hold on! Treats come *after* you... H-hey! Stop! Stoooop!  
  
**Illya：**  
Heheheh... It seems you cannot control your beast!  
Now's our chance! Take her down!  
  
**Bats：**  
Skreeeeeee!  
  
**Illya：**  
Guooohhh! B-but why?! Why are you all flying towards me?!  
Enough! Stop that! St... stop, I say!  
  
**Anna：**  
Wh-what now, Hellhound? Why are you trembling like that...  
Hold on! Wait a moment! That's not good! We're indoors!  
Y-you can't...  
  
**Librarian：**  
What is wrong with you people?!  
  
**Dog：**  
Ruff ruff!  
  
**Bats：**  
Skreeee...!  
  
**Illya：**  
D-do not flee, my minions!  
 Ohhhh, why will you not listen?!  
  
**Anna：**  
H-Hellhooooound! Here, boy! Come here!  
  
**Librarian：**  
Now, see here! This is a public library!  
All of this shouting and playing with animals...  
Do you have no manners at all?!  
  
**Illya：**  
H-hands off! Do not pull me!  
 U-unhand meeee!  
Minion! You will rescue me forthwith!  
  
**Librarian：**  
You, too! If you cause any more trouble, I'll be contacting your parents!  
  
**Anna：**  
Wha—?!  
M-my name is Stechpalm!  
As a lone warrior of legend, I have no parents or little brothers...  
  
**Librarian：**  
That uniform... You're from Irene Girls' Academy.  
How about I give your school a call?  
  
**Anna：**  
A-anything but thaaaaat!  
  
**Librarian：**  
You're a big girl, so keep your little sister under control.  
Now, I won't tell anyone about this incident,  
but you're both banned for a month.  
  
**Anna：**  
L-little sister?!  
  
**Illya：**  
I-I am no little sister!  
Furthermore, I must have that book, or—  
  
**Librarian：**  
Are we quite clear?  
  
**Both：**  
Y-yes, ma'am...  
  
**Anna：**  
I did not expect to face such a fearsome guardian...  
  
**Illya：**  
Ughhh! This is not over!  
When this world becomes mine, that woman will have no place  
in my court! Perhaps I will make her clean the dog litter!  
  
**Anna：**  
Still, I was impressed.  
The way you summoned all those dark denizens  
like some kind of vampire queen!  
  
**Illya：**  
I must say I also found your summoning quite remarkable for a human.  
But alas, it seems we have lost the clue to my powers...  
  
**Anna：**  
Hm? Did you want something, Sigurd?  
  
**Illya：**  
Ohhh! You checked out the book on your own account?  
Excellent! Such faithful service!  
Come, then—let me peruse the words within!  
  
**Anna：**  
No, me! I need to read that book without fail!  
Which of us are you going to give it to, Sigurd?!  
  
**Both：**  
Nghhhhh...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  How about this?  
`Tag 5`  

---  
  
![700700501.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/700700501.webp)  
**Illya：**  
Hm... I suppose this does permit all three of us to read it.  
However do you think of these things?  
  
**Anna：**  
It seems a little cramped, though...  
Should our faces and whatnot really be so close?  
  
**Illya：**  
I have no objection.  
Please, come as close as you wish.  
  
**Anna：**  
W-well, I suppose I must if I am to read the tome...  
Urgh, I can't focus on the contents...  
  
**Illya：**  
Hey, no turning the page!  
I was still partway through that section.  
  
**Anna：**  
I-I am sorry...  
Sigurd, do you understand this book's contents?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  It's as clear as day!  
**Choice: (7)**  It's all Greek to me...  
`Tag 6`  
**Illya：**  
Oh... You have a sharp mind!  
The writing is so oblique, I can barely grasp half of the author's intent.  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmm? It's as clear as day... that you'll never understand it?  
Honestly! That's just like you...  
  
Jump to tag 8  
`Tag 7`  
**Anna：**  
I... I see.  
To think a simple tome like this mystifies you.  
Your memories of the former age must still be firmly sealed away!  
  
`Tag 8`  
**Illya：**  
Hmmm. I feel no magical power from the book either.  
Perhaps this was a dud after all.  
Still... I must say I find this situation... pleasing somehow.  
  
**Anna：**  
Y-yes... I suppose.  
We could stay like this a little longer...  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmm? What's this, {player}? You appear drowsy.  
  
**Anna：**  
Mmnhhh... Ahh... Actually, same here...  
  
**Illya：**  
Haha... How hopeless you both are.  
Seeing you like this  
 is making me feel a little sleepy too.  
*yawwwn*...  
  

---  
  
`image display end`  
**Illya：**  
*yawwwn*...  
Mnhh? It appears I must have fallen asleep...  
  
**Anna：**  
That dream... Was it from Sigurd's memories?  
But not only was I there, so was Lady Ornstein...  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmm... This is mere speculation on my part, but...  
Could it be we glimpsed memories of a former life,  
like those seen in The Gale Chronicles?  
  
**Anna：**  
C-can it be...?!  
  
**Illya：**  
It seems perfectly natural that the two of us and {player}  
would have met in another world.  
  
**Illya：**  
What surprised me most was when you and I, Stechpalm,  
were addressed as sisters!  
Could it be that long ago, in a past life, we really were related?  
  
**Anna：**  
D-do you think?  
You may be overanalyzing that part, Lady Ornstein...  
  
**Illya：**  
At this point, it feels oddly formal for you to address me that way.  
Young Stechpalm... nay, Anna! You may refer to me as Illya.  
  
**Anna：**  
W-well, sure, if you say so. But...  
  
**Illya：**  
My powers may yet be lost to me,  
 but perhaps today  
I recovered a still greater treasure! Hahahahahah!  
  
**Anna：**  
Sigurd... Umm, do you think we should properly explain to her...?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  I'm so happy for you.  
`Tag 9`  
**Anna：**  
Wait, wait, wait, wait!  
Is that really the appropriate reaction?!  
  
**Illya：**  
It is a pleasure to meet you, Anna.  
Hahahahahah!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so the halls of the Tower of Luna  
were filled with the sound of Anna's protests and Illya's laughter.
