## Subtitle: Hecate of the Gale and the Legendary Vampire
  
**Narration：**  
Today, {player} has set out for the Tower of Luna  
to continue searching for the keys to his lost memories  
with Illya, who seeks a way to restore her own true strength.  
  
**Narration：**  
Along the way, they run into Anna wandering around town  
in search of inspiration for her novels, and so the three of them  
head to the Tower of Luna's entrance together.  
  
**Anna：**  
So, Sigurd, this is the fabled Tower of Luna  
where your memories are sealed...  
Heheh... I feel it... A tingling deep in my Evil Eye!  
  
**Illya：**  
Ho-hoh... This is quite the imposing structure.  
I trust you are fully prepared?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Of course.  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
Hmm, most admirable.  
And what of you, Miss... \"Living Storm,\" was it?  
  
**Anna：**  
Ah yes, I must introduce myself properly!  
My name is Annerose von Stechpalm! Better known  
as Hecate of the Gale!  
 But you may call me as you wish!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmm. Then I shall address you as Stechpalm.  
Incidentally, by \"Sigurd,\" are you referring to {player}?  
  
**Anna：**  
Naturally! He is the Zweiritter of the Order of Gehenna Immortals,  
my sworn foe yet true comrade in a world now lost...  
The one and only Sigurd of the Fulgor!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmmm...  
 You are an intriguing one, to be sure.  
I should expect no less from a friend of {player}'s.  
  
**Anna：**  
I must say, the title of \"legendary vampire\"  
is quite the fine appellation as well!  
That's my Sigurd—unflinching in the face of devilry!  
  
**Illya：**  
Ah, of course. I should provide an introduction myself.  
My name is Illya.  
The Ruler of the Night, Illya Ornstein.  
  
**Anna：**  
Then allow me to address you as Lady Ornstein.  
Hahahah... a true name brimming with great demonic energy!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Does that cover the introductions?  
`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
Yes... It is time we ventured within.  
  
**Illya：**  
Any artifacts concealing your memories  
will surely aid me in my own search for the powers I have lost.  
  
**Anna：**  
Then let us conquer the Tower of Luna as one!  
Order of Gehenna Immortals, go forth!
