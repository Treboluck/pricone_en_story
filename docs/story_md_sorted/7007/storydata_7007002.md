# Banquet of Minions
Showing open curiosity about Illya's vampiric nature, Anna learns that {player} is her minion. Neglecting to mention that she does not drink blood, Illya invites Anna to become her minion as well, but Anna is too scared to agree.
  
## Subtitle: Banquet of Minions
  
**Anna：**  
B-by the way, as a legendary vampire,  
do you have minions of your own, Lady Ornstein?  
  
**Illya：**  
Heheheh... But of course—I would be amiss not to.  
As it so happens, {player} is my most loyal minion!  
  
**Anna：**  
Wh-whaaaat?! My sworn comrade of ages past  
has been transformed into this demon's bloodkin?!  
How strange fate can be!  
 Wait, but then... Are you all right?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  How do you mean?  
`Tag 1`  
**Anna：**  
W-well, you know how it is...  
It must take a... toll on your body, mustn't it?!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmm, let's see now.  
Young Stechpalm. I sense great potential in you.  
If you so desire, I would be willing to make you my minion also.  
  
**Illya：**  
This is a privilege I offer only to the truly worthy.  
You would do well not to squander this opportunity!  
  
**Anna：**  
Me, a legendary vampire's minion?!  
I-I'm not sure... *glance*  
  
**Anna：**  
Wouldn't becoming her minion mean... being bitten? By those fangs?  
They look so vicious... My blood would spray everywhere...!  
  
**Illya：**  
Well, young Stechpalm?  
Come, {player}, speak on my behalf!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Wanna be minion buddies?  
`Tag 2`  
**Anna：**  
N-no! Alas, I must refuse!  
I wish to remain not a minion in your service but a faithful friend!  
It's certainly not that I'm afraid of blood, or anything like that...  
  
**Anna：**  
B-besides, you don't want my blood!  
I haven't caught many bounties lately, so I'm not eating well!  
I'm sure my blood wouldn't be as tasty as Sigurd's!  
  
**Illya：**  
Oh...? You wish to be a friend to me?  
 A bold proposal!  
I should expect no less from Hecate of the Gale, eh, Stechpalm?!  
  
**Illya：**  
In that case, I suppose I shall feed upon  
{player}'s blood for today!  
Come, give me your neck, minion.  
  
**Anna：**  
Wha—?! S-Sigurd...  
 Siguuuuurd!  
P-please, not that! If you need blood, take mine... W-wait, but... Urghhh!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  She never actually drinks my blood.  
`Tag 3`  
**Anna：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Illya：**  
Hahahahah! Just my little joke.  
  
**Anna：**  
But... you truly are a vampire, are you not?  
Would being a vampire's minion not usually imply...  
  
**Illya：**  
For some reason, I care little for blood lately...  
  
**Illya：**  
Simply touching {player} restores my magic,  
which is frankly far more efficient.  
  
**Anna：**  
I-is that right...?  
Ahhh... You scared me...  
  
**Illya：**  
Eheheh. Still, to think Hecate of the Gale is afraid of a little blood!  
A rather adorable weakness, I must say.  
Hahahahahah!  
  
**Anna：**  
O-of course blood does not cause me any discomfort!  
I was merely concerned that the dark magicks in my blood  
would surely ravage you from within...  
  
**Anna：**  
Sigurd, help me explain to her! Please!
