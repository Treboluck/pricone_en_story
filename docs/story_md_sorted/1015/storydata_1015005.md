# Misato Episode 5
Misato, in the midst of recovering from a cold, falls asleep with {player} in mind. She dreams about their time together, only for him to be by her side when she wakes up.
  
## Subtitle: Always in My Heart
  
**Narration：**  
Misato is making preparations for an upcoming reading session.  
  
**Misato：**  
Hm. What should I bring with me this time?  
Last time was a story about a wizard, so...  
  
**Misato：**  
*cough, cough*  
Oh. Don't tell me I'm coming down with a cold.  
  
**Misato：**  
That's not ideal.  
I'd much rather not spread it,  
but I also don't want to let all the children down...  
  
**Misato：**  
*cough*  
I should feel better by the time I arrive,  
so let's get go—  
  
**Misato：**  
Hm? ...Oh my.  
  
**Misato：**  
*sigh* Collapsing wasn't quite within the scope of my plans.  
Though it's my fault for not taking better care of myself.  
  
**Misato：**  
I made sure someone sent word about the reading session  
being cancelled, so it *should* be okay. And as terrible about it as I  
feel, the last thing I want is to exacerbate the situation.  
  
**Misato：**  
It's so quiet...  
Usually I either have the children or him with me,  
so it's rare for me to be by myself.  
  
**Misato：**  
I wonder what {player}'s doing...  
  
**Misato：**  
Hm? Why is he the first thing that came to mind...?  
But well, I do want to see him...  
Getting sick always leaves me feeling so lonely.  
  
**Misato：**  
Hehe. He was the one that had collapsed when we first met.  
And then I came upon him by chance.  
I wonder if he felt as distressed as I do right now?  
  
**Misato：**  
Mmm... {player}...  
  

---  
  
**Misato：**  
Right. This is where we first met.  
He went and plopped a poisonous mushroom into his mouth.  
That's why I started taking care of him.

**Misato：**  
Oh. This is where we made the crowns together.  
He worked so hard to learn for the children's sake.  
  
**Misato：**  
I still have the crown he gave  
to me hanging up in my house.  
  
**Misato：**  
A present with that much  
heart will always feel special.

**Misato：**  
It's normal for children to ask where  
babies come from,  
but I can understand why  
an amnesiac like him would be curious as well.  
  
**Misato：**  
If he can't even remember his own mother's face,  
then the least I can do is be something of a surrogate for him.  
I want to protect him. That's what I told myself.  
  
**Misato：**  
I wanted to help him make some good memories for himself.  
But it turns out that he's the one doing that for me.  
  
**Misato：**  
What I wouldn't give to see him right now...  
  
**Misato：**  
I'm not sure what this is,  
but it's a nice, warm feeling...  
It's oddly familiar, now that I think about it.  
Is this—  
  

---  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh... Did I fall asleep?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  How are you feeling?  
**Choice: (2)**  Good morning, sleeping beauty.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misato：**  
Oh, {player}...  
There you are.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Misato：**  
Oh, if it isn't {player}.  
Good morning.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Misato：**  
You've... been holding my hand this entire time?  
That explains things.  
  
**Misato：**  
Hehe. Pretend I didn't say anything.  
What brings you here, though?  
I made sure to relay that the reading session was cancelled...  
  
**Misato：**  
You rushed here when you heard I was sick?  
My, my. No need to panic that much.  
  
**Misato：**  
But, well... I'm glad you came.  
I was hoping to see you again, myself. ♪  
  
**Misato：**  
The fever had me feeling lonely.  
Which led to me thinking about you.  
  
**Misato：**  
I never expected you to actually turn up, though.  
But that just goes to show  
how kind you really are.  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh! Oh my!  
I'm so sorry.  
The relief over seeing your face made me all hungry.  
How embarrassing...  
  
**Misato：**  
There's nothing quite as honest as a person's stomach, is there?  
I haven't eaten anything since this morning, so let me  
whip something up. Would you care to join me?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'll make it.  
`Tag 4`  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. You will?  
I'll take you up on that, then.  
  
**Misato：**  
Hehe. Looks like I'll be the one  
getting spoiled today. ♪  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus Misato made steady progress towards recovery,  
partly due to {player}'s efforts in taking care of her.
