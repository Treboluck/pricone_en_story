**Narration：**  
Misato is telling {player}  
about the children she's taking care of.  
  
**Misato：**  
That one over there's quite the handful.  
He gets jealous if he sees me patting any of the other children.  
  
**Misato：**  
I let the others rest their heads on my lap quite often,  
and he always looks like he wants to try it as well.  
Except he runs away whenever I beckon him over.  
  
**Misato：**  
There's all sorts of children here,  
but I treat them all like my very own.  
  
**Misato：**  
Hehe. ♪Would you like to use my lap as a pillow, too?  
It comes highly recommended by the children.  
Come on. No need to be shy. ♪  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my.  
You seem to be awfully shiny, {player}.

**Boy：**  
Waaahhh! Waaahhh!  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. That looked painful.  
Don't worry, though. I'll make it all better.  
Pain, pain, go away! ♪  
  
**Boy：**  
*sniff* *hic*  
Hehe... Ehehe. ♪  
Thanks, Miss Misato!  
  
**Misato：**  
Not at all, my little friend.  
You wiped your own tears away.  
That's incredibly brave of you.  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh? If it isn't {player}.  
Hello there. On one of your patented walks, perhaps?  
  
**Boy：**  
Miss Misato! Lemme lay on your lap!  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. Yes, yes. You sure love to be spoiled, don't you?  
Hehe. Sorry. It's playtime for the children right now.  
  
**Misato：**  
How about you join us?  
I'm sure the children will love it.  
  
**Boy：**  
Hey! Are you here for some lap action, too?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Lap action?  
**Choice: (2)**  You bet I am.  
`Tag 1`  
**Boy：**  
Yeah! No one gives better lap pillows than her!  
It's like... you get all these fluffy, warm feelings!  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. Hearing that puts a smile on my face.

`Tag 2`  
**Boy：**  
I knew it! She gives the best lap pillows!  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. Someone else is looking to be spoiled, I see. ♪  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Boy：**  
You can go first, then!  
I've gotten to do it loads already!  
  
**Misato：**  
Well, well.  
Aren't you kind?  
  
**Misato：**  
Hehe. ♪ Now then, {player}.  
Welcome to Miss Misato's lap.  
  
**Misato：**  
How is it?  
All the children love it.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Humanity lacks the vocabulary to describe this.  
`Tag 4`  
**Misato：**  
Oh, you! ♪  
Looking for some extra attention, are we?  
Just call me \"Mama,\" then.  
  
**Boy：**  
Wow! You two are all lovey-dovey!  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. Who's been a bad influence on you?  
  
**Boy：**  
My mom and dad! They're always super lovey-dovey!  
  
**Misato：**  
Well then. That's good to hear.  
  
**Boy：**  
Yeah!  
Mom and dad always kiss and stuff, though.  
How about you two? You should smooch!  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my! Whatever shall we do?

**Ameth：**  
And there we have it. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Think of what you just saw as something of a dream.  
Chances are you'll forget about it as soon as you wake up,  
so no need to brood over it that much.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Talk about getting spoiled, though.  
Don't you think you're a bit too old for that?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Sent shivers right down my spine, if I'm being honest.  
Moreso since you seemed into it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
If anything, though,  
it's just proof that  
Misato more than lives up to her \"saint\" moniker.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Wouldn't mind having a teacher like that to take care of me, too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oops. Let's stop this conversation right here.  
As for you, don't let people spoil you too much, okay? Bye-bye.  
  

---  
  
**Misato：**  
Hm... Oh?  
Oh my. Looks like we both fell asleep together.  
  
**Misato：**  
I seem to remember dreaming about giving you a lap pillow, too.  
Did we talk about something similar before falling asleep?  
  
**Misato：**  
You had the same dream?  
Oh my! That's quite the coincidence!  
  
**Misato：**  
Hehe. ♪  
How about we turn that dream into reality?  
  
**Misato：**  
I'm more than fine with it.  
Let yourself get spoiled now and then. ♪  
  
**Misato：**  
Just call me \"Mama.\"  
  
**Narration：**  
Though elated over his current predicament,  
{player} found himself a little bit embarrassed as well.
