**Narration：**  
Misato and {player} have  
made their way to the Elven Forest for a picnic.  
  
**Misato：**  
Hehe.  
Perfect weather for a picnic, isn't it? ♪  
  
**Misato：**  
And being able to relax together like this is nice, too.  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh. That reminds me.  
I made some food for you today.  
Think of it as my way of  
saying thanks for everything you've done for me recently.  
  
**Misato：**  
Hopefully you'll like it...  
This spot should do.  
  
**Misato：**  
Hehe. Do you recognize this place?  
It's where we first met.  
  
**Misato：**  
Back when you took a big mouthful of a poisonous mushroom.  
That brings back lots of memories.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Thanks for your help back then.  
**Choice: (2)**  Sure was a numbing experience.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misato：**  
Not at all, not at all.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Misato：**  
It certainly left your entire body numb, at the very least.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Misato：**  
You have no idea how worried I was that day.  
I don't want to see you eating anything  
off the ground again, you hear?  
  
**Misato：**  
Hehe. ♪ Let's get started, otherwise you might go  
searching for some mushrooms again.  
  
**Misato：**  
I put in plenty of things you like,  
so no need to hold back.  
  
**Misato：**  
Hands together, now.  
May we give thanks for—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my! That was quite the surprise!  
  
**Monster：**  
...  
  
**Misato：**  
Hm? It's quite the tame one.  
Is something wrong with it, maybe?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Chances are it's hungry.  
`Tag 4`  
**Misato：**  
Well, that's not good. Let's share some of our food with it.  
Here you go. Eat up, my little friend. ♪  
  
**Monster：**  
Groar! Groar!  
  
**Misato：**  
Ehehe. It sure seems to be enjoying it.  
It must have been really hungry.  
  
**Misato：**  
My, my. Hehe. What is it?  
Do you want me to pet you?  
Awww. You're such a little cutie.  
  
**Monster：**  
Grohhh...  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh. Are you satisfied?  
Hehe. Take care, then.  
  
**Misato：**  
I have to say, I'm surprised you noticed it was hungry.  
Very impressive.  
  
**Misato：**  
Hm? You learned how to pick up on  
what other people want after spending time with me?  
  
**Misato：**  
My, my.  
I just let my desire to help others  
take control and act from there.  
  
**Misato：**  
Hehe. Now you've got me all embarrassed, though.  
  
**Misato：**  
Now then, let's get back to eating.  
Hands together, now.  
May we give thanks for this delicious food.  
  
**Misato：**  
Here you go. Say \"ahh.\"  
Hehe. How is it?  
  
**Misato：**  
That's a relief. There's still plenty left.  
  
**Misato：**  
Don't forget to eat your greens, too.  
Hehe. Now that's a good boy.  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. You've got some on your face.  
I'll eat that right up. Hehe.  
  
**Misato：**  
You wolfed that down, didn't you?  
That appetite of yours never ceases to impress me.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  It was delish.  
`Tag 5`  
**Misato：**  
Excellent. Thank you. ♪  
My, my. That was quite the big yawn.  
  
**Misato：**  
I bet you're tired after gobbling all that up, aren't you?  
Hehe. Relaxing is our main goal today, so...  
  

---  
  
**Misato：**  
My lap's ready anytime you are. Don't be shy, now.  
  
**Misato：**  
There we go. Good night, and sleep tight.  
I'll keep a firm eye on you while you sleep.  
  
**Misato：**  
Hehe. That was quick.  
He's so cute when he's asleep, too.  
  
**Misato：**  
He really has come so far.  
Not that he wasn't kind before,  
but today and other recent events make it more than apparent.  
  
**Misato：**  
Now he's as reliable as they come.  
  
**Misato：**  
Enough so that he probably doesn't need me anymore.  
Hehe. The thought's leaving me a bit blue.  
  
**Misato：**  
Maybe it's time to let him go...  
Or so I say, but he's already become self-dependent.  
  
**Misato：**  
You know, I...  
  
**Misato：**  
Silly me.  
This isn't the sort of thing I should be  
saying when he's still asleep.  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus the two of them enjoyed a quiet day together,  
soothed by the silence of the forest.
