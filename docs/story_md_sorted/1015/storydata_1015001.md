**Narration：**  
Misato is on patrol around the forest as part of her guild duties.  
  
**Misato：**  
Hm...  
I'd heard reports of monsters lurking around these parts,  
but nothing seems out of the ordinary to me.  
  
**Misato：**  
This is a popular spot for the children, though.  
I'd rather not let even the slightest thing slip by.  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh? Oh my!  
Someone's collapsed over there!  
  
**Misato：**  
Are you okay?  
What happened here?  
Don't worry. You can confide in me.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  My entire body's paralyzed.  
**Choice: (2)**  I took a big bite of a mushroom.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misato：**  
Paralyzed, you say? Oh my.  
Did you eat anything strange, perhaps?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Misato：**  
A mushroom? Oh my.  
That might just be the reason.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Misato：**  
It must have been a poisonous mushroom.  
Surely its appearance should have been a warning sign?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Tell that to my empty stomach.  
`Tag 4`  
**Misato：**  
Poor little thing.  
Let me heal you right up.  
  
**Misato：**  
Stay still for me, I'll make it qui—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRRAAAAGGHHH!  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my! You certainly popped out of nowhere, didn't you?  
You gave me a big old fright.  
  
**Misato：**  
Be a good boy and wait here for me, okay?  
I'll have a little chat with our friend over there.  
  
**Misato：**  
Good day.  
You must be the friendly little monster  
roaming around here lately.  
  
**Misato：**  
I'm terribly sorry, but you've been scaring the children.  
Would you mind if I asked you to—  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. You're in no state to be leaping onto the front line.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAGHHHH!  
  
**Misato：**  
Now now, my little friend.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my! Are you okay?  
  
**Misato：**  
I'm sorry, my little friend.  
You must have been so startled.  
There, there. Who's a good little monster?  
  
**Monster：**  
Grrr...  
  
**Misato：**  
Don't worry.  
There's nothing to be afraid of.  
  
**Misato：**  
It's about time you go back home.  
I'm sure your parents are worried sick about you.  
  
**Monster：**  
*whine*  
  
**Misato：**  
Phew... I'm glad it was a well-behaved monster.  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. You went and got yourself hurt.  
That's what happens when you push yourself too much.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I couldn't ignore the monster.  
`Tag 5`  
**Misato：**  
So you were trying to protect me?  
How kind of you.  
  
**Misato：**  
I must say, that makes me quite happy.  
Thank you.  
  
**Misato：**  
What a brave little soul you are.  
There, there.  
  
**Misato：**  
Pain, pain, go away! ♪  
  
**Misato：**  
Hehe. How do you feel?  
That should have taken care of both the poison and your wounds.  
  
**Misato：**  
Yes. You seem fine enough.  
I really am quite surprised, though.  
  
**Misato：**  
That mushroom you ate is rather well-known  
all over the continent. Even if its appearance didn't  
put you off, I'd expect you to be aware of it...  
  
**Misato：**  
Even monsters do their best to stay away from it,  
which makes it all the more surprising.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Being an amnesiac probably doesn't help.  
`Tag 6`  
**Misato：**  
Oh my, oh my!  
Now it all makes sense.  
  
**Misato：**  
You poor little thing.  
I'm sure you've been through a lot...  
  
**Misato：**  
That said.  
It takes quite the mental fortitude to pick up a  
mushroom straight from the ground and eat it.  
  
**Misato：**  
Usually it's only children that  
throw anything and everything into their mouths...  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my.  
I just had a wonderful idea. ♪  
  
**Misato：**  
There's a nursery in the elven village, you see.  
And I just so happen to be a teacher there.  
  
**Misato：**  
So my question is...  
Would you be willing to let me become your teacher?  
  
**Misato：**  
I'd rather avoid you eating another poisonous mushroom.  
Plus, I can teach you all sorts of other useful things.  
  
**Misato：**  
This is just a suggestion, of course.  
There's no need to feel pressured.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Sign me up.  
`Tag 7`  
**Misato：**  
Oh my! Good to hear it.  
I look forward to teaching you.  
  
**Misato：**  
Please call me Miss Misato. ♪  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus {player} became  
one of Misato's lovely students.
