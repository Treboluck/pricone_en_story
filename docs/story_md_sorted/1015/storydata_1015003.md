**Narration：**  
{player} is accompanying Misato on her way  
to an organized picture book reading.  
  
**Misato：**  
I'm honestly glad you came along with me.  
  
**Misato：**  
I've got lots more books than usual today,  
so carrying them all on my own would have been difficult.  
  
**Misato：**  
Thank you for agreeing to help.  
You're such a good boy.  
  
**Misato：**  
I've always thought of picture books as important  
materials for children.  
They get to learn all  
sorts of things while enjoying the books themselves.  
  
**Misato：**  
That's why I use my days off to come all the way out here.  
I want to spread that joy to all the children here, too.  
  
**Misato：**  
Their parents always seem to enjoy themselves as well.  
You have no idea how happy that makes me.  
  
**Girl：**  
Hey! It's Miss Misato!  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh?  
Well, hello there!  
  
**Girl：**  
Hello!  
Mommy! It's Miss Misato!  
  
**Woman：**  
Yes, yes. No need to raise your voice.  
Good day, Miss Misato.  
  
**Misato：**  
Good day, good day.  
  
**Woman：**  
Thank you for taking such good care of her.  
Sorry she's always so noisy, though.  
  
**Misato：**  
Not at all.  
  
**Woman：**  
I hope she's not causing any issues...  
  
**Misato：**  
Absolutely not.  
If anything, I appreciate how lively she is.  
  
**Girl：**  
See!  
Everyone's always happy when I'm around!  
  
**Misato：**  
Right you are.  
We all appreciate it.  
There, there.  
  
**Girl：**  
Eheheh.  
  
**Misato：**  
Hehe.  
Are you on a little shopping trip?  
  
**Woman：**  
Oh, no. We're actually on our way to the hospital.  
The one here is much bigger than back in the village.  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. I hope you're not sick...  
  
**Woman：**  
Not at all! In fact—  
  
**Girl：**  
Get this!  
Mama's pregnant!  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my, oh my!  
What wonderful news! Congratulations!  
  
**Woman：**  
You're a little handful, you know that?  
And thank you very much, Miss Misato.  
  
**Misato：**  
When are you expecting the baby?  
  
**Woman：**  
I'm only three months in, so it's still a ways away.  
  
**Girl：**  
I'm gonna be a big sister!  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my.  
Then you'll have to a good influence, won't you?  
  
**Girl：**  
No problem!  
  
**Misato：**  
Excellent.  
I take it you'll be eating your carrots from now on?  
  
**Girl：**  
Ughhh! Anything but that!  
  
**Misato：**  
Hehe. ♪  
I bet you're looking forward to it.  
  
**Girl：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Woman：**  
Ideally I'd like to send them to your nursery when the time comes.  
  
**Misato：**  
Please do.  
I'll do everything I can to take care of them.  
  
**Woman：**  
Thank you very much. Now then, we should be on our way.  
Apologies for interrupting your date.  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. This isn't a date—  
  
**Girl：**  
Mama! What's a date?  
  
**Woman：**  
Heehee. I'll tell you when you're a bit older.  
Let's get going.  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. Off they go.  
Sorry about that.  
I always get a little bit carried away when talking to people.  
  
**Misato：**  
Quite the blessed news, though.  
  
**Misato：**  
There's all sorts of books I'd love to read to the newborn.  
And the village is going to get much livelier, too. Hehe.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Where do babies come from?  
`Tag 1`  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. Well...  
  
**Misato：**  
It all comes down to love.  
When a mother receives plenty of love,  
it gives form to a beautiful baby.  
  
**Misato：**  
And then the baby is born,  
treated with the very same care and love,  
growing up in the process.  
  
**Misato：**  
In simpler terms,  
we all come from our mother's wombs.  
People and animals alike.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Even me?  
`Tag 2`  
**Misato：**  
Now that's a silly que—  
  
**Misato：**  
...No. It's not. I'm sorry.  
  
**Misato：**  
You've lost your precious memories.  
It only makes sense that you wouldn't know...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Is something wrong?  
**Choice: (4)**  Did something happen to make you sad?  
`Tag 3`  
**Misato：**  
Don't worry. I'm fine.  
I just felt the urge to hug you.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Misato：**  
Not at all.  
I just... felt the urge to hug you.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Misato：**  
Don't worry.  
I'll be here for you, no matter what.  
You can rely on me.  
  
**Misato：**  
I hope, at the very least,  
that I can be something of a  
surrogate mother for him...  
  
**Narration：**  
Though he didn't quite understand the reason behind it,  
the warmth of her embrace was all that {player} needed at that time.
