**Narration：**  
{player}, having come to the Elven Forest for a delivery,  
bumps into Misato as she's about to leave.  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. If it isn't {player}.  
What brings you here today?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Just finished up a delivery job.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misato：**  
Well then.  
Hehe. You're an admirable little worker, aren't you?  
  
**Misato：**  
I've got some prep to do for an event at the nursery.  
Which means today's encounter will be a brief one, alas.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm done with work, so let me help out.  
`Tag 2`  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. Now that's a happy proposition.  
You really are kind, aren't you?  
  
**Misato：**  
I don't see any reason to say no, so by all means.  
  
**Misato：**  
Phew. Here should be good.  
  
**Misato：**  
There aren't too many birthdays this month,  
so I won't need to make that many.  
  
**Misato：**  
Hm? Oh my. Sorry about that.  
I should explain the situation first.  
  
**Misato：**  
We have a little tradition at the nursery, you see.  
Basically, we hold an event for all the children  
that have a birthday that month.  
  
**Misato：**  
And to start it off, we hand each of them a crown made of flowers.  
It's our little way of making them feel like the main stars of the day. ♪  
  
**Misato：**  
Today's goal is to gather up the flowers for that. ♪  
It's a bit much for just one person,  
so I'm glad you offered to help.  
  
**Misato：**  
Let's get started, then.  
Could you gather up some blue flowers for me?  
  
**Misato：**  
They're the birthday flowers for this month.  
We'll make some crowns once we've got enough.  
  
**Misato：**  
Let the gathering commence! ♪  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh, those are the ones.  
They're so pretty, aren't they?  
  
**Misato：**  
Don't forget to give thanks whenever you pick one, too.  
  
**Misato：**  
Thank you so much, little flower.  
We'll make a splendid crown out of you.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Thank you so much, little flower.  
**Choice: (4)**  We'll make a splendid crown out of you.  
`Tag 3`  
**Misato：**  
Hehe. Perfect.  
No doubt the flowers are thanking you back.

`Tag 4`  
**Misato：**  
Hehe. I'm sure they're thrilled, too.  
One should always be grateful to mother nature.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Misato：**  
Now then. Let's get back to it.  
  
**Misato：**  
Phew. We sure gathered up a lot.  
All thanks to you, of course.  
  
**Misato：**  
Birthdays only come once a year,  
so I want the children to look back on them fondly.  
  
**Misato：**  
We should be able to make some  
lovely crowns with these, so let's get to it.  
  
**Misato：**  
You're doing good.  
Now just bring the stem up...  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. The knot won't be tight enough like that.  
Take it like this, then twist and turn it like this...  
Hehe. That's more like it.  
  
**Misato：**  
You're a fast learner, aren't you?  
You'll be better than me in no time at this rate.  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh, right.  
Why not tell me when your birthday is, while we're at it?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Tell her when your birthday is.  
`Tag 6`  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. Is that so?  
We'll have to include you in the festivities  
when it comes around, then.  
  
**Misato：**  
I'll make a big, tasty cake for you.  
Just thinking about it's got me all giddy, hehe.  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh. You've got that part backward.  
  
**Misato：**  
Now pass the stem through there...  
And there we have it! Clap, clap, clap for you.  
  
**Misato：**  
Quite the effort for your first try.  
Let's keep it up.  
  
**Misato：**  
But before that...  
Here. Take this.  
  
**Misato：**  
Thank you for helping me out.  
That crown's a little present.  
It suits you, too. Hehe.  
  
**Misato：**  
Hm...? Oh my.

**Misato：**  
Is this for me, perhaps?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  A gift for a gift.  
`Tag 7`  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. I wasn't expecting something in return.  
Hehe... I appreciate it. Does it suit me?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  It makes you even cuter.  
**Choice: (9)**  It makes you even prettier.  
`Tag 8`  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. You're going to make me blush.  
The crown is what's cute, though.

`Tag 9`  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. You've got a way with words, don't you?  
Who taught you how to be that charming?  
  
**Misato：**  
The crown itself is what's pretty, though.  
  
`Tag 10`  
**Misato：**  
Either way, thank you very much.  
I'll be sure to treasure it.  
  
**Misato：**  
Hehe. You're quite similar to the other children.  
They often give me things as thanks.  
  
**Misato：**  
There's nothing I appreciate more than their smiles, though.  
But well... Someone making the effort to give a physical gift is always nice, regardless of how old we get.  
  
**Misato：**  
If a present can make me feel this happy, then there's no doubt  
the children must be looking forward to their birthdays.  
  
**Misato：**  
Hehe.  
Let's make some crowns for the children now, shall we?  
  
**Misato：**  
He honestly reminds me of them. Pure, honest and kind...  
That's why I always feel the need to take care of him.  
  
**Narration：**  
And so they continued to make crowns together,  
comforted by the gentle rays shining down on them.
