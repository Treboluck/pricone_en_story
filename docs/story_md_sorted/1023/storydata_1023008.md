## Subtitle: Pukichi's Family Reunion
  
**Ayane：**  
Hey, {player}?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Sorry to bug you late at night, but are you awake?  
Can we talk?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hm?  
You're reading a book?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh, is that from Mama Saren's collection?  
I've read that one. Kurumi said, \"It's so good! Read it!\"  
and made me read it.  
  
**Ayane：**  
The princess in that story is so cute, huh?  
Oh, but I shouldn't spoil it for you.  
My lips are sealed!  
  
**Ayane：**  
But {player},  
I thought you had amnesia...  
Can you read?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ooh, I see. You got taught a little bit,  
and then you were able to read smoothly?  
Woooww!  
  
**Ayane：**  
There's too many difficult expressions  
in adult fiction books like that one...  
I really struggle to read them.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I guess this means that  
you were originally pretty smart.  
Or at least your literary aptitude was normal.  
  
**Ayane：**  
All you did was forget  
the things that you knew.  
So just by remembering how, you could read again.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Huh?  
Oh, that's right!  
I didn't come just to stand around and chat!  
I actually have something to ask you.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hey {player},  
have you seen Pusuke?  
I can't find him anywhere.  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Whoa, don't just grab me like that.  
Not me! I'm Pukichi!\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Pusuke's my dad... That's who she meant.  
Have you not met him yet, {player}?\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
You see,  
Pusuke is  
Pukichi's dad!  
  
**Ayane：**  
He looks like  
a bear-shaped bag...  
If you see him anywhere, could you let me know?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Whoa?!  
S-something's glowing again, {player}!

**Pukichi：**  
\"Hey, {player}.  
Over here. Eyes this way.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Thanks for dropping by.  
Sorry Ayane suddenly started going on about  
how the weather's nice and we should have a picnic.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"  
You're  
already a high schooler, after all.  
Wouldn't you rather be on a less childish date?\"  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I was looking forward to it too.  
**Choice: (2)**  This is a date?  
`Tag 1`  
**Pukichi：**  
\"O-oh, I see.  
Okay, as long as you're good with it.\"  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Pukichi：**  
\"What?! What did you think it was?  
Kid, did you just come here to play babysitter?\"  
  
`Tag 3`

**Pukichi：**  
\"Huh?  
Ayane's  
wearing a cute backpack... You say?\"  
  
**Pumama：**  
\"Oh my, you really know how to flatter.  
I'm Pukichi's mother, Pumama.  
Thank you so very much for always looking after Ayane and Pukichi!\"  
  
**Pumama：**  
\"Hee hee.  
But that's enough standing around talking.  
Let's have lunch.\"  
  
**Pumama：**  
\"This morning,  
I heard from Ayane that I'd be meeting you...  
So I'm afraid I got carried away and made too much food.\"  
  
**Pumama：**  
\"We have a crab and avocado salad,  
ham sandwiches,  
and some sliced honeydew melon.\"  
  
**Pumama：**  
\"Go on, go on.  
{player},  
please take whatever you like and enjoy.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"How's it taste?  
Is it good?  
Gotcha, gotcha, that's a relief... Right, Ayane?\"  
  
**Pumama：**  
\"Did you like the sandwiches?  
Ayane and Pukichi made those,  
using our homemade mayonnaise!\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Hmm?  
They were so good you want to eat them every day, you said?  
Does that mean...\"  
  
**Pusuke：**  
\"You scoundrel!\"

**Pumama：**  
\"Oh hi, honey.  
I was wondering where you were.  
It turns out you were inside my belly.\"  
  
**Pusuke：**  
\"Yeah, I was.  
This kid said something so brazen  
that I had to come out.\"  
  
**Pusuke：**  
\"Listen up,  
you little brat!\"  
  
**Pusuke：**  
\"When you say you want to eat them every day...  
Are you saying  
you want to marry Ayane?\"  
  
**Pusuke：**  
\"Huh? No? So even though you don't intend to marry her,  
you led her on with something that sounded like a proposal?  
Good-for-nothing playboy!\"  
  
**Pusuke：**  
\"Wha?  
You just thought they tasted so good  
that you'd be happy to eat them every day, and that's it?\"  
  
**Pusuke：**  
\"Huh...  
W-wait here.  
Everyone, we're going to have a family meeting.\"  
  
**Narration：**  
Several minutes later...  
  
**Pusuke：**  
\"E-every day might be pretty tough,  
but we can make you sandwiches once in a while...  
That's what Pumama said.\"  
  
**Pusuke：**  
\"You better show some gratitude  
to Pumama for her kindness.\"  
  
**Pusuke：**  
\"In return,  
I expect you to come running whenever Ayane calls for you.  
Even if it's raining, or thundering, or the middle of the night... Got it?\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hee hee! ♪

**Ameth：**  
You know...  
You really are an airhead. Not that I didn't already know.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You need to stop saying so many misleading things.  
Is it fun for you to tease innocent children?  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's fine, though.  
Since you made a promise,  
you'll have to be sure to keep it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And your amnesia's no excuse.  
Once you've gotten yourself involved,  
you have to see it through to the end.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's also why  
I have to show you all these dreams over and over,  
to complete your missing memories and make sure they stick...  
  
**Ameth：**  
It looks like  
it's going to take a bit more time, though.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh no, just talking to myself.  
It's gotten late, and you should get to bed too.  
Staying up late isn't good for your health.  
  
**Ameth：**  
See you around, and  
good night!  
  

---  
  
**Ayane：**  
{player}?  
What's wrong?  
You were just staring into space...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Well, I guess it is time for good children to be in bed.  
Are you sleepy?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Looks like I kept you up.  
Sorry about that.  
I'll search more for Pusuke tomorrow.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'm going to head to my room and go to sleep now too.  
Night night!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hm?  
Pusuke is  
inside Pumama's belly...? Really?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Huh?  
{player},  
did I introduce you to Pumama?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh, actually...  
I do kinda  
hazily remember putting Pusuke inside Pumama.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I share a room with Kurumi,  
so I don't really have that much space of my own.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I didn't have a place to put Pusuke,  
so I put him inside Pumama. I remember now.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'd totally forgotten!  
I didn't need to be running all over searching for him.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Thanks, {player}!  
Because of you,  
I can sleep nice and easy tonight!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hm?  
If I run into any trouble,  
I can come to you...? Really?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Thank you!  
{player}, I love you so much!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hee hee.  
As thanks,  
I'll make you breakfast tomorrow.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I think I'll make some sandwiches,  
using my homemade mayonnaise I remember you saying you liked!
