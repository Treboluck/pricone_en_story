Just as Ayane is about to use her special attack against the monster, {player} senses danger and stops her. They manage to escape, but with no medicinal materials, so Ayane tries to figure out other ways to help those important to her.
  
## Subtitle: So I Can Protect Them Someday
  
**Ayane：**  
A-ahhhhh!  
Nooooo,  
there's a huge monster!  
  
**Ayane：**  
I-it's looking at me!  
I'm scared, {player}, what should I do?  
Since it's come to this, I guess I've gotta use my Pukichi Fullswing...  
  
**Ayane：**  
What? I shouldn't?  
Because it's not safe?  
  
**Ayane：**  
B-but the monster's right there!  
If I don't take it down, it's gonna eat us all up!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Hmm.  
All the other weaker monsters  
are scared of this big one and ran away.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"No wonder...  
That's why we didn't run into any monsters,  
even though this forest's supposed to be dangerous.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
But somehow,  
we managed to bump into the biggest and baddest one of all!  
It's not fair how unlucky this is!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Whyyy?  
I've been a good girl and everything!  
  
**Ayane：**  
And good girls  
should get to be happy!  
  
**Ayane：**  
I-is it because I disobeyed Mama Saren  
and snuck into the forest?  
Did something this scary happen because I was bad?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Calm down, Ayane. Let's get out of here first.  
**Choice: (2)**  Leave it to me. I can take down a monster this size.  
`Tag 1`  
**Ayane：**  
O-okay!  
Could you pull me along,  
{player}?  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'm so scared, I can hardly stand up straight!  
My legs aren't working well, so please drag me out of here!  
Y-you can even carry me out, if you want!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Ayane：**  
Whaaaat?  
But all it took was one Pukichi Fullswing  
for you to pass out cold!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Y-you can't possibly beat a giant monster!  
Let's run, {player}, okay?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Ayane：**  
*pant* *wheeze*!  
D-did we manage to get away from the monster?!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Yep, we're out of the woods for now. Heh.  
While we were on the run, we ended up on the main road, too.  
Looks like we won't end up lost with no way back home.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Well, it turned out all right in the end, I guess.  
All's well that ends well, yeah?\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
*sob*  
But I didn't get any plants to make into medicine.  
  
**Ayane：**  
And I'm too scared  
to go back in and try looking again...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Awww,  
I feel like I wasted time and tired myself out for no reason.  
Well, I guess I'm just lucky to be going home alive.  
  
**Ayane：**  
And Kurumi would be really sad  
if her big sister didn't come home.  
  
**Ayane：**  
The others would worry too,  
like Mama Saren and Suzume.  
I'm glad I didn't cause trouble for my family.

**Ayane：**  
Whoa whoa!  
What is it, {player}?  
Why are you giving me a piggyback ride?  
  
**Ayane：**  
I do appreciate it,  
since I'm so exhausted I can hardly move.  
But I'm not happy about getting treated like a little kid!  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'm a grown-up lady, you know!  
I'm someone's big sister!  
  
**Ayane：**  
What?  
Mama Saren asked you to...  
go and look for me?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh, that's why you were in the forest...  
Mama Saren found the books I left open in the study  
and guessed at where I'd gone?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ooh, so that's what happened.  
Well, you found me, so I guess your mission was a success.  
Congrats, {player}.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hmph.  
So Mama Saren figured out  
what I was up to...  
  
**Ayane：**  
But that's okay.  
She was worried about me,  
which means I'm important to her, right?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ahh, I'm so tired after running for so long.  
Is it okay if I go to sleep?  
  
**Ayane：**  
That was the first big adventure I've ever had in my life.  
It's too bad I couldn't get what I came for...  
But I do feel like I gained a tiny bit more life experience!  
  
**Ayane：**  
I couldn't get any medicine ingredients...  
So instead, I'll do my very best to nurse Kurumi back to health.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Maybe I can ask Mama Saren  
for some pocket money in advance and go buy medicine, too.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'm still just a kid,  
so there's not much I can do yet.  
  
**Ayane：**  
But it's okay as long as I do my best to think  
before I act, and protect what's important to me.  
  
**Ayane：**  
One by one,  
I'll learn about all kinds of different things...  
and become a really awesome big sister.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I want to at least  
become strong enough to protect my family.
