## Subtitle: Ayane and Pukichi
  
**Ayane：**  
Taaaaake that!  
Pukichi Fullswing!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Heheh!  
Looking good... We nailed it,  
just like we've been practicing!  
  
**Ayane：**  
That's my special attack,  
Pukichi Fullswing!  
  
**Ayane：**  
No matter what kind of monster,  
it knocks 'em out in one blow!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Me 'n' Pukichi are super strong together!  
I was told that it's dangerous to go outside of town,  
but this is no sweat!  
  
**Ayane：**  
I haven't seen a single monster,  
and things are totally peaceful!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Don't let your guard down, Ayane.  
I'll knock down  
any monster that dares to pop out...\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"But still, don't go too far from the town.  
You might get yourself lost.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
I knoowww, Pukichi!  
But it'll be fine, I've got a map and everything!  
  
**Ayane：**  
I should be able to see the Tower of Sol in the distance,  
and use that as a landmark...  
Hmmm?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Where is the Tower of Sol?  
Huh? Wait...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Uh-oh.  
I'm in the middle of a forest, and all the trees are blocking my view!  
Ummm...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Pukichi, could you take a look for me?  
Up we go!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Mmm, nope.  
I'm not long enough to see over the trees.  
How about we just go back the way we came? That'll be faster.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hmm, I guess you're right.  
But which way did we come again?  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Can't you trace  
your footprints?\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Mmm...  
I-I can't tell.  
Ahh, what should I do?  
  
**Ayane：**  
I thought I'd just head for the Tower of Sol,  
so I wasn't paying much attention to my surroundings!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Did I  
get myself lost?  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Calm down, Ayane.  
We haven't walked for that long,  
so as long as we're going in the right direction, we should be able to exit the forest.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Collect yourself,  
and try to remember which way you came.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Y-yeah.  
*sob* What if I squat down  
and press my face to the ground? Could I make out my footprints then?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Although I don't wanna get my clothes all muddy.  
Umm, umm...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh, huh?  
S-someone's lying on the ground!  
Over there, by those bushes!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Are they... dead?  
No no no, I don't wanna look!  
I won't be able to sleep at night! Pukichi, could you take a look for me?  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Hey, cut that out.  
Don't use me to poke at a (presumed) dead body.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Nnngh!  
Huh? A leg moved!  
Looks like they're alive... Maybe they were just passed out?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh no,  
don't tell me they got knocked out by my Pukichi Fullswing!  
  
**Ayane：**  
U-ummm!  
Are you okay?  
I'm sorry, did I do that to you?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Uhh...  
Who are you?  
I've never seen you before.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hmm, {player}, huh?  
Got it. Then you're {player} from now on!  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'm Ayane!  
And this is Pukichi!  
Nice to meet you!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Nice to meet you, Ayane and Pukichi.  
**Choice: (2)**  Pukichi? Is that your ventriloquist dummy?  
`Tag 1`  
**Ayane：**  
You said it!  
It's our first time meeting,  
but you still said hi to Pukichi too! Not everyone does.  
  
**Ayane：**  
You know,  
you might be one of the good ones.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Ayane：**  
I'm not using ventriloquism...  
Pukichi here is my best friend. He's like family to me!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Ayane：**  
Anyway, why did you faint?  
Was it really my fault?  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'm sorry.  
From now on, I'll check for people around me  
before letting my Pukichi Fullswing loose.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I feel really bad.  
Will you forgive me?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hee hee.  
To say I'm sorry,  
I'll give you some first aid supplies.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Mama Saren said, \"Just in case something happens,\"  
and gave me a bunch of stuff to carry out of worry for me.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'll treat your wounds for you,  
so no more hard feelings, okay?  
Do you forgive me?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Actually...  
I think this must be some kind of fate.  
So please be my friend!
