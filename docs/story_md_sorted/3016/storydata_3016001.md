# St. Theresa's Academy (Friendship Club) Episode 1
Yuni, Chloe and Chieru gather for a meeting about a scholarship. The school is willing to grant them the cash, on the condition that they become good friends with {player}, a special transfer student serving as a test case for the school's co-ed plans.
  
## Subtitle: The Scholarship Seekers
  
**Narration：**  
After school at St. Theresa's Academy,  
a lone student walks into an empty classroom.  
  
**Chloe：**  
'Sup.  
  
**Chloe：**  
The, uh...  
 scholarship money thing?  
I came 'cause I'm interested in it.  
This the right place for the briefing?  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Wait, huh?  
  
**Chloe：**  
No one's even here. Like, zero people.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh god.  
No way... Did I come to totally the wrong room?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Or what, is it like...  
this school's so full of pampered little princesses,  
nobody needs these handouts to cover their fees?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pff...  
Whatever, guess I'll just sit down...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, someone's here.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Greetings, fellow student.  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Eh? A kid?  
  
**Yuni：**  
I heard that this old-fashioned institution has finally seen fit  
to implement a modern scholarship program.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I trust I've reached the correct location for the initial briefing?  
I rarely venture so far beyond my home in the old schoolhouse.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh? Who's this cheeky little brat?  
Why's a kid from the elementary division  
wearing our high school uniform?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm...  
It would seem no members of the staff have yet arrived.  
So be it, then. I will seat myself and wait. Ahhh...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeesh, what a weirdo. Where'd she learn to talk like that.  
Is this some kinda play-pretend game or what.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, whatever.  
I'll just let her have her fun. Pff...  
  
**Yuni：**  
By the by, young miss.  
  
**Chloe：**  
...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Excuse me! Young miss!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh?  
 You mean me?  
  
**Yuni：**  
If not you, who else?  
I am Yuni of the Ivory Tower.  
 It's a pleasure.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Right...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Are you a fellow seeker of scholarship funds?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uhhh, yeah.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Just as I thought... Yes.  
I see a fierce hunger in your eyes for capital at any cost.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Wow, this kid thinks a lot of herself.  
Did I just get dissed? Amazing.  
  
**Yuni：**  
It's you who lack in manners, second-year.  
Who do you take me for?  
Show some respect. Do you not see my ribbon's hue?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Wha—?!  
No way. Like, a third-year?  
Wait, you're *actually* in high school?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Older than me. With that look.  
 Huh.  
Like, for real? I mean... damn.  
  
**Yuni：**  
It is the truth.  
You may address me more properly  
as Doctor Yuni, if you wish.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeah, sure...I'll, uh, think about it.  
  
**Yuni：**  
What's this? You sound skeptical somehow.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh? You think?  
Gonna be honest, this is just how I talk.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. Well, no matter.  
Each of us is here simply to obtain our offered dues.  
Our coexistence at these coordinates is a temporary affair.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Then so be it.  
We need not forge lasting bonds.  
Fleeting encounters are the way of the world.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh-huh. You said it.  
  
**Yuni：**  
A fine response.  
Neither an agreement nor a denial; mere background noise.  
Devoid of submission and rebellion alike. True neutrality.  
  
**Yuni：**  
A little more warmth wouldn't go amiss,  
but like the reed that bends in the wind,  
your steadfast nature strikes me as a boon in this place of academia.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh-huh. You said it.  
  
**Yuni：**  
...  
  
**Yuni：**  
By the by, what's your name?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh-huh. You said it.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, I mean,  
 I'm Chloe.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Young Chloe. This is an order from your elder. Converse with me.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Converse...? About what.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Whatever you wish.  
It's silence that bothers me. Speak to yourself, if you must.  
I can adapt to most modes of conversation.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeah, uh, same.  
Pulling small talk out of the ether's not my strong suit.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. You're like me.  
Which is to say, a lonely soul with no social skills.  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Does this girl gotta keep dissing me outta nowhere?  
  
**Yuni：**  
That said, young Chloe, I'd suggest that your frosty bearing  
does you no favors in attracting social contact.  
One point to work on—your gaze and tone seem actively threatening.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, you call that \"one point\"?  
Way to reject my whole identity.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Look, I've totally got friends and stuff, OK?  
...Back home, at least.  
  
**Yuni：**  
By which you mean you have none in this academy?  
A sorry state of affairs. Your youth is wilting away.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeesh, for all her sweet looks, this girl's just the Queen of Rude.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. The elders of my village often told me the same.  
How lamentable. At times I fear my charming appearance  
is actually a curse I must bear to the grave.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Outward looks are just a screen to conceal the soul within,  
yet so many assume from this sweet, diminutive form  
that my character must be that of a graceless yet delightful young waif.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Doesn't this seem lacking in imagination?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, I don't really get the details,  
but are you being a preachy ass  
about not judging books by their covers right now?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Words are hollow structures with many faces.  
If that's what you perceived, then so it must be.  
Though from my perspective, it's quite regrettable.  
  
**Chloe：**  
And why's that.  
  
**Yuni：**  
After devoting my formative years to learning, I may be lacking socially,  
but I don't wish to invite ill feeling from my peers.  
At times, I long for one who might sympathize with this eccentric soul.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uhhh... Sorry.  
Can you try using words that, uh, mean things?  
Like, talk a bit more normally?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Then let me use the terms of the layfolk.  
I thought that the two of us could be friends.  
  
**Chloe：**  
O-oh...  
Gotta say,  
 I wasn't expecting that sudden turn for the cute...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Words have many faces.  
This adorable nature may also be a valid aspect of my being.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Cutie-patootie~! ♪  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, never do that again.  
  
**Chloe：**  
So, um, tell me then. What made you think that?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Think... what, exactly?  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Don't make me say it.  
You know. Why'd you wanna...  
 make friends... with me of all people?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oh. That was instinct, nothing more.  
A kind of bond between kindred spirits.  
When I saw you, I felt something of that sort.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Now who's judging books by covers!  
After that whole lecture? Double standards much?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well, naturally.  
I too am but one of the foolish masses.  
How can I judge, if not by the aspects visible to my eyes?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Right, right. Sure thing.  
...  
Uh, wait.  
What was this whole conversation about again?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Mere chitchat.  
My earnest attempt to fill these empty moments with words.  
Does that displease you?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well,  
 I *guess* I can't complain...  
  
**Chloe：**  
I mean, I don't...  
 mind at all, I guess.  
  
**Yuni：**  
R-really...?  
This girl seems surprisingly cute all of a sudden...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Cheru~n! ♪  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh?  
  
**Chieru：**  
So, ummm~?  
I'm just a sweet girl in search of some serious cash handouts.  
Is this the right place for the scholarship meeting~?  
  
**Yuni：**  
...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Young Chloe, bad news.  
This fresh face seems to wield her cuteness with reckless abandon.  
She'll surely overwhelm our meager charms in a matter of seconds.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, totally different genre.  
You don't call that "cute, you call it \"dumb in the head.\"  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hello~? Anybody home~?  
Hey guys, is this the right place for...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, god...  
Write a thesis on this, Doc.  
Even rich-kid schools can't escape the curse of the terminal ditz.  
  
**Yuni：**  
You and I are quite the exceptions as well.  
Only natural, perhaps.  
What dataset is free from a handful of clear outliers?  
  
**Yuni：**  
What an intriguing phenomenon!  
This classroom is a hotspot for our academy's irregulars!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Whoa, whoa.  
Can you *not* just lowkey slot me into that weird-ass group?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ummm~?  
I ask a friendly question, and I'm zero for zero on answers.  
Am I getting blanked here?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh well, both the students here look pretty poor,  
so it must be the right place!  
 Coming in~!  
  
**Yuni：**  
This first-year strikes me as positively impertinent.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Where the hell am I.  
Did I stumble into the Bratty Kids' Insult Club?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, but consider, young Chloe. If we allow her voice  
to wash by as mere background noise,  
 does it not provide  
a certain lively accent to the atmosphere? I quite approve.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Welcome, first-year.  
Might I ask your name?  
  
**Chieru：**  
I'm Chieru~! ♪  
But you can call me Chierun or Chellypon if you like!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. Young Chieru. Please provide us with conversation.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, for the...  
Do you always pass the buck like that?  
  
**Yuni：**  
I'm simply respecting her personal freedom.  
To limit the potential of the young is a common vice of the old.  
Let us have faith in young Chieru's verbal abilities.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, sure! That's super fine by me,  
but first, who exactly are you two?  
  
**Yuni：**  
I'm Yuni, a third-year.  
And this is the second-year...  
 ehm...? Miss Hanako.  
  
**Chloe：**  
It's Chloe. You missed the right neighborhood by a few nautical miles.  
  
**Chieru：**  
'Kaykay! So the cute li'l bigheaded girl is Yuni,  
and the cool bigheaded girl is... Chloe, am I right?  
Registered to memory!  
  
**Yuni：**  
She's begun interweaving insults with compliments...  
Hear that, young Chloe? Her technique is masterful.  
We may be dealing with a prodigy.  
  
**Chloe：**  
I see it.  
The \"lovable weirdo you can't hate\" angle.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes... I'd wager her appearance belies a shrewd nature.  
Say, young Chieru. You seem more social than studious,  
but your attendance rate is high, am I right?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, yes! My record's perfect!  
'Cause like, I've got so many friends here,  
how could I miss a day of school?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh boy. Spoken like one of the social top one percent.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yep, that's me!  
The girl everyone loves to love, Chierun the adorkable!  
Cheru~n! ☆  
  
**Chloe：**  
God, calm down. Even your gestures are too loud.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Aww~!  
 So, Yuni?  
 What did you want me to talk about?  
My camping trip the other day where we all had a BBQ together?  
  
**Chloe：**  
A barbecue. With friends.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, the fabled normie.  
I've never seen one in the flesh.  
A dazzling visage indeed.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Like, her socialite preening is killing me.  
Can't even deal.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Aww~? The barbecue story's no good?  
Then what about the time we got coffee  
with boys from another school, three-on-three?  
  
**Chloe：**  
A freakin' mixer.  
God, are all your stories like this? Way too heavy.  
Can't you talk about the weather or something?  
  
**Yuni：**  
O-one moment. Did you say \"boys\"?  
Young Chieru, are you one of those...  
th-those young ladies who indulge in inappropriate relations?  
  
**Chieru：**  
No, no, I'm a young lady who steers way clear of that minefield!  
  
**Chieru：**  
I only went along that one time  
'cause a friend asked me to help make up the numbers!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Isn't it way more fun  
just goofing around with a bunch of other girls?  
  
**Chloe：**  
How should I know.  
  
**Chieru：**  
To be honest, I'm just not great with boys in general.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ohh... Well,  
 I kind of feel you on that.  
Yeah, boys can be a pain in the ass, huh.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. Much as I hate to excessively generalize...  
Well, I can hardly deny I share much the same sentiment.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I've submitted many theses to noted journals in my time,  
yet I find they are often undervalued on account of my gender.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ohhhh~? Are you sure  
it's not just that your work wasn't up to their standards?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Silence. I don't wish to hear such feasible notions.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Listen, back at my place, I've got three little brothers.  
Never listen to a word I say, but they get so cocky...  
Trust me, boys are so not worth it.  
  
**Chieru：**  
I know, right?  
They're all hotheads with no fashion sense or hygiene!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Too true.  
  
**Chloe：**  
You preach it, sister.  
  
**Chieru：**  
But give them the time of day,  
and next thing you know it's \"Please go out with me!\"  
  
**Yuni：**  
So tru—  
  
**Chloe：**  
You said i— Eh?  
  
**Chieru：**  
And even if I'm blatantly not interested, as soon as I say no,  
they complain as if *I* was leading them on,  
 every time.  
Like, when did I ever?! Right? You get that?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Y-  
yeah... Big same.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I...I *have* read books of this nature...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Right~?!  
That's why I decided on this school!  
All-girls' schools are *so* much easier on the soul!  
  
**Yuni：**  
T-tell me, young Chloe.  
What is this young lady speaking of?  
Do her words not seem to belong to a wholly separate genre?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Help me, young Chloe.  
I must confess, in my life up to this point,  
I have never resided in environments with males of my own age.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, if I'm totally honest,  
I've never spent much time with boys outside my family either...  
  
**Yuni：**  
I see...  
 Then this cannot be helped.  
Let's both smile and nod as though we understand.  
  
**Yuni：**  
So true!  
  
**Chloe：**  
So true!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ahah! I knew you'd get it!  
This is why I'm sure us girls will be great friends!  
You big sweeties! ♪  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ah, geez...  
Do you gotta do the hugging thing? Back off, girl.  
  
**Yuni：**  
No, feel free. Please continue.  
  
**Chieru：**  
'Kaaay~!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Say what now.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well, you see, since time immemorial, I've always held  
a strong academic interest  
 in the unique rosy glow  
produced by displays of affection between adolescent females.  
  
**Chloe：**  
You're sounding like some kinda perv.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Now, continue, my friends!  
Embrace freely as your instincts guide you!  
Show me the glittering magic of youth that I lack!  
  
**Yuni：**  
In fact, by all means invite me to join you!  
The effects of this upon my own emotional state  
would be a most fascinating subject to study!  
  
**Chloe：**  
What is this, yuri?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yaaaay! Group huuuug!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Huuuug!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, spare me.  
You're both as bad as each other!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ahah!  
Look at Chloe getting all embarrassed!  
 She's so funny!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, how thrilling.  
As the layfolk say, the magic of youth! Friendship! Student life!  
Isn't this most wonderful, young Chloe?  
  
**Chloe：**  
...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, if you say so...  
  
**Chloe：**  
I mean, sure...  
 I guess you're right.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Good day, young ladies.  
Thank you for your patience. We will now begin the—  
  
**Teacher：**  
Oh my, what's this?  
All this gleeful entanglement. You're certainly getting along well.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, you can tell~?  
That's right! We were just making the most of our magical youth...  
  
**Teacher：**  
I was being sardonic. Settle down and take your seats.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Ahem, now then.  
Miss Yuni, Miss Chloe, Miss Chieru.  
The three of you are interested in our scholarship, yes?  
  
**Teacher：**  
But as you may expect, we cannot provide such benefits  
without following due process.  
We will need you to fulfill certain requirements to qualify.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. If it is our grades that concern you,  
let me reassure you I am consistently at the top of my grade.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh? For real?  
 The kid's a genius?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ahh... I think I should be fine too.  
I can usually ace all the tests  
as long as I vaguely pay attention in class.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh god.  
 And this one's a prodigy.  
  
**Chieru：**  
What, Chloe, are you just dead average, then?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Don't rub it in.  
Like, tact. Have you heard of it?  
  
**Chloe：**  
I mean... I do put in decent effort,  
so it's not like my grades are the worst of the worst or anything...  
  
**Teacher：**  
Well, of course.  
A certain level of academic performance should go without saying.  
  
**Teacher：**  
But there's a certain condition  
that we would like you all to fulfill on top of that.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. Please, share the details.  
  
**Teacher：**  
This is still only in the early planning phases,  
but our school, St. Theresa's Academy for Girls,  
is preparing to transition to a mixed-gender mode of education...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? We're going co-ed?!  
  
**Teacher：**  
Settle down.  
Yes... in preparation for this significant transition, we have invited  
a single male transfer student to serve as a preliminary test case.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wha...  
 This isn't what I signed up for!  
  
**Teacher：**  
Yes, I expected that reaction. Just as we feared.  
  
**Teacher：**  
For many years, this academy has fostered a proud reputation  
as an exclusive institution for respectable young ladies.  
  
**Teacher：**  
But the times are changing, and we must change with them.  
It is time for us to open our doors to a broader clientele.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, I *had* heard that student numbers were in decline...  
Perhaps the economic climate has made such expansion unavoidable.  
  
**Teacher：**  
As such, it falls to us to ascertain in full  
if our student body can achieve harmony with this foreign culture.  
We would like the three of you to act as representatives of your peers.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yuni, can you put that in layfolkese?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. It would appear we're being asked to become good friends  
with this transfer student,  
 or so I would presume.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh? Why the heck would we wanna...  
  
**Teacher：**  
Well put, Dr. Yuni! You are quite correct.  
Well then, allow me to introduce the new student in question.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Young man, you may enter now!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ehh...?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Aaaahhh!  
  
**Teacher：**  
Oh? What's this now, everyone?  
It sounds almost as though you are already familiar with our new friend.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm {player}. It's a pleasure.  
`Tag 1`  
**All Three：**  
Whaaaaaa~?!  
  
**Narration：**  
Each recognizing their new schoolmate beyond a shadow of a doubt,  
the three young ladies of St. Theresa's Academy for Girls  
were rendered speechless.
