## Subtitle: A Delivery Worth Waiting For
  
**Rin：**  
Hey, {player}!  
Over here! ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Welcome to Elizabeth Park! ☆  
  
**Rin：**  
Hm...?  
What's with that look on your face?  
  
**Rin：**  
Come on.  
I'm allowed to be excited now and then, aren't I?  
No need to make it seem like I got kidnapped and replaced.  
  
**Rin：**  
Whatever.  
More importantly...  
  
**Rin：**  
You're here to deliver stuff, right?  
Is there a package for me?  
  
**Rin：**  
Heh!  
I got myself a new video game I'd been waiting for,  
plus a pack of high-grade sweet buns for myself.  
  
**Rin：**  
Only cost me a whole month's worth of my salary.  
  
**Rin：**  
Not that I regret it, of course.  
No point in saving for the sake of saving  
if there's stuff you wanna buy.  
  
**Rin：**  
Especially when the farm already  
provides all the basic necessities I need.  
  
**Rin：**  
I'm working hard every day,  
so it's only fair to reward myself. ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Hm? You've never actually seen me work?  
I mean, I *am* in charge of security.  
Just roaming around here and there counts as work for me.  
  
**Rin：**  
Forget that, though.  
You've got the goods, don't you?  
Hand 'em over.  
  
**Rin：**  
I even got my stamp ready  
beforehand and everything.  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh, is that it? Must be, since my name's on it!  
Gimme! And now to stamp it.  
Stampy! ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Heh! There we go!  
These precious items are officially mine! ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Hm?  
This is a bit... lighter than expected.  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh well.  
Whatever.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey, {player}. You free after this?  
If you are, then wanna play together?  
  
**Rin：**  
No one else here ever takes me up on it 'cause  
they prefer outdoor activities and stuff.  
  
**Rin：**  
So yeah.  
I've kinda been looking for someone to play video games with.  
  
**Rin：**  
Sounds good, right?  
I'll even let you have a tiny, tiny bit  
of these super duper high-grade sweet buns!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm down.  
**Choice: (2)**  What is a \"video game,\" anyway?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rin：**  
Woo!  
Knew I could count on you, {player}!  
  
**Rin：**  
Let's head back to my room, then.  
  
**Rin：**  
It's a bit messy, but there should be space for you to sit.  
If there isn't, then I'll clean it out a bit first.  
  
**Rin：**  
Ehehe.  
Have to admit,  
I've kinda been wanting to hang out with someone around my age.  
  
**Rin：**  
Most of the people here are  
either decently younger or older than me.  
  
**Rin：**  
Can be a bit hard to get on the same page sometimes  
when you've got people on the opposite ends of maturity.  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh?  
Err, wait...  
You *are* around my age, right?  
  
**Rin：**  
I'm seventeen, by the way.  
  
**Rin：**  
Wait, you thought I was younger?  
Ahh... That explains your kinda soft attitude towards me.  
Like you're dealing with a kid.  
  
**Rin：**  
I mean. I do look the part at least, considering how short I am...  
But yeah. We're around the same age, so take that into  
consideration when approaching me from now on.  
  
**Rin：**  
I'd feel a bit pathetic if you kept treating me like a kid.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Rin：**  
Oh, you don't know?  
  
**Rin：**  
I guess they are a pretty niche form of entertainment,  
though they're getting more popular these days.  
I'm super hooked on them.  
  
**Rin：**  
First you need a pretty expensive magic tool called \"hardware.\"  
Then you insert something else called \"software\" into it,  
which displays a screen in mid-air that you can touch and stuff.  
  
**Rin：**  
It's kinda hard to explain.  
So yeah, let's just give it a spin.  
That's probably the best way to wrap your head around it.  
  
**Rin：**  
There's a bunch of games available these days,  
but I'm not exactly the richest person in Landosol.  
I've only got a few on hand.  
  
**Rin：**  
They're all super fun, though.  
I've pretty much spent entire days on them.  
  
**Rin：**  
It'd be nice if you ended up getting hooked, too.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rin：**  
Heh.  
Let's get going, then.  
I'll give you the grand tour to my room. ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
It's a bit messy, but don't judge me for it.  
Though, hmm... I probably would've left it cleaner  
if I knew you'd be coming over.  
  
**Rin：**  
A-actually. Do you mind waiting outside for a bit?  
I'll give it a quick clean first.  
  
**Rin：**  
Mmm...  
This is weird.  
Normally I don't care what people think about me.  
  
**Rin：**  
But here I am kind of  
trying to impress {player}.  
  
**Rin：**  
How come...?  
Ahh, man.  
This is why dealing with other people is a pain.
