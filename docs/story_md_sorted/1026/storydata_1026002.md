**Rin：**  
Oh. Hey, {player}.  
What're you doing here today?  
  
**Rin：**  
Doing mailman stuff again?  
Sheesh. How many times've you had to come out here already?  
  
**Rin：**  
I respect it, though.  
Your legs are probably super sturdy by now.  
  
**Rin：**  
Unlike mine, considering I barely ever move.  
Just standing still for a while makes them turn to jelly.  
  
**Rin：**  
Honestly, just walking back to my room is a struggle these days.  
Hey, {player}. Mind carrying me back?  
  
**Rin：**  
I'll even make it worth your time.  
You can have some of these acorns I found earlier.  
  
**Rin：**  
The nice thing about being way up a mountain is no one ever makes the  
effort to come acorn picking. So they're all mine by default.  
  
**Rin：**  
Man.  
You really can't beat life here at Elizabeth Park. ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Do acorns taste any good?  
**Choice: (2)**  Where is your room, anyway?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rin：**  
They sure do.  
I could eat those bad boys every day for  
the rest of my life and never get sick of them.  
  
**Rin：**  
Actually. I'd still wanna have sweet buns, too.  
  
**Rin：**  
Have you never tried them before?  
Man. Now that's depressing.  
Don't worry, though. I'll let you try one.  
  
**Rin：**  
Check it out. This here's an acorn.  
I always carry some around with me in case I get a bit hungry.  
  
**Rin：**  
Here you go, {player}.  
Say \"aah\" for me. ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Hm?  
What's up?  
Sure doesn't look like you enjoyed it.  
  
**Rin：**  
It was a lot harder than expected?  
Oh. You can get softer ones,  
but I prefer them this way.  
  
**Rin：**  
Probably 'cause I'm a squirrel beastgirl.  
My incisors are pretty strong.

`Tag 2`  
**Rin：**  
Err... Why would you even as—  
Oh, right. I'm the one that asked you to carry me back.  
  
**Rin：**  
Well.  
That big building over there has a bunch of rooms.  
I'm using one of them while I'm here.  
  
**Rin：**  
I told you that I'm a part of Caon, right?  
That basically makes me a guest of sorts.  
  
**Rin：**  
They even gave me one of the nicer rooms, too.  
Perks of the job and all that.  
  
**Rin：**  
I do have to say goodbye to this place  
and head back to town once the contract's up, though.  
  
**Rin：**  
Not something I wanna do in the first place,  
but I've got a bunch of nice furniture and stuff there too.  
  
**Rin：**  
Plus, I've made some good friends.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rin：**  
Oh, sorry.  
You're busy enough as it is,  
so I shouldn't waste your time talking about myself.  
  
**Rin：**  
The farm's super busy right now,  
so I was getting a bit lonely.  
Couldn't help but want to spend some time talking to you.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hm?  
Shouldn't I be working, too?  
  
**Rin：**  
Well... I'm not a proper farmer, you know?  
Doubt anyone wants a newbie like me  
getting in the way and slowing things down.  
  
**Rin：**  
If I can't be that much help in the first place,  
then I'd rather avoid being a nuisance to boot.  
They're working hard enough as it is, you know?  
  
**Rin：**  
Whoa!  
Why're you grabbing my hand out of nowhere, {player}?  
  
**Rin：**  
Quit it! I told you how weak my legs are.  
You're gonna make me fall over!  
  
**Rin：**  
What's that?  
I might get in the way at first,  
but it's fine if I start with simple stuff?  
  
**Rin：**  
You think everyone'll be really thankful?  
  
**Rin：**  
I dunno...  
You sure sound confident about it, though.  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh.  
You kinda had the same experience  
at work thanks to your amnesia, huh?  
  
**Rin：**  
But the more you worked, the more you got used to it.  
And that experience made you real happy...  
  
**Rin：**  
So now you want to share that same feeling with me?  
  
**Rin：**  
Man, talk about Mr. Positive.  
Or Mr. Normie, maybe? Either way,  
that's the sorta thing only capable people can say.  
  
**Rin：**  
Not everyone's like you.  
Some people can put in all the effort  
in the world and still fail spectacularly.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey!  
Stop pulling me already...!  
You're surprisingly pushy, aren't you?  
  
**Rin：**  
You look like you couldn't even hurt a fly, too.  
Figured that's why you were being nice to me.  
  
**Rin：**  
Also.  
Don't you have your own work to worry about?  
You sure you've got time to deal with me?  
  
**Rin：**  
No one likes a slacker, {player}.  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh? You're done with work now?  
And you're too concerned to just leave me alone?  
  
**Rin：**  
Man...  
Ever heard about minding your own business?  
  
**Rin：**  
Not that I mind.  
You're a bit of a weirdo though, aren't you?
