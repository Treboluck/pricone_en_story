# Rin Episode 6
Having learned of Rin's slothful life at Elizabeth Park, Caon issues a formal summons to her. Rin, now fully aware of both their and {player}'s concern for her, abides. What's more, she also considers cleaning up her act altogether.
  
## Subtitle: Do You Mind Praising Me?
  
**Rin：**  
Man...  
Sure has been a while since I was in Landosol.  
  
**Rin：**  
Don't remember it being this lively...  
Urgh. Seeing so many people at once is making me feel sick.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey, {player}.  
Don't leave me behind.  
  
**Rin：**  
I'm a surefire candidate  
to get lost if you do.  
  
**Rin：**  
Let's hold hands, yeah.  
  
**Rin：**  
I've never been that good with crowds in the first place,  
but I think living at Elizabeth Park's made it even worse.  
We've got way more animals than people there.  
  
**Rin：**  
There's so much going on that it's making me all dizzy.  
  
**Rin：**  
Urgh... I want outta here as quickly as possible.  
So let's head over to Caon's headquaters, pronto.  
  
**Rin：**  
Not that I know where it is.  
Do you?  
  
**Rin：**  
Well then.  
Didn't realize you knew people from the guild.  
Guess you're more of a social butterfly than you let on. Impressive.  
  
**Rin：**  
Though you *are* friends with someone like me, so it makes sense.  
You're probably one of those outgoing types  
that can get along with just about anyone.  
  
**Rin：**  
Man, that's so cool.  
I'm a little bit jealous, even.  
  
**Rin：**  
Anyway.  
Let's get this over and done with.  
  
**Rin：**  
Yeah.  
Caon asked me to write up some reports and stuff,  
plus they want me to undergo some training.  
  
**Rin：**  
You know how they ended up coming to Elizabeth Park?  
I used that chance to give them a brief rundown of stuff,  
but it wasn't enough in the end.  
  
**Rin：**  
They even said they'd have to consider expelling me  
from the guild if I don't undergo proper training and mend my ways.  
  
**Rin：**  
Not that I'd mind too much.  
Only reason I'm a member in the first place  
is 'cause my parents forced me into it  
  
**Rin：**  
I don't want Mama finding out  
about it and getting upset, though.  
  
**Rin：**  
It'd make living at Elizabeth Park awkward too,  
considering I was originally there on duty.  
  
**Rin：**  
It's a pain, but I'll deal with it for now.  
If a little bit of effort's what it takes to reclaim my chill life,  
then you bet I'll go all in.  
  
**Rin：**  
And I dunno why,  
but Caon also asked you to come along  
and make sure I actually show up.  
  
**Rin：**  
So yeah.  
I'll just be causing issues for you if I don't get my act together.  
  
**Rin：**  
And that's a big fat nope from me.  
I'd rather stay on good terms with you.  
  
**Rin：**  
You're a good guy, plus you play games with me.  
  
**Rin：**  
When I think about it from your perspective, though,  
I'm probably just way more hassle then I'm worth,  
huh?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Not at all.  
**Choice: (2)**  Admitting it is the first step.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rin：**  
Oh... You really mean it?  
That makes me happy and all, but well...  
You really are just super nice, aren't you?  
  
**Rin：**  
Is taking care of others just like, a thing of yours?  
Or maybe it's *because* it's me...  
  
**Rin：**  
Heh. As if.  
I don't have a single positive trait worth falling for.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Rin：**  
Urgh...  
Et tu, {player}?  
  
**Rin：**  
I always liked that you never ran your mouth.  
Probably because of your amnesia and stuff.  
  
**Rin：**  
But well...  
I guess that just goes to show how rotten I am.  
  
**Rin：**  
I get it. I really do.  
But that's just who I am. It's kinda hard to change.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rin：**  
Oh well.  
No point in debating it.  
Let's get going.  
  
**Rin：**  
They told me I can turn up anytime without an appointment,  
but I'd rather just get this out of the way now.  
  
**Rin：**  
Besides, it's my own problem. I can't just let you handle it all for me.  
  
**Rin：**  
I'll get my butt over there,  
do their training or whatever, then make like a tree.  
  
**Rin：**  
And once I'm done...  
Do you mind praising me? Telling me I did good?  
  
**Rin：**  
I'm not doing anything special here.  
I understand that much.  
  
**Rin：**  
But that's the thing.  
I don't function the same way as \"normal\" people.  
What comes easy to them is a real struggle for me.  
  
**Rin：**  
I was spoiled through pretty much every stage of my life.  
From the moment I was able to stand, to when I learned to say \"Mama,\"  
they'd pat my head and tell me I was super special.  
  
**Rin：**  
That never changed, even as I got older.  
And here I am now.  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh. Not to imply that I ever had  
an issue with that in and of itself.  
  
**Rin：**  
No one's ever been as lucky as I've been.  
I was shown more love and affection than you can imagine.  
  
**Rin：**  
I never had to force myself to deal with anything I didn't like.  
If anything, Mama made an effort to distance me from all that.  
  
**Rin：**  
Everyone around me's been telling me  
I need to move past that, though...  
  
**Rin：**  
That made me realize just  
how much of a struggle life's been for them all.  
  
**Rin：**  
And I'm not sure how to handle that.  
I never knew just living could be that difficult.  
  
**Rin：**  
Yet here they are, all getting through life somehow...  
Ahh, man. Must be such a pain.
