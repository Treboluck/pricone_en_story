## Subtitle: All About Yukari
  
**Chieru：**  
So, that Yukari lady from the Mercs. What's she really like?  
C'mon!  
 Like... she's pretty, composed, smart, *and* a hard worker!  
But she loves the bubbly?  
 Like, isn't that contrast way too cute?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She's a very grown-up woman.  
**Choice: (2)**  She's a former holy knight.  
**Choice: (3)**  She's a drunkard.

**Chieru：**  
Yep, yep! I look up to her type! Independent and ambitious!  
 And despite  
her pretty looks, there's not the slightest sign of boys around her!  
I bet she's got zero interest in dating or getting married.  
 That's so cool!

**Chieru：**  
A holy knight? Huh. Not really seeing that one.  
 Oh, that reminds me—  
people call you a knight sometimes, right? What's up with that?  
Do you ride on a white horse? Um, with that face? That's beyond surreal.

`Tag 3`  
**Chieru：**  
Um, wording! You make it sound like she's boozing constantly.  
I'm sure Yukari's more like...  
 a little tipple to celebrate a job well done!  
A sip here and there at a fancy bar!  
 ...Huh? Why the weird face?
