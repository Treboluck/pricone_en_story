My folks're no slouch on the glitz meter either,  
 but House Wisteria's the  
best of the best—no, the super of the duper!  
 So what kind of person *is*  
their heiress, Akino? What's she do every day? Bathe in pools of cash?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Mostly, um... getting lost.  
**Choice: (2)**  She likes handing out money.  
**Choice: (3)**  She's trying to become a true entrepreneur.

Ooh, inspirational! She's a major success story, and she still works hard?!  
With a gal like that in charge, I bet the Foundation's only getting bigger.  
Hmm. Maybe I really oughtta make pals with her. AKA smart networking.
