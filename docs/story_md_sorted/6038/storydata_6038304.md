## Subtitle: All About Tamaki
  
**Yuni：**  
Tell me, now—this Tamaki girl. What are her credentials?  
The Foundation's development prowess must rely on capable staff,  
but she in particular seems to lead them...  
 She can be no ordinary feline.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She's a catgirl.  
**Choice: (2)**  She's a taiyaki seller.  
**Choice: (3)**  She's the Phantom Cat.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuni：**  
Well, yes. If you told me she was a piggirl, I'd be nonplussed.  
In any case, I'd love to recruit her for the development of my Yunicopter II.  
Heaven knows I'll need a lucky cat. Ahaha. I slay myself.

**Yuni：**  
Taiyaki... A snack of sweet bean paste encased in a fish-shaped cake.  
No, I'm not interested. I shun solid foods. They tire the jaw and strain the  
bowels.  
 That said, the fruity cake you give me... That one, I like. Swoon.

**Yuni：**  
Phantom what? A vigilante?  
 Ah, that archetype. They steal from the rich  
and redistribute wealth to the poor.  
 So? You say young Tamaki is one of  
them?  
 Hrm. I see. It may not be my place to pry. Let's say I heard nothing.
