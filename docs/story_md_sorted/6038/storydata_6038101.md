Oh, Doc Yuni?  
 I hear she's been hanging with the Lyricals a bunch ever

Our Chloe? She was having trouble with the report part of the project.  
It's silly how she obsesses over these things.  
 Doesn't she know essays  
are easy if you just gamify it and write what the teachers want to hear?

Little old me? I've been single-handedly upholding this club's reputation.  
That's just how it goes, since Yuni's a shut-in and Chloe's... like that.  
Nothing ties them down.  
 So I gotta tough it out as the responsible one!
