## Subtitle: So What Was That Job?
  
**Chloe：**  
So, that time you called me out to fight the giant armor things.  
...Looking back, I think the Merc gals might've been there too.  
And... you talked about a \"world in peril\"?  
 Yeah, what even was that.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  The Final Battle of Landosol.  
**Choice: (2)**  An epic clash to defend this very world.  
**Choice: (3)**  Honestly, I don't really know either.

Final... bottle...? Oh, like some kinda booze party?  
 I guess one of the hires  
*was* downing broth like there was no tomorrow...  
 Wait, was that Yukari?  
So. Why'd you invite me?  
 To meet your buds?  
 Ew, what are you, my BF?

**Chloe：**  
Yeah, I do remember a lotta talk about worlds and nations and stuff.  
The whole \"Curse you, foul villain!\" mood in the air was kinda creepy.  
I mean, I didn't wanna argue, so I did try to do my angry face too...

You don't know...? Oh, right, sure. Something you can't tell me.  
Well, I'm not gonna pry.  
 But if you're still in any kinda trouble...  
Huh? Wait, hold on. You're not *seriously* clueless about this, are you?
