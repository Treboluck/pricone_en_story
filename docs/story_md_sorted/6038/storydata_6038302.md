## Subtitle: All About Akino
  
**Yuni：**  
So young Akino, the Mercurius guildmaster, is my equal in years.  
 It can't  
be easy to represent her family at such a tender age.  
 What kind of person  
is that youthful heiress? Does she strike others' cheeks with cash for fun?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She gets lost a lot.  
**Choice: (2)**  She likes handing out money.  
**Choice: (3)**  She's always challenging Saren.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm, so our lowly world lies far beneath her noble sight.  
 But of course—  
I too, raised by wise elders, am ignorant of the common ways.  
 ...Hm?  
I may as well be a rich heiress myself! Ohoho—  
*cough* *cough*...

**Yuni：**  
What? She hands out riches?  
 Concerning behavior indeed...  
 Or perhaps  
this is the notion of noblesse oblige—  
the duty of those with privilege.  
Still, to think it falls to you to stop her. I'd usually expect the reverse.

**Yuni：**  
What?! Sarendia Orphanage's Mama Saren—I mean, young Saren?  
Oh, well... I just happen to know of her.  
 It's a fairly long story...  
Huh? You have a room of your own there? As in, 24/7 mama access?!
