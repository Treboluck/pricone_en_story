## Subtitle: The Power to Protect
  
**Chloe：**  
So hey, I was wondering. Can you actually get nasty when you need to?  
Like, being a good guy's great, but can you protect your fam if they're in  
danger?  
 Tell you what—let's try it. I'll be your enemy, so come at me.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Glare at Chloe.  
**Choice: (2)**  Shout at the top of your voice.  
**Choice: (3)**  Draw your sword and swing.

Eh? The heck?  
 ...Oh, giving me the evil eye? Hilarious. Not bad. I mean,  
it's not *scary,* but still.  
 ...Uh. You can stop now.  
 ...No, really, stop! How  
long you gonna stare?  
 Quit it! C'mon. Hey.  
 Dude, you're makin' me blush.

**Chloe：**  
...Tch!  
 Pff... Not bad. I usually read the enemy's face, their windup...  
You know, the danger signs? That's how I dodge attacks.  
 So wild sword  
swings outta nowhere catch me off guard.  
 Actually, isn't that a talent?
