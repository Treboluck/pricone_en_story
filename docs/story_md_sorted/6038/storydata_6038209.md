## Subtitle: Pitch Me Something
  
**Chloe：**  
So, our pitches were a huge failure, but let's forget that. Yeah.  
Moving on, how 'bout you? You should try the pitch thing too.  
Why don't you... try to sell me some random object you've got?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  A Killer Pen.  
**Choice: (2)**  A Mixed Berry Cake.  
**Choice: (3)**  I've got nothing in this world.

What's this? Just bottom-tier rarity trash.  
 Hah, like heck it's precious...  
Huh? It was a present from me? Ohhh...  
 I remember. That takes me back.  
Wait, no way. You've actually still got that thing? That's... nice.

Huh. Gotta say that cake looks familiar, but, well... guess I'll dig in.  
Uweh?! No way. What the?! The heavenly flavor brings tears to my eyes!  
Feels like I might remember a new memory of us bonding... Swoon.

No, you can't have *nothing.* Did you check all your pockets?  
See, you've got a mountain of these, uh, weird ticket things. And look.  
There's no way you need all these coin collections. Shall I throw 'em out?
