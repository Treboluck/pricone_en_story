## Subtitle: Drink Up, Yukari!
  
**Narration：**  
In the road that she swept clear of monsters,  
Yukari is feeling down.  
  
**Yukari：**  
I really am a hopeless adult...  
  
**Yukari：**  
I can't believe I caused you so much trouble.  
Even though I banned myself from barley broth,  
I still ended up making a nuisance for you.  
  
**Yukari：**  
...*sigh*  
  
**Yukari：**  
At this rate I...  
Hm?  
  
**Yukari：**  
What's this bright light...?  
Don't tell me the barley broth is calling out to me...!  
I-I won't give in!  
  

---  
  
**Yukari：**  
Thanks for coming shopping with me.  
Sorry for calling you here so suddenly.  
  
**Yukari：**  
There's nothing in particular that I want to buy.  
I just felt the need to get out and about...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, I hope I didn't worry you.  
No, I'm not sick or anything, so no need to be concerned.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You look different today.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yukari：**  
Huh?... You noticed?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Which means I was right... I'm always...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Huh? Ah... Sorry,  
I'm just suddenly feeling a bit down.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Right now... I'm abstaining from drinking.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Why are you so taken aback?  
Really?  
Is it honestly that surprising?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Well... My little cousin  
said to me, \"Yukari, you smell like Dad does on holidays!\"  
What a thing to say...  
  
**Yukari：**  
I mean, it's probably, almost certainly, definitely true... right?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Sure, I like to drink a lot,  
but at the same level as my uncle on his days off? That's a little much...  
  
**Yukari：**  
I'm a young lady, after all.  
And besides...  
  
**Yukari：**  
It would sadden me to know that  
...you saw me like that too.  
  
**Yukari：**  
So for the time being, I'm holding off on the drink.  
But it's hard for me.  
  
**Yukari：**  
When I'm at home, my hands go on autopilot and open every nearby can.  
Hence why I'm out here... as a distraction.  
  
**Yukari：**  
And it's really nice out here!  
It's refreshing and healthy!  
And there are no unnecessary temptations!  
  
**Clerk：**  
Miss, miss! Would you like to try some?  
The aroma, the taste, the texture—all vastly improved!  
Come have a sample of our new beverage!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Urk...!  
  
**Clerk：**  
I-is something the matter?!  
Why are you suddenly all crouched over...?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  ...Critical hit, right?  
`Tag 2`  
**Yukari：**  
I-I'm fine, I'm fine...!  
I can take this much...!  
  
**Clerk：**  
O-okay then...  
Once again—would you like to try some?  
This new beverage is on a totally different level from our previous drinks!  
  
**Yukari：**  
It... does smell pretty good...!  
  
**Clerk：**  
Doesn't it?  
Please, try as much as you'd like!  
  
**Yukari：**  
As much... as I'd like...?  
  
**Yukari：**  
N-no, I'll pass.  
Don't give into temptation, Yukari...!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Stay strong!  
I want to be an elegant, responsible lady  
who always smells like flowers...!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Go ahead, have a drink.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yukari：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Yukari：**  
N-no, I mustn't!  
Why are you... encouraging me...?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You always smell good.  
`Tag 4`  
**Yukari：**  
Huh?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Just now you said I \"smell good,\" right?  
Always? Me...?  
  
**Yukari：**  
You're not lying, are you...?  
  
**Yukari：**  
A-all right... So that's what you're telling me...  
In that case...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Clerk, could I please try some?  
  
**Clerk：**  
Here, feel free!  
  
**Yukari：**  
...*gulp*  
  
**Clerk：**  
Huh? Downed in one go...?  
  
**Yukari：**  
It's delicious...!  
Clerk, hit me.  
  
**Clerk：**  
O-okay...!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Its fragrant aroma really is an olfactory delight!  
Again!  
  
**Yukari：**  
The feeling as it slips down my throat... I just can't stop...!  
Another!  
  
**Yukari：**  
This bubbliness... It's making my tongue dance...!  
Clerk, round four!  
  
**Clerk：**  
Um, excuse me... miss？  
  
**Yukari：**  
Come on, I'm jusht getting shtarted!  
  
**Clerk：**  
...Sh-she sure is enjoying it...!  
And other shoppers are noticing... This could be fantastic publicity!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Mooaarr!  
  
**Narration：**  
Yukari, after draining nearly all the free drinks until she is blind drunk,  
is taken home by {player}.

**Ameth：**  
Yeah, no matter how you look at it, she had way too much to drink.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And you should have stopped her!  
What exactly were you trying to make her do?!  
  
**Ameth：**  
I suppose she seems happiest when she's drinking...  
Hmmm. I just don't understand.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Everything is best in moderation.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, the fact that she can quit drinking for you  
means that you are her top priority.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Make sure to take good care of her.  
Wait, what kind of advice is that?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, good work.  
I kind of feel like having a drink myself...

**Yukari：**  
Hngh...  
Huh?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Ugh, this is bad. Looks like I fell asleep again...  
Even though I only had a little, it feels like I drank a whole keg...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Huh? You fell asleep too?  
Don't tell me you also...  
Never mind, you don't drink.  
  
**Yukari：**  
*sigh*  
To think I was so thirsty for barley broth that I saw it in my dreams...  
  
**Yukari：**  
But I won't give in!  
I will never drink barley broth again!  
  
**Yukari：**  
The broth ban continues!  
  
**Narration：**  
Yukari renewed her resolve,  
but soon after returning to Landosol,  
she almost walked into a tavern on a whim.
