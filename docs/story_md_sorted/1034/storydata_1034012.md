## Subtitle: The End of Prohibition
  
**Narration：**  
{player} has been summoned to  
the Mercurius Foundation's guildhouse.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Sorry for calling you out here so suddenly.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
It's... about Yukari.  
You know that she's under a...  
\"broth ban,\" was it?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Argh! These calculations are wrong again!  
I'll have to go back to square one! Fine, bring it on!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Since she put herself under the broth ban,  
its effects are manifesting in many places.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Come on, that's why I said I wanted applications in early!  
So why are they always pushing the deadline?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
The Mercurius Foundation's operations are,  
um...  
I don't want to say it, but they're proceeding extremely... well.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Start a new business?  
What are these estimates? Aren't they a bit too optimistic?!  
Whatever, I'll go over there right now and talk to them in person!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
...Yukari  
is doing all the work.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Isn't that a good thing?  
`Tag 1`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yes. I know what I'm saying is strange.  
But in this world, there is such a thing as \"balance\"...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
The more work Yukari does, the more brazen the slackers become...  
I mean, lazy scoundrels come out of the woodwork to push all their  
duties onto her...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Argh, Tamaki, you were eating taiyaki in the hallway again, weren't you?!  
Akino, you still haven't taken a look at the document I asked you to.  
Don't think you can get away without doing it!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
...Ahem. Anyway.  
I can't bear to look at Yukari now because she's always so tense.  
Can you please do something about her?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll figure something out.  
`Tag 2`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Great, I hope you do.  
I'm sure you can get her to relax.  
  
**Yukari：**  
It sure is rare for *you* to be inviting *me* out for dinner,  
wouldn't you say?  
  
**Yukari：**  
I actually had some work left to do...  
but Mifuyu chased me out of the guildhouse .  
  
**Yukari：**  
Sheesh. What was that all about?  
I don't have time to be slacking off...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Anyway, barley broth!  
`Tag 3`  
**Yukari：**  
H-huh?!  
N-no way! You're too young... Wait, me?You're telling me to drink?  
  
**Yukari：**  
...No, I won't.  
  
**Yukari：**  
I already gave up... barley broth.  
Water is fine for me...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Wh-what's that look for?  
I'm being serious. This time, not a single drop will pass my lips!  
  
**Yukari：**  
I'm already over barley broth!  
  
**Owner：**  
Thanks for waiting. Here's your barley broth!  
  
**Yukari：**  
................................................*gulp*  
  
**Yukari：**  
I-I can't...!  
Barkeep, I can't drink this, so please take it away.  
  
**Owner：**  
And one more barley broth!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Why?!  
  
**Owner：**  
It's on the house.  
  
**Yukari：**  
What? Didn't I just say that I'm not going to drink it?!  
  
**Owner：**  
Uhhh, to be honest, we're also in a bit of trouble.  
Since you began your broth ban, our sales have slumped.  
  
**Yukari：**  
I used to drink that much...?  
B-but that's unrelated! I will not drink!  
  
**Yukari：**  
All that happens when I drink  
is that I cause trouble for the people around me.  
  
**Man：**  
Yukari, this one's on me!  
Drink!  
  
**Yukari：**  
What?! The regulars are at it too?  
  
**Woman：**  
When I see you drinking,  
even I enjoy myself more!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Wait... even you?!  
  
**Man：**  
A Yukari who doesn't drink isn't Yukari at all!  
  
**Woman：**  
That's right! Come, dear. Down it in one go like you usually do!  
  
**Yukari：**  
I-I'm not doing it. I already...!  
  
**Deliveryman：**  
Excuse me, I have a delivery for Yukari of the Mercurius Foundation.  
Is this the correct address?  
  
**Yukari：**  
What is it this time?!  
  
**Deliveryman：**  
Er... It's a thank-you for protecting that wagon from monsters  
the other day!  
This is a whole barrel's worth of barley broth!  
  
**Yukari：**  
I can't believe this is happening!  
  
**Yukari：**  
I-I'm not giving in...  
I will not be beaten by a cereal drink...!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Cheers!  
`Tag 4`  
**Yukari：**  
Ah, cheer—  
Wait a minute!  
Come on, I can't let my guard down for even a second!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Anyway, no!  
I will absolutely *not* drink barley broth!  
  
**Yukari：**  
I-I...!  
I don't want to cause any more trouble for you!  
  
**Yukari：**  
You always forgive me,  
but for how long? I have no idea.  
  
**Yukari：**  
I don't want you to hate me any more than you already do...  
If it makes you hate me,  
then I don't need any stupid barley broth!  
  
**Yukari：**  
I'm going to be a responsible lady...  
who you respect... and look up to  
just a little bit more... than you do now!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I will never hate you.  
**Choice: (6)**  I will always respect you.  
`Tag 5`  
**Yukari：**  
There's no need to be polite about it.  
I'm always showing you my bad side...  
I couldn't even cook you a proper meal when I hosted you.  
  
**Yukari：**  
That type of lady is no good, right?  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Yukari：**  
Liar... There's no way.  
The kind of girl who gets sloshed on berries while on the job?  
  
**Yukari：**  
There's no way you could respect that...  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Yukari：**  
It's fine.  
You don't have to flatter me.  
  
**Yukari：**  
I know that I'm unfit to be a lady...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  That's your cutest feature.  
`Tag 8`  
**Yukari：**  
Huh?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Wh-what are you saying all of a sudden?!  
And with such a serious face...!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Stop it! Stop teasing me!  
P-please...!  
  
**Yukari：**  
M-my face is getting hot...!  
  
**Yukari：**  
S-something cold, I need something cold...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Ahhh, what ish thish? Sho gooood...  
Refreshing, fragrant, shmooth,
