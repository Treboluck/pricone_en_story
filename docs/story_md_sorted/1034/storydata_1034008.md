**Narration：**  
Yukari has overdone it drinking once again,  
so {player} carries her to the Mercurius Foundation guildhouse.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Eheheh, sorry, {player}...

**Choice: (1)**  Huh? Yukari?  
`Tag 1`  
**Yukari：**  
Eek! {player}?!  
Oh...  
Um, hello.  
  
**Narration：**  
Yukari quickly hides the big bag of cans she's holding  
behind her back.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Are you headed to a party or something?  
`Tag 2`  
**Yukari：**  
Oh gosh. Guess I wasn't quick enough, huh...  
No, not a party. I just figured I'd drink  
and watch some anime on my day off.  
  
**Yukari：**  
*sigh* I guess a girl who spends all day drinking  
must be pretty cringey, huh?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You are who you are, and that's cool with me.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yukari：**  
Wow... Th-thank you.  
You know, sometimes you say the nicest things out of nowhere.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Huh? Oh, my boss is calling.  
  
**Yukari：**  
What? The documents for the meeting tomorrow?  
Oh yes, right. Those documents.  
Don't worry, I've put them together.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, you want to look over them first thing in the morning?  
So please have everything ready to go?  
U-understood!  
  
**Yukari：**  
O-oh no...  
I forgot all about doing the report.  
  
**Yukari：**  
I'm going to have to pull an all-nighter!  
*sigh* But I'll never get it done at home...  
There's too many temptations. I won't be able to focus!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, what am I going to do?  
A-ha, that's it!  
  
**Yukari：**  
{player}!  
Let's go to your place!

`image display end`  
**Yukari：**  
Ohhh, no, it's no good.  
There's just no end to it!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Bring out some tea.  
`Tag 4`  
**Yukari：**  
Ohh, thank you...  
Sorry about barging into your place like this.  
I just wouldn't be able to get anything done at home.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Bring out some rice balls.  
`Tag 5`  
**Yukari：**  
Thanks... I was getting hungry, actually.  
*chomp, chomp* These are tasty.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Rub her shoulders.  
`Tag 6`  
**Yukari：**  
Mm... That feels nice...  
You know, you're a very kind guy.  
  
**Yukari：**  
...Okay!  
I-I think I'm ready to get back at it!  
Thanks, {player}!  
  
**Yukari：**  
And now we click \"send\", and...  
Whew, all done!  
  
**Yukari：**  
{player}! Thank you so, so much for everything!  
Now then, let's have a drink to celebrate!  
Juice for you, of course!  
  
**Narration：**  
A few hours later.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Yeah, y'know you really saved my shkin tonight...  
You're really shomethin' for how young you are!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Huh? No way, I'm not drunk!  
I'm totally fine. *hic* Enough 'bout me, though...  
Shay, {player}, you got a girlfriend?  
  
**Yukari：**  
If ya don't, then what'sh your type?  
C'mon, tell me! What kinda girl are ya into? *hic*  
  
**Yukari：**  
Mebbe I should call it a night...?  
...But m'not tired.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hey... What're your thoughtsh on older women?  
  
**Yukari：**  
{player}...  
Ya ever thought about taking that next shtep into adulthood?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Ya may not know about it yet, {player}, but lemme tell ya...  
that next shtep is...  
  
  
**Yukari：**  
...Sleep.  
...Zzz, zzz...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Mm... {player}...  
I lov—  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} puts a blanket over the exhausted Yukari,  
an amused smile on his face.

**Ameth：**  
And there we have it. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Just like before, you're going to forget about all of this  
when you wake up.  
But, this time, you might feel  
some lingering happiness.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I have to say, even if you don't remember...  
I'm surprised the two you could spend the night together  
without anything steamy happening.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But, I guess it doesn't matter...  
The two of you will have your day soon enough.  
I suppose that's all we can ask for, huh?  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's enough for today, though. Catch you later. ♪

**Yukari：**  
...Mm, huh? Is this the guildhouse?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, {player}... Good morning.  
Was all of that... a dream?  
  
**Yukari：**  
What? We had the same dream again?  
Wait, I can't really piece it together,  
but wasn't I saying some pretty weird stuff?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hey, what gives?!  
Why're you grinning like that, {player}?!  
Please tell me!
