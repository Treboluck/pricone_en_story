**Tool Shop Owner：**  
Yes, my friend, that is a great deal you got there! Thanks for coming by!  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} has just left the item shop after buying a few things  
when an elven woman calls out to him.  
  
**???：**  
Excuse me, can I talk to you for a moment?  
  
**???：**  
I was sitting on the terrace over there  
when I just so happened to notice you shopping.  
  
**???：**  
Say, you didn't happen to pay 5,000 rupies for a single jar of salve, did you?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  He said I was getting a bargain.  
`Tag 1`  
**???：**  
A bargain?  
Do you mind if I take a look?  
  
**???：**  
I knew it.  
See, this is about the lowest quality of salve you can find.  
Normally, it goes for around 200 rupies for three jars.  
  
**???：**  
I don't mean to be blunt, but... you've been ripped off.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  No way!  
**Choice: (3)**  I'll go ask for a refund.  
`Tag 2`  
**???：**  
It's a shock, I know.  
You looked so happy when you left the store.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**???：**  
You're... a nice guy, I get that.  
You're too laid-back.  
You'll just get swindled again.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**???：**  
Hmm.  
I'm not really good at this sort of thing, but...  
I'll see what I can do.  
  
**???：**  
Hm? What do I have in mind?  
Well... come with me and you'll find out.  
  
**???：**  
Heheh, don't worry. Leave it to me.  
  
**Tool Shop Owner：**  
Hey there, welcome!  
What might a pretty lady like yourself be looking for today?  
  
**???：**  
Let's see... Do you have any salve?  
  
**Tool Shop Owner：**  
Boy, do I! Lady, this is your lucky day!  
Just so happens I have a real bargain in stock!  
  
**???：**  
Wow, a bargain?  
Would this \"bargain\" happen to be... the substandard salve you sold this boy?  
  
**Tool Shop Owner：**  
Wha... Hey, wasn't that kid just in here?  
  
**???：**  
He was, and it's clear that you sold him salve at an outrageous price.  
  
**???：**  
You're running a dishonest business that preys on young adventurers  
by selling them inferior goods for exorbitant sums.  
I think you need to pack it up and leave the town.  
  
**Tool Shop Owner：**  
Psh. Even women and kids are acting all tough now.  
  
**???：**  
What did you say?  
  
**Tool Shop Owner：**  
I didn't do anything wrong! This world is rotten with monsters, lady.  
It's survival of the fittest out there.  
Of course guys like me are gonna peel rupies away from the rubes!!  
  
**???：**  
Look here, this boy trusted you when he paid you his money.  
Doesn't that make you feel at least a little bit guilty?  
  
**Tool Shop Owner：**  
Not in the slightest!  
He ate up every last bit of my spiel like a fool!  
If anything, this is all on him for being such a sucker!  
  
**???：**  
I see. I understand now.  
  
**Tool Shop Owner：**  
Huh? What exactly do you under—  
  
**???：**  
To my knowledge, according to Article 19 of the Landosol Commercial  
Code, all proprietors of businesses in the royal capital must not seek  
to profit unjustly from adventurers.  
  
**Tool Shop Owner：**  
...What?!  
  
**???：**  
Or there's Article 24 of the Public Law. \"All trade businesses  
must offer the same prices with no discrimination in regards to  
race or profession.\"  
That might apply here too, don't you think?  
  
**Tool Shop Owner：**  
W-Well...  
  
**???：**  
In any event, I think we need to bring this before the proper authorities.  
A bit of fair warning, but I know every bit of financial law in Landosol by  
heart.  
 I trust that you're ready to fight this battle to the bitter end?  
  
**Tool Shop Owner：**  
M-my deepest apologies!  
Please, let's keep this off the records.  
Forgive my harsh words earlier. I-I apologize for everything!  
  
**???：**  
And what about the money for the medicine you sold this boy?  
  
**Tool Shop Owner：**  
Oh, of course! A full refund for the young master!  
Now please, I'm begging you, forgive me this one mistake!  
  
**???：**  
I'm pleased to see that you've learned your lesson.  
  
**???：**  
Just make sure that you treat adventurers kindly and fairly from here on out.  
  
**???：**  
Here. The money you paid, refunded as hoped.  
Seriously, though, the least he could have done after all that was throw in some freebies!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, no, no need to thank me. I'm Yukari.  
I run all the books for a guild called the Mercurius Foundation,  
so I'm pretty savvy when it comes to finances.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hmm. I don't think I've seen you around here before.  
Are you new to the area?  
  
**Yukari：**  
I see, so your name is {player}.  
Heheh. You're such a sweet, honest kid. Just make sure you  
watch out for big, bad grown-ups trying to gobble you up. ♪  
  
**Yukari：**  
Anyway, maybe we'll bump into each other again. Bye!  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} was left thoroughly impressed  
by the lovely lady who swept in heroically out of the blue  
to aid him in his hour of need.
