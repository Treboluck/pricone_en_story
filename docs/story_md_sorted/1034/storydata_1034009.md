**Owner：**  
Whoa there, slow down, miss!  
Don't you think you've had a little too much?  
Can you even stand up?  
  
**Owner：**  
Please don't cause a nuisance to the other patrons.  
There are people trying to trade tools here.  
  
**Yukari：**  
I don't shee a porblem!

**Choice: (2)**  Look out!  
`Tag 2`  
**Yukari：**  
Whaa?  
  
**Owner：**  
Ugh... What did I tell you?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Waahh! Hyeaargh?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
...Urk. Ow, ow, ow...  
Huh...?  
{player}, why did you jump on me...?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Were you protecting me...?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You're not hurt, are you?  
`Tag 3`  
**Yukari：**  
N-no...  
  
**Yukari：**  
He just risked his life to protect me...  
H-his face is too close, too close, too close...!  
  
**Merchant：**  
Hey you, are you all right?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh! Are you the guy whose seat I bumped into...?  
I'm so sorry I flipped your table...  
  
**Merchant：**  
Uh... Actually,  
I'm more worried about him!  
When he jumped up to protect you, he was hit by an anti-criminal magic device!  
  
**Merchant：**  
This thing temporarily restricts its target's movements.  
Whatever part of you it hit won't be able to move for a while...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  ...I can't move my right hand.  
`Tag 4`  
**Yukari：**  
Huh? Really?!  
I'm so sorry! It's all my fault...!  
  
**Yukari：**  
It's no problem...?  
Of course it's a problem!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Anyway, today you're coming to my place.  
Let me take care of the things you need your hand for.  
  
**Yukari：**  
All right, open wide.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Well, how is it?  
  
**Yukari：**  
We had to suddenly leave the tavern  
because I caused a scene and made a mess. We didn't get to finish our meal, did we?  
  
**Yukari：**  
I only used what I had on hand,  
so it turned out to be just a simple stir-fry,  
but I hope you like it.  
  
**Yukari：**  
It's good? Better than last time?  
...Oh, you remember when I hosted you before.  
But it was a total mess back then. This time is different.  
  
**Yukari：**  
You know, it's not like everything I do is a failure.  
It's just... when you're around, I get a little distracted, is all.  
  
**Yukari：**  
You've... seen everything, haven't you?  
All my bad points, that is.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Eheheh. Next bite—open up!  
Oh, let me blow on it to cool it down for you first. ♪  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I can eat with my left hand.  
**Choice: (6)**  Aaaah.  
`Tag 5`  
**Yukari：**  
What's this? Are you embarrassed?  
You'll just have to deal with it. You'd make a mess with your left hand.  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Yukari：**  
Here you go. Be careful now, it's still a bit hot.  
Oh, you got some on your face. Let me wipe it off for you.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Yukari：**  
Come to think of it, even though it was all unintentional...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Not only have I brought him home with me,  
but I'll have to take care of him too, right?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Wh-what should I do?  
This situation is totally like—!  
  
**Yukari：**  
T-take it easy, Yukari.  
It's all because I caused a nuisance...!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Somehow you're managing to stay calm, aren't you?  
Even though I'm all in a fluster.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Huh? You're used to it?  
Being fed?  
...Being taken care of?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Could it be a normal thing that everybody does?  
  
**Yukari：**  
......  
  
**Yukari：**  
But... again, I'm sorry.  
  
**Yukari：**  
To think I got too drunk and caused you a lot of trouble.  
I'm such a failure...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  You didn't cause me any trouble at all.  
`Tag 8`  
**Yukari：**  
*sigh* There you go again, saying kind things!  
  
**Yukari：**  
But it's no use! For once I can't forgive myself!  
Therefore.... I've made up my mind!  
  
**Yukari：**  
I'm... giving up barley broth!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Huh? Wh-what's with that face?!  
Don't you think I have it in me?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
I-I'm definitely gonna quit!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Henceforth, I, Yukari, am under a barley broth ban...  
No, that's too long.  
Barley ban.  
Still not quite right.  
How about...  
broth ban!  
  
**Yukari：**  
I am under a broth ban!  
  
**Narration：**  
Yukari's sonorous declaration  
of self-enforced barley broth prohibition  
echoed through the still night.
