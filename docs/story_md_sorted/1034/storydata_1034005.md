Yukari and {player} are attacked by monsters while picking wild berries. Intoxicating fruit puts her to sleep, forcing him to fight alone. Things look grim until Yukari saves the day with magic cast in her sleep.
  
## Subtitle: Hushed Havoc!
  
**Narration：**  
{player} pays a visit to Yukari's guildhouse.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh no, what do I do?  
I'll never make quota by myself, no matter how hard I work.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Huh, {player}?  
It's rare to see you here at the guildhouse.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, but I'm sorry! I'm a bit tied up today.  
I'd love to hang out with you, but I can't...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I saw your job posting.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yukari：**  
Huh...? Wait, do you mean that you came here to work?  
Oh wow, that would be a huge help! Thank you!  
  
**Yukari：**  
You see, all of the other guild members are off  
handling a huge request we received.  
Unfortunately,  
that leaves us shorthanded for our other jobs.  
  
**Yukari：**  
But I know I can count on you. So thanks for coming to help!  
Knocking this job out will be a cinch if we work together!

**Yukari：**  
Here we are.  
Our job this time is to pick a type of berry  
that grows wild in this forest.  
  
**Yukari：**  
This berry has a distinct scent that makes it very easy to find,  
but we need to gather so many that I couldn't do it alone...  
Oh, speak of the devil. I smell some now.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It smells like what you always drink.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yukari：**  
Hey, you've got a pretty sharp nose.  
Heheh, maybe you learned that scent from being around me?  
  
**Yukari：**  
The berries have intoxicating properties.  
So the smell tends to hang in the air wherever they grow.  
  
**Yukari：**  
You can brew spirits out of them pretty easily too.  
But don't eat them just because they look tasty.  
They aren't to be taken lightly.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Wh-what's with that look? It's like you're saying,  
\"You're one to talk...\"  
Don't you worry about me.  
Though I have to admit, that's a really nice smell...  
*gulp*  
  
**Yukari：**  
...Oh! Um, no, I'm fine!  
I would never, ever eat on the job!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Have some faith in old Yukari here!  
Anyway, let's get to picking those berries!  
  

---  
  
**Yukari：**  
Eheheh. Bahahahah!  
Hey, these are sooo good! C'mon, you gotta try one.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You're already drunk as a skunk.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yukari：**  
Aw, don't be such a prude. With you being a minor and all,  
we never get to drink together,  
but berriesh are okay!  
This'sh a real chance for ush.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Sho... c'mon, have a few berriesh and looshen up with me!  
Let'sh feel good and have fun!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Continue quietly picking berries.  
`Tag 4`  
**Yukari：**  
Boo, you're no fun at all!  
Ahh, whatever, I'm jus' gonna passh out for a bit.  
...Zzz, zzz...  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} finishes gathering the berries.  
Just as he's about to wake Yukari, a monster appears.  
  
**Monster：**  
Grraaarghhh!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Mmm...  
Eheheh, {player}...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Take on the monster.  
`Tag 5`  
**Monster：**  
Grrrghhh!  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} battles the monster alone as Yukari sleeps on.  
The odds are even at first, but as the fight presses on,  
he finds himself in dire straits.  
  
**Monster：**  
Grraaarghhh!  
  
**Narration：**  
The monster then finds an opening,  
launching an especially vicious blow.  
{player} braces for some major damage, when...  
  
**Monster：**  
Grraaarghhh!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Mmm...  
{player}, no touching me there!  
  

---  
  
**Monster：**  
Gyaaarghhh!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Yukari... She cast a spell in her sleep...  
`Tag 6`  
**Yukari：**  
Zzz... Zzz...  
I swear, you're such a naughty boy, heheheh...  
  
**Narration：**  
But {player}'s battle with the beast has left him completely spent.  
He realizes that he has no more fight left in him when...  
  
**Monster：**  
Grraaarghhh!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Another monster! I'm done for!  
`Tag 7`  
**Yukari：**  
Mm...  
Save shome booze for me...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Healing, healing... Mmmnnh.  
  

---  
  
**Monster：**  
Gyaaarghhh!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Mnnh... Nnahh! Boy, I really dozed off there.  
...Huh? {player}?  
Wh-what're you doing on the ground here beside me?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Wait... Don't tell me: I ate some berries...  
What, you say I then got drunk and fell asleep?  
And made you do all the work?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Ohmigosh... I-I'm so sorry! I really am!  
Oh, all you seem to do is get me out of messes,  
when it should be the other way around!  
  
**Yukari：**  
What's that?  
You say it's fine, since I'm the one who saved you?  
Wh-what do you mean?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hey, {player}, why are you laughing?  
C'mon, tell me!  
  
**Narration：**  
Though Yukari didn't quite get why,  
the bond between the two of them grew even stronger.
