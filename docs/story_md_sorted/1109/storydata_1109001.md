## Subtitle: Just Another Magical Day
  
**Narration：**  
At St. Theresa's Academy for Girls,  
young ladies in the prime of their adolescence  
gather after school to amuse themselves with girl talk.  
  
**Student 1：**  
So, hey. Did you guys hear?  
The prez of the class next door was seen with a *boy* yesterday!  
  
**Student 2：**  
A-a boy?!  
No way. How come? Are they dating?  
  
**Student 3：**  
Maybe they are...  
Aw man, I want a boyfriend too! Someone find me a guy!  
  
**Student 1：**  
Easy to say, but... y'know?  
...Like, uh, anyone got anything?  
  
**Student 2：**  
...  
  
**Student 2：**  
Um...  
For starters, who's the most popular with guys here?  
...Well, it's Chieru.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Me?  
  
**Student 3：**  
Yeah, gotta be Chieru.  
She's got the looks, got the charm...  
She gets along with literally anyone, too.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? Wait—wait, you guys. What's all this now?  
When'd we start a praise-Chieru-till-she-drops contest?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Super sorry!  
The conversation seemed boring, so I was barely listening.  
Can we start over from the top?  
  
**Student 1：**  
Oh, c'mon.  
We're just saying you're popular with guys.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh. Yes, extremely.  
  
**Student 2：**  
Y... yeesh. No modest denial or anything, huh?  
  
**Student 3：**  
Well, I guess it figures. With a face as cute as hers.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, yes! That's just it!  
Right? Boys go way too crazy for cute faces, don't they?  
  
**Student 2：**  
...Forget denials, she's doubling down on it.  
  
**Student 3：**  
And is she acting like she's somehow the victim?  
  
**Chieru：**  
It's ridiculous!  
Just 'cause of my face, boys have been all over me since forever!  
And like, sorry to burst your bubble, guys,  
 but it's just a pain.  
  
**Student 1：**  
Woooow...  
  
**Student 2：**  
How to put this...  
  
**Student 3：**  
Bit late to say it, but this girl sure is something.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? Is it just me, or am I getting icy stares?  
  
**Student 3：**  
...Li'l bit.  
No, but listen—it's just that you're so honest and breezy...  
You always do your own thing, see? If anything, I'm impressed.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ohhh... I see...  
Right, right, I get what you're saying here.  
Let me try again, then. Take two!  
  
**Chieru：**  
M-me, popular with boys?!  
No way, no way! Not at all! You've got me all wrong!  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Is that more the right reaction?  
Like, sure. I can do the modest thing if you want.  
  
**Chieru：**  
But then I'm sure you'll be all,  
\"Bah! Get a load of her!\" \"Who does she even think she's fooling?\"  
and we'll be right back to the icy glares.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Point is, whatever I say, you're just gonna take it out on me.  
Isn't that the dumbest thing?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? Is being cute a crime in Landosol?  
Sorry, officer! I've got a kinda pretty face!  
Do I have human rights? Am I allowed here?  
  
**Student 2：**  
I dunno, but, uh... with that personality, I think you'll be fine.  
  
**Student 1：**  
Gotta say, it's a waste, though. You've got those good looks...  
But you take, like, zero interest in boys or romance, right?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Maybe not *zero*, but well, yes. They're low on the priority list.  
Definitely below friendship, hobbies and studying, at least.  
  
**Student 2：**  
Um, below studying? That's basically rock bottom!  
  
**Student 3：**  
I can't believe I'm hearing this! I *so* need romance in my life!  
  
**Chieru：**  
The girls around me are at that age  
where they constantly chatter about love and relationships.  
I'm sure it must be how they have their fun.  
  
**Chieru：**  
But I have so many kinds of \"fun\" in my life.  
Just chatting after school like this is fun, of course,  
but then I love to visit new places, meet all kinds of people...  
  
**Chieru：**  
These magical years of youth won't go on forever.  
That's why, as long as this special season of my life lasts,  
I want to fill it with as many kinds of \"fun\" as I can.  
  
**Chieru：**  
All this romance stuff that gets them so excited...  
Well, it would probably be fun too if I tried it.  
It's been an ultra-popular pastime since forever, after all.  
  
**Chieru：**  
But I dunno. Finding just one special person and becoming lovers?  
Having to care about them above everything else?  
Feels to me like the cons outweigh the pros, that's all.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Life's way too short for love.  
  
**Student 2：**  
Hey, Chieru, what're you muttering about?  
Were you even listening just now?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Nope, not at all.  
So? What is it now?  
  
**Student 3：**  
Get this—Miiko says she's gone and fallen for some guy!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Whoa, for real?  
I mean, *again? *  
  
**Student 2：**  
That's our Miiko.  
Two minutes with a guy, and she'll be swooning.  
  
**Student 1：**  
Wha...? I didn't say I, like, *like* like him!  
I think he seems kind of cute, that's all...!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Aw, even as she tries to deny it,  
she's got L-O-V-E written all over her face!  
  
**Chieru：**  
So? Like, who's the guy? Where'd you find him this time?  
  
**Student 3：**  
It's a delivery boy who drops by her house sometimes, she says!  
  
**Chieru：**  
A delivery boy...  
Oh, I see. So he brought the gift of love in a pretty package!  
What a clever little thing to say!  
  
**Student 2：**  
Whether it was clever or not, you're the one who said it.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Whether it was me or not,  
 you can't deny it was clever!  
  
**Chieru：**  
So? So? How's his personality and stuff?  
What celebrity does he look most like?  
Where would you place him in the Cute/Cool/Passion trinity?  
  
**Student 1：**  
Huh~? I dunno...  
 He's sort of ditzy, which is so Cute, but he's also  
got a strong and silent side, which is more Cool...  
 And he sometimes  
says the weirdest things, which is a killer Passion trait...!  
  
**Chieru：**  
All three types covered?  
Huh? People like that exist? Who is this guy?  
You're saying he's, what... a ditzy, aloof, kooky part-timer?  
  
**Student 1：**  
Well, yes... He's just so unique, he seems to defy all the usual examples!  
Hehehe... Let me see if the name horoscope thinks we're a good match!  
  
**Student 3：**  
\"{player}\"...  
Ooh, that's his name, huh?  
 I like the sound of it!  
  
**Chieru：**  
But he's a ditzy, aloof, kooky part-timer, remember?  
  
**Student 2：**  
And the face?! What's he look like?!  
  
**Student 1：**  
Ohh~! I don't know...  
Personally, I'd rate him as a total cutie... Eheheh.  
  
**Chieru：**  
But he's a ditzy, aloof, kooky part-timer, remember?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well... I mean, no accounting for taste and all that.  
It's great that you seem so happy and all.  
  
**Student 1：**  
Ahhh...  
I'd really love to date him...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hmmm.  
If you're serious, why don't you go ask him out?  
  
**Student 1：**  
Eh?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Eh?  
  
**Student 1：**  
...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Um, huh? What's the silence for?  
Huh? Like, you want to date this guy, don't you?  
Then, you know? Right?  
  
**Chieru：**  
You could just... go up to him and say so?  
  
**Student 2：**  
...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh~? What is it now?  
Why's everyone sharing those silent looks?  
Am I the weird one here somehow?  
  
**Student 1：**  
It's... not weird exactly...  
But it feels so rushed... or, like, careless?  
If it was that easy, we wouldn't be here right now...  
  
**Student 2：**  
I see Chieru's deal.  
Living life in the Cutie Elite, she's always had boys come to her.  
She doesn't know the first thing about normal romance.  
  
**Student 3：**  
Yeah, this is pro bias.  
You see it in game guides and stuff sometimes, too.  
\"Just use the right weapon and this stage'll be a breeze!\" they'll say.  
  
**Student 3：**  
And I'm like, good for you?  
I'm looking at a guide 'cause I *don't* have all the rare gear!  
Some people need to spare a thought for the less fortunate.  
  
**Student 1：**  
Yeah. I'm way under-leveled for this...  
I can't just... ask him out...  
  
**Student 2：**  
See? Now Miiko's feeling bad.  
Chieru, you'd better help her out of this mess.  
  
**Student 3：**  
Yeah! Lend the poor girl a hand!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, sure. I'll do that, then.  
  
**Student 3：**  
Eh?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Eh?  
  
**Chieru：**  
...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Um... I said, sure I will?  
You just want me to get Miiko and what's-his-name together  
like some kind of pretty little Cupid, right?  
  
**Student 1：**  
Really?! You will? You'll do that for me?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
'Course I will, 'course I will!  
When a pal's in trouble, Chieru's here to help!  
Cheru~n! ☆  
  
**Student 1：**  
Chieruuuu!  
  
**Chieru：**  
A tender heart torn by budding affection...  
To help her friend, one girl bravely takes a stand!  
Oh, it's too perfect!  
 I can see the standing ovation already!  
  
**Student 1：**  
Huh...? You seem to be... having fun, Chieru.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yes!  
This'll be a great new way to pass the time!  
  
**Student 1：**  
Eh?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yep!  
  
**Student 1：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Chieru：**  
You betcha!  
  
**Narration：**  
To help her friend... or at least to enjoy her newfound Cupid role,  
Chieru leapt out of the classroom bursting with pure enthusiasm.
