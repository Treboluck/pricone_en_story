**Narration：**  
It's a day like any other at St. Theresa's Academy,  
and a familiar group of young ladies  
is enjoying another round of amusing girl talk.  
  
**Student 1：**  
So, like, my *boyfriend...*  
Since the moment we first met,  
he's only had eyes for me~!  
  
**Student 2：**  
Ugh, not more of this.  
Give it a rest. We've heard enough.  
  
**Student 3：**  
Seriously. Read the room already.  
Man, I never thought Miiko would *actually* get a boyfriend.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Whagh—?!  
  
**Student 2：**  
Uh, what's up, Chieru? That was a weird noise, even for you.  
  
**Student 3：**  
Actually, why's your face gone all white?  
Maybe you oughtta sit down.  
  
**Chieru：**  
B-but... Miiko?! Is it true what they're saying?!  
  
**Student 1：**  
Eheh. Yep, it's true~! ☆  
I bumped into him yesterday, and once we got talking,  
one thing kinda led to another...  
 Eheh... eheheh...  
  
**Chieru：**  
B-but... no way...  
Huh? I mean, I thought...  
What happened to \"zero interest in romance\"...?!  
  
**Student 2：**  
Huh? Did you ever say that, Miiko?  
  
**Student 3：**  
As if Miiko would ever!  
She's always been the biggest sucker for that stuff.  
  
**Student 2：**  
Right?  
Up till just recently, she was head over heels for that delivery boy, too.  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Student 1：**  
Oh... *that* guy.  
Heh... I'd almost forgotten about him.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? Huh?!  
  
**Student 2：**  
Now *that's* classic Miiko.  
A crush that went literally nowhere,  
and she goes all misty-eyed like he's an old flame.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Uh—wait wait wait.  
Huh? So Miiko's going out with *which* guy now?  
Like, it's, um... *not* the delivery boy...?  
  
**Student 2：**  
Yeah, not him—y'know, the other guy.  
You met him that one time too, right? From Lucy AC...  
His name slips my mind, but he acted like such a big shot.  
  
**Chieru：**  
No, that doesn't ring even a tiny bell.  
But... I see! So it's just some other nobody! Gotcha, gotcha!  
Yeesh, say these things sooner! You really surprised me!  
  
**Student 1：**  
Hahah. You look so happy.  
Wasn't expecting you to be this thrilled for me!  
Thanks! We'll make sure not to mess this one up!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Waheeey!  
Big congrats on that! I'm so jelly! Woo!  
  
**Student 2：**  
Huh, what's this?  
You're even more hyper than usual, Chieru.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Bahahah!  
Now look who's so last week! Poor guy! Hilarious!  
Bweheheh! Ow, my sides!  
  
**Student 3：**  
Wow, she really is going for it.  
What's up, Chieru? You hear some good news?  
  
**Chieru：**  
No! Nothing like that in the slightest...  
 Eheheh...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Miracle Chellerun, chelly-chelly hoy! ♪  
  
**Chieru：**  
Now then! The school day's over,  
but it'd be a terrible shame to head straight home!  
Where's a random passerby who'll help me pass the time~?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ooh, here we go!  
 Nyeheheh...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Heeey, {player}! ♪  
Coincidence much? What brings you to these chellery parts~?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm working, actually.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm working, chellery.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chieru：**  
Yep, 'course you are!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Chieru：**  
Chelly good, chellster!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Chieru：**  
Well, I mean, of course.  
Literally every time I see you 'round here,  
it's 'cause you're making deliveries, huh?  
  
**Chieru：**  
So I was hanging around wondering if you'd show up...  
Uh, I mean,  
 I just happened to be passing through...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Anyway! Can't stand around forever,  
so shall we drop by that cafe again?  
By the way, I'm in an all-treats-welcome mood today!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Can't cafe. Gotta work.  
`Tag 4`  
**Chieru：**  
Instant rejection?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
No... wait, wait. Isn't this a bit weird?  
Like, sure. I can see you're working and stuff.  
It'd actually be creepy if you dropped it all to buy me a drink.  
  
**Chieru：**  
But a point-blank rejection...?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Shouldn't an ultra-cutie's invitation make you hesitate a little?  
At least turn me down with a wistful sigh! Like, come on.  
Huh? Are you feeling OK?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Actually, I've been wondering for a while,  
but could it be that even aside from the zero romantic interest...  
  
**Chieru：**  
He's somehow failed to notice I'm a cutie in the first place?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Grrr... Guys throwing themselves at me is annoying,  
but this total indifference is killing me too!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Curse you, {player}...!  
I guess I'll have to teach you a lesson!  
Take this! My chelliest dose of ultra-concentrated cute!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Waahhh!

**Chieru：**  
Owiiie!  
I think I tripped over my own feet!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ohhh...  
I've broken so many bones, I'll need five years of treatment!  
Aren't I the world's biggest klutz you wanna protect with your life?  
  
**Chieru：**  
But I won't give up!  
In this dog-eat-bunny world of Landosol,  
I'll stand on my own two tootsies! Up I go...

**Chieru：**  
No, no, no, I do *not* need a stretcher!  
Stop, stop. Don't ask passersby for emergency help!  
...I'm healed! Amazing! It's a chelly Landosol miracle!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Close call much?! Almost got sent to the freakin' hospital...  
And like, I know this was my idea,  
but who actually believes a ridiculous skit like that?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Could it be that this guy...  
Rather than oblivious or a chump...  
He's just a plain old idiot?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? {player}? What is it this time?  
Huhhh?! You'll carry me home?!  
N-no! That's totally fine! I'm extremely fine!  
  
**Chieru：**  
See, I'm dandy! Never been chellier, actually!  
Check this! I can even dance the Chellarena like a pro—  
 Oww!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Ehhh? Who's this clown of a brat?  
That hurt, you little dumbass!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ooh! So sowwy~!  
Guess I messed up! Tongue out, cute wink! ☆  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Why, you... What's that attitude?! You tryna make a fool of us?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
N-no, um, look... That's not what I...  
This is a super-sincere apology with added adorbs, see?  
Uh-oh... Did I make totally the wrong call?  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Whaddaya say, men?!  
Shall we teach this little pipsqueak  
what it means to have good manners?! Gueheheh...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? Seriously...? Like, no joke? A real-life \"gueheheh\"?  
N-no way! Right here in the city?!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Now, girlie... Hold still for me. Gueheheheh...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Nooooooo!  
I'm so sorryyyy!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Stand in front of Chieru.  
`Tag 8`  
**Ruffian：**  
Ehhhh?!  
What's your deal, punk?  
Outta my way! You got a death wish or what?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ahh... {player}...?!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  I think that's enough.  
`Tag 9`  
**Ruffian：**  
Hah. The kid wants us to stop!  
Now, ain't that a laugh?! Gueheheh!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Lemme fill you in on the deal. We're so infamous 'round here,  
newborn babies would stand up and run at the sight of us!  
We ain't no third-rate thugs who'd stop 'cause you asked nicely.  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Ehh? \"And why not?\"  
Who needs a reason?! This is just how us tough guys roll!  
Can't let regular folk get any funny ideas!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
There's no need? We can all get along?!  
Bah! Dumb brat! As if that's ever been an option.  
Bruisers like us will never be welcome in this city...  
  
**Ruffian：**  
What? You, brat? You'll be our friend, you say?!  
Gueheheh! Now, that I haven't heard before!  
Dang, you've got guts. I think I like you, kid. Gueheheh.  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Say what? This laugh of mine? Huh? It's kinda scary?  
Y-you think so? I've laughed like this since I was a kid...  
S-sure, all right. I'll try to tone it down. Gueheheh.  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Whoa! Look at the time!  
We're gonna be late for our volunteer job cleaning up trash!  
The old guys in charge always worry if we ain't there on the dot...  
  
**Ruffian：**  
See you 'round, kid.  
And you, girlie—I like your moxie, but don't forget your manners.  
Honestly! Parents these days have never heard of discipline! Gueheheh.  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Phuaahh! That was scary!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, um, and, {player}...  
I, um, guess you saved me, so...  
Thank you very much.  
  
**Chieru：**  
In the end, I guess it wasn't necessary, but...  
For a moment there,  
 you did seem... a little bit cool.  
  
**Choice: (10)**  I didn't do a thing.  
`Tag 10`  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, you! Don't be so modest!  
You didn't mean to...  
 um, what? Then what *did* you mean to do?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh. They didn't seem like bad people?  
You thought they'd understand? So you just spoke your mind...?  
  
**Chieru：**  
I-is that right.  
  
**Chieru：**  
For real?  
Could it be that this guy... is just some kind of literal saint?!  
  
**Narration：**  
In the space of a single day,  
Chieru found her opinion of {player}  
flip-flopping wildly between several extremes.
