**Rino：**  
Yahh!  
Yah-yah-yah-yah-yahhh!  
I'm gonna keep firing till I run out of arrows!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Miss Kaiser!  
If there's any way, I want to help you too! So...  
For now...  
 I'm sorry!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Octo!  
Don't you dare hold back!  
  
**Octo：**  
I know, I know!  
  
**Jun：**  
Heinous felon, Omniscient Kaiser!  
For controlling us and defiling the throne, you will pay dearly!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Haaahhh!  
Wolven Rend!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hiyaahhh!  
Ryukyu-Ken Knuckle Cannon!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...A... ...aaahhh...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...I-it's no good...I can't attack her...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I betrayed her... opposed her...  
But after all that... I still can't bring myself to hurt her...!  
I'm just the absolute worst...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Nghhh...!  
It's not like our attacks aren't hitting...  
  
**Rei：**  
But it feels like we're getting nowhere!  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's just like when I used to punch giant boulders for training as a kid!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Once more, then. This time, I'm gonna slice you in half!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Spiresbane Blade!  
  
**Muimi：**  
...How's that?!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Let's see.  
To be frank, I hoped you'd make a little more of an effort.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Healing magic as well?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Urgh...!  
Everything we do is just dropping in buckets!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It's \"a drop in the bucket,\" Rino!  
But... all we can do is keep trying!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Dunno what those words mean, but right on!  
Yaaahhhhhhh!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...How tedious.  
You really are as meaningless as your name.  
  
**Jun：**  
...!  
Look out, Muimi!  
  
**Jun & Muimi：**  
Aaaaghhh!  
  
**Octo：**  
Nov... Muimi!  
Captain!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Jun shielded Miss Muimi,  
but the attack incapacitated them both!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Ah, so tedious. It's all so pointless.  
You people... this world...  
All of it.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Where did it all go wrong, I wonder?  
Perhaps I was too hasty with Astrum's creation.  
I should have done it without the other Crowns' help.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Despite compromising my vision to speed its completion,  
in the end, by the time it was done,  
I was already too old to indulge in a world of dreams and adventure.  
  
**Yui：**  
Miss Kaiser...?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Yui... Kusano.  
Let me tell you... I do take pride in my status as a god.  
But if there's one thing in this world that I still envy...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
That thing would be you.  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh?!  
M-me...?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
A girl like you, who everyone adores—even destiny itself.  
A perfect little princess, standing up to me.  
Spouting hackneyed ideals together with all your friends.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...It really is a dreadful bore.  
Why, it's as though I'm some kind of villainous queen!  
  
**Neneka：**  
...Mana.  
Just as I thought, you...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Ngh...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
U... urghhh...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...I have a proposal! Omniscient Kaiser!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Oh...?  
 Haha...  
Begging for your life, princess? But it's far too late for that.  
Just because you see you've lost, you can't expect...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's not what I'm doing!  
No matter what reasons you have...  
I won't be able to forgive you. But...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But...  
But... listen...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Won't you join us for a meal?!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
To be honest,  
 I didn't understand much of what you told us.  
But just like I can't forgive what you've done,  
you have an enemy you can't forgive too, right?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You lost something precious, and it's hurting you too, right?!  
Then I'm sure we're no different deep down!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Even though I really don't want to,  
I think I can understand exactly how you feel!  
After all, when I lost everything I had,  
 it filled me with hate too!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But... right now, I don't feel like the world's so bad anymore.  
Because no matter how bad things got for me,  
I found people I really love, who eat meals with me every day!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Pecorine...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So isn't something totally wrong here?  
You're the one who took everything I had...  
so why do you look so unsatisfied?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I need to snatch back everything you stole away from me.  
But if you... the villain who ran off with my entire life...  
look so empty inside... What's even left for me to take back?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So please, at least join me for a meal!  
There's a diner where I did a bunch of part-time work...  
Or the crepe stall down that alley! Or parfaits! Or monster cuisine!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Sure, those places are closed right now...  
Well, they're probably not even in one piece...  
But all the food in this city really is delicious! And I'm sure...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If you just try sharing a meal with someone,  
and see how great it feels... I'm sure once you see that,  
you won't think everything's pointless anymore!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Honestly, you make no sense.  
I may be able to handle huge volumes of data, but if there's one thing  
even I can't process, it's the mad ravings of lunatics like you.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Share food together?  
...Oh, please.  
 You're so utterly oblivious, it makes me sick!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
A god doesn't need to share a single thing!  
I decide for myself when to give and when to take away!  
Just like... this!  
  
**All：**  
Aaaaaaghhhhh!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Owwwww...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Nghhhhh...!  
She just loves to send us flying, doesn't she...?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
Omniscient... Kaiser...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Now... We've swept away the rabble,  
so it's high time I executed you myself!  
Foolish little princess!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Flee for your life, Miss Pecorine...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh...!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Defend Pecorine.
