**Narration：**  
The Omniscient Kaiser unleashes a blast of magical energy.  
The sheer force of the shockwave knocks {player}  
and all his allies off their feet at once.  
  
**Makoto：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
 Dammit...!  
  
**Kaori：**  
U-urghh...  
She's just ridiculously strong...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
H-hey, guys... Are you OK...?  
  
**Rei：**  
It looks like... we're still alive, just barely...  
  
**Rino：**  
Th-thanks so much for that, you in the pink...  
You protected us all with your defense magic...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yes, and little Kokkoro too...  
  
**Yui：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
 No, no—it's thanks to Mr. Knight  
that we had enough strength to protect everyone at once.  
But...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The Kaiser's strength is overwhelming. Even with my lord's power,  
we will not survive many more attacks of that caliber.  
At this rate...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...How pitiful.  
All I've done so far is toy with you a tiny bit...  
Are all of you down for the count already?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Makes me wonder if I should even have bothered taking this form.  
...*sigh*  
  
**Rei：**  
Ngh...!  
Think you've won already, do you...?!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Hah.  
You think this is a victory? Perish the thought.  
If it were... it would surely taste far less empty.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Empty...?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I told this to Christina just now too, but...  
Originally, I never intended to truly do battle with you.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I never planned to show you all this form.  
I didn't intend to play my trump card at this stage.  
I was hoping to save it for the real battle that still lies ahead of me...  
  
**Kaori：**  
The \"real battle\"...?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Not against the Seven Crowns...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Or against us who rebelled against you...?  
Your Majesty...  
  
**Yui：**  
Please tell us!  
Who or what... is the enemy you're trying to face?!  
Omniscient Kaiser...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...This from you of all people, little Yui?  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Well... fine. The sunset is as beautiful as as sea of blood...  
And none of you will see another night,  
so I suppose I'll chat with you one last time.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
In the first place...  
This world is a bundle of lies and illusions. A fantasy of empty dreams.  
As you lived your simple lives, did none of you realize that?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Good and evil should be labels that depend on the observer.  
But in this twisted world, a true, absolute evil exists...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
And worse still, that being is what's keeping this world alive.  
Almost as if it wishes to claim the role of a god.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Outrageous, isn't it?!  
This world only needs one god. Myself... the Omniscient Kaiser alone.  
  
**Rei：**  
You think so much of yourself...!  
  
**Neneka：**  
...No.  
If it comes from none other than Mana Senri,  
that claim is surprisingly difficult to deny in its entirety. After all...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
After all, this world you know as Astrum  
was certainly created by us—the Seven Crowns.  
Isn't that right, Metamorph Monarch?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Yes... And you, Mana...  
Among all our number, you were the most remarkable.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Yes.  
I was raised to be a god, and to claim my divine right,  
I created an entire world...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
So if another being has claimed my rightful throne,  
then I must depose them no matter what it takes.  
Because a god must always be unique and absolute.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Once I do, I can craft a new world of my own design!  
None of you can obstruct the path  
 of a god with omniscient insight!  
  
**???：**  
Then I guess I'll have to cleave that path in two!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Spiresbane Blade!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...!  
  
**Yui：**  
Novem...?!  
  
**Jun：**  
Let us follow her!  
Young Octo!  
  
**Octo：**  
Yes, yes... Sheesh, what a pain...  
...Take this!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Captain Jun of Nightmare!  
And...  
  
**Rino：**  
Th-that grumbling guy... I think I've seen him somewhere before!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
He's the one we fought over Novem with, Rino!  
I don't know why, but I guess he's on our side now!  
  
**Kaori：**  
...!  
Makoto!  
Let's join in too!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yeah!  
I think this'll be our final chance!  
Let's go all out, Kaori! You guys too, Yui!  
  
**Yui：**  
Right!  
  
**Rei：**  
Of course!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord!  
Will you lend your strength to everyone?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  On it!  
`Tag 1`  
**All：**  
Haaahhhhh...!
