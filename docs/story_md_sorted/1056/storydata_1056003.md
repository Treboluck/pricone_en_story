## Subtitle: A Boss Lady Among Boss Ladies
  
**Narration：**  
{player}, on another stroll  
with no real goal in mind, bumps into Ruka.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Enough already.  
I'm not here to clean up your mess.  
  
**Man：**  
Come on, Boss Lady! Don't abandon me!  
I'm begging you here!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Quit calling me that! Sheesh. You're begging me?  
This is just pathetic, so do me a favor and scra—  
Oh, hey there. You been keeping well?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sure have been.  
**Choice: (2)**  Who's this?  
`Tag 1`  
**Ruka：**  
I see. That's good to hear.  
...Curious about him, are we?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Ruka：**  
Well, you see...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Ruka：**  
He's just someone I gave a good scolding a while back.  
Seems like he's gotten himself into a bit of trouble.  
  
**Man：**  
A bit? A *bit*?!  
I just told you that I'm gonna be  
six feet underground at this rate!  
  
**Man：**  
Even if I do go ahead and try to off their boss,  
I'm gonna be dead meat either way... Haha...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Basically, this guy thought he'd finally left the gang he was in,  
only to get an order to assassinate the boss of their rival group.  
  
**Man：**  
I never should have let the boss do me a favor.  
They made it real clear what'll happen if I try to decline...  
  
**Man：**  
But I don't wanna live that life anymore! I wanna be clean!  
Boss Lady helped me realize that!  
That's why she's the only one I can rely on!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Quit calling me that! Argh, fine.  
Tell me where your boss is.  
I'll discuss this with him directly.  
  
**Man：**  
Boss Lady! Thank you so much!  
I'll never forget this debt!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Let's not take it that far.  
I'd just rather see you alive than dead.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Accompany her.  
`Tag 4`  
**Ruka：**  
You sure about that?  
Well, it is a lot better than going alone.  
Thanks. I appreciate it.  
  
**Syndicate Boss：**  
Heh. He went and did it.  
Avoided turning up himself,  
and even got someone else wrapped up in his business.  
  
**Ruka：**  
You the boss around here, I take it?  
I'm Ruka. A fishmonger in the business district.  
  
**Syndicate Boss：**  
A fishmonger?!  
Hahahaha!  
Now *this* is priceless!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Let's cut to the chase.  
Let him off already. He's not your underling anymore.  
  
**Syndicate Boss：**  
No can do, I'm afraid.  
Unless you run his little errand for him.  
Then I'll think about it.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Excuse me? Why should I have to—  
  
**Syndicate Boss：**  
He asked you for help, didn't he?!  
Then it's your job to clean up his mess!  
That's how we do things around here!  
  
**Ruka：**  
That's how you do things, is it?  
$By taking advantage of others?  
  
**Syndicate Boss：**  
Never thought he'd turn to a regular ass fishmonger, though.  
Heh heh...  
Pathetic! You're nothing!  
The only thing you can slice up is fish, ain't it?  
  
**Ruka：**  
You'd be wise not to underestimate me.  
You know what? I *will* do it!  
  
**Syndicate Boss：**  
Give it your best shot, little miss fishmonger!  
Not that it'll get you anywhere!  
  
**Syndicate Boss：**  
Don't worry, though.  
I'll be there to collect the pieces when it's all over!  
Hahahahaha!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Let's hope you're as enthusiastic when I get the job done.  
I'll be back.  
  
**Ruka：**  
...*sigh*  
Why'd I go and do that?  
  
**Syndicate Member：**  
Hey, kiddo! Your mommy's back! Ain't that great?  
Now you can stop pissing your pants! Hyahaha!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Sorry. I shouldn't have let you wait around here.  
Let's get going.  
I'll fill you in on the way.  
  
**Ruka：**  
And that's the gist of it.  
I'm stuck having to do the job for him now.  
I kind of lost my cool after their boss ridiculed my job...  
  
**Ruka：**  
You could call it a personality quirk, I suppose.  
But this time I definitely took it a bit too far.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Here's hoping I can diffuse the situation between  
both parties, at the very least.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  They should really just go at it themselves.  
**Choice: (6)**  Just let them be.  
`Tag 5`  
**Ruka：**  
Yeah. If they're enemies, then it should be between them.  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Ruka：**  
That'd be the ideal solution, but alas.  
I can't believe how willing they are to get others involved.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Ruka：**  
If they both got rid of each other...  
Wait. That's it.  
There's no need  
for us to get our hands dirty with their business.  
  
**Ruka：**  
If we get both parties' bosses together,  
then they'll just hash it out on their own.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Which makes our goal nice and simple.  
First up, we need to locate the other boss.  
  
**Narration：**  
And so Ruka begins searching for the opposing faction's boss.  
Eventually she digs up info on a place he visits often, and she  
and {player} make their way there.  
  
**Ruka：**  
That looks like our target.  
I'll take care of this, so you watch my back!  
  
**Ruka：**  
You're coming with me!  
  
**Gang Boss：**  
And who the hell are you?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hah!  
  
**Gang Boss：**  
Gurgh!  
  
**Ruka：**  
That went nice and smoothly.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Guess who's back!  
  
**Syndicate Boss：**  
Well, well. So? Couldn't go through with it, could you?  
I know someone running with their tail between their legs when I see—  
  
**Ruka：**  
I brought the opposition's boss right to you.  
Now it's up to the two of you to settle this!  
  
**Gang Boss：**  
Urgh...  
  
**Syndicate Boss：**  
The hell?!  
I never asked for this!  
  
**Gang Boss：**  
Where am I...  
Wait!  
So you're behind this?! You god damn fool!  
Guess you want your whole group to go under!  
  
**Syndicate Boss：**  
This is a big misunderstanding! Th-that's right! I actually wanna form an alliance!  
That'll help both our groups grow!  
  
**Ruka：**  
WHAT?!  
  
**Gang Boss：**  
For real?!  
W-well, whaddya know! I've actually been thinking the same!  
We're just gonna wipe each other out if we keep this up!  
  
**Syndicate Boss：**  
Right?!  
Now hear me out. All this? She set it all up!  
She's the one that's been driving us to war!  
  
**Gang Boss：**  
Well, that explains things.  
So you're the culprit, huh?!  
Been trying to get in our way all this time, have ya?!  
  
**Gang Member：**  
Boss! We're here to make the save!  
  
**Gang Boss：**  
Good timing!  
We've got one enemy here!  
That woman!  
  
**Syndicate Member：**  
So we just gotta take her down?  
  
**Syndicate Boss：**  
Aye! Plus the little runt with her!  
Make sure to lock the door, just in case.  
  
**Ruka：**  
...Geez. No rest for the wicked, eh?  
Pitiful. Laughable, even.  
  
**Ruka：**  
You get out of here. I'll take them all on myself.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Let me help.  
`Tag 8`  
**Ruka：**  
...Got it.  
Always love it when you show that vigor!  
Let me borrow that power of yours again!  
Now then. I'm going to have to go all out now, aren't I?  
  
**Ruka：**  
You small fry won't last a second.  
I was hoping to settle this as quietly as possible, but...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Don't blame me for what happens to you now!  
If you've got a death wish, then come at me!  
  
**Gang Boss：**  
Wh-what the?! How'd she become so threatening?!  
  
**Syndicate Boss：**  
That killing intent is off the charts! Hey, woman!  
Just who the hell are you?! An assassin sent by him?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Like I said. I'm just a fishmonger.  
  
**Ruka：**  
A fishmonger that also happens to be  
Twilight Caravan's guildmaster too, I guess.  
  
**Syndicate Boss：**  
T-Twilight Caravan?!  
Hahaha... You're kidding, right?  
  
**Syndicate Member：**  
Boss, is that the guild I think it is?!  
  
**Gang Boss：**  
You're damn right.  
The've got the One-Eyed Devil. And not  
just her! The Collector, the Destroyer, even the Living Storm...  
They're the most dangerous guild in Landosol!  
  
**Syndicate Boss：**  
Yet their guildmaster's never shown their face in the underworld!  
All I'd heard is they were strong enough to control that insane crew!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Control? Please. As if they'd ever listen to anyone.  
I just had the position forced on me.  
I'm a fishmonger, first and foremost. Now and forever.  
  
**Syndicate Boss：**  
Dammit!  
I can't believe he sent a monster like this after us!  
  
**Gang Boss：**  
E-everyone bail!  
We don't stand a chance!  
  
**Syndicate Boss：**  
Hold up! We'll rule the underworld if we can take her down!  
Go get her, boys!  
  
**Baddies：**  
Yaaaaah!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Sheesh. Why do you petty villains always make it a point to  
come at me in droves? If I need to beat some sense into  
those thick skulls,  
then so be it!  
You best be ready!  
  
**Baddies：**  
Aaaaaaghhh! H-help!  
  
**Knight：**  
We received reports of a commotion at a nearby restaurant, but...  
Just what in the world happened here?!  
  
**Knight：**  
I-I can't even begin to fathom this situation...  
  
**Syndicate Boss：**  
Forgive me, Boss Lady! I was in the wrong all this time!  
  
**Ruka：**  
I told you to quit calling me that! Knock it off!  
  
**Gang Boss：**  
Don't be like that!  
We're your loyal subordinates, from now until the end of time!  
  
**Baddies：**  
Boss Lady! Boss Lady!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Argh! Why does it always end up like this?!  
  
**Knight：**  
Um... Can we inquire as to what's going on here?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Royal knights! Perfect! You guys can handle this lot!  
As for us, let's get going! Farewell!  
  
**Baddies：**  
Boss Lady! Hold up!  
  
**Ruka：**  
*huff, puff*  
Think we managed to get away... You okay?  
  
**Ruka：**  
They're not the first people to say they've turned over a new leaf.  
The thing is, though, this never really leads to good results.  
  
**Ruka：**  
All of my admirers have ended up pushing  
themselves way more than they need to, only to reach their  
limit at the end of it all.  
Don't you turn out the same way, okay?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  It's not my goal to take down baddies.  
**Choice: (10)**  Even if I wanted to do, I couldn't.  
`Tag 9`  
**Ruka：**  
Figures.  
You'd have joined the royal guard if that were the case, wouldn't you?  
  
Jump to tag 11  
`Tag 10`  
**Ruka：**  
Fair enough.  
Strength itself isn't what's important to you.  
  
`Tag 11`  
**Ruka：**  
Let me ask, then. What made you come with me?  
  
**Choice: (12)**  I just wanted to help you.  
`Tag 12`  
**Ruka：**  
So it wasn't about putting an end to warring factions,  
or even a sense of justice?  
You just did it for my sake?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Heh... Haha... Ahahaha!  
  
**Ruka：**  
I swear. You really are a great guy!  
I like you even more now!  
I'm counting on you from here on out, partner.  
  
**Narration：**  
With a light smack on the back and her firm words,  
Ruka's trust in {player} made itself more than apparent.
