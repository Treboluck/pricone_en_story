## Subtitle: Always Willing to Help Out
  
**Narration：**  
With no other plans for the day,  
Ruka leaves town for a relaxing walk.  
  
**Ruka：**  
*yawn*  
This sure is great napping weather.  
Guess I ought to take advantage of it.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Down we go. Zzz...  
  
**Ruka：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You okay?  
`Tag 1`  
**Ruka：**  
Hm...? And you are?  
Interrupting someone during a nap isn't very courteous, you know.  
Do you have business with me or something?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You looked like you'd collapsed.  
`Tag 2`  
**Ruka：**  
Hahaha! Did I?  
Don't worry. I'm a lot tougher than I look.  
  
**Ruka：**  
The monsters around here barely even serve as a warm-up.  
But hey. Thanks for being concerned. I appreciate it.  
  
**Ruka：**  
My name's Ruka. Pleased to meet you.  
I work at a fishmonger's shop in the business district.  
I've got today off though, so I figured I'd take a nap here.  
  
**Ruka：**  
More importantly, that's a nice fishing rod.  
I take it you're into fishing?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm just doing it for work.  
**Choice: (4)**  I don't really know.  
`Tag 3`  
**Ruka：**  
Huh. Now that's something you don't hear every day.  
Takes a pretty peculiar person to do that sort of work,  
let alone request someone to do it.

`Tag 4`  
**Ruka：**  
You're not even sure?  
You really are a strange one.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Ruka：**  
Mind if I ask where you're fishing? And what for?  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} explains that he was  
requested to catch a certain fish at a town by the ocean.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hahaha!  
Hate to break it to you, but that's  
a freshwater fish. You won't find it in the ocean.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Sheesh. Why'd you go and take on a job like that?  
Your client should've known full well that—  
Ahhh.  
Now I get it.  
  
**Ruka：**  
...Good grief.  
Hey. Do you mind if I help you out with that job?  
  
**Ruka：**  
I won't be getting any sleep now that I'm  
all worried over whether or not you'll be able to get it done.  
  
**Ruka：**  
It's fine, I don't mind.  
In fact, I know a certain someone that can help out.  
Let's get going.  
  
**Ruka：**  
All right, we're here. This store deals in high-quality freshwater fish.  
Hey, you around?  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Welcome!  
Oh. Hey, Ruka.  
You got some goods for me this early in the day?  
  
**Ruka：**  
No, I'm here with him today.  
Take a look over there.  
That's what they asked you to fish up, isn't it?  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Oh, these bad boys?  
You're in luck, my friend.  
These have been selling like wildfire lately.  
That's the last batch for today.  
  
**Ruka：**  
They're actually easily mistaken for saltwater fish.  
Well, this means your job's pretty much done now,  
so let's hand  
the money over and get back to Landosol—  
  
**Client?：**  
Excuse me!  
Hey, it's you!  
What're you doing here?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
And you are? Never seen you around before.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  That's my client.  
`Tag 6`  
**Ruka：**  
Really?  
That's pretty... fishy.  
Hey, you. You asked him to fish that up, right?  
So why're you here trying to buy it?  
  
**Client?：**  
I, uh, I've got my reasons!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hmm... Are you really his client? Because you've  
reminded me of something. Word has it there's  
been a recent trend of people getting conned...  
  
**Client?：**  
You calling me a con man?!  
Of all the nerve!  
I'm just here to buy some fish!  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Sorry. They just bought up the last of today's stock.  
  
**Client?：**  
What?!  
That ain't no good!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Figures.  
  
**Ruka：**  
You're not his real client, are you?  
You're just pretending to be. All so you can trick him.  
  
**Ruka：**  
The fish he just bought is what his actual client is after.  
  
**Client?：**  
Wh-where's your proof?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
I can tell. You've got buddies that set up shop in that town, right?  
And they'll be ready to approach him  
when he can't catch the fish he's aiming for.  
  
**Ruka：**  
They'll rip him off with a similar looking saltwater fish,  
then have him take the blame for buying  
the wrong one once he gets back to Landosol.  
  
**Ruka：**  
You'll cheat him out of his remuneration,  
then even have him pay a fee for not getting the job done.  
A dirty trick if there ever was one.  
  
**Ruka：**  
And just to top it off, you'll play the good guy  
and go sell off the fish you bought here to the actual client.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Right on the money, aren't I?  
That's exactly what I'd do if I wanted to con someone.  
  
**Con Man：**  
Ugh...  
Only one thing to do if the cover's blown!  
I'll send you two to the afterlife!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Steady there.  
  
**Con Man：**  
Urgh! You gotta be kidding me...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Come on.  
You need to understand how strong your  
opponent is before you leap at them like that.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Now that I think about it, the rumors mentioned that you lot are running  
a cabal.  
So listen up. I want you to take me to wherever your hideout  
is. I'm going to make sure you never pull anything like this again.  
  
**Con Man：**  
Heh! Not a chance in hell you'll be able to pull that off!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Big words from a small man  
Unfortunately, your petty little antics have severely ticked me off.  
I won't stop until you and your cronies are done for.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hey. You're coming with me, too.  
They tried to set you up, so it's only fair that  
you help give them their just deserts.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I'd rather avoid putting you in danger.  
**Choice: (8)**  Okay, but only to help keep you safe.  
`Tag 7`  
**Ruka：**  
Wow. You're actually worried about me?  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Ruka：**  
Haha.  
You sound like a knight in shining armor.  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Ruka：**  
I like it, though!  
You're a real man's man! Attaboy!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oops, sorry.  
I didn't mean to hug you out of nowhere like that.  
It just kind of happens when I'm happy.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Anyway, we should get going.  
Show us the way, scoundrel!  
  
**Ruka：**  
So this is the place, huh. You ready?  
We're charging right in!  
  
**Con Man：**  
H-hey.  
Are you serious about this?  
You better stop while you're ahead.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Serious as can be. You think I'd come all this way if I wasn't?  
*inhale*  
Coming through, boys!  
  
**Accomplice 1：**  
Who the hell are you?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Just a friendly swordsman here to give you what for!  
  
**Accomplice 2：**  
Holy! What's her deal?!  
Surround her, boys! That'll make it a cinch!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Color me disappointed. I expected more of you.  
Look at you—you're shaking in your boots.  
Well,  
at least now I don't need to hold back.  
Hope you're ready for this!  
  
**Accomplice 1：**  
Aaaaaaghhh!  
  
![105600101.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/105600101.webp)  
**Ruka：**  
Phew. That was quick.  
  
**Accomplice 1：**  
H-how's she this strong?!  
  
**Accomplice 2：**  
Who... who the hell are you?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Just your average part-timer.  
Nothing special, really.  
  
**Accomplice 2：**  
There's no way that's true.  
No way in hell!  
  
**Ruka：**  
I mean, it is.  
Oops. No time for small talk.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Listen up. If any of you, and I mean *any* of you,  
try to pull something like this again... heads will roll.  
Got it? Answer me! Loud and clear!  
  
**Accomplice 1：**  
Understood!  
We'll be good for the rest of our lives!  
  
`image display end`  
**Ruka：**  
Not only did we successfully deliver that fish to your real client,  
but we even got to collect the bounty on their heads!  
  
**Ruka：**  
And with that said...  
Time to celebrate! Cheers!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Ch-cheers...  
`Tag 10`  
**Ruka：**  
*gulp, gulp* Whew!  
Now that's the good stuff!  
Nothing like kicking back a cold one after a hard day's work!  
  
**Ruka：**  
I have to admit, though—you did well today.  
Thought you might refuse to come along with me,/33  
but you really stepped up.  
I respect that.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Attaboy. I'm really proud of you!  
Pay me a visit if you're ever in trouble, you hear?  
I'd be happy to help you out again.  
  
**Narration：**  
At the peak of exhaustion, {player} passed out.  
Ruka, assuming he had just nodded his head,  
made a hearty order for more drinks.
