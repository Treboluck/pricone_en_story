# Kyoka (Halloween) Episode 4
In a dream, Kyoka hurts her foot before she can hand out her Halloween treats. Initially she tries to carry on through the pain, but then {player} picks her up. She accepts the gesture, and happily asks him to taste-test her new batch of cupcakes.

**Narration：**  
After sunset, Kyoka and {player} walk hand in hand  
through the still-bustling streets of Landosol, but...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
{player}...?  
Ummm... Listen...  
No, forget it, it's nothing!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Do you need the bathroom again?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kyoka：**  
O-of course not!  
Why is that the first thing you think of?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Don't you have even the tiniest shred of delicacy?  
I can't believe you said that, you super suspicious creep!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Geez...  
Just when I thought I might thank you for all your help...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Huh?  
Did it get brighter all of a sudden?  
Is this... some kind of Halloween firework display?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
No, of course it isn't!  
I mean, fireworks don't go off this close to the ground!  
This light... it seems familiar somehow...

**Kyoka：**  
*pant*... *pant*...!  
I have to hurry!  
At this rate, I'm going to be late...!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Making those treats took longer than I expected...!  
But I worked so hard to get them right,  
so I hope the children like them...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Actually...  
 I'd bet anything {player}  
will want to have some treats too...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Will it make him happy if I give him one of mine?  
I'd kind of like to find out...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
What's the time?  
...Yes, I can still make it. Thank goodness...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Now I just... have to track him down somehow...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Kyoka! Over here!  
`Tag 2`  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh! There he is.  
Good evening, {player}.  
I'm glad finding you was so easy.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I must say, though... I'm surprised.  
I honestly expected you'd show up later than me.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
But you actually arrived right on time.  
That makes me... a little happy.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Hm...?  
What is it now? Why the staring...?  
Is there something on my face?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  That's a cute costume.  
`Tag 3`  
**Kyoka：**  
O-oh... This thing.  
I tried to say I didn't need one!  
I mean, it's such a childish idea, dressing up like this...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
But... my mom insisted I put it on, so I didn't have much choice!  
So you see, I don't really want your compliments...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
But... I suppose... I should say thank you.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
M-more to the point, let's head over to the parade now!  
We're here to hand out treats to the children today!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Come on, let's hurry!  
If we're too slow, the parade will start without us!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ungh—owww...!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahhh... My foot hurts...? What is this feeling...?  
Could it be my shoe chafing?  
Oh, right, I ran here in these new shoes...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Are you OK?  
`Tag 4`  
**Kyoka：**  
O-of course I'm perfectly all right!  
No problems at all!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
If I start crying with pain now,  
he'll definitely tease me and call me a kid...!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
This pain is nothing I can't handle!  
Now, let's head to the—  
 Unghh...!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Urghh... It really does hurt...!  
What now? I don't think I can walk...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Sorry, Kyoka, hang on a second...  
`Tag 5`  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh?  
Wh-what do you think you're doing?!

**Kyoka：**  
H-hold on, {player}!  
You can't just pick a girl up in your arms...  
You'll get yourself arrested!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
My foot doesn't hurt at all really!  
This embarrassing idea is much worse!  
So put me down!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Grrr...!  
Why are you just smiling without saying a word?!  
Geez! You're such a suspicious creep, you know that?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...But I suppose he must only be trying to help me, really...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
He always does help me out when I need it...  
He's a kind guy... and surprisingly reliable, too...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
So I suppose... I could let him do this... just for... today...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Umm... Listen, {player}...  
Can I say something?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I, um... I'm not thanking you or anything,  
but I made some cupcakes today.  
You know, to hand out...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
And, well...  
Before I do, I should get someone to taste them...  
Can I ask you to do that?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Of course.  
`Tag 6`  
![111100402.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/111100402.webp)  
**Kyoka：**  
Well then... Here.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
How... is it...?  
I worked pretty hard on them, with my mom's help...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
It tastes good?  
Are you sure...?  
Thank goodness!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Well, I made plenty of them, so have some more.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...It's still tasty?  
Then I suppose you can have another bite.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
You're a big grown-up, so your appetite must match.  
I guess you probably need another one!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Eheheh. There's still plenty left.  
Here, open wide for me.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh...?  
You can't eat another bite...?  
I knew it. They weren't really that good at all, were they?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Th-they're delicious!  
**Choice: (8)**  I... I can keep going...  
`Tag 7`  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh, really?!  
In that case, here—dig in! ♪  
Hee hee. Your cheeks are puffing up like a hamster's.  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Kyoka：**  
Hee hee, you're so greedy sometimes.  
If you insist, here's one more. As a special treat!  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Kyoka：**  
Since you seem to like them so much,  
I'm sure the children will be thrilled as well.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I'll hand them all out,  
so you just make sure not to drop me while I do, OK?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Eheheh.  
Happy Halloween! ♪

**Ameth：**  
And that's a wrap.  
Whew, Kyoka really is such a cutie!  
  
**Ameth：**  
She tries to do everything on her own,  
but doesn't that just make it sweeter when she does rely on you?  
What do you think?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, it's got to be a sign of how much Kyoka secretly trusts you,  
so just make sure not to let her down, OK?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, I wouldn't expect that from you of all people, anyway.  
  
**Ameth：**  
At any rate, that'll do for today.  
Well then, see you later!

**Kyoka：**  
M-mnnhhh...  
Was all that... a dream...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh? You just fell asleep as well, {player}?  
Both of us at the exact same time...  
Could this be the work of Halloween ghosts...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh...?  
O-of course I'm not scared of them!  
Do I look like a little kid who'd be afraid of ghosts?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Still... I can't quite remember,  
but somehow it feels like he even helped me out in my dream...  
Why is it that he always seems to be right there when I need him?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I suppose I should stop stalling  
and at least thank him properly for once...!  
Yes, I'm going to thank him right now!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
U-um... Listen, {player}...!  
Today, you, um... helped me out with all sorts of things...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
So please... take this as thanks.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I made this cupcake myself.  
All the children seemed to like them a lot, so it should taste OK.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...H-how is it?  
  
**Choice: (10)**  I want more.  
`Tag 10`  
**Kyoka：**  
Hee hee. Well, I'm glad you seem to like it.  
But no seconds, I'm afraid. You know it's only one treat each!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Beg all you like, I'm not bending the rules!  
You're supposed to be older than me, so behave like it!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...*sigh* How can I turn down a face as forlorn as that?  
Fine then. Just one more! ...Hee hee.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Thank you so much for everything today.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
And... Happy Halloween!  
  
**Narration：**  
As she watched {player} wolf down the cupcake,  
Kyoka breathed a sigh of relief that she'd finally managed to thank him.
