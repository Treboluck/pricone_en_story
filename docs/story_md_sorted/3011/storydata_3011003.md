# Twilight Caravan Episode 3
Twilight Caravan obtains a map to the Twilight City from a bounty target, and after a long fight over who gets to keep it, Ruka is forced to lecture everyone. It all ends up being for naught when the map is revealed to be fake.
  
## Subtitle: Whose Map Is It?
  
**Narration：**  
{player} and the Twilight Caravan girls  
have cornered another wanted criminal.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Now, there's nowhere left to run.  
Ready to throw in the towel?  
  
**Bounty：**  
Eeeergh! W-wait! Take this! You can have it!  
J-just please, let me go!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Ah, yes. Of course a villain blackened by darkness would  
resort to bribery.  
But I suppose I should at least check  
what's inside.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Hmm? What's this? A scrap of paper?  
No... This is a map!  
  
**Bounty：**  
Y-yeah, that's right. It shows the way to the Twilight City.  
You know the rumors, right? It's the real deal.  
No question about it!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
An actual map to the Twilight City?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
I never dreamed that we would find such a thing...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Heh... Fwahahahah! At last, the time has come!  
In the end, the world's fate converges upon my Evil Eye!  
Now the Twilight City is within my grasp!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I quite agree.  
Anna, that map is priceless.  
We can't risk losing it, so I'll hang on to it for you.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I think not! It was bestowed unto my hands!  
Which means...  
this map belongs to me!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Do you really think that logic will hold?  
That map belongs to everyone here.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
You say that, Mitsuki, but you weren't, I dunno...  
planning on running off to \"decipher\" it  
and never  
coming back, were you?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Oh my! Do I look like the kind of person who'd do  
something so underhanded?  
  
  
**Eriko：**  
Without the slightest doubt.  
In fact, it would be completely out of character  
for you *not* to try.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Best to leave everything to Magical Girl Nanaka, I think!  
Hey, Annie-girl, how 'bout a trade? I'll give you that tome  
you were saying you really wanted! Sound good?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I no longer need it!  
Once I reach the Twilight City and claim  
the memories of my past lives, I'll have no need for tomes.  
I'll be the most powerful being in the universe!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Shoot, I've lost her. Gotta think up another excuse.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee.  
Anna, darling. Do you want to make me angry?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Urk! G-glare at me all you want, I'm not afraid of you.  
To finally reach the Twilight City, I can't back down now!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
The map is mine alone! I'll never hand it over!  
Farewell!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Stop right there! That map is mine, you hear?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hey, I heard that! You said \"mine\"!  
  
I knew you were gonna try to keep it for yourself.  
Well, that's not happening on my watch!  
  
**Eriko：**  
I won't restrain myself, either.  
I'll take it back by force if necessary.  
Teehee.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Good grief...  
This is the worst possible time to start infighting.  
  
**Bounty：**  
While they're arguing... Exit, stage r—  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hold it. Where do you think you're going?  
You're not getting away, either.  
  
**Bounty：**  
Oh, come on! I gave you the map!  
You promised to let me go!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Not much of a negotiator, are you?  
You gave up the map before we actually agreed to anything.  
Better luck next time.  
  
**Ruka：**  
{player}, I'm afraid after we turn this rogue in,  
I could do with your help to stop Mitsuki and the others.  
  
**Ruka：**  
If they start getting serious, they'll end up wiping  
at least one town off the map, if not more.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's stop them, quick!  
**Choice: (2)**  The map could get ruined...  
`Tag 1`  
**Ruka：**  
I knew you'd have my back.  
Well then, let's move!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Ruka：**  
You're quite right. If that map's the real deal, there's every  
danger it'll be blown to pieces like everything else!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Ruka：**  
Honestly...  
Just how far has their rampage taken them?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh dear... What a path of destruction.  
The maps of this  
area are going to need some redrawing.  
Can they not even  
restrain themselves against their own guildmates?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Well, at least all their lively antics  
are making it easy to see where they've gone.  
C'mon, let's keep moving.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Stop struggling and hand over the map.  
Otherwise I'm coming to destroy you with everything I've got!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Mwahahahah!  
Take your best shot, if you think you can!  
Evil Eye, Open: The Extreme!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Not too shabby, Annie-girl!  
Guess it's time the world's strongest magical girl  
graced the battlefield with some serious beamspam, too!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee.  
That sounds dangerous, Nanaka.  
But please, have no fear.  
I'm going to obliterate all three of you.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Uh-oh, they're all deadly serious now.  
Everyone's planning to make her next attack the last.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Stop them.  
**Choice: (5)**  Watch and wait.  
`Tag 4`  
**Ruka：**  
Don't throw your life away.  
Step aside and leave this to me.  
I'll stop them myself!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Ruka：**  
Smart move. With the situation this bad,  
I'd feel guilty asking you to help any more.  
I'll handle this myself.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Ruka：**  
All of you! Knock it off already!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
You can't stop me now!  
Rising Zapper: VOID!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I'm not afraid to throw down, either!  
I'll smite my enemies with a cybernetic flash!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I'll cleave you all in two!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Disintegrate and die.  
  
**Ruka：**  
I thought I told you  
to *KNOCK IT OFF!*  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Wha—?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Holy moly.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Did she just erase all our attacks at once?  
  
**Eriko：**  
A feat only Ruka could perform...  
Teehee.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I-I'm not done...  
I can still continue to fight!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Annie-girl, you oughtta quit while you're ahead.  
You put all your strength into that last spell, and it's taking  
all you've got  
just to stay on your feet, amirite?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
As for me, I'm totally at my limit!  
I'm clean out of MP and stamina.  
Pretty sure I can't move a single step...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
That was the last of my magic, too.  
It's been ages since I've played—ah, fought with all  
my strength, so I'm too tired to move as well.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee...  
I could use a good, long rest myself...  
  
**Ruka：**  
All of you worn out already? Tut tut.  
Well then, I'll be taking custody of that map.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
This is tyranny!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Don't \"tyranny\" me! What were you thinking, trying to keep  
it to yourselves? We all teamed up to find the Twilight City  
together, didn't we? A lead like this should be evenly shared!  
  
**???：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Umm, guys? Did anyone else  
just hear a slightly ominous noise?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Nanaka! I'm teaching you an important lesson.  
This is hardly the time to try to change the subject.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
No, really, though! Listen! You hear that?  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I-I knew it! Miss Ruka, ma'am, there's a monster!  
And I think it's headed right in our direction!  
  
**Ruka：**  
So what if there is? Did I not just explain that I'm still talking?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Well, yes... But we've all used up every ounce of our  
energy fighting,  
so I'm a little worried that the monster  
might gobble us all up...  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Ugh, what a noisy beast.  
Enough interruptions already!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Wait, what?! You took out that huge monster from way  
over here?  
And in one strike, too!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
D-did you just...  
project that sword slash?!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
That species is incredibly ferocious, and highly durable!  
  
**Eriko：**  
And she didn't even bat an eye...  
  
**Ruka：**  
I may not have any magical ability whatsoever,  
but I have my  
own skills.  
If I focus my \"Ki\" a little, I can strike from far away.  
Now then, that's our intruder dealt with. Shall we continue?  
  
**Everyone：**  
Yes, ma'am...  
  
**Ruka：**  
So in conclusion, we have to respect and value one another.  
  
**Ruka：**  
And really, exhausting yourselves to the point  
where you can't handle a monster? That's just unacceptable.  
I expect better from you all in future.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I think they've gotten the point. Let's call it a night.  
**Choice: (8)**  It's getting kinda late, Boss Lady.  
`Tag 7`  
**Ruka：**  
...Hmm?  
Oh, wow, when did the sun go down?  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Ruka：**  
D-don't call me Boss Lady!  
Huh? Hey, when did it get so dark?  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Ruka：**  
Ah well... Out of respect for {player},  
I'll let you all off the hook.  
Now pick yourselves up, and let's head home.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Whew... Who knew the calm, collected Ruka  
could be so terrifying when she gets mad?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Indeed. Let's be careful not to anger her from now on.  
I don't ever want to have to sit through a lecture  
like that again!  
  
**Eriko：**  
I have no regrets about doing battle with all of you,  
but I will take more care in the future...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Umm... Err... I'm really sorry!  
Th-this was all my fault for trying to keep the map to myself!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Anna, I have to say I'm shocked.  
I don't remember the last time you offered such a sincere apology!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Well, just as long as you learned your lesson.  
Remember, we're all companions with the same goal.  
I just, you know... I want us all to get along.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
R-right! Boss Lady! I'll follow you for the rest of my life!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hey! Please don't call me that.  
For some reason  
it makes my skin crawl a little...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Wowie! Boss Lady! It's perfect!  
I'm so calling you that too.  
Lead on, Boss Lady Ruka!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I like it, too. I suppose I'll call you Boss Lady as well!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Then I suppose I should do the same.  
\"Boss Lady\"...  
The title suits you perfectly, Ruka! Teehee.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Cut it out!  
I know your game... You're all teasing me, aren't you?  
{player}, say something, would you?  
  
**Choice: (10)**  After you, Boss Lady!  
`Tag 10`  
**Ruka：**  
Not you, too!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Good lord, the second I let you off the hook...  
You guys sure are a handful.  
  
**Narration：**  
Incidentally, they had the map appraised a few days later,  
and everyone was devastated when it turned out to be a  
worthless forgery.
