**Karyl：**  
Aaaaghh! It's raining creepy bugs!  
Why, you... You just wait... I'll murder you...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhh dear.  
 Looks like the tanuki's illusions got her again.  
She acts so standoffish,  
 but maybe she's the most innocent of us all?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh... Miss Karyl... You poor thing...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well then, this time I think it's my turn to wake her up!  
One... two...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
No need for that! I'm good!  
 Seriously!  
Don't even touch me!  
 Thanks but no thanks!  
  
**Karyl：**  
The sheer dread snapped me right out of it...  
Any later, and I'd have been a goner...!
