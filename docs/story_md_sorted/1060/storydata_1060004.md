**Karyl：**  
*slurp*  
Ahh, now this is the good stuff. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Nothing better than some  
medicinal porridge for a tired, stressed body. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Go ahead and get whatever you fancy, too.  
Best thing about the food here is it's both  
delicious and not too heavy.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Not that I need to tell you,  
considering we've came here with the others before.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah.  
I've been a fan ever since,  
so I come along often.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Especially for breakfast, too.  
It's nice and close to my workplace... In other words, the palace.  
  
**Karyl：**  
And unlike all the other blessed kids out there,  
I don't have any parents that'll make me meals to speak about.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Goes without saying that I'll  
kick the bucket if I don't provide for myself.  
  
**Karyl：**  
So...  
I'll just be honest and say that being able to  
go around eating with you lot has been a big help.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Now I know plenty of places  
that're both cheap and delicious.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Honestly, I'd love it if we did that all day—not just for dinner.  
There's something nice about sitting together and eating with people.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But, well, you guys have your lives to live.  
I'd feel a bit guilty making you put everything aside for me.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Not like I have the right to  
make proper friends and stuff in the first place.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahaha.  
Sorry about that.  
No sense in complaining to you, is there?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Not to sound like a Koro knockoff here,  
but to eat really is to live.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I never really realized just how  
fulfilling it can be to eat such good food all the time.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But I've just been feeling super good lately.  
And, well... That's all down to you guys.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I just wish things  
could keep going like this forever.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Whoa!  
{player}?!  
How come you're all shiny?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Seriously, what's the deal here?!  
Her Majesty never mentioned anything about this.  
  

---  
  
**???：**  
God, you *have* to be kidding me!  
This sucks!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
How the hell did I drop my wallet?!  
Did someone steal it?!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
What am I gonna do?  
My station's super far from here, too...  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Walking sure isn't an option.  
It'd take a bajillion years to get back home.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Mom gets super pissed  
at me if I'm ever home late after cram school, too.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Always whining at me if I don't do  
everything exactly as she tells me to.  
Then she starts accusing me of stuff.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
That's cost me a bunch of part-time jobs.  
Right when I was starting to get along with people, too...  
  
**Kiruya：**  
God, she pisses me off.  
Wish she'd just drop dead already!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Phew. Probably shouldn't flip my lid here.  
I gotta scrounge together some money for a ticket.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Might be worth heading to work  
and asking them to pay me a bit in advance.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Actually, no. I'd still need to head home for that. Can't believe she  
forced me to choose places nearby, then went and shoved me in a  
cram school ages away because of some feng shui crap.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
The hell does feng shui have to do with anything?  
God, why is she so insanely stupid?!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
*sigh* Life sucks...  
And it's all her fault.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Wish I could just run away.  
Ditch that joint and go live  
somewhere nice and far away.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Gotta deal with it, though.  
I'll be in a real tough spot in terms of work  
if I don't make it through college.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
I'm the only one that can make me happy.  
I'll live through this crap, get a good job,  
then find me a hunk to marry.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
And once I have, I'll look her dead in the eye  
and tell her that not a single bit of that was thanks to her.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
That'll be my sweet, sweet revenge.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
*sigh* Wish my life didn't suck enough that I had to do that.  
How come everything bad in the world always happens to me?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Hm?  
Hey,  
you! You better have a good reason for staring!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
I ain't here for your entertainment!  
Scram, else I'll kill you twice!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You seem upset.  
**Choice: (2)**  Please spare me.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kiruya：**  
And? What if I am?  
It ain't got anything to do with you. Not one bit.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Look. I don't wanna hear your crappy chat-up lines or whatever.  
Go waste some else's time, douchebag!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kiruya：**  
What?  
You dumb in the brain or something?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Seriously.  
Are you trying to piss me off? 'Cause it sure is working.  
Get the hell outta here before I beat you to death!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kiruya：**  
Hm? Run that by me again, will you?  
And speak up, while you're at it!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Excuse me?  
You want to lend me  
the money  
 to buy a train ticket?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
You heard me shouting and got worried?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Whatever!  
No one asked for your help, loser!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
You trying to make yourself feel all special  
by pretending to care about a poor little middle schooler?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Too bad!  
I don't give a crap! I only trust myself!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
All you posers just wanna  
feel superior to me! I know it!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Get the hell outta here with that crap!  
Actually, just go drop dead! All of you!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Wha—?!  
H-hey,  
did you just throw something at me?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Oh, now you're in for it.  
I'll fight a punk like you any time of the day!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Don't think I'm some little girl, either.  
I've been through the hard life.  
I can rough you up in more ways than you can count!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Don't you dare run!  
Get back here so I can beat the crap out of you!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Hmph...  
The hell was his problem?  
Now I'm even more pissed off.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Pretty sure he attends one of the schools  
around here, though, based on his uniform.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
I've got his face memorized,  
so he can expect a fist to the face  
the next time I come across him.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Hmm...?  
What *did* he throw at me, actually?  
Isn't this... his wallet?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Oh, there's even a note inside.  
I *do* remember him writing  
something down at the speed of light.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Uhh.  
\"Use this to buy a ticket?\"  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Huh?  
Is he for real?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Now it looks like  
I shook him down for cash!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
I *can* get home easy with this much, at least.  
So he did do me a solid.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Oh. His student ID's in here, too.  
Huh. Guess his name's {player}.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
It's even got his address listed.  
Guess I can just use enough to get myself home,  
then go give the rest back afterwards.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Absolutely no way I'm staying in someone's debt.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Hmph.  
Thanks, I guess.

**Ameth：**  
Holy cow.  
I didn't realize Karyl was that wild.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I wasn't even there, and  
she still scared the life out of me!  
  
**Ameth：**  
What sort of environment do you have to grow up in  
to be that foulmouthed while you're still in middle school?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm honestly a bit curious.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ah, sorry.  
I should probably explain what's going on here, shouldn't I?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Think of what you just saw as something of a dream.  
Chances are you'll forget about it as soon as you wake up,  
so no need to brood over it that much.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Seems like you had  
barely any connection with Karyl on the \"other side.\"  
  
**Ameth：**  
There were hardly any shared memories  
between the two of you to scrape together.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Let me explain  
a little bit more.  
  
**Ameth：**  
A few days after that encounter,  
you and Karyl meet again when she comes  
over to return both your wallet and the money for the train ticket.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And that's where the big twist kicks in.  
Turns out both of you had already met in Astrum.  
What a shocker!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Basically, the same sort of  
development that's oddly common for you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The only difference is that things never progressed from there.  
There was never any opportunity for  
the two of you to grow any closer.  
  
**Ameth：**  
From what I gather,  
there wasn't enough overlap in your daily activites.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What's more, Karyl wasn't able to  
log on to Astrum that much thanks to her situation back home.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That makes the fact  
that the two of you keep meeting so  
often over here even more of a mystery.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I get the feeling  
someone might be behind that...  
  
**Ameth：**  
No point in thinking about it too hard right now, I guess.  
Could always just be a coincidence.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway.  
That's enough from me today, so I'll let you be on your way.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Bye-bye.  
Catch you later! ♪  
  

---  
  
**Karyl：**  
{player}?  
You okay...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Did you catch a cold or something?  
I might be able to heal you up, depending on the symptoms.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm pretty good at magic, you know.  
Did all sorts of studying and training, so I've learned lots. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm?  
What's with that look?  
Is there something on my face?  
  
**Karyl：**  
You really are a  
weirdo, you know that?  
  
**Karyl：**  
More importantly,  
you should finish your food before it gets cold.  
  
**Karyl：**  
And unlike a certain someone,  
I actually have work in the afternoon as well.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'll go get us the bill if  
we're all done ordering here.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm?  
You forgot your wallet?  
Nice one, dumbo.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Fine, fine.  
We'll be having dinner  
together with the other two as well.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'll cover us here,  
so be sure to repay the favor then.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, come on.  
You don't need to look *that* shocked.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Do I really seem like the super stingy type?  
  
**Karyl：**  
U-uhh...  
Why are you bowing your head  
to me like your life depends on it?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Come on. I'm not even angry!  
Or maybe I just look that intimidating?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahaha.  
You really are weirder than usual today. ♪
