**Karyl：**  
Meow... ♪  
Meow, meow! ♪  
Meow. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Meow?!  
D-don't go sneaking up on me like that!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, it's just you.  
What're you doing here?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Me?  
I, uh...  
L-let's just say it's none of your business!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ah, crap!  
So much for getting a place nearby and  
keeping an eye on him without being noticed!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I know what my mission is. I do, really!  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's just... I dunno how to use a hotel in the first place. And I  
don't have a registered address or any proof of identity.  
Didn't  
help that I had to run away 'cause the owner got suspicious, too.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I can't let this mission fail because of something dumb like that.  
But I can't just waltz back to the palace after saying  
I'd stay elsewhere... Which left me in a major bind.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Then these cats turned up all of a sudden,  
so I got distracted petting and giving them food.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'd be insane to tell {player}  
all of that, though.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm?  
What's with that look on your face?  
Y-you better not be ready to hit me with a complaint.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You okay? You look a bit sad.  
**Choice: (2)**  You might want to be quiet at this time of night.  
`Tag 1`  
**Karyl：**  
Excuse me?  
W-who gave you the right to be worried about me,  
you dweeb!  
Don't push your luck!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Honestly, now...  
You're a weirdo, you know that?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Karyl：**  
Oh. Fair enough.  
It *is* late, so I should pipe down.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You of all people hitting me with some common sense  
kinda ticks me off, though.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm?  
What's with that weird voice I was making?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ohh...  
So you came along after hearing all the meowing?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ever heard about curiosity killing the cat?  
Landosol hasn't exactly been the safest place these days.  
It'd do you a lot of good not to wander around at night.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Same goes for me, too?  
That's true. I'm still recovering, even.  
I'd be in a real pickle if any ruffians came for me.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Whatever. Guess I'll just head home.  
I can just tell Her Majesty that I bailed because  
{player} almost caught me. That should work.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Except, well, it'd be a mega lie.  
'Cause here I am talking away to him like it's nothing.  
Ah, man. I wish things would go my way for once.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait. Did I say that out loud?  
Pretend you didn't hear anything!  
Come on,  
please! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Whoa there.  
You might be a cute little cat,  
but let's not climb up on me.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Aw, come on. You'll get me covered in fur.  
Be a good kitten for me, okay? Meow, meow. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm?  
What's with you? Never seen a cat before or something?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, right. You've got that whole amnesia deal going on.  
This cute little fella is called a cat. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wanna try holding it?  
Just be nice and gentle. And don't drop it.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahaha.  
Sure isn't fond of you, is it?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Pass it back before it ends up scratching you.  
Cats've got bacteria all over their claws and mouths,  
so you could end up with a bad case of lockjaw.  
  
**Karyl：**  
There we go.  
So warm and snuggly. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm...?  
Wanna do me a favor and *not* stare at me like that, {player}?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?  
Cats sure do seem to like me?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahaha...  
Monsters and animals tend to warm up to me quickly, funnily enough.  
There's... reasons for that.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Let's just say I was born a certain way.  
And well, I doubt that cats actually like me or anything.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I don't think *anyone* will ever like me for who I am.  
It's all over once they get to know the real me.  
  
**Karyl：**  
What's that?  
*You* like me for who I am?  
  
**Karyl：**  
What gives?! Don't go around saying you  
like people before you even get to know them.  
Honestly. Sometimes I really can't wrap my head around you.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Lines like that should be saved for people  
who actually deserve that sort of affection.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Brr...  
Sure does get cold around this time of night.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I should head home before I end up catching a cold.  
You too, kid. Go get yourself wrapped up nice and warm.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah. Bye-bye. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahaha.  
Look at me.  
I ended up chatting away to him like it was nothing. ♪
