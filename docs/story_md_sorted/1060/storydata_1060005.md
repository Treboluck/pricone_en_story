# Karyl Episode 5
Karyl makes her way to the forest to improve on her monster manipulation, only to come across {player} on the hunt for food. Though she once warned against them getting too close, she shows no hesitation in helping him out now, albeit with her usual delightful complaints.
  
## Subtitle: Her Secret
  
**Karyl：**  
Arghhh! This is so annoying!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Things aren't going well at all...  
Do I just suck at this?  
  
**Karyl：**  
The Seven Crowns hold a special influence over this world,  
and those granted a fragment of their power  
are known as Princess Knights.  
And I'm one of them.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Her Majesty is as prideful as they come.  
She trusts no one, yet made something of an exception for me.  
She even split a fragment of her power  
just for my sake.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But here I am, barely even able to make proper use of it.  
Man, I'm so pathetic.  
I *really* don't want to disappoint her...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Actually, wasn't it only guys that were able to become Princess Knights?  
And I'm not one of those, that's for sure.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Maybe there's something up with the circuit or whatever  
that system was called.  
 Can't be my fault.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I can't exactly complain to her about that, though.  
I know for a fact she'll just give me the boot  
and go find someone better to replace me.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That's the sort of person she is!  
Which means I just have to practice like my life depends on it!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Right then.  
First and foremost, let's go right back to basics.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah. I can do it if I try.  
I mean, look how quickly I picked magic up with no experience.  
I can do it. I know I can!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Her Majesty bestowed me the ability to control monsters at will.  
I just need to consider them an extension of myself.  
Then I can use them in any way I want!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Weirdly enough, I got good at controlling those Shadow things.  
So next up is plain old monsters!  
I'll turn them  
into my perfect,  
battle-ready slaves!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Heh!  
Now to find me a monster.  
I'll have it obeying my whims in a flash! ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Greet her normally.  
**Choice: (2)**  Give her a fright.  
`Tag 1`  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?  
Oh, it's just you.  
What're you doing around these parts?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Karyl：**  
Aaaaaaghhh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
C-came to find me first, did you?!  
That works for me...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're mine, monster!  
Obey me! Revere me!  
Become my loyal slave!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh...?  
Wait a minute.  
You're no monster. You're just {player}!  
  
**Karyl：**  
D-don't scare me like that!  
Seriously, what's your problem?!  
Do you enjoy trying to give me a heart attack or something?!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Karyl：**  
Err, more importantly...  
You wouldn't happen to have overheard what I was saying, would you?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh crap, oh crap!  
I was shouting pretty loud to give myself a boost, too!  
Don't tell me I just leaked confidential info...  
  
**Karyl：**  
To *him* of all people, too!  
Wh-what am I gonna do?  
Should I kill him? Kill him dead?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm?  
You couldn't hear me over the wind  
rustling all the leaves and stuff about?  
  
**Karyl：**  
For real?  
For *real* real?  
Phew... ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmph! Guess you get to live another day!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Really, though. What're you doing here?  
A forest full of monsters isn't exactly the best place for a stroll.  
Especially when you're a weak-ass scrub.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You gotta be more careful.  
Last thing we want is you getting killed off  
or going missing forever  
after getting lost.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm? You think I'm worried about you?  
Pfft. As if.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Look, it's not like that. I don't really care what happens to you.  
It's just... Argh, this is a pain to explain!  
The point is I'm not worried about you!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You wanna know what I'm up to?  
None of your business, that's what!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? You're more than willing to help if you can?  
H-how come you're being so nice?  
Are you into me or something...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ehehe... ♪  
Err, no! There's no way you can help out!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Honestly, though. Enough with the buddy-buddy business!  
That's what friends do, and we sure as heck aren't that!  
  
**Karyl：**  
There's no happiness beyond whatever could  
bloom between us. I mean it. I really do...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Never mind. Just talking to myself.  
  
**Karyl：**  
For the millionth time, though. What're you doing here?  
I had it pinned as a good training spot  
'cause barely anyone ever comes by.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah.  
You'll find me here more often than not these days.  
What about it?  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's pretty much my turf,  
so don't go trespassing without permission.  
Got it?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Good to hear.  
...Oh? Here to procure stuff for tonight's dinner, are we?  
Can't you just buy it at the store? Unless you're poor.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well then. I'll help you out.  
Believe it or not, that's one of my specialties.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I... didn't lead the best life before Her Majesty found me,  
to say the least. I was pretty much like a stray cat.  
  
**Karyl：**  
The sooner we find stuff, the sooner you'll go home, right?  
Yup, that's it! No need to hold back.  
Just do as I say, and we'll get this over with quick!  
  
**Karyl：**  
And lemme be clear. This is just to make you leave faster.  
Not 'cause I wanna help out or anything, okay?  
Don't go getting any weird ideas!
