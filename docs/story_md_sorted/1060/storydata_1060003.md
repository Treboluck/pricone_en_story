**Karyl：**  
*sigh*  
Things just aren't going my way at all.  
  
**Karyl：**  
My main objective for now is to keep an eye on Tia—  
Err, Pecorine and {player}. And if given the order,  
I'm to send monsters after them to finish them off once and for all.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That hasn't happened yet, so I'm just keeping an eye on them.  
But that's got me worried about my own tailing abilities.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Didn't expect to get busted that easily...  
And now I'm eating dinner with them pretty much every day.  
  
**Karyl：**  
No, that's fine. It's all part of the plan.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Let's be positive here.  
It's a lot easier to get info out of them now that they trust me.  
Yeah. I haven't messed up at all.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But, well...  
Getting Her Majesty to see things that way might not be so easy.  
Which means I'm best off not reporting back yet.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's honestly hard to tell where the line is with her.  
Sometimes she'll just flip out for no reason, too.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Guess I kind of do the same too, though.  
Almost feels like we're actually related.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I gotta tread carefully.  
Last thing I want is to trip one of her switches  
and get tossed aside as a result.  
  
**Karyl：**  
She needs to understand that I'm doing exactly as I've been told.  
Which means getting close to them  
and extracting all the information she wants.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Then the ends will justify the means!  
The process doesn't matter when the results are good.  
Yup! ♪  
  
**Royal Guard：**  
He went that way!  
Catch him!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Whoa!  
Wh-what's the deal?  
Did something happen?  
  
**Royal Guard：**  
Oh! Good day, Lady Karyl.  
Someone suspicious has been lurking around the palace!  
He wouldn't happen to have run this way, would he?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh.  
Sorry. I just left the palace myself, so I haven't seen anyone.  
They might be  
long gone already.  
  
**Royal Guard：**  
I see. Thank you.  
Please raise your voice if you notice him or anything else suspicious.  
We'll come to your aid in a flash!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Right, thanks. Will do.  
Keep up the good work...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
...  
  
**Karyl：**  
They're gone, {player}.  
Get your butt out here right now!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ugh... I just knew it was you.  
The heck are you doing here? You'd be dead meat by now  
if it weren't for me. Especially when you're hiding there.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I was just taking a stroll.  
**Choice: (2)**  How about you, friendo?  
`Tag 1`  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm... You might wanna consider *not* taking a stroll  
in the middle of the most important building in the country.  
Security here's as tight as can be.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Anyone caught loitering is gonna have a run in with Nightmare.  
That's the guild in charge of security around here,  
a.k.a. the guys that were just chasing you.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Karyl：**  
\"Friendo?\"  
Someone sure thinks we're on casual terms...  
Not that I mind.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Karyl：**  
Oh well.  
Now's not the time for chitchat.  
Let's get you of here first.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Come on, follow me.  
I know a safe route out of here,  
so get your butt in gear.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Just pretend you're my attendant if it comes to it.  
Commoners normally aren't allowed in the palace,  
so that's the only way we could weather the storm.  
  
**Karyl：**  
This path'll take you right back to the city itself.  
Don't worry—I'll stick around until then.  
 Man, though.  
Why do you need to be such a handful?  
  
**Karyl：**  
It'd be a real pain in the rear for me if you  
got yourself caught by Nightmare.  
Though I have the authority to bail you out if it ever came to that.  
  
**Karyl：**  
The thing about Nightmare is that while they serve the  
royal family directly, their allegiance is sort of waning.  
It's kind of becoming a guild for random thugs and stuff.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're in for a bad time if they catch you,  
so just be careful. Okay?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't take that as me being worried about you, though.  
I just can't be bothered with any hassle around here.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah.  
This is where I work.  
I even have noble status, technically.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That's why I'm allowed inside the palace in the first place.  
Bow to my feet,  
you lowly commoner.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Is what I'd say, but the only reason I was given it in  
the first place was to make doing Her Majesty's bidding easier.  
Basically, I'm just a poser.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oops. I wasn't to let that slip...  
Argh! Why am I the one leaking all the info?  
Sure would be nice if things went well for once...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm...?  
Look. Don't just go patting my head without my permission.  
  
**Karyl：**  
What's that? You just want me to cheer up?  
I don't need any sympathy. Especially from you.  
Also, quit acting like we're best buds.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Things are just going to get  
a lot more painful if we get any closer.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Never mind. Just talking to myself.  
  
**Karyl：**  
More importantly... Are you free after this?  
I pretty much saved your life, so the least you can do  
is treat me to dinner. A lot of dinner.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Today sucked bad, so I wanna eat something real good.  
Even the worst, sucky days can end well  
if it's on a delicious note. ♪
