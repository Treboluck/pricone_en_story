## Subtitle: Cavern of Corruption
  
**Narration：**  
Around the same time as Ruka's encounter in the village,  
Anna and {player} have finally arrived  
at their cavernous destination.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Whew... We got to fill our bellies as soon as we got here!  
This really is the perfect workplace!  
Unbridled motivation is coursing through me!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
And all we have to do is the very simple task  
of digging out this cavern, it seems!  
 ...Oh dear. I'm sorry, sir!  
  
**Wanted Criminal：**  
Hah. Watch where you're walkin'.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
What a muscular fellow.  
...Hm?  
That face... It seems familiar somehow...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Sigurd, do you recognize that man at all?  
He's triggering something in the depths of my Akashic records...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  He's a wanted criminal.  
**Choice: (2)**  He might be my dad?  
`Tag 1`  
**Stechpalm：**  
A criminal?  
...  
Of course—the wanted posters! No wonder I recognized him!  
You have a good memory, Sigurd! Great work!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Wh-whaaaaat?!  
Wait, aren't you lacking all of your memories, Sigurd?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
No, that can't be it at all! Where have I seen him...?  
That's right! The wanted posters!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Hold it, you! There's a bounty on your head, is there not?!  
  
**Wanted Criminal：**  
Right, and you're... the Living Storm, ain'tcha?  
So what, you lookin' for a fight?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I'm glad you understand.  
Now face the flames of my dark magicks  
and become an unholy sacrifice!  
  
**Foreman：**  
You two, there! What's the big idea?  
Fighting is against regulations!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
But this man is a wanted criminal!  
Besides which, violating taboos is in my—  
  
**Foreman：**  
Break the rules and you don't get paid!  
How's that sound, eh?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Th-that would be bad! After coming all this way,  
I can't leave without even receiving payment...!  
But can I really let a villain go without administering justice?  
  
**Wanted Criminal：**  
Guess you get to live this time. Buh-bye!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Ahh! Wait...!  
Curses... How could I let a bounty slip through my fingers?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Oh well... Let's focus on the job for now.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
*pant*... *pant*... The work is simple,  
but digging for hours on end is pretty strenuous...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Sigurd, how are you doing?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I can't feel my arms...  
`Tag 4`  
**Stechpalm：**  
You've been transporting all the dirt I dug up this whole time...  
Of course you're worn out.  
 Thank you for working so hard, Sigurd.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Actually, we were never told about break times, were we?  
Let us take this opportunity to catch our breath!  
  
**???：**  
*pant*... *pant*... *pant*...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
What is it now, Sigurd? All that harsh panting...  
Are you struggling that much?  
Wait, that's not Sigurd. Then who...?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Ah, it's this man!  
Hey, what's wrong?! Pull yourself together!  
  
**Man：**  
Sorry, I got a little dizzy after all this nonstop work.  
Thank you.  
 I don't think I've seen you two around...?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Oh, we just started today! It's a pleasure to meet you.  
  
**Man：**  
You just started...?!  
C-could you come over here for a second?  
  
**Man：**  
It may not be too late for you. Run for it while you still can.  
This place—  
  
**Foreman：**  
Hey! What are you lot doing?!  
  
**Man：**  
I-I'm very sorry! I just fell over, that's all.  
I'll get right back to work!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Ah... Hey! Are you really all right?!  
...  
He just left.  
  
**Foreman：**  
And you two! Back to the job!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Understood.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Sigurd... Something's not right with this workplace.  
It can't just be my imagination.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Wanted criminals roaming free, not to mention that man's words...  
Let's try to find an opportunity to investigate.
