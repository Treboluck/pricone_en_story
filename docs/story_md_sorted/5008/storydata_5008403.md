## Subtitle: Our Battle's Only Just Beginning!
  
**Nanaka：**  
I may not remember how many breads I've eaten in my life,  
but I remember how many times we've smashed that sucker!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
We've shown it who's boss, but it's still raring to go.  
In other words, our battle's only just beginning!  
 I hope you're with me!
