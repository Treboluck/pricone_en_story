## Subtitle: Always Eager to Fight
  
**Stechpalm：**  
So we reach the final day of our grueling battle...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
But wait, it's not over yet!  
Until peace returns to the Canyon Cavern,  
we must fight down to the final second!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Those words are actually quite inspiring, Nanaka.  
  
**Eriko：**  
I agree with Nanaka as well.  
Evil must be eradicated completely...  
We must ensure that nobody ever dares to insult my love again...  
  
**Ruka：**  
That's the spirit, everyone.  
Well then,  
 let's get out there and finish this thing!
