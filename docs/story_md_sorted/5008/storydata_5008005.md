**Mitsuki：**  
Yes... His weakened pulse is beginning to beat more strongly again.  
  
**Eriko：**  
The medicine you and I pooled our knowledge to create could never fail.  
All that's left is to trust in his own inner strength...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Agreed. We must have patience...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Ah...!  
 Eriko, come here!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I think I just saw his eyelids flicker!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Are you certain?  
Ahhh, {player}... {player}, my love...!

**Eriko：**  
Aahhh...! Oh, my love! Thank goodness!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Finally, you're awake! You sure did have us worried!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Right now, you're lying in the carriage that we came here in.  
  
**Eriko：**  
The two of us met up with Ruka and the others  
in a village near the cavern where you collapsed.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Eriko...  
**Choice: (2)**  Mitsuki...  
`Tag 1`  
**Eriko：**  
Yes, it's me, my love! Your one true soulmate, Eriko!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Yes, that's me!  
 Tell me, how's your body feeling?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mitsuki：**  
I must say though, it's such a relief...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Nanaka sent word to us that you were in trouble,  
and we came as fast as we could...  
When I heard you weren't waking up, I went into quite a panic!  
  
**Eriko：**  
As of course did I... And when I realized  
that I had failed to be there in your hour of need,  
I cursed myself a thousand times over...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Hmm? What's wrong? Why are you looking around?  
  
**Eriko：**  
The others are outside, standing lookout and going over our intel.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Once you're able to move, you should go and see them.  
Anna, especially, has been blaming herself for what happened.

**Stechpalm：**  
Sigurd! You're really awake!  
A-are you sure you're all right?!  
 This isn't a dream?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
A... aaahhhh... You're okay... You're really okay!  
If anything happened to you, Sigurd, I... I... *sniff*...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Huh...? \"Sorry for all the trouble\"...?  
What are you talking about?! I'm the one who should apologize!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
If you hadn't saved me back there,  
neither of us would be standing here right now...  
I feel like I owe you more than I can ever repay...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Listen, Sigurd.  
I swear I won't ever put you in danger like that again.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
So will you still... go on missions with me after this?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  In the depths of Gehenna, a gale arises!  
`Tag 4`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Th... thank you, {player}...  
 Thank you!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
You truly are the one and only Zweiritter  
of the Order of Gehenna Immortals, Sigurd of the Fulgor!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ahhh?! {player}!  
Thank heavens! I was so worried!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Ah, {player}... You're finally awake.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Thanks, everyone.  
`Tag 5`  
**Ruka：**  
No need for thanks.  
When you shielded Anna, did you do it to hear words of gratitude?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
And of course, Anna didn't risk life and limb  
struggling to haul you safe from that cavern  
because she wanted you to thank her for it!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
\"I'm sorry... He took an attack to protect me...  
We have to get him... to safe... ty...\" Ka-flump!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ahhh~! You were just the picture of a hero, Annie-girl!  
That scene deserved its own event CG!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Wh-what are you talking about, Nanaka?!  
This is no joking matter! I really was desperate!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
...Yeah. I know you were.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
You did every last thing you could to protect {player}.  
It was heroism at its finest.  
You really were the absolute coolest!  
  
**Ruka：**  
I agree. You fought well, Anna.  
You have my thanks for protecting {player}.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Nanaka... Ruka...!  
Th-thank you too, for carrying both of us all the way to safety...!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Haha...  
 Hahaha!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Eheheh... Ohohohoh!  
Mueheheheheh! ♪  
  
**Eriko：**  
Sorry to interrupt your beautiful moment of friendship,  
but isn't it time we began our counterattack?  
  
**Eriko：**  
I don't think I can possibly rest for an instant  
until I've shown those worms who harmed my love a thousand hells.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Oh, how funny.  
 I was just thinking the same thing.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
No objections here!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
My intentions are one and the same!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Yes, I suppose...  
If they're not coming for us, we should mount a full attack—  
  
**Old Man：**  
Wh-what nonsense is this now?!  
You mustn't make enemies of those people!  
  
**Woman：**  
Please, I beg you... Don't do anything to provoke them more!  
Who knows how they'll take their revenge...  
  
**Ruka：**  
I'm very sorry to make you all worry.  
 But there's no need.  
From now on, you can toss those worries aside for good.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Once we're done with them,  
there won't be anyone left to take revenge.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Now, everyone! Shall we go teach them a lesson?  
We have a cavern to assault!
