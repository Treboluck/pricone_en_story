**Pecorine：**  
Karyl, Kokkoro!  
It looks like this is the final trial!  
  
**Karyl：**  
As I guess you'd expect, it doesn't look like it'll be easy...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Facing one's own self  
 is an unnerving experience indeed.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's dangerous, so maybe you should stay back, Kokkoro!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, surely you jest, Miss Pecorine.  
All of us here have honed our strength in many trials already.  
I feel sure we can overcome this one just the same.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, all right then.  
If you're so pumped for this, Koro, I guess I can't hold back either!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let's overcome this trial  
 and seize the new power we deserve!
