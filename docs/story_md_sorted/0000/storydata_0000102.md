**Kokkoro：**  
The Bonus Shop is a special shop that sometimes appears  
after you complete a Main Quest stage.  
If they have equipment you need, you can purchase it using Mana.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The Bonus Shop only remains open for ten minutes at a time.  
If you take too long, you will need to wait for it to appear again,  
so try to be careful.
