L-look! Rin, Mio!  
Ueki-chan's growing taller and taller...!  
What's happening to the big guy?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Hmmm...  
Could it be that Ueki-chan's love for idols  
is reaching new and greater heights?  
  
**Mio：**  
That could be it!  
...Huh?  
Hey, over there... Doesn't that look like an entrance?  
  
**Rin：**  
You're right.  
It looks like it might let us climb to higher levels.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Um... Shall we try going up?  
You never know, there might be clues up there to how this happened!  
  
**Mio：**  
Sounds like fun! A big adventure!  
Yeah, let's do it!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine, Miss Karyl.  
The members of \"New Generations\" seem eager to begin the climb,  
but how do you think we should proceed?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, we've come this far already.  
Guess it can't hurt to go with them.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
You'll really come, Karyl?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Thank you.  
You're pretty nice when it comes down to it.  
  
**Mio：**  
Yep, yep! ♪  
That's why we love ya, Karyl-Karyl!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I-I'm not kind or nice or anything!  
I just figured it's not like I've got anything better to do!  
Don't get the wrong idea!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh.  
Well, that settles that. Let us all climb Ueki-chan together.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yep! ♪ Journeys are like dinners—always better with company!  
Now, let's begin a mighty trek to the very top!
