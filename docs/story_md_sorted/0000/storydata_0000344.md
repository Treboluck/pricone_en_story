**Karin：**  
This monster is a terrifying specimen that even the  
Guild Association was unaware of...  
 If we leave it unchecked,  
there's no telling what havoc it might wreak in nearby settlements!  
  
**Karin：**  
We simply can't afford to run and save ourselves!  
I'm issuing a request for this monster's swift defeat!  
Please try to eliminate it, and preserve peace in this land!
