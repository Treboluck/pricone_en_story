**Karyl：**  
Wh-what? This place wasn't here before, was it?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Did somebody activate a teleportation spell?  
Well, I guess we'll find out if we explore!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Gah! Idiot!  
There's nothing more dangerous than charging in blindly!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, yes, but it doesn't seem scary.  
Actually, this place feels weirdly familiar...  
  
**Karyl：**  
You know, I get the same feeling, now that you mention it.  
Like I'm gazing at myself somehow...  
Is this a reflection of our minds?  
 Or something like that?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
By facing memories that lie deep within one's heart,  
it is possible to awaken new power, or so I have heard.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You have to face yourself to get stronger? Is that it?  
Then what're we waiting for?!  
 Chaaaaarge! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, for the... I told you not to rush in!  
Geez, she's always such a handful!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh.  
Let us follow after our companions, my lord.
