**Kokkoro：**  
So this is Elpis Island!  
 What lush greenery, and such a pleasant climate...  
It does seem like a fine location to build new settlements.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We finally made it!  
So this is our new land of adventure! Unknown plains, foreign winds!  
And a world full of flavors we've never tasted! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Now I see why you were so keen on coming...  
Well, as long as we report back, we're apparently allowed to do  
whatever we like, so I guess no one'll complain if we eat the wildlife...  
  
**Karyl：**  
But even so, I'm not eating any bugs or monsters!  
You got that?!
