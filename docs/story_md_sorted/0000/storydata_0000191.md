As you might expect, \"Hard\" quests are trickier than \"Normal\" ones,  
but the rewards include not only equipment  
but also characters' Memory Shards.

Memory Shards are an invaluable resource,  
allowing you to unlock entirely new characters  
or increase the strength of characters you have already unlocked.
