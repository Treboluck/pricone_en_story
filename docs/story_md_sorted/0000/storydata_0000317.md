**Rin, Uzuki & Mio：**  
We made it!  
  
**Mio：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
 Finally, the top!  
That was quite the climb...  
  
**Rin：**  
Wow...  
 Look, you guys.  
The view is incredible.  
There's something special about summits.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Oh, you're right!  
I've never seen such a beautiful sight before...  
Well, unless I've lost those memories.  
  
**Mio：**  
Hey, I just had a thought...  
What if this view was what Ueki-chan wanted to show us all along?  
  
**Rin：**  
Ueki-chan wanted to?  
  
**Mio：**  
Yeah.  
 Like \"Climb to the top if you can!\"  
 you know?  
I can't exactly put it into words...  
  
**Rin：**  
...I think I see.  
A trial to reach new heights. Not a bad idea.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
If that's the case,  
 this adventure may have brought us  
one step closer to being top idols!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...  
Huh.  
 You three really are idols, aren't you?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
...Karyl?  
  
**Karyl：**  
No, it's nothing really.  
 It's just, seeing how you push forward,  
always optimistic, always trying to reach higher...  
Maybe that's what sets real idols apart. That's all I thought.  
  
**Mio：**  
Ummm...  
 Did we just get complimented?  
  
**Rin：**  
I think we did, you know.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Thank you ever so much, Karyl!  
  
**Karyl：**  
It... it wasn't a compliment!  
Quit just hearing what you want to hear!

Ahaha! ♪ You're so cute when you're embarrassed!  
As cute as an idol!  
 Woo-woo! ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes. Miss Karyl will always be our most treasured idol.  
  
**Karyl：**  
D-don't say all that weird stuff!  
I really will kill you dead!  
  
**Mio：**  
Ahaha!  
Karyl-Karyl's such a cutie~! ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Looking back, we made lots of memories  
with the Gourmet Guild members,  
so this was a good adventure.  
  
**Mio：**  
Yep!  
And I think I'm extra pumped to become a great idol now, too!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Let's work hard to become real idols,  
 all three of us together!  
  
**Uzuki, Rin & Mio：**  
Yeah! ♪
