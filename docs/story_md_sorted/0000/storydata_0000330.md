**Karin：**  
Well then, everyone. I'm counting on you to explore these ruins.  
And as for these rare \"Princess Heart\" treasures found inside...  
  
**Karin：**  
You're free to collect them to do with as you wish.  
We'll consider them part of your reward.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Counting on us,  
 huh? You make it sound so simple! This... \"Sanctum,\"  
was it?  
 I've gotta say, between it and that great big Tower of Luna,  
aren't there too many weird ruins being uncovered on this continent?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Personally, I rather enjoy going on adventures like this  
with my lord, Miss Pecorine and Miss Karyl,  
so I am glad for this opportunity.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, you always know just how to make me blush, Kokkoro!  
Besides, Yui's coming along too this time,  
so we'll have even more fun than usual! ♪  
  
**Yui：**  
That's right!  
 I packed plenty of lunch for everyone! ♪  
...  
Hey, guys, can I ask something?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. Could there be something bothering you, Miss Yui?  
Something to do with those strange treasures  
that Miss Karin just showed us, perhaps?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Those fragments do seem to give off some kind of weird energy...  
  
**Yui：**  
...Yeah. Actually, when Karin showed them to me,  
I felt like their power reminded me of Mr. Knight's somehow.  
It could just be my imagination, but...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh, I see, I see!  
 Then let's get moving!  
We'll excavate the sanctum and grab a haul of fragments!  
The more we have, the sooner we'll solve the mystery!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And while we're there, let's find some tasty meat for us all to share! ♪
