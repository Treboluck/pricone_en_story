Ueki-chan has grown even taller...  
We're higher up than the clouds now...  
  
**Mio：**  
I never thought we'd come this high...  
Is it still gonna be a while before we reach the very top?  
  
**Rin：**  
It doesn't matter how high it goes.  
We decided we're aiming for the peak.  
 Didn't we?  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Uh, guys? This situation isn't exactly normal, right?  
Have you given up on questioning it? Helloooo?
