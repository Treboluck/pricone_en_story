**Mifuyu：**  
Oh, please!  
We blew up a whole airship to defeat that titan!  
Why did this thing crawl out of the wreckage?!  
  
**Maho：**  
The road and even the plants are dryin' up like a desert...!  
Is this all a part o' that monster's power?  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'm glad we got the evacuees to safety ahead of time.  
But we can't allow this thing to parch the terrain any further.  
  
**Misato：**  
To protect the forest...  
We members of Forestier will fight alongside young Hatsune!  
  
**Akino：**  
Ohoho! Most excellent! ♪  
Let us all join forces as one!
