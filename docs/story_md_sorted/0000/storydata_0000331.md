**Karyl：**  
So what the heck is this place?  
We've explored a lot of ruins in the past,  
but these feel extra special somehow.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, this place is...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Something up, Kokkoro?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Though remarkably ancient,  
I do believe this seems to be a sacred temple.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A temple this size, and nobody discovered it before us?  
Now that's mysterious!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It appears it was magically concealed to all but a chosen few,  
so perhaps it is only natural that it went unnoticed.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh, I see!  
Then does that mean the temple chose us to explore it?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?!  
You mean nobody can complain if we excavate all its treasure?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Regrettably, the legends tell of great trials that await within  
for those who would face them.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Yeah, I should've known.  
I was an idiot to get all excited. *sigh*  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But in return,  
 by overcoming those trials, one may obtain rare items  
that will awaken great power, or so the legends say.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, why didn't you say so?!  
Now that we're here, I'm gonna show this temple  
it bit off way more than it can chew with us!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh... Karyl's really getting into this!  
Well then, let's get to conquering some trials, shall we?! ☆
