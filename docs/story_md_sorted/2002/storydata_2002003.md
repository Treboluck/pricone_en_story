**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, please, fall back this way!  
Now that a battle has broken out in earnest,  
there is little we can do to help.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, why did it have to come to this...?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Don't worry. It'll be OK.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
H-how can you be sure...?  
Ahh... Sometimes you can be a little *too* optimistic, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Though I cannot deny your words sound reassuring...  
The fact remains that the situation before us is dire.

**Christina：**  
At least try to give me a challenge!  
Let me dance on the brink between life and death...  
Make me feel like I'm truly alive!  
  
**Christina：**  
If all you're going to do is disappoint me,  
I'll be forced to drown my woes in your flesh and blood!  
  
**Christina：**  
Come, if you're holding back any secrets, it's time to reveal them!  
  
`image display end`  
**Makoto：**  
Urghhh... I've had enough of your attitude!  
You sure seem to be having the time of your life,  
trampling all over our home for no good reason!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Makoto, you mustn't rush in alone!  
I'll use my speed to distract her...  
So you find an opening and strike when she's—  
whoa-oh-oh?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Seriously, ladies?  
You're just going to blurt out your strategy where I can hear?  
  
**Christina：**  
I expected better than this from Caon...  
Aren't you some of the strongest fighters in the Menagerie?!  
My my, what a letdown!  
  
**Christina：**  
You're not fighting like a team! There's no bite to your attacks!  
Are you professionals, or just petty street brawlers?!  
At this rate, you'll never measure up to a real knight!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ahhh?!  
Me and Makoto have her outnumbered, but she's not budging!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Something feels kind of wrong here...  
It doesn't look like she's managing to follow my movements...  
But somehow she's dodging all my attacks at the last second.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Her attacks are pretty weird, too...  
It should be tricky to fight using such a big sword indoors...  
But somehow her wild swings are all hitting their mark.  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's like our attacks aren't allowed to hit her,  
but hers aren't allowed to miss us.  
Almost as if the laws of physics are biased in her favor...  
  
**Kaori：**  
It doesn't make sense... There's gotta be some trick to it...  
But there's no time to be figuring that out right now!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Makoto! This ambush has left us in a bad position.  
We should abandon the guildhouse for now and retreat!  
Let's open up an escape route for Maho and the others!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Say what?!  
After all this, you want us to flee with our tails between our legs?!  
I can't let her walk all over us! I've gotta teach her a lesson!  
  
**Kaori：**  
If this was a one-on-one fight, that would be fine...  
But this is a battle between guilds!  
We'd already lost this fight the moment they set us up!  
  
**Kaori：**  
So our job right now is to minimize the damage and regroup!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ohhh?  
It would appear this one is a lot smarter than she looks!  
  
**Christina：**  
But too bad for you—I'm not letting you escape!  
You think I'd let such perfect toys slip through my fingers?! ☆  
  
**Kaori：**  
Uergh?!  
That was close! How can she attack so easily from that position?!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Urgh... Her attacks really do always hit their mark...  
It's not natural...  
  
**Kaori：**  
My usual fighting style is based on agility,  
dodging between the enemy's attacks to strike,  
so having to block all the time like this throws me off!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'm fighting empty-handed, while she has a huge sword...  
So far I've managed to deflect her blows,  
but it's only a matter of time before she wears me down!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I can't keep this up forever, and she knows it!  
Aghh! How could my grandparents' ultimate karate  
fail me like this?!  
  
**Kaori：**  
But it's no use...  
Until I figure out what's behind her unnatural movements,  
I'm completely outmatched!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Kaori, get outta the way!  
No matter how good she is,  
there's no way she can attack and defend at the same time!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I'm gonna go on an all-out offensive,  
and force her to lose some momentum!  
Hiyahhh!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Princess, cast some healing and enhancement on me and Kaori!  
And if you get the chance, try to blast aside some of those  
goons surrounding the guildhouse, so we can make our escape!  
  
**Maho：**  
R-right!  
I'll see what I can do!  
You sure can be a lifesaver in a pinch, Makoto!  
  
**Maho：**  
Me, I'm no good at times like this...  
I just can't keep up in the heat o' battle!  
  
**Maho：**  
But that's enough complainin' for now.  
My prince, take the others and get behind me.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  What are you going to do?  
**Choice: (3)**  Is there some way I can help?  
`Tag 2`  
**Maho：**  
Ahh, I don't really have time to be explainin'...  
Could ya just trust me and do as I say for a second?  
  
**Maho：**  
Do this for me, my prince.  
I can't bear to watch them tramplin' all over  
my precious home like this.  
  
**Maho：**  
I gotta at least do what I can to resist.  
On my honor as the Caon guildmaster!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Maho：**  
Sure!  
How's about...  
 you use that special power of yours  
to give me a little energy boost?  
  
**Maho：**  
In a moment, I'm gonna cast a couple o' big spells at once.  
I'll be defenseless while I do, so try to protect me, OK?  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah! ☆ I have to hand it to these animals...  
They may seem like brainless mongrels,  
but their battle instincts are nothing to sniff at!  
  
**Christina：**  
I love it! So this is how beastfolk fight!  
A beast's toughness and instincts, paired with human intellect!  
Nothing thrills me more than facing a new kind of threat!  
  
**Christina：**  
It makes my heart leap! This is what I call a battle!  
Keep it coming, mongrels! I need more! ☆  
  
**Christina：**  
I've been toying with you so far,  
since I didn't want this to end too soon.  
But it looks like I don't need to hold back!  
  
**Christina：**  
Let's see how you handle something more potent!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Whoaaa?!  
Dammit, her sheer strength isn't human!  
Just blocking one of her attacks lifted my feet off the ground!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ahaha! I'm starting to enjoy this a little myself!  
Kaori! I'll keep this lunk's big sword occupied!  
You make use of your speed and attack from all angles!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Gotcha!  
Always happy to help a guildmate out!  
That's what Caon's all about!  
  
**Kaori：**  
No mercy for invaders!  
Let's give her a good spanking and send her on her way!
