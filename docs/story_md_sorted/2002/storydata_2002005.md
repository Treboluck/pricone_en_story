**Christina：**  
Hahah.  
Besides, this is precisely how a knight behaves,  
my dear innocent little Tomo.  
  
**Christina：**  
Try as you may to cling to ideals of chivalry,  
at the end of the day, a knight's business is bloodshed.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Can you not do something about that attitude?!  
It's that depraved outlook of yours  
that's giving all of Nightmare a bad name!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Do you have no pride at all?!  
  
`image display end`  
**Christina：**  
Please, no need to get so worked up.  
Whatever happened to your usual air of nonchalance?  
It suits you far better than this.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hahaha!  
I suppose you really are a humorless little do-gooder at heart.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah, but wait...  
Perhaps, given your roots as a commoner,  
you put on that pure and righteous act deliberately.  
  
**Christina：**  
Playing to your own childish ideas of knighthood,  
in order to overcome your insecurities?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Don't try to analyze me, Christina!  
  
**Christina：**  
Watch how you address your superiors, girl.  
  
**Christina：**  
Today I actually managed to enjoy myself a little...  
So I'd like to retire to bed before anyone spoils the mood.  
  
**Christina：**  
I am a little worn out, too, after all.  
I don't have the energy to squabble with you.  
  
**Christina：**  
I'll be happy to play with you tomorrow,  
so hurry along home and ask your mommy to put you to bed.  
  
**Tomo：**  
D-don't treat me like a child!  
Jun, can you tell her to take this seriously?!  
  
**Jun：**  
...  
  
**Christina：**  
Captain.  
Do you also intend to brand me a thoughtless barbarian?  
  
**Jun：**  
Your deeds will be reviewed in due time at Her Majesty's tribunal.  
It is not my place to pass judgment.  
  
**Jun：**  
I hear you have been acting on Her Majesty's private orders.  
You too are ultimately a mere pawn.  
  
**Jun：**  
If you have made the decision to accept that role,  
then I will refrain from further comment.  
  
**Jun：**  
However...  
If your current position is causing you to suffer,  
I would like to help you, if I can.  
  
**Christina：**  
Well, aren't you kind.  
  
**Christina：**  
But I'm afraid I'm just sick to death of this tedious peace.  
I was glad for the opportunity to spark the flames of conflict.  
Now it's just a question of how far that fire will spread...  
  
**Christina：**  
...Oh, look who it is.  
Looks like we don't have time to stand around chatting.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I apologize for interrupting your conversation.  
Her Majesty wishes to see you, Vice-Captain Christina.  
Proceed to the audience chamber at your earliest convenience.  
  
**Christina：**  
Very well. I can hardly turn down a royal summons.  
Whatever could she want? To give me a reward, perhaps?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm afraid I cannot say.  
You will have to ask Her Majesty directly for the details.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hahah.  
Tell me, girl. ..."Karyl," was it?  
  
**Christina：**  
You're a beastgirl too, aren't you? Those ears and tail...  
I imagine you must have your own thoughts  
on the incident we've been discussing?  
  
**Christina：**  
Go ahead, spit in my face if you like.  
Curse me as the villain who attacked your fellow beastfolk.  
I would enjoy the opportunity to play with you as well!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I am merely a messenger.  
I would rather you keep me out of this, thank you.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Besides which...  
Neither I nor Her Majesty  
have anything to do with the beastfolk of this country.  
  
**Christina：**  
Then what exactly are the pair of you, hmm?  
What do you think, Captain? Little Tomo?  
Don't you find it at all strange?  
  
**Christina：**  
The royals of Landosol have never been friendly with the beastfolk.  
Far from it, they have fought numerous times through history.  
Even if lately, that animosity has been on the down-low.  
  
**Christina：**  
So how is it that Her Majesty, the one we all serve,  
and her trusted messenger Karyl, are beastfolk themselves?  
  
**Christina：**  
Doesn't that strike you as odd?  
It certainly doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  
  
**Christina：**  
Could it be that somehow,  
each and every one of us  
 is being played for a fool  
by none other than Her Majesty herself?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Watch what you say, Vice-Captain Christina.  
You could be accused of treason for less.  
  
**Karyl：**  
At any rate, please hurry to the audience chamber.  
It would not do to keep Her Majesty waiting.  
  
**Christina：**  
As you wish, as you wish.  
Please, take my hand and show me the way,  
my darling little lady.  
  
**Tomo：**  
...  
  
**Tomo：**  
...What do you think of all this, Jun?  
  
**Jun：**  
For the moment,  
I'd rather avoid too much infighting if possible.  
  
**Jun：**  
I can see that you and Chris... I mean, Vice-Captain Christina...  
are never going to be the best of friends.  
So I won't tell you to get along with her.  
  
**Jun：**  
But we are all on the same side here,  
so I would appreciate it if you could try to understand her.  
Her position is not an easy one either, you know.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Well, I'll do my best...  
  
**Tomo：**  
But there's something bothering me more than that.  
That messenger—Karyl's her name, right?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Who exactly is she, really?  
I can't seem to recall when or why it was  
that Her Majesty hired a personal assistant like that...  
  
**Jun：**  
It is a little unsettling...  
Until the vice-captain pointed it out just now,  
I didn't even notice anything was strange.  
  
**Jun：**  
I just accepted it without thinking.  
Even though her existence here *is* rather unnatural.  
  
**Jun：**  
And the more I think about it, the stranger it seems.  
How did we come to be ruled by one of the beastfolk,  
who have historically been our enemies?  
  
**Jun：**  
It seems almost like a paradox.  
As if logic itself does not apply.  
  
**Jun：**  
I don't think I'm eloquent enough to properly explain it...  
But it's as though my perceptions have been altered somehow.  
Something feels wrong, and it bothers me.  
  
**Jun：**  
Tomo.  
As the captain of the royal guard,  
I have a duty to remain here at the palace.  
  
**Jun：**  
I cannot move freely.  
So if you would be willing,  
I would like you to investigate this matter in my stead.  
  
**Jun：**  
These strange contradictions, and the conflicts at hand...  
They could all be part of some greater scheme.  
  
**Jun：**  
I fear these shadows may run deeper than we know.  
We must be careful as we unravel them in search of the truth.  
I would do this myself if I could, but I am bound by my position.  
  
**Jun：**  
So I must count on you.  
This may be dangerous, but I fear we have little choice.  
  
**Tomo：**  
That's fine by me.  
Actually, I'm honored you would trust me with this.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I do have an idea where to start looking...  
So I'll see what I can dig up.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Besides, what's a little danger to a knight?  
I swore an oath to protect this country if it costs me my life.  
That's our duty as Nightmare, Defenders of the Throne!  
  
**Jun：**  
Indeed.  
Let us fight for the justice we believe in.
