**Narration：**  
{player} is staying at the village with \"New Generations.\"  
During a break in their lessons, he heads out for a walk, when...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Oh—hi there, {player}! Did you come here for a rest, too?  
The breeze is so relaxing under this tree, right? ♪  
  
**Uzuki：**  
We've been so busy with everything that's happened lately,  
but it's nice to sit back and relax once in a while.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Still, for such a shady spot, it's kind of bright...  
Huh? Is it you who's shining?!  
 Are you OK?!  
Has someone cast some kind of weird spell on you, or... Aaahhh!

**Narration：**  
On a day off, {player} is out for a random stroll.  
With no particular destination in mind,  
he wanders through the town until...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Huh?  
 Oh, hello!  
Are you out for a stroll as well?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
I've actually got a day off for once,  
so I decided to take a look around the town.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Shall I show you around?  
`Tag 1`  
**Uzuki：**  
You'd do that? Thank you so much!  
I'm still not used to Tsubakigaoka, so I'd really appreciate it! ♪  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Oh...? I think something's going on over there. Umm...  
\"Amateurs Welcome! Try-Your-Luck Idol Audition,\" it says!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Wow... That does sound like fun!  
Do you want to take a look?  
  
**Man：**  
You there, girl! Are you interested in our event?!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Waahhh! Th-that surprised me...  
Um, who might you be...?  
  
**Man：**  
Ah, please forgive me. I am this event's organizer  
and a producer at an idol agency. Here's my business card.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
W-well, thank you very much...  
So, um, did you want to ask something?  
  
**Man：**  
It's very simple. The moment I saw you, my radar went DING!  
You, young lady, have the Super Aura of a future idol!  
  
**Man：**  
Please can I ask you to take part in this event?!  
I feel utterly certain you have what it takes to win!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
It's very kind of you to say that, but, um...  
I don't think I can...  
  
**Man：**  
I'm begging you! I'm on my hands and knees!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
U-um, please don't prostrate yourself!  
 It's very embarrassing!  
  
**Man：**  
I won't raise my head until you agree to participate! Please!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
O-ohhh... What should I do...?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Tell him why you can't do this.  
`Tag 2`  
**Uzuki：**  
Yes... you're right.  
The truth is, I already belong to a different idol agency.  
So you see, it's really not possible...  
  
**Man：**  
Whaaat?! No way! ...W-well then, can you at least join in?!  
Not for the audition, but just as a guest! Please? Please?!  
If you need, I'll hit the ground again—  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Th-that's really not necessary!  
...All right, then. I'll join in.  
Just as a guest performer, okay?  
  
**Man：**  
Yippee! Thank you so much!  
Now, this is a duo event, so if you'll both come this way!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
An audition event for pairs...?  
Do they want us to perform as a unit, I wonder?

**Announcer：**  
Now! Next up, it's the duo with entry number ten!  
Is your treadmill runner ready to get running?  
  
**Announcer：**  
If he can't keep up, the backing track won't play,  
and the spotlight won't shine! So run with all your might!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
This seems... almost like a variety show game...  
Um, do you think you can run for a whole song?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'll give it everything I've got...  
`Tag 3`  
**Uzuki：**  
Sounds like you're up for the challenge...  
All right, then. I'll do my best for both our sakes!  
  
**Announcer：**  
Looks like they're both set.  
Well then, runner, it's time to get running!  
  
**Announcer：**  
...Yes, the spotlight has turned on!  
Once you introduce yourself, the music will start!

**Uzuki：**  
Entry number ten, Uzuki Shimamura!  
Everyone, I hope you'll cheer me on!  
  
**Audience Member 1：**  
Whoa! This girl just radiates confidence!  
  
**Audience Member 2：**  
That uniform... A high schooler? But what school's she from?  
  
**Man：**  
I knew it... She has the makings of a truly brilliant idol...!

`image display end`  
**Man：**  
Thank you for participating despite your reservations.  
It was an honor to witness such a performance!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
O-oh, no, I'm really nothing special yet...  
But I'm happy that you enjoyed it.  
  
**Man：**  
We gave the prize to another contestant, but how about it?  
Would you consider debuting as an idol for our agency?!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Whaaaa?!  
You said you'd leave me out of the actual audition!  
  
**Man：**  
And we did leave you out.  
But auditions aside, won't you join us?! Please! I beg you!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
I-I'm very sorry! I already have someone in my life,  
so it wouldn't be right for me to accept your offer!  
  
**Man：**  
...Heh. After such a straight rejection, I can't grumble.  
Very well, then. Though it truly pains me, I'll give up. Boo-hoo-hoo...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Phew... Th-thank goodness that's over.  
I got so flustered, I phrased it in a bit of a weird way...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Were you talking about your producer?  
`Tag 4`  
**Uzuki：**  
Yes, that's right. I've made my decision to do my best  
with my current producer by my side. Nobody else will do.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Eheheh...  
 Please don't mention to Rin or Mio that I said that.  
If our producer ever heard about it, I'd be so embarrassed.  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
And welcome back. You have a nice dream?  
...Well, this might not be the time for that.  
What's going on here?  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's as if a whole lot of data has gotten muddled up somehow.  
Is this because those girls come from \"somewhere else\"...?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I can't even tell if these events really happened on the other side...  
This whole situation is just way too irregular. Geez...  
  

---  
  
**Uzuki：**  
...Huh? Did we fall asleep at some point...?  
I know this is a comfy spot, but it's gotten so late...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Oh, and I had the strangest dream.  
I was standing on stage at an idol audition,  
singing and performing with a huge smile...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Could it be... that was my subconscious trying to tell me  
the kind of idol I really want to become?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I know you can do it.  
`Tag 5`  
**Uzuki：**  
Eheheh... Thank you very much!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
I want to put on a performance as great as the one in my dream...  
so I'll do my best!  
  
**Narration：**  
And from the sight of Uzuki's smile,  
{player} had no doubt whatsoever  
that she would become a wonderful idol indeed.
