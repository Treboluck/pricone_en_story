## Subtitle: Find My Dream
  
**Narration：**  
On the way to Musa Town to fulfill their job for \"New Generations,\"  
{player} and friends are camping out on the road...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Tasty rice! ♪ Tasty rice! ♪  
Do you think the rice is ready yet? It's ready, right?!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
I think it might take a little longer.  
Opening it before it's done harms the texture, so let's be patient.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Urghhh...! Waiting is painful when I'm this starving!  
And midnight snacks are the best part of taking the night watch, too!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I can't wait to taste Uzuki's cooking.  
**Choice: (2)**  Midnight snacks get me excited.  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
I know, right?!  
Just imagining what she might serve us makes me extra hungry! ☆  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Please don't expect too much, OK?  
I've just made an ordinary meal like always.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh, I understand that!  
 You've already had dinner,  
but then you get a whole extra meal!  
 It's a blast! ☆  
  
**Uzuki：**  
They say eating at night makes you gain weight,  
but it really can be tempting sometimes.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Uzuki：**  
...I think the rice might be ready now. Let's see!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Yes, it's all hot and fluffy!  
Well then, Pecorine, here's your rice and stew!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yaaaay! I'll dig in right now!  
*munch* *munch munch munch*  
Your cooking tastes so delicious, it's crazy! ☆  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Eheheh. It's nothing special, really.  
 But I'm really glad you like it!  
I made a whole batch, so eat as much as you want!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Um... should we really be relaxing like this, though?  
We're supposed to be on lookout, aren't we?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You can't stay on edge all the time.  
`Tag 4`  
**Pecorine：**  
True enough! Besides, Karyl set up that barrier magic for us,  
so if monsters show up, we'll know in no time at all!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We've got a long night ahead, so let's take it easy!  
Oh,  
 Uzuki—can I have seconds now?! ☆  
  
**Uzuki：**  
I suppose that makes sense.  
 Here—please dig in!  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Oh! Ahhh... Thank goodness... Fellow travelers!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Huh...? An old lady?!  
What's the matter? Why are you out here all on your own...?  
  
**Old Lady：**  
I was camping not far from here, but a pack of monsters attacked...  
I ran off to search for other adventurers nearby!  
  
**Old Lady：**  
I'm sorry to impose, but could I stay with you for tonight?  
The thought of another monster attack terrifies me...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, how awful. You poor thing...  
It's not safe if there are monsters nearby, so can we let her stay?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Rest here as long as you like.  
`Tag 5`  
**Uzuki：**  
Agreed.  
 Please, madam, come this way!  
We've got lots of food, so feel free to dig in if you're hungry!  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Oh, thank you.  
 I know—in return for your help, I'll make some tea.  
It isn't much, but it's the least I can do...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Oh, no, we appreciate it! Thank you very much!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This tea has an unusual scent.  
*gulp* *gulp*  
 Wow! It's sweet and delicious!  
 Can I have another cup?!  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Oh...? So you're all heading for the town of Musa?  
Of course—that's a long journey, so you would need to camp.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Yes, it's not easy.  
 But it's our best chance to become idols!  
We're going to win the audition and fulfill our dreams!  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Do you really believe that dreams can come true?  
I don't trust such things myself.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Old Lady：**  
I've seen any number of kids with big dreams like you.  
But most of them wound up frustrated and empty.  
  
**Old Lady：**  
I myself had big ambitions when I was young,  
but you can see how much good that's done me.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But those don't have much to do with Uzuki's dream, so...  
  
**Old Lady：**  
But they do.  
Dreams, you see, are for people who are born special.  
Ordinary folk like you and I shouldn't expect to reach the stars.  
  
**Old Lady：**  
There are so many things that normal people can never achieve.  
Anyone can tell you that, so why give yourself false hope?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
I can't deny the things you're saying are probably true.  
There's no guarantee I'll be able to become a real idol, either.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
I'm sure there'll be suffering along the way.  
But this is what inspired me to change myself, so I want to try.  
  
**Old Lady：**  
For someone who dreams so big,  
you don't sound very sure of yourself.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
It could be that reaching the dream itself isn't what matters.  
I just want to find something that feels worth doing.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Aiming to be an idol is just the first step, I think.  
Because I still don't know what kind of person I want to become.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Even so, as long as Rin and Mio are with me,  
I'm sure we'll find something we can...  
 aim for...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
H... huh...? I feel... so sleepy...  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Finally, the drug takes effect.  
You really should be more wary of bandits like me.  
  
**Old Lady：**  
...Still, what to do...? I'm not feeling too thrilled about this job.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh? A bandit like you isn't going to steal anything?  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Guaaarghh?!  
Y-you two! Why are you still awake?!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Karyl warned us about this.  
`Tag 6`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhhh... \"Never drink anything a stranger gives you,\" was it?  
Actually, I'd forgotten that, so I drank it right up! ☆  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Sleeping drugs don't affect you?! That doesn't make a lick of sense!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, here I am awake, so what can I say? ☆  
Now, come on—you're not going to steal anything?  
Even though you're a bandit?  
  
**Old Lady：**  
...I just don't feel like it.  
Talking with that young miss made me remember a thing or two.  
There was a time when I lived an honest life like that.  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Since giving up on my dreams, I've lived a cruel and cynical life...  
Looking at myself now, I feel ashamed of what I've become.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Then why don't you try to become your best self starting now?  
There's no better time than the present! ☆  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Hah... It may be too late for an old crone like me.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  It's never too late to do what you love.  
`Tag 7`  
**Old Lady：**  
To think I'd be comforted by whelps like these...  
Tell that girl that my friends came to pick me up.  
I'll be on my way now.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't go doing naughty things any more, OK?  
And take care out there!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
All's well that ends well, huh? ☆  
Still, why *didn't* that sleeping drug work on me?  
Could it be because my tummy was so full already?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
*yawn*...  
 Oh! Did I... doze off just now?  
I'm so sorry! On lookout duty, too...  
...Huh? Where's the old lady?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Her friends dropped by, so she went with them.  
It seems like you really helped her out, you know! ☆  
  
**Uzuki：**  
I helped her?  
 Huh? What do you mean?  
Did she really enjoy my cooking that much...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, something like that! ☆  
Anyway, back to lookout du...  
 ty... Zzz...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Whaaa?! What's this all of a sudden?!  
Are you okay, Pecorine?  
 Pecorine!  
  
**Narration：**  
With Pecorine's sleeping drug finally kicking in hard,  
{player} and Uzuki decided to let her rest  
and handle the night's lookout duty themselves.
