## Subtitle: Offering to the Vampire
  
**Narration：**  
One day, when {player} and Illya are exploring the city,  
they find themselves suddenly enveloped in a glowing light.  
  
**Illya：**  
What is this blinding light?  
Could it be an attack upon my person?  
  
**Illya：**  
Hrmph! A brave attacker indeed, to mount an assault on me!  
  
**Illya：**  
However, you need not worry, {player}.  
I will protect you from any danger!  
  

---  
  
**Man：**  
Congratulations! You win the second prize: a grab bag!  
  
**Illya：**  
Oh...?  
  
**Illya：**  
Ahh, {player}.  
'Tis a rare coincidence to run into you here.  
  
**Illya：**  
Oh, this bag?  
  
**Illya：**  
I was given it when I bought some tomato juice.  
Some kind of offering to me, I suppose.  
  
**Illya：**  
I must say, I approve. A fine attitude indeed.  
Now, let me inspect the contents.  
  
**Illya：**  
Since you're here,  
we can open it together.  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmm... Whatever could this be?  
A \"facial roller\"? A tool to improve one's looks?  
  
**Illya：**  
Well, well...  
To offer such an item to the world's most beautiful woman...  
That shop attendant must have a death wish.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  He wants to enhance your beauty even further!  
**Choice: (2)**  I think you're more of the \"cute\" type.  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
Hmmm... I see, I see...  
 That would make sense.  
'Tis the way of the populace to hold the ruling class  
to impossible standards.  
  
**Illya：**  
But a true ruler must always rise to the challenge.  
This token will remind me of the people's wishes.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
C-cute, you say...?  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmph!  
Hardly an appropriate label for a noble ruler.  
  
**Illya：**  
S-still, I do value your words.  
Just this once, I will let it slide.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Illya：**  
Now then, what else could be in this bag...?  
  
**Illya：**  
What's this?  
A massage device for the hands?  
And this is... a \"handy portable humidifier\"?  
  
**Illya：**  
Most intriguing...  
All of these items are devices I have never seen before.  
  
**Illya：**  
This world has certainly grown full of conveniences  
during the many years I lay in slumber.  
  
**Illya：**  
Well then... That seems to cover all of the bag's contents.  
It was a most engaging diversion.  
 ...Hm?  
  
**Illya：**  
Actually, there seems to be one last item at the bottom.  
What could it be...?  
  
**Illya：**  
This is... a bracelet, I suppose?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  It's a watch.  
`Tag 4`  
**Illya：**  
Ah. The design seems male-oriented.  
I doubt it would suit me particularly well...  
  
**Illya：**  
Very well!  
I shall make this bracelet a present to you!  
  
**Illya：**  
D-don't misunderstand me!  
I do not mean anything special by it!  
  
**Illya：**  
It's just... Y-you know! A you-know-what!  
  
**Illya：**  
A small reward bestowed upon you  
for your loyal service to me!  
  
**Illya：**  
Sh-show some gratitude!  
  
**Illya：**  
And be sure to continue your faithful service!

**Ameth：**  
Looks like Illya is stuck as a child in that world too.  
The poor thing.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Although the return of an ancient vampire in that world  
would be quite the cause for concern, I suppose.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You know, in this world, I'm treated as something like a goddess.  
But Illya is a very unique entity beyond even my influence...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Although personally, I don't recall Illya ever appearing  
as anything but an attractive young woman...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh—what you just saw was a sort of dream that I created  
based on your memories and Illya's.  
Did it ring any bells? Well, I suppose it wouldn't yet.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Perhaps if you gather more of those scattered memories,  
I'll be able to show you more dreams.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Witnessing these dreams with all sorts of girls...  
That's your best bet at uncovering the truth of this world.  
So good luck!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, I'll see you around!  
  

---  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmm...?  
It would appear I was asleep...  
  
**Illya：**  
This is... Landosol, yes.  
To pass out in the middle of the street...  
My powers really must be failing me.  
  
**Illya：**  
I feel as though I had an unusual dream, too...  
  
**Illya：**  
What's that?  
You, too, dreamed of meeting me in some kind of shopping district?  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmm.  
A strange turn of events indeed.  
  
**Illya：**  
Ah well.  
Let's put this behind us and return to our search!  
  
**Illya：**  
Just like that dreamworld, this city is filled  
with all manner of things that are entirely new to me.  
  
**Illya：**  
If you see anything that could aid me in conquering the world,  
be sure to inform me.  
 Understood?  
  
**Narration：**  
Quickly forgetting about their unusual experience,  
{player} and Illya went right back to exploring the city.
