# Illya Episode 5
In an underground burial chamber brimming with magical energy, Illya is restored to her full power, but she returns to her childlike form as soon as she leaves it behind. She attempts to use her adult body to seduce {player}, but her wiles have no effect, and she only ends up frustrating herself.

**Narration：**  
Today, Illya and {player} have come to investigate  
a certain cave.  
  
**Illya：**  
Hahahah...  
Rejoice, my faithful minion!  
I have finally uncovered it!  
  
**Illya：**  
You see, this is no mere cave.  
It is an ancient system of catacombs  
in which the souls of great heroes lie at rest.  
  
**Illya：**  
Those who set foot in its depths are said to absorb the souls' energy,  
amplifying their own magical power!  
  
**Illya：**  
In other words!  
This place is my ticket to restoring my true form once and for all!  
  
**Illya：**  
W-well, you are not wrong. It is but a rumor.  
Still, it is worth investigating, would you not say?  
  
**Illya：**  
Now, let us go forth, {player}!  
Today is the day I will be restored to my glory!  
  
**Illya：**  
These tunnels certainly are extensive.  
It's tiring to traverse them with these small legs...  
  
**Illya：**  
{player}, I grant you permission to carry me.  
So come and—  
 Hmm?  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRRRRRAAAAGGHHH!  
  
**Illya：**  
Monsters, hm?  
Well, they may be great in number...  
but beasts of this level are no match for me.  
  
**Illya：**  
I will dispose of them in the space of a mere instant.  
Taste the unparalleled power of the Ruler of the Night!  
  
**Illya：**  
Urghhh... I thought things might be different in these catacombs,  
but it seems I still can't defeat monsters in this form...  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOOGGHHH!  
  
**Illya：**  
In fact, my attacks seem to have angered them further...  
{player}, we should run!  
  
**Illya：**  
I-I grant you special permission to carry my noble self!  
So come, grab me and flee this place!  
  
**Illya：**  
A narrow escape, but an escape nonetheless...  
No less from my most faithful minion.  
  
**Illya：**  
I trust you will maintain this level of service  
and protect me from all danger.  
  
**Illya：**  
Now then, let us make our way—  
Oh,  
it would appear that is not necessary.  
  
**Illya：**  
Why is that, you ask?  
{player}, take a look at our surroundings.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are those... s-skeletons?!  
**Choice: (2)**  Our surroundings?  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
Indeed.  
I suspect these are the ancient heroes preserved in this tomb.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
Take a closer look.  
We are surrounded by pale skeletons of the fallen.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Illya：**  
I would venture a guess that we have reached the innermost chamber.  
  
**Illya：**  
Let me see if I can claim the power of these great souls...  
Hmm?  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRRRRRAAAAGGHHH!  
  
**Illya：**  
Still they pursue us?  
 Such irritating persistence...  
  
**Illya：**  
They have even blocked our sole course of escape.  
Battle is our only option.  
  
**Illya：**  
If only I could restore my true form,  
then such lowly beasts would be no match for my strength...  
...Very well, I see what I must do!  
  
**Illya：**  
Souls that slumber in these catacombs...  
Hear the call of Illya Ornstein!  
Ruler of the Night!  
  
**Illya：**  
Surrender your strength to fuel my power!  
  

---  
  
**Illya：**  
Heheheh... Hahahahahah!  
My true form is mine once more!  
It seems the rumors were true!  
  
**Illya：**  
With my true powers restored, I have nothing to fear from you beasts!  
Your ashes will stain these walls!  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRUOOOOOGGGHHH!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hahahah...  
This strength is the selfsame power I wielded  
long ago in my prime!  
  
**Illya：**  
The time has come to conquer this world!  
Come, my minion! Carnage and glory await!  
  

---  
  
**Illya：**  
First, we must leave this cave and head to the nearest town—  
  
**Illya：**  
Wha—?!  
I am reduced to a child yet again?!  
As soon as I left the hidden tomb...  
  
**Illya：**  
C-could it be I can only recover my true self in that one spot?!  
  
**Illya：**  
What use is that to anyone?!  
{player}! Let us leave this worthless place and—  
  
**Illya：**  
N-no... Hold on one moment.  
Let us return to the depths of the cave first.  
  

---  
  
**Illya：**  
Good... my old form is restored once more.  
Now, my sworn minion.  
Do you have anything to say to me?  
  
**Illya：**  
Behold this chest... these hips... and this face.  
Well? Am I not beautiful?  
  
**Illya：**  
I greatly appreciate the work you do for me.  
So I would not be averse to granting your desires in return.  
What say you?  
  

---  
  
**Illya：**  
Wh-what do I mean, you ask?  
Can it be you do not understand what I am offering?  
This form brings certain desires to mind, does it not?!  
  
**Illya：**  
H-have you no appreciation for my heartfelt offer...?!  
{player}, I must teach you some respect!  
  
**Narration：**  
For some reason, {player} found himself subjected  
to a lecture on various difficult subjects...
