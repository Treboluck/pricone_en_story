**Illya：**  
There you are. For what reason did you summon me so very suddenly?  
...N-no, I did not come as fast as I could out of excitement!  
As your overlord, it would be wrong to keep a minion waiting, that's all!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Happy birthday!  
**Choice: (2)**  Why do you think I summoned you?  
**Choice: (3)**  Just hug her.

**Illya：**  
Ah!  
 You remembered the day of my birth. A fine effort indeed!  
So you have begun to learn how to behave  
as one who serves the Ruler of the Night.  
  
**Illya：**  
Hahah, what a strange feeling.  
I had grown tired of such celebrations many years ago,  
but when I see your enthusiasm, it awakens new joy within me.

Hmm, answering a question with a question?  
Very well, I will solve the riddle you have posed!  
If this business of yours cannot wait for another day, then...  
 hmmm...  
  
  
**Illya：**  
Could it be that you wish to celebrate my birthday?  
Ah, my instincts fail me not!  
 Hahah. To think you'd make me  
deduce it myself. Does the prospect embarrass you, perhaps?

**Illya：**  
Waaahhhh?!  
 Wh-what's this all of a sudden?!  
H-h-h-have you finally decided to consummate our bond  
as mistress and blood-sworn servant?!  
  
**Illya：**  
...That was a hug to celebrate my birthday?  
H-how dreadfully misleading! At least try to make your intentions clear!  
Not to say that I... *disliked* it, of course.  
 W-well, no matter.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Illya：**  
If you desire so strongly to celebrate my birth, then so be it!  
Come, show me your finest efforts at entertainment! Let us begin!
