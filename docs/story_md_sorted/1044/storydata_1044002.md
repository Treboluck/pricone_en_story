**Illya：**  
There you are, my minion!  
Come with me—I require your services today!  
  
**Illya：**  
The truth is... since our fateful meeting,  
I have not been able to assume my true form.  
  
**Illya：**  
It is of course my wish to regain my original powers  
as soon as I possibly can...  
  
**Illya：**  
But what must I do to restore my true body?  
You were there when it happened!  
If you noticed anything at all, speak your mind!  
  
**Illya：**  
Nothing in particular?  
I see... How very vexing.  
At this rate, my powers remain out of reach...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Pat her on the head.  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
H-hey!  
I told you before—don't treat me like a child!  
Honestly...  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmm? Wh-what's this?  
I feel something deep within my body...  
  
**Illya：**  
Whoaaa!  
My true form is restored?!  
  
**Illya：**  
I know not how you did it, but good work, my fine minion!  
  
**Illya：**  
Now! With my true powers finally unleashed,  
the world will bow before—  
  
**Illya：**  
...  
  
**Illya：**  
Whyyyyy?!  
  
**Illya：**  
This is exactly the same as before!  
Why must it last for mere seconds?!  
Not to mention, it's still unclear what caused—  
  
**Illya：**  
Ahhh! C-could it be...?  
  
**Illya：**  
My minion!  
I require you to pat my head one more time!  
Come now, do it at once!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Pat her on the head.  
`Tag 2`

**Illya：**  
Y-yes... Very good.  
Please continue in that manner.

**Illya：**  
Hahahahah! Power is flooding through me!  
  
**Illya：**  
I knew it!  
Though I know not the reason why,  
it seems contact with you restores my true form!  
  
**Illya：**  
In which case, all I need do is continue to touch you!  
What could be more simple?!  
  
**Illya：**  
Curses! I have returned again already?!  
W-we must touch for longer!  
I know! You must embrace me!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Hug her from in front.  
**Choice: (4)**  Hug her from behind.  
`Tag 3`  
**Illya：**  
Th-that's too close!  
You're right up in my face!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Illya：**  
Wh-why must you circle behind me?!  
This is... how to say... an oddly embarrassing position...  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Illya：**  
My true form has returned?!  
Excellent! As long as I have you, I can assume this form as I wish!  
  
**Illya：**  
H-however...  
It will not be easy to do battle  
while locked in this embrace.  
  
**Illya：**  
If I use my full power like this, it will blast you to pieces.  
That would quite defeat the purpose.  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmmmm...  
I suppose we should investigate further  
and find a different restoration method.  
  
**Illya：**  
I say this out of concern for you, my minion.  
Show a little gratitude!  
  
**Illya：**  
Besides which... this method...  
is not exactly good for my heart.  
  
**Illya：**  
What do I mean, you ask?  
Well, isn't it plainly obvious?  
When you touch me like this, my heart goes—  
  
**Illya：**  
Wait, what are you trying to make me say?!  
You are my minion!  Show some respect!  
A-at any rate, I'm vetoing this method!  
  
**Narration：**  
Unreasonably enough, {player} found himself  
on the receiving end of Illya's embarrassed fury...
