## Subtitle: An Inglorious End?
  
**Narration：**  
One day, when {player} and Illya are resting in the plaza,  
they find themselves surrounded by a glowing light.  
  
**Illya：**  
Aaagh, what's this?!  
Not this light again!  
  
**Illya：**  
Nghh...!  
Wh-why does this happen to us?!  
  

---  
  
**Illya：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
Urghh... I can go... no further...  
  
**Illya：**  
To think the sun's radiance would grow so strong...  
Even with this hat to shade me, it saps all of my strength...  
  
**Illya：**  
All I wanted was to buy some tomato juice...  
But I fear... this is the end...  
  
**Illya：**  
I would at least have liked to drink from a lively young man's neck  
at the very end...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hang in there!  
**Choice: (2)**  Offer your neck.  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
M-mrghh!  
W-wait a minute, mortal!  
Don't shake me so wildly!  
  
**Illya：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
Now you've wasted even more of my energy!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
Oh...? You would offer your neck up to me?  
My, my... a fine attitude indeed.  
Well then, don't mind if I do...  
  
**Illya：**  
*munch*...!  
 *munch*... *munch*..  
  
**Illya：**  
It's no use. I have not even the energy  
to pierce through a mortal's skin...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Illya：**  
If only my tomato juice reserves had not run out,  
it would never have come to this...  
  
**Illya：**  
Hm?  
What's that in your plastic shopping bag? Could it be?!  
  
**Illya：**  
I-is that tomato juice I spy?!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hand it over!  
Give me that tomato juice at once!  
  
**Illya：**  
...*gulp*  
*gulp*... *gulp*... Ahhhh!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hah... Hahahahah... Ahahahahah!  
I am reborn!  
  
**Illya：**  
Right now, my body is brimming with such strength,  
I could conquer the world in a day!  
  
**Dog：**  
Woof woof!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hm? Oh... It's just a dog.  
Well, I am in a good mood right now.  
Filthy though you may be, mutt, I will permit you to approach me!  
  
**Dog：**  
*whine*  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmm?  
What is the meaning of those puppy-dog eyes?  
  
**Illya：**  
Ah... It would appear you crave this tomato juice  
I hold in my hands.  
  
**Illya：**  
A lowly being such as yourself, coveting my possessions...  
I will not surrender this juice!  
  
**Dog：**  
*whine*  
  
**Illya：**  
D-don't... don't gaze at me like that!  
Th-this tomato juice belongs to me, so...  
  
**Illya：**  
Ngh... So be it, then.  
Just this once! This won't happen again!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You're pretty kind, huh...  
`Tag 4`  
**Illya：**  
What?!  
Me, of all people? Kind?  
  
**Illya：**  
S-spare me your nonsense!  
I am the woman who will one day conquer this world!  
Kindness is not in my nature!  
  
**Illya：**  
I-if you dare to demean me with such words again,  
I will execute you where you stand!

**Illya：**  
Very good... I see you are aptly repentant.  
In that case, by way of apology, you may serve as my attendant  
for the remainder of the day!  
  
**Illya：**  
For starters, let's see... I require sustenance!  
  
**Illya：**  
Take me to the most delicious restaurant in town!  
  

---  
  
`image display end`  
**Illya：**  
{player}... What exactly is this place?  
  
**Illya：**  
\"All-You-Can-Eat Extra Garlic Gyoza\"  
is what the sign seems to say...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Head into the restaurant.  
`Tag 5`  
**Illya：**  
Nguaaahhhh!  
Wh-what is this stench?!  
  
**Illya：**  
I can't stand the smell of garlic!!!  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Really... You thought you'd treat Illya, the vampire,  
to a meal full of garlic?  
  
**Ameth：**  
To begin with, a restaurant specializing in garlic  
is hardly a place to take a lady. Honestly.  
  
**Ameth：**  
All of that was a dream I created from your memories and Illya's.  
It was interesting how you handled it this time.  
I had a lot of fun watching!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, I'll see you around!  
  

---  
  
**Illya：**  
Anything but the garlic...!  
...Hmm?  
  
**Illya：**  
Was I asleep and dreaming again?  
What a strange dream it was, too...  
  
**Illya：**  
Hahaha.  
And even in my dream you acted as my servant...  
Now that's true loyalty.  
  
**Illya：**  
What? You just had the same dream, did you?  
  
**Illya：**  
Well, that makes things easy! Let's pick up where we left off!  
  
**Illya：**  
You're going to take me to the most delicious restaurant in town!  
O-one without garlic, of course!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so, just like in the dream, {player} and Illya  
set out to have a hearty meal.
