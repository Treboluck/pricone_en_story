**Narration：**  
Deep in Brisa Canyon, a young girl faces down a pack of monsters.  
  
**???：**  
Hahahahah!  
You beasts have some nerve defying *me!*  
  
**???：**  
Allow me to show you a small taste of my power.  
  
**???：**  
Beg and plead as you will, it is too late now!  
Your fate is sealed!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOOGGHHH!  
  
**???：**  
Hm?! It had no effect whatsoever?!  
  
**???：**  
Urghh... Alas...  
To think my powers have faded to such an extent...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are you OK?!  
`Tag 1`  
**???：**  
You are... who, exactly?  
No, it matters not.  
It is dangerous for you to be here.  
  
**???：**  
Ahh... Where are you trying to carry me off to?!  
  
**???：**  
You mean to help me flee this danger?  
I... I see. Expending your efforts in my service...  
  
**???：**  
So be it!  
I entrust my fate into your hands for now!  
  
**???：**  
It would appear the danger is now past.  
  
**???：**  
Your swift actions proved to be my salvation.  
Young man, what is your name?  
  
**???：**  
I see... {player}, is it?  
You have done well.  
  
**Illya：**  
I am she who rules over the night, Illya Ornstein!  
In recognition of your deeds, I shall make you my personal minion!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  'Tis an honor, dark mistress!  
**Choice: (3)**  Um, no thanks.  
`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
Very good. A fine response!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Illya：**  
Excuse me?!  
  
**Illya：**  
In the old days, an offer of minionship was enough  
to make even the proudest of nobles weep tears of joy!  
  
**Illya：**  
At any rate, I have made my decision!  
It is not your place to refuse!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Illya：**  
You are officially a minion of mine now!  
It is your duty to aid me from this day forth!  
  
**Illya：**  
Still... a new minion is a fine thing,  
but the problem at hand remains unsolved.  
  
**Illya：**  
How could I allow my magical energies to sink so far?  
  
**Illya：**  
With the powers I possessed of old, I could have  
turned such monsters to dust with a flick of my finger...

**Illya：**  
Hmm? Wh-why are you patting my head, of all things?!  
  
**Illya：**  
Cheer up, you say?  
D-do not treat me like a child!  
  
**Illya：**  
To lay hands upon my noble head  
is an honor I have bestowed upon no other!

**Illya：**  
Wh-what's this?!  
I have returned to my true form?!  
  
**Illya：**  
How can this be?  
All my attempts to restore my old body ended in failure...  
  
**Illya：**  
S-still! Though the reason is unclear,  
if my true form is restored to me, I have naught left to fear!  
From now on—  
  
**Illya：**  
Aaghh! I am a child once more?!  
  
**Illya：**  
Nghh... What can this mean?  
  
**Illya：**  
First you pat me upon the head,  
then I suddenly regain my queenly stature...  
  
**Illya：**  
Could it be... you triggered this change somehow?  
If that's the case...  
 Hmm?  
  
**Illya：**  
On closer inspection, your face...  
I feel I have seen it somewhere before...  
Alas, it's no use. I cannot remember.  
  
**Illya：**  
At any rate, it seems to me that you most likely hold the key  
to recovering my true self.  
  
**Illya：**  
Which would mean... if I consume your blood,  
perhaps I will be restored for good...  
  
**Illya：**  
...  
  
**Illya：**  
{player}! Offer up your lifeblood to your mistress!  
  
**Narration：**  
That day, Illya chased {player} around  
until they were both exhausted.
