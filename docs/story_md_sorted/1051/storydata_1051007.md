## Subtitle: The Scent of Attraction
  
**Narration：**  
{player} and Mitsuki arrive at a dark forest.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Right this way. Just a little further in, and we should be able  
to see our destination.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
We're after a plant for my perfumes, but I need a lot of it.  
Having you along will be a huge help.  
And that's not all...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Just the two of us in a dark forest...  
No one around to see us... Whatever happens is our secret.  
Doesn't this situation excite you a little?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
...I'm just teasing!  
I'm grateful for your help, really. I won't try anything funny.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
...As long as you don't.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Right now, I'm wearing a perfume imbued with that  
pheromone magic that we tested the other day.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I need to test if it's still potent in this form...  
And what better test subject  
 than my lovely assistant?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Hey, do you notice anything different about me today?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Not particularly...? Hmm, maybe this isn't enough.  
I'm sure a little more perfume will do the trick!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Hm? Oh, it's nothing. More importantly...  
  
**Monster：**  
GGGRRRUOOHHHHH!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
A few monsters have been creeping towards us.  
Honestly, just when the mood was getting good.  
I wish they wouldn't interfere...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Can't they sense that they're weaker than their opponent?  
I feel sorry for these stupid things.  
  
**Monster：**  
RRRRGHHHHHH!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
There's another one.  
Ever so sorry, but this is really no time for—  
  
**Monster：**  
GGGRRRRGHHHHH!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Goodness, they just keep coming, don't they?  
Also... Maybe it's just me, but it feels as though they're all  
making a beeline straight for me...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  So they don't care about me?  
**Choice: (2)**  Maybe they're courting you?  
`Tag 1`  
**Mitsuki：**  
They must not have any taste  
if they can't see your appeal.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Sorry, beasties, we don't have time for you.  
Goodbye!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Not the kind of affection I'm looking for.  
I have my sights set elsewhere...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Yes, this is an important moment for me.  
So you little nuisances need to get lost!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Really, those beasts... How dare they get in the way of  
my plans? I'm sure they just don't know any better,  
but the least they could do is have better timing!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Back on topic... Well?  
Do I perhaps seem more captivating to you today?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You were pretty cool back there.  
`Tag 4`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Ugh, no! I'm not talking about that!  
This is strange... You should be feeling the effects by now...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
...Hold on. These monsters' expressions...  
They actually look *happy* to have been pummeled.  
As if they're hardcore masochists...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I've never heard anything before about the monsters here  
having such odd tendencies...  
 Unless... Could this be...?!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
When I was making today's perfume,  
one of the failed variants had monster-attracting properties...  
Did I accidentally put on the wrong perfume?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
They smell the same, so I couldn't tell...  
No wonder there were so many monsters,  
even on our way to the forest.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
That said, this is an interesting effect in its own right.  
We've stumbled upon a useful byproduct.  
  
**Monster：**  
RRRRGHHHHHH!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Dear me, there's still this many left?  
This might be a bit rough, even for me.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Protect Mitsuki.  
`Tag 5`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Oh my... You want to protect me?  
Not the other way around?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Heheh, thank you.  
But you don't have to worry about me.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
In fact, I think this will make the perfect stress relief!  
Now then... Bring it on!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Oh please, you call that a scream?  
You can do better than that!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
That's a little better, I guess. Keep it up!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Much better! Now give me more!  
I want a hundred more out of you!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Looks like they've all run away.  
Can't they even handle a little discipline? How pathetic.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Okay, so maybe I went a bit overboard.  
But this way, the monsters won't soon forget what happened.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
They'll remember that pain, and the pleasure it brought them.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
So, how was it?  
Did you feel anything,  
watching me fight them off?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Not particularly.  
`Tag 6`  
**Mitsuki：**  
What a shame...  
You're a tough nut to crack, you know that?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Ah well, there'll be plenty of chances in the days to come!  
I'm not about to give up!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I wish you would.  
`Tag 7`  
**Mitsuki：**  
You really are stubborn. I'd love to keep going  
and test whether it's possible to awaken masochistic  
tendencies in humans as well...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
But I'll stop for today.  
Let's get back to picking flowers, shall we?  
  
**Narration：**  
From that day onward, those who entered the dark forest  
left with stories to tell about the monsters' strange behavior...
