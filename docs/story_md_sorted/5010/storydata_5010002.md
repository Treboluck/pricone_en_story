# One's Desire
As the crew begin their security work, they quickly learn that tonight is just one problem after another. Aid from the other visitors brings the current issues to a close, but a corporeal wish appears soon after. Working together, Hiyori and {player} are able to purify it.
  
## Subtitle: One's Desire
  
**Narration：**  
The crew watch as visitors toss their wish-transcribed paper  
into the bonfire.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh wow! Check it out, Rei!  
There's people lined up all the way outside the temple!  
  
**Rei：**  
I was still a child when I last came myself,  
so I never quite understood just how many other people there were.  
  
**Yui：**  
It makes sense when you think about how quiet the city itself is on  
New Year's Eve. More so with most of the stores closed.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I hear that pickpockets and bag snatchers can be a big problem, too.  
Purifying wishes is all well and good,  
but we gotta look out for everyone else too!  
  
**Rei：**  
Indeed.  
That said, Hiyori...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
One, two! Three, four! Five, six! Seven, eight!  
And again! One, two! Three, four! Five, six! Seven, eight!  
  
**Rei：**  
Hiyori.  
Can you hear me out for a minute?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hm? What's wrong?  
Oh! Did you spot someone in trouble!  
  
**Rei：**  
I didn't, no. Could you settle down a bit, please?  
All that vigor of yours is kind of putting me on edge...  
  
**Yui：**  
Hehe.  
I noticed you were a bit restless, Rei.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
But, but! I wanna be ready for anything!  
You never know when someone's gonna be in need of help!  
  
**Rei：**  
I mean. You're not wrong, but...  
  
**Child's Voice：**  
Waaaaaahhhhhh!  
Mommy! Daddy!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Did you hear that?! There's a kid crying!  
We gotta help them!  
  
**Yui：**  
Ah! Hiyori!  
  
**Rei：**  
Let's follow suit!  
There's every chance that someone's wish has already become corporeal!  
  
**Yui：**  
Hiyori! Where are you?  
  
**Rei：**  
Hiyori! Answer us!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yui, Rei! Mr. Knight!  
Over here! I found him!  
  
**Boy：**  
Papa... Mama... *sob*  
  
**Rei：**  
Oh...  
Just a regular lost child, I see.  
  
**Yui：**  
Hopefully we can find his parents nice and quick...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Don't worry!  
I'll go find them!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Um. Excuse me. Do you work here?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Sure do!  
  
**Young Man：**  
Are you the shrine maidens around here?  
Sorry, but did any lost goods get delivered here?  
My girlfriend lost her good luck charm.  
  
**Rei：**  
We haven't heard anything about lost goods.  
Also, we're not shrine mai—  
  
**Young Man：**  
Well that's not good... We bought matching ones for for each other,  
so I'd rather not give up on it. It has to be around here somewhere...  
  
**Rei：**  
Okay. Let me help you out.  
You handle things here, Hiyori.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Got it!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Ummm...  
  
**Yui：**  
I'll take care of her, Hiyori.  
You deal with the child.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Thanks!  
Okay, kid! Let's go find your parents!  
  
**Man：**  
Ah, here we go!  
You're one of the shrine maidens, right?  
I kinda got  
separated from my buds, so would you mind lending me a hand?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I'm, uh, kind of not a shri—  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Huh? Wait a minute.  
I might not be able to help anyone out at this rate!  
  
**Man：**  
Please help me out.  
Just for a little bit!  
  
**Boy：**  
Miss...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ahhh! Don't worry!  
I'll find your parents for you!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Th-this is bad, Mr. Knight!  
Too many people with too many issues!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Then let's work together with everyone else.  
`Tag 1`  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh! Yeah, that sounds good!  
Great idea!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Excuse me, everyone! I have a favor to ask!  
If you notice anyone in trouble, please help them out!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Mister!  
Could you keep an eye on this little boy for me?  
  
**Man：**  
Sure thing.  
What's wrong, squirt? You lost?  
  
**Boy：**  
Yeah...  
Are you lost as well?  
  
**Man：**  
Funnily enough, I am.  
I came here with my buds, but got separated from them.  
Pretty dumb of me, right?  
  
**Boy：**  
Hehehe...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Now's our chance, Hiyori.  
`Tag 3`  
**Hiyori：**  
Got it!  
First we'll find the parents, then we'll find the guy's friends!  
Let's do this!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Excuse me!  
Are there any parents searching for a lost child?!  
  
**Boy's Father：**  
Thank you so, so much.  
  
**Boy's Mother：**  
We can't express our gratitude enough...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Don't worry about it!  
I'm always willing to lend a hand to anyone in trouble!  
  
**Boy：**  
Thanks so much, miss!  
  
**Man：**  
Sorry, missy. This kid ended up helping me find my buds.  
Thanks for looking, though! See ya!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, he managed to find his friends?  
Thank goodness!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Nice job, Hiyori.  
`Tag 5`  
**Hiyori：**  
You too!  
That advice of yours really helped!  
  
**Girl's Voice：**  
Papa... Mama...  
Where are you...?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Did you hear that?! It must be another lost child!  
Let's get going, quick!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I'm pretty sure the voice came from around here...  
  
**???：**  
I'm so lonely!  
I wanna see my mama and papa!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Whaaaaaa?! That's not a person, right?!  
Is it one of those corporeal wishes that the priest talked about?  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
Papa... Mama...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
This is all based off of someone's unfulfilled wish, right?  
Hey! Are your parents here, by any chance?  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
I don't wanna live apart...  
I'm so lonely...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hm...  
There's no telling where they are at this rate...  
I'm kind of stumped here.  
  
**Yui：**  
Hiyori! Mr. Knight!  
Are you okay? You're not hurt, right?  
  
**Rei：**  
So this is what happens when a wish materializes...  
We're going to have to do something about it.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yui! Rei!  
It's saying that it wants to see its parents again...  
  
**Rei：**  
Its parents...  
They wouldn't happen to be around here, would they?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Seems like they're living apart, so I don't think so.  
Hey, Mr. Knight. Do you have any other good ideas?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Let's become its parents.  
`Tag 7`  
**Hiyori：**  
Us?!  
But, uh, how do we even do that...?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
No, this isn't the time for hesitation!  
I gotta do everything I can!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Mr. Knight!  
Let's become parents!  
  
**Yui：**  
U-um. Does that mean what I think it does?  
  
**Rei：**  
Yui. It absolutely does not mean what you think it does.  
I hope.  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
I wanna go home...  
Mama... Papa...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Poor little thing. Don't worry. We'll grant your wish!  
You ready, Mr. Knight? One, two, three!

**Hiyori：**  
Your mama's right here, son!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Your papa's right here, son!  
**Choice: (10)**  You winning, son?  
`Tag 9`  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
Papa! Mama!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Woo! It thinks we're its real parents!  
Good stuff, Mr. Kni—  
Papa!  
  
Jump to tag 11  
`Tag 10`  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
Papa...? Is that you?  
Really...?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Y-you betcha it is!  
Your mama and papa are right here!  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
Ahhh! Mama! It's really you!  
  
`Tag 11`  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight and Hiyori...  
Papa and Mama...  
  
**Rei：**  
Let me stress this, Yui.  
They're playing pretend.  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh?  
O-oh you, Rei.  
You say that like I'm taking it seriously!  
  
**Rei：**  
And you say that like you're not.  
But let's just keep that to myself for now.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey. Is there something you'd like to tell us?  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
I'm so sorry for running away from home after we fought.  
I want to go back and say sorry. I really do.  
But I'm too scared!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It's okay.  
Believe in us. We'll always be waiting for you.

`image display end`  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
Really?! Okay!  
Thank you! I love you both!  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
I was really, really homesick.  
But I'll give it my best, just for a bit longer—  
  

---  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It disappeared.  
Does that mean we purified it?  
  
**Rei：**  
Seems like it, at least.  
That was a stellar effort, you two.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
*sigh*  
I'm so glad we managed it before things took a turn for the worse.  
  
**Yui：**  
I feel bad for the child behind that wish.  
Do you think he'll be able to see his parents?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
No doubt about it!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That aside.  
Me and Mr. Knight as a wedded couple, huh?  
  
**Choice: (12)**  What's wrong, oh wife of mine?  
`Tag 12`  
**Hiyori：**  
Pffft. Ahahaha!  
Thanks, Mr. Knight!  
But don't worry about it!  
No need to play the dad role anymore, so let's go back to normal.  
  
**Yui：**  
Sure wish that were me...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yui?  
We can switch up if you want.  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh?! I, uhhh, errr...!  
I-it's fine! I'm good!  
  
**Rei：**  
*sigh*  
We're in for a wild ride this time, aren't we?
