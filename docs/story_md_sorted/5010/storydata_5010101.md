# New Year's Day Twinkle Crisis! Preview
As New Year's Eve approaches, the Twinkle Wish trio accept one final request to close out the year. They take to town to prepare for it, only to find a surprise waiting for them…
  
**Hiyori：**  
Can't believe the year's almost over!  
  
**Yui：**  
It kind of flew right by, didn't it?  
  
**Rei：**  
That just goes to show how focused we've been.  
The busier you are, the faster time goes.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It's gonna be next year in no time at this rate then!  
  
**Yui：**  
Yeah...  
But it'd be a waste if we didn't close this year out  
without making some final memories together.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Now that sounds good!  
Let's find something the three of us can do together!  
  
**Rei：**  
Agreed. Let's pay a visit to Karin first, then.  
She might have some suitable work for us.  
  
**Yui：**  
Sounds good! Let's get going!

Hopefully we can do something New Years Eve-ish!
