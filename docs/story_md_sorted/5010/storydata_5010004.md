# Desperate Times
The party are faced with a wish that wants to be cheered up. Rei casts her shame away and takes a page out of Hiyori's book to give it her all, but as their personalities differ so much, the wish opts to disappear in spite of not being entirely satisfied. Needless to say, Rei is left furious.
  
## Subtitle: Desperate Times
  
**Narration：**  
More and more visitors make their way to the temple  
as New Year's Eve slowly draws to a close,  
leaving the party busier than ever.  
  
**Woman：**  
Excuse me, miss.  
Could you bring me a drink, please?  
  
**Youngster：**  
Could you bring us two drinks after that, then?  
  
**Yui：**  
Of course!  
I'll go get them for you right away!  
  
**Yui：**  
So much for security!  
We're just helping out with general errands now!  
  
**Boy：**  
Excuse me! Is there somewhere I can write down my wish?  
I kind of forgot to do it earlier.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
The temple has a place specifically for that, so don't worry!  
  
**Boy：**  
Really?  
Thank you!  
  
**Youngster：**  
You're one of the security folk, right?  
Thought I should tell you that someone had their wallet stolen.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Really?!  
Okay, I'll be right there!  
I can't believe someone would do that at this time of the year.  
They're gonna get a big slap on the butt!  
  
**Rei：**  
Oh, here you are.  
Yui and Hiyori are...  
still out helping others, I see.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  How are you faring?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rei：**  
I finally cleared my load up there, so it's about time I get back to  
security duty.  
Who knows when another wish will show up.  
  
**Rei：**  
Would you mind joining me?  
It'll be reassuring knowing there's two of us.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Can't say I'll be that much help.  
`Tag 3`  
**Rei：**  
Come now. I'm more than willing to rely on you these days,  
so don't put yourself down like that.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Sorry.  
`Tag 5`  
**Rei：**  
No worries.  
So long as you understand.  
Now then. Let's do some patrolling, shall we?  
  
**Rei：**  
It's as busy as usual,  
but nothing seems out of the ordinary.  
  
**Woman's Voice：**  
What's the deal here?!  
What is this thing?!  
  
**Rei：**  
Did another wish appear?  
Let's hurry!  
  
**Man：**  
Take this! Hiyahhh!  
What the?! My strikes won't connect with it!  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
I just wanted one...  
I just wanted one...  
  
**Rei：**  
Security here!  
Leave the rest to us and get away from here!  
  
**Man：**  
You're in charge of security this year, huh?  
Sorry! It's in your hands!  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
I just wanted one...  
  
**Rei：**  
It has a much clearer form and color than the ones before it.  
Be on guard. This might not go as smoothly as it has so far.  
  
**Rei：**  
What is it that you wanted?  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
A... job...  
I just wanted... a job... before the year ended...  
  
**Rei：**  
A job seeker, is it?  
I'm not quite sure how we should go about purifying this one.  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
I want... a job...  
Why can't I... find one...?  
  
**Rei：**  
We can't just go find a job for it, either...  
I'm stumped here...  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
Someone...  
Cheer me up...  
  
**Rei：**  
N-now it wants to be cheered up?  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
Cheer me up!  
Pep talk!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  We should do just that.  
`Tag 7`  
**Rei：**  
I see.  
Helping to reframe its state of mind may do the trick, so let's try that.  
  
**Rei：**  
Hiyori's a much better fit for this than me,  
but I'll give it my best shot.  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
Work...  
  
**Rei：**  
Um...  
Cheer up!  
Next year'll be a great year!  
I'm sure you'll find a job soon!  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Well that didn't work.  
`Tag 9`  
**Rei：**  
Urgh...  
Where did I go wrong?  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
Cheer me up... more...  
  
**Rei：**  
More?  
Is there anything else I can even say?  
Or was I just not saying the right things in the first place?  
  
**Rei：**  
Argh! I don't have a clue...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Don't give in, Rei!  
  
**Rei：**  
Hiyori! Yui!  
I didn't think you'd come!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Of course we would! And I just know you can do it!  
Come on! Believe in yourself and go for it!  
  
**Yui：**  
I'm rooting for you, too!  
It might be tough, but don't give in!  
  
**Rei：**  
Hiyori, Yui...  
Thanks.  
That's all I need to help me pull through.  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
I'm feeling... all cheered up!  
I can do it! I can find a job!  
  
**Rei：**  
It reacted more to them than it did to me...  
  
**Rei：**  
But I can see why. They completely outdid me.  
  
**Rei：**  
...Fine.  
Challenge accepted!  
  
**Choice: (11)**  I know you can do it!  
`Tag 11`  
**Rei：**  
Thanks.  
You're always helping me press forward.  
  
**Rei：**  
*inhale* *exhale*  
Here I go! I'm going to tickle you pink!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ohhh! Finally!  
  
**Yui：**  
She's all serious now!  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
I'm feeling... cheery!

**Rei：**  
S-stay strong! I-I just know good things are waiting for you!  
So please don't give in!  
  
**Rei：**  
Push forward towards a brilliant future!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...  
  
**Yui：**  
...  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
...  
  
**Rei：**  
...  
  
**Yui：**  
Good stuff, Rei!  
You tried your best!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That was great!  
I could tell just how committed you were to that!  
  
**Rei：**  
Thanks, Hiyori!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Also. I could swear you sounded a bit like me there.  
Just kidding!  
  
![501000402.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/501000402.webp)  
**Rei：**  
?!  
  
**Rei：**  
My cover's blown!  
Ahhh! This is too embarrassing!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Huh?! Is sounding like me [[that]] embarrassing?!  
  
**Rei：**  
I'm embarrassed that copying you was my only option!  
I'm begging you all. Don't look at me for a while.  
  
**Rei：**  
I can feel the shame washing over me!  
Argh! I never should have done that in the first place!

`image display end`  
**Yui：**  
Look! It's starting to shine!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Wow! You really managed to purify it, Rei!  
That's amazing!  
  
**Rei：**  
It really is...  
I assume what I did was enough, then?  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
I guess... that'll do...  
  

---  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...G-good stuff, Rei!  
  
**Yui：**  
...  
  
**Rei：**  
...  
  
**Rei：**  
Hehe. Hehehe.  
Hehehehe!  
  
**Rei：**  
You guess that'll do?!  
Then I guess I'll just slice you to pieces!  
Don't you dare disappear on me! Get back here!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yui! We gotta get her under control!  
  
**Yui：**  
R-  
right!  
Calm down, Rei!  
  
**Rei：**  
Let go of me! I'm perfectly calm!  
Calm enough to dice and mince that thing over and over!  
I swear I'll do it! I really will!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It's already long gone!  
  
**Rei：**  
There should still be traces of it!  
I'll carve right through it!  
  
**Yui：**  
M-Mr. Knight!  
Help us stop her!  
  
**Rei：**  
Grrrrrr!  
I'll never, ever copy someone else again!
