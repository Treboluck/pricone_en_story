**Rei：**  
Hey there.  
It's more than reassuring to have you fighting by my side.  
Let's give it our all.  
  
**Rei：**  
More so considering how tough our current opponent is.  
There's no doubt Hiyori and Yui feel the same way, too.  
  
**Rei：**  
Don't hesitate to rely on me after this, either.  
I'm more than willing to help out.  
  
**Rei：**  
Let's get going, then.  
The new year is on the line!
