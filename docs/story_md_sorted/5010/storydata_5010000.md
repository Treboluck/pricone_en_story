## Subtitle: A New Year's Promise
  
**Narration：**  
As the year comes to a close,  
{player} bumps into the  
Twinkle Wish trio while wandering around town.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh hey! It's Mr. Knight!  
Long time no see!  
How've you been?  
Actually, how's the Gourmet Guild been?  
How come you're alone today?  
  
**Rei：**  
Calm down, Hiyori.  
You can't just unload of a barrage of questions at once.  
That aside. You seem to be doing well.  
  
**Yui：**  
Hello, Mr. Knight.  
Um... It's been a while, hasn't it?  
Glad to see you're doing well.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It's almost New Year's Eve,  
so I take it you're out shopping as well?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Should I be?  
`Tag 1`  
**Hiyori：**  
You should! A lot of shops start closing around this time of the year,  
so it's always a good idea to stock up on a bunch of stuff!  
  
**Yui：**  
We bought a whole bunch.  
Enough to last us the entire holiday, even.  
  
**Rei：**  
We need some decorations for the guildhouse entrance as well,  
so we decided it'd be smarter to buy everything in one go.  
  
**Yui：**  
Rei and Hiyori'll be in charge of the decorations,  
and I'm in charge of making the osechi dishes.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Sounds like you're getting ready for a festival.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
It's not quite a...  
Oh. It's your amnesia, isn't it?  
  
**Rei：**  
You don't remember what New Year's entails, do you?  
Sorry. We were too focused on ourselves to notice.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...So basically, this'll be your first New Year's experience!  
You see, the year's actually about to end!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  What'll happen when it does?  
`Tag 3`  
**Yui：**  
It means a whole new year'll start.  
The year'll change, but don't worry.  
That doesn't mean the end of the world or anything.  
  
**Rei：**  
It's common for people to do big cleaning sessions. That acts  
as a way of ridding themselves of the impurities built up over  
the year.  
And on New Year's Eve, they visit shrines to pray.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
They say that something good'll happen if you're all cleansed before  
bringing in the new year! Other traditions are eating stuff  
like soba and mochi.  
Not to mention chestnut and sweet potato mash!  
  
**Yui：**  
Hehe.  
There's traditions other than food, Hiyori.  
  
**Rei：**  
Well yeah, but food's important. I'm really looking forward  
to your osechi dishes and what all the stalls'll be selling.  
Oh, speaking of which. There's the New Year's pocket money as well.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Pocket money, huh?  
`Tag 4`  
**Yui：**  
You give it to children who you want to have  
another healthy, fulfilling year. Think of it  
as regular pocket money,  
but with extra feeling put into it.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'd like to do that.  
`Tag 5`  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh? For us, maybe?  
  
**Rei：**  
That'd imply that he sees us as children, Hiyori.  
But I can guess who he wants to give it to.  
  
**Yui：**  
Kokkoro, I assume?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I owe her a lot.  
`Tag 6`  
**Yui：**  
Ahhh. I'm sure she'll really appreciate it!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh!  
Hey hey,  
would you mind joining us on New Year's Eve then?  
  
**Rei：**  
New Year's Eve...  
Oh. I see where this is going.  
Having you around would be a big help, so please do join us.  
  
**Yui：**  
Yeah.  
Nothing to worry about if he's there with us.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  What's happening on New Year's Eve?  
`Tag 7`  
**Hiyori：**  
Ehehe. That's a secret, my friend!  
Here, take this map.  
And don't forget to come, okay?  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus {player}'s New Year's Eve  
was booked by the Twinkle Wish trio.
