# New Year, New Wish
With their work now over, the crew write down their wish for the year on an ema and hang it up at the temple. As fate would have it, they all wish to stay together forever. They return to the guildhouse afterwards, falling into a peaceful slumber together.

**Priest：**  
That was quite the ordeal.  
More so than I ever anticipated.  
  
**Rei：**  
It really was.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Barely anyone got injured, though!  
And Yui healed up anyone that did in a jiffy!  
  
**Yui：**  
It was mostly scratches and bruises from when they were evacuating.  
The sort of stuff that heals up naturally,  
so technically I didn't do that much.  
  
**Priest：**  
All of the visitors were overjoyed with how you handled it.  
As for your recompense, allow me to add  
a little more on top of what we initially discussed.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Woo! Thanks a lot!  
  
**Rei：**  
We appreciate your generosity.  
  
**Priest：**  
Not at all. You all went above and beyond expectations today,  
so if anything, I wish I could do more.  
It would be an honor if you helped us out again this year.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
W-we'll think about it!  
  
**Rei：**  
What say we close the day out by hanging up our emas?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Now [[that]]'s what I'm talking about!  
There's something so exciting about hanging up an ema.  
  
**Yui：**  
Do you know what an ema is, Mr. Knight?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Nope.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
Well. They're wooden plaques that you write a wish for this year on,  
then hang them up at the temple.  
Here. This one's for you.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
You can actually write as many wishes as you want!  
  
**Yui：**  
Let's all come back when our wishes come true!  
Do you mind if I ask what you're wishing for,  
Mr. Knight?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I...  
`Tag 3`  
**Hiyori：**  
Looks like we're all done writing, so let's show each other!  
All together now! One, two...  
  
**Hiyori & Yui & Rei：**  
Three!  
  
**Ema：**  
\"I wish that we can all stay together forever.\"  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I'm back...  
Phew. Finally home.  
I'm absolutely knackered.  
  
**Rei：**  
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't exhausted, either.  
Hm? Where did the other two go?  
  
**Yui：**  
Zzz... Zzz...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
They sure passed out quick.  
*yawn* Guess I'll sleep as well.  
Right beside Yui...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Zzz... Zzz...  
  
**Rei：**  
I'm about at my limit, too...  
Good night...
