# Arrival on Elpis Island
Upon arriving at their base camp on the island, the Nightmare girls begin their investigation in earnest. Some unsettling words from Homare, the third of the dragongirls, put Tomo on edge. Meanwhile, Matsuri finds herself becoming more friendly with Kaya.
  
## Subtitle: Arrival on Elpis Island
  
**Narration：**  
After a long voyage, the crew weighs anchor at Elpis Island,  
setting up camp in a jungle region towards the island's south edge.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Phew... Even the brief trek here wasn't easy.  
This island's teeming with much stronger monsters than Astraea.  
Still, we should get down to investigating.  
  
**Tomo：**  
We've still only met two dragonfolk so far.  
I suspect the third is inside that carriage we brought along.  
  
**???：**  
Okay, listen closely, everyone~!  
Thank you all for ensuring our safe arrival!  
Let's all get some well-earned rest today!  
  
**Inori：**  
Aughh... Working us to the bone as always...  
Why did we even have to come to this monster-infested jungle?  
Can't you make the boss see sense, Kaya-P?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Monsters? They've all been pushovers so far.  
I just wish they put up more of a fight!  
  
**Inori：**  
Aughhh...  
I should have known all you care about is brawling...  
  
**Boss：**  
We might be in luck on that front~! ♪  
Or didn't either of you notice?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Notice... what, exactly?  
  
**Inori：**  
Wh-what's that creepy smile for?  
I-it's giving me a really bad feeling!  
  
**Boss：**  
Ahaha...  
 Strangely scratched rocks. Burn marks on trees.  
And, though a little faded, huge footprints.  
Seems like a fair amount of evidence, don't you think~? ♪  
  
**Kaya：**  
Then you think there's really one nearby?  
  
**Boss：**  
Maybe there is, maybe there isn't... ♪  
  
**Kaya：**  
Huh... Can't wait to meet it!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Sounds like they're on the hunt for something here...?  
But what could their target be?  
  
**Inori：**  
Why would we want to meet it?!  
And why are you two chuckling like sinister villains?!  
  
**Boss：**  
Now, now. We came all this way, so let's enjoy it~!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Heheh. I smell a challenge.  
 Right, Inori?!  
  
**Inori：**  
Are you a total idiot, Kaya-P?!  
That's just the smell of our future rotting corpses!  
Urghh... How did I end up in this guild?!  
  
**Boss：**  
Don't be like that.  
 Let's all work together~!  
To restore order to this broken world...  
 OK?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Broken... world?  
 What's she mean by that?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh boy... Talk like that about \"fixing a broken world\"  
tends to mean a dangerous group plotting some kind of high treason.  
This guild could be worse news than we anticipated.  
  
**Tomo：**  
We really must identify their objective and put a stop to it.  
Best to assume everyone here besides me, him and Matsuri is an enemy.  
And I can't put Matsuri in danger, so I have to handle this myself...  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
Inori! A little help over here!  
  
**Inori：**  
Oh, how hopeless can you be?  
Go on, step aside. ...Haahhh!  
  
**Tomo：**  
What was that voice?  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
Oh, thanks a bunch. This should do for lighting.  
You're so handy to have around, Inori.  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
Hey, can you help me burn the trash over here too?  
  
**Inori：**  
Oh, good grief.  
Can't any of you do a thing without my help?  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
All the wood around here's so damp.  
It really doesn't want to catch fire!  
  
**Inori：**  
You're really putting me through my... paces!  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
Ooh~! Thanks for tha—  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
Whoaaa?! What the...?!  
  
**Inori：**  
Peughh! Wh-what's going on?  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
That's our line, girl!  
 Did you blow too hard or what?  
You're gonna start a forest fire!  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
What's all this? Did Inori mess up big-time again?  
  
**Inori：**  
I-it wasn't my fault this time!  
If you're gonna be like that, do this yourselves!  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
Hey, hey, we're sorry.  
Everyone makes mistakes, so don't get your tail in a twist.  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
Yeah, sure! We won't tell the boss or nuthin'.  
  
**Inori：**  
O-oh, all right then!  
 What am I going to do with you people?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Above all else, we need intel.  
To find out what Dragons' Nest is really plotting.  
I guess we should start by targeting their weakest link...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Huh... Inori, was it?  
 You're certainly making the rounds.  
  
**Inori：**  
Ueghhh?! Y-you're...  
 that weird little brat's babysitter!  
Don't surprise me like that!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Just call me Tomo. Nice to meet you!  
  
**Inori：**  
What's with the creepy friendly attitude?  
I don't need a bodyguard, or whatever else you're selling!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahaha.  
 I suppose there's not much I could offer the fabled dragonfolk.  
  
**Inori：**  
If you don't need anything, don't talk to me.  
I'm a lot busier than I look.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh, I was just a little concerned.  
It looked like you were being taken advantage of.  
  
**Inori：**  
...I'm fully aware of that, thank you.  
I don't need an outsider like you to tell me.  
  
**Tomo：**  
...Interesting.  
 No, I'm sorry.  
I honestly didn't expect such a collected reaction.  
  
**Inori：**  
This is the only thing I can do right now, that's all.  
It's the only way for me to stay by Kaya-P and the boss's side.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Even if it might be a danger to the world?  
  
**Inori：**  
Hmph! Someone like you would never understand...  
How it feels to be a useless dragongirl  
who's only good for lighting fires!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ah...! ...She ran off.  
 How awkward. Why did I run my mouth off like that?  
Now I've made her more wary...  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'm worried about Matsuri, too...  
I'm sure she'll be OK as long as he's with her, but...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hm? There she is. Hey, Matsu—  
  
**Matsuri：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
 Heave... and... ho!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are you OK?  
`Tag 1`  
**Matsuri：**  
I-I'm just fine!  
 Fetching a little water won't wear me down!  
How're things over there with you? That's quite the pile of firewood...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm fine.  
`Tag 2`  
**Matsuri：**  
Gotta prove we can both pull our weight here, huh?  
All part of the mission...  
 wait, no,  
 of our training!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Even so, try not to push yourselves too hard.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wahh?! Suddenly it feels lighter...  
Wait. Kay— Miss Kaya...?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Go on, gimme that one too.  
I'll carry both.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I-I can handle this much myself!  
...What're you doing here, M... Miss Kaya?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Just work.  
 Patrolling and... overseeing.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Then should you really be doing this for me?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Didn't I say? It's work, all work.  
Like keeping an eye on a couple of bodyguards  
with unclear backgrounds...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Kidding. Nah, I'm just bored.  
C'mon, let's get this over with.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
She ended up doing half the job for me...  
Could Kaya actually be a pretty nice person...?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  She's super nice.  
**Choice: (4)**  She's a villain.  
`Tag 3`  
**Matsuri：**  
I knew it!  
Why's a girl like her working for a shady gang?!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Matsuri：**  
Urgh... She really is, huh?  
Can't believe I almost let her trick me!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Kaya：**  
Uh, you two. Should you be saying this stuff in front of me?  
  
**Tomo：**  
She's right, Matsuri.  
I hate to see you getting so buddy-buddy  
with members of another guild.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
W-wait, Tomo...?! When did you get here?  
And it's not like that at all!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Really...?  
So, ah...  
 Miss Kaya, was it?  
You seem to be taking good care of our Matsuri.  
  
**Kaya：**  
You're Tomo,  
 am I right?  
Could it be... you're picking a fight with me?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh, please... That's not my intention at all.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Well, dang. Shame.  
I thought a fight with you might be pretty fun.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Uwehhh?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Guess I'm done here, then.  
She's your apprentice, right?  
 Don't cause her too much trouble.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Urgh. Don't surprise me like that, Miss Kaya...  
  
**Tomo：**  
That attitude  
 might be what's really leading Matsuri astray...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Say what now?  
Whatever. I'm gonna go and take a nap.  
You guys should slack off too. When no one's watching, of course!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'd never dream of turning into a slacker!  
Right, Tomo?  
  
**Tomo：**  
I think she's just trying to encourage you  
not to push yourself too hard.  
She seems like a good person at heart.  
  
**Tomo：**  
On a personal level, she does seem genuinely friendly.  
But if Dragons' Nest and its guildmaster were to give the order...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Mmgh... But I can't slack off after she gave me all that help!  
I'm gonna go fetch some more water!  
  
**Tomo：**  
You OK? Shall I come too?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'll be fine! I can handle this alone!  
You just wait—I'll make it look easy like Miss Kaya does!  
You just focus on your own work, Tomo!  
  
**Tomo：**  
What a cruel rejection.  
Ahahaha...  
 *sigh*  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Something wrong?  
`Tag 6`  
**Tomo：**  
Oh, nothing.  
 Or so I'd like to say...  
Hmmm. I suppose I might be feeling a little bit jealous,  
seeing how fond Matsuri's getting of that Kaya girl.  
  
**Tomo：**  
All I can do right now is gather intel.  
That's the only way I'll keep him and Matsuri safe...  
  
**Tomo：**  
I did know handling this as smoothly as Jun  
 would be  
beyond my abilities, but it's still frustrating.  
  
**Tomo：**  
...Kidding.  
 Ahaha, forget I said that. It's just a joke.  
I should get back to work now.  
  
**Narration：**  
What could Dragons' Nest's true objective on Elpis Island be?  
With the mystery still unsolved, their days at the camp continued.
