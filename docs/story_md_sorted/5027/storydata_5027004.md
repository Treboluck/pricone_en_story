# The Price of Haste
The morning after the attack, the Dragons' Nest crew begin their search for the vanished assailant. Discovering that Tomo has already headed into the jungle to search alone, they set off to rescue her despite knowing her true agenda. Meanwhile, deep in the jungle, Tomo tracks down the attacker by following some unusual footprints.
  
## Subtitle: The Price of Haste
  
**Narration：**  
The morning following the appearance of the strange attacker  
who had set the camp on fire before vanishing into the night...  
The crew members waver between confusion and fevered excitement.  
  
**Narration：**  
In the midst of this turmoil,  
the dragongirls of Dragons' Nest alone remain strangely calm,  
as though they had foreseen the attack ahead of time.  
  
**Kaya：**  
And then it just vanished, huh. What did it even come here for, then?  
You're sure that fire wasn't yours, Inori?  
If you got spooked and let it slip out, you'd best 'fess up quick.  
  
**Inori：**  
Of course it wasn't me! That *thing* breathed those flames!  
And don't talk about my fire breath like I wet the bed or something!  
  
**Homare：**  
I do think we can trust Inori on this.  
The footprints in the cinders were just like the others we've found here.  
And what's more...  
  
**Kaya：**  
What's that weird stone for?  
  
**Inori：**  
It's got a messy drawing scribbled on it.  
Looks like... an apple? Or something?  
Even I could draw better than this!  
  
**Homare：**  
Whatever it is, it's not a natural occurrence, right?  
If this really is what we're all imagining...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Sounds like bingo. Then it's time to make our move.  
So...? How about you guys?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Waughh?! Th-they found me out?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
With all that snooping around, how could we not?  
You might think you're hiding, but it's not working.  
  
**Inori：**  
Huh, it's just Matsuri and him?  
Is that featherbrained bodyguard still asleep?  
  
**Homare：**  
This must mean...  
 Oh dear. She's one step ahead of us.  
Given the terrain, it's not hard to narrow down the big brute's location...  
But I confess I didn't think she'd have the nerve to go alone~!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Wait. She's gone into the jungle?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
N-no way!  
Did Tomo really leave me behind to search on her own?!  
  
**Inori：**  
Sheesh... What a pain in the behind!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Boss, there's no time for preparations. Let's head out now.  
  
**Homare：**  
Now? Do you know where you're going?  
Even if we deduce the general area, the jungle's a big place...  
  
**Inori：**  
Then hurry up and investigate!  
It can't be hard for you, boss!  
  
**Homare：**  
I *could* do that, but what merit is there for me?  
Besides, do you want to be in my debt?  
I thought you'd had quite enough of that already.  
  
**Inori：**  
Aurghhh... W-well...  
I-I'll make the idiot pay for her own stupid rescue!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Haha.  
 Guess you're more worried about her than you let on.  
  
**Inori：**  
O-o-o-of course I'm not worried!  
It'd just leave a bad taste if she got herself killed on my watch!  
  
**Kaya：**  
OK, OK. Sure thing.  
...C'mon, Matsuri. We'll get your friend back, so don't look so down.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I-I'm coming too!  
I can't just leave Tomo out there on her own!  
  
**Kaya：**  
D'you know what you're getting into?  
Worst case, we could come to blows with that fire-breathing beast.  
  
**Inori：**  
Yeah, what she said!  
We don't need brats holding us back!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Of course I'm scared...  
 But I've made my choice!  
This is my path of justice!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Talking to us about justice? Well, dang.  
... All right, then. But you'll have to protect your own ass.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Got it!  
Eheheh.  
 You're scary when you start brawling,  
but it's just like Tomo said. You're a kind person really!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh? You think so?  
Matsuri. I hope you aren't forgetting we're gangsters.  
Who's to say this isn't a ploy to scam you for all you're worth?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Urgh... If that's what it takes, you can have everything I've got!  
Just please don't let anything happen to Tomo!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Whoa, whoa, I'm kidding! Don't take it like that.  
  
**Inori：**  
I suppose we can let you come too, {player}!  
Hurry up and get ready!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Whew. I feel bad heading out without a word to Matsuri,  
but we're against the clock here.  
  
**Tomo：**  
This is the only way to get ahead of them.  
Haha. I'll have to give Matsuri a proper apology later.  
  
**Tomo：**  
The goal of those people who think this world is broken lies just ahead.  
Worst case, it could be some kind of weapon to endanger our nation.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I can't let them have that.  
Not as a knight of Nightmare.  
  
**Tomo：**  
This really is a tough trek, though...  
I've never slacked off on my training,  
but training can only take you so far...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Even so, I'm on the right trail.  
With that huge body, there are only so many routes it could take...  
  
**Tomo：**  
...Ah! I reached a clearing? But...  
What am I looking at here...?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Are these ruins...?  
 They certainly don't look natural...  
But I'm not sure they look man-made, either...  
The constituent parts are artificial, but something feels off here...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Still, I'm sure this must be what Dragons' Nest is looking for.  
  
**???：**  
MRRGUOOHHHH!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh, shoot! I was careless!  
 It's right in front of me?!  
  
**Narration：**  
As she ventured into the ruins where the beast had made its lair,  
Tomo found herself face to face with the strange dragon itself.
