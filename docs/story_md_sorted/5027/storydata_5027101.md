Tomo and Matsuri go undercover to investigate the guild Dragons' Nest, on a mission that takes them all the way to the uncharted Elpis Island!
  
**Matsuri：**  
On a special mission for Nightmare,  
me and Tomo go undercover to investigate a suspicious guild!  
Our destination:  
 the untamed jungle of Elpis Island!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Our targets are a trio of mysterious dragongirls.  
What could these gangsters be searching for on this uncharted island?  
  
**Inori：**  
Looks like a couple of weird brats  
ended up on the crew for our latest Dragons' Nest mission.  
Any idea why, Kaya-P?  
  
**Kaya：**  
How would I know that?  
 Though I hear they're friends of his.  
Anyway, what's the verdict, boss? Did we strike gold this time?  
  
**???：**  
Hard to say... but I do hope we find one.  
 A real dragon, that is! ☆
