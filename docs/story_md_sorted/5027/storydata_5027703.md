# Beyond the Battle…
With their furious contest behind them, the Pseudo-Dragon shows how far it has come by speaking Inori's name out loud... But that is only the beginning of another terrible conflict.
  
## Subtitle: Beyond the Battle...
  
**Narration：**  
Kaya and Inori's word-linking battle rages on fiercely...  
  
**Inori：**  
Y-you're not making this easy...  
  
**Kaya：**  
I'm impressed... you guys can take the heat...!  
  
**Draggo：**  
Mirogh... rhee...  
  
**Inori：**  
He spoke...? I think he just spoke!  
\"Inori,\" he said! I heard him say my name!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Uhh... I guess it did sound a *little* like that...?  
  
**Homare：**  
Hee hee.  
 You certainly have educated him well, Inori!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey, what about me? You know me too, right?  
  
**Draggo：**  
Grrumgrraighhh mrragrhhhrragggihh.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hm?  
  
**Draggo：**  
Grrumgrraighhh mrragrhhhrragggihh.  
  
**Homare：**  
I suppose Inori's name is still all he can say.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Are you sure he even said her name at all?  
Just sounds like a bunch of \"grr\"s and \"mrr\"s to me.  
  
**Inori：**  
Oh, you're so hopeless!  
Can't you tell he just said \"musclebrained battle addict\"?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Ohhh...?  
  
**Homare：**  
Hee hee. You really have educated him well, Inori! ☆  
  
**Inori：**  
Ah... I messed up...  
Hey! Draggo! Apologize, quick!  
Kaya-P's a big pushover really, so if you say sorry, it'll all be fine!  
  
**Draggo：**  
Graigh rorrighh.  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Oh, and you think I'm such a pushover  
I'll take that comment lying down?  
  
**Inori：**  
Ngh... At this point...  
It's time to run! Draggo, follow me!  
  
**Draggo：**  
Mrghhhhhhh!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hold it, you two!  
  
**Homare：**  
Hee hee. They're all such lovely friends~! ☆  
  
**Narration：**  
And the sounds of rowdy \"grr\"ing and \"mrr\"ing  
echoed throughout the wild jungle.
