## Subtitle: Lurker in the Jungle Ruins
  
**Narration：**  
Matsuri and the members of Dragons' Nest  
forge a path through the jungle in search of Tomo and the dragon.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Is this really the right way?  
  
**Homare：**  
Don't worry, we're on track~! ♪  
According to what I \"saw\" just now, at least. ☆  
  
**Inori：**  
The boss is never wrong about things like this.  
Kaya-P, did you find anything over there?  
  
**Kaya：**  
This is that stone tablet, right?  
If it's lying around here, that means...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Did that tree just shake?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Over there!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Tomo!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Wha—?! What are you doing here, Matsuri?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Now that's a dumb question.  
If anything, we oughtta be asking you.  
  
**Inori：**  
Running off on your own and getting cornered? Serves you right!  
  
**Tomo：**  
...  
Yes, you're right.  
I suppose I just wasn't able to handle this alone like you.  
My mission is a failure... I don't know how I can face Matsuri now...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You really did your best.  
**Choice: (2)**  Matsuri was worried about you.  
`Tag 1`  
**Tomo：**  
Of course you'd say that...  
 Honestly, I'm no match for you.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Tomo：**  
Yeah... I'm sorry, Matsuri.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Matsuri：**  
Waaahhh! C'mon, Tomo!  
You can't leave me behind like that!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, heck. Look how much the kid cares about you.  
Instead of trying to save face, why don't you consider her feelings?  
Besides, being partners is about more than just success or failure, right?  
  
**Inori：**  
Does that go for us too, Kaya-P?  
  
**Kaya：**  
'Course it does.  
  
**Inori：**  
...Ehehe. Good to hear.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha...  
 Well, dang.  
I'm getting lectured by my own targets.  
But you're right. I shouldn't have made you all worry.  
  
**Homare：**  
Were you that desperate to fulfill your mission?  
...Young knight of Nightmare. ☆  
  
**Tomo：**  
You even know about that?  
Sheesh... You were just toying with us all along.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Says the girl who managed to leave us in the dust.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I got so on edge, I wasn't thinking straight.  
I really am still just a greenhorn.  
Thank you again, Matsuri.  
 I'm so glad you came after me.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Oh, Tomoooo!  
  
**Inori：**  
Heh. You should've quit being stubborn from the start!  
If you say you're sorry, you can be my subordinates and—  
  
**Homare：**  
Hey, you guys~? Sorry to interrupt your little chat...  
But isn't that... our mystery attacker over there?  
  
**Dragon?：**  
...  
  
**Narration：**  
Everyone turns to follow Homare's gaze.  
A gigantic beast stands before them,  
staring as if to evaluate the intruders.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Uh, boss...? Is this really the same dragon  
we came out here to look for?  
  
**Homare：**  
Inori, you're the one who saw it up close. Well?  
  
**Inori：**  
Ummm...  
 Was it always this ugly?  
  
**Dragon?：**  
Mrrghh?!  
  
**Homare：**  
Largo, can you talk to it?  
  
**Largo：**  
Growwrrr!  
  
**Dragon?：**  
Mrghhhhhh...  
  
**Largo：**  
Grow-growl!  
  
**Dragon?：**  
Mrrrgh...  
  
**Kaya：**  
...They're not on the same wavelength, are they?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hold up... Is this thing a real dragon?!  
  
**Dragon?：**  
Mrghh!  
  
**Homare：**  
That's what we thought, but...  
 Hmmm...  
We might need to inspect it more closely before we can be sure.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Could it be... the guild you belong to, Dragons' Nest,  
came here to search for dragons and ruins related to them?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Well, yeah.  
 We're all dragonfolk, but even we  
don't know much about our own roots. And we'd like to.  
Wait, did you never tell them that, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Didn't I mention it?  
`Tag 4`  
**Tomo：**  
Huh?! You knew their goal here this whole time?!  
*sigh*... I suppose we should have asked you to begin with...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
We thought you were here to do shady gangster stuff...  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh, I can't believe you'd think that of us~!  
Do we really look like such villains?  
  
**Inori：**  
For my own safety, I'd rather not answer that.  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Yeah, no comment.  
  
**Tomo：**  
What were you planning to do with any dragons you found?  
Fix this \"broken world\" by standing up to the palace?  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh, I see. You overheard that, did you?  
Ah, of course... I wasn't \"watching\" then,  
 so I couldn't have known! ☆  
  
**Homare：**  
Trust me, we're not planning to set dragons on Landosol or anything.  
What's broken is our geography, history, common sense, memories...  
Everything that makes up this world.  
  
**Homare：**  
Surely even you have felt it from time to time?  
Right now, this world is...  
  
**Inori：**  
This isn't the time for all that stuff!  
We need to deal with that ugly dragon!  
  
**Dragon?：**  
Mrghhhh...!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hold up!  
 Look how it's acting...!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hm?  
 What now? Looking for a fight?  
Sure thing—bring it on!  
  
**Dragon?：**  
FFSSHHHHRRR...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Could this be... like when it attacked the camp?!  
Everyone, get back!  
  
**Narration：**  
In response to Kaya's provocation, the dragon inhaled deeply.  
Foreseeing an incoming burst of fiery breath,  
Tomo found herself leaping forward to protect Matsuri.
