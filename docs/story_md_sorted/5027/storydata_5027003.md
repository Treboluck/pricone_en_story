# Assailant in the Dark
Though their investigation continues, the Nightmare girls make little progress, and find themselves falling into a rut. Then, one night, Inori is summoned by Homare and finds herself under attack from a mysterious fire-breathing enemy. As the attacker closes in, Homare gives a sinister smile.
  
## Subtitle: Assailant in the Dark
  
**Narration：**  
As their expedition continues, many members of the crew  
grow weary of attending to the same tasks day in and day out,  
and a sense of lethargy begins to hang in the air of the firelit camp.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Good work out there today!  
 Didja find anything?  
I wish I could've gone with you, but the investi...  
uh, I mean,  
 my chores have gotta take priority!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...! That lady looking this way is a dragongirl too, right?  
Everyone calls her \"boss,\" so she's gotta be the guildmaster.  
One of the gangsters told me her actual name is "Homare."  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Uergh. She doesn't *look* like old Christina,  
but she gives me the same vibe...  
Somehow she seems way more dangerous than the other two.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You think?  
**Choice: (2)**  You might be right.  
`Tag 1`  
**Inori：**  
She's got such blatant hidden depths, it's just way too creepy.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Yeah. And that smile... It never reaches her eyes!  
  
**Inori：**  
How's anyone supposed to have a clue what she's thinking?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Inori：**  
Oh, absolutely.  
You should hear the things she's put me through...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Th-that bad, huh...?  
  
**Inori：**  
Even with her eyes closed, her gaze could kill.  
Trust me, you don't want to see her open them...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Matsuri：**  
Wait—waghhhh?! Wh-why are you here?!  
Don't just slip into our private conversation!  
  
**Inori：**  
H-hah! As if a brat like you could keep secrets from me!

**Matsuri：**  
Hold up... Is she beckoning in our direction?  
  
**Inori：**  
Pyeughh?!  
I-I'm sure it must be you she's calling for...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Her lips are moving too.  
Lemme see. \"I... o... i…\" \"I... no... ri…\"?  
  
**Inori：**  
N-no, look again.  
I think she's saying \"Ma... tsu... ri.\"  
I'm sure of it... It's the only explanation!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Doesn't look like it to me...  
Oh, now she's raised her fingers. Is she doing a countdown?  
  
**Inori：**  
Pyeughhh...!  
Urkk... Wh-why? How did it come to this?!  
Th-this is... It's all your fault, you hear?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I think you brought it on yourself.  
  
**Inori：**  
Y-you'll regret this someday!  
  
`image display end`  
**Matsuri：**  
Even while protesting, she actually ran over to see the boss...  
Seems like... a tough life in that guild.  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
The hell'd you just say?!  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
Ehhh?! You try'na pick a fight?!  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
You better believe it!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
N-now they're infighting too?!  
Tough isn't the half of it...  
  
**Kaya：**  
*sigh*... Now listen, you two. What's all this about?  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
Wha... Kaya?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Oh, phew. I'm sure Kaya'll be able to put a stop to this!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Who was it?  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
L-look, he's the one in the wrong...  
  
**Kaya：**  
I don't care who's wrong. Which one of you started the fight?  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
It was him! He came up and started accusing me of stealing stuff!  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
If you didn't steal it, who the hell did?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hmm...  
 All right, got it! Listen.  
You picked a fight with him, so I'll take you up on it.  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
Huh? Wait, but...  
  
**Kaya：**  
And you accepted his fight, so I'll accept it from you.  
That way everyone's even. We clear?  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
W-well, I guess that does... make sense...?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Then there's no need for you to fight each other.  
 Right?  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
Uhhh,  
 sure...  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
If you say so, Kaya...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Amazing! She stopped the fight in seconds flat!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Great!  
 You can both come at me together, then.  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
Huh?  
  
**Kaya：**  
The fights you two picked both belong to me now, see?  
So obviously this ain't over until we've settled 'em, is it?!  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
Wha...?! Wait—!  
  
**Kaya：**  
The boss said anyone who beats me in a fight  
gets promoted on the spot, didn't she?  
And I'm letting you take me two-on-one!  
 So let's see your best shot!  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
Arghhh...  
 If that's how it's gonna be...!  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
W-we've got no choice! Yaarghh!  
  
**Kaya：**  
That's more like it! Just what I like to see!  
I've been itching for a fight, so try to keep me entertained! Yaahhh!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ahhhh...  
 Somehow it ended up worse than it started.  
I thought Kaya was nice, but she can be super scary...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I thought this would happen...  
`Tag 4`  
**Matsuri：**  
I-if you saw it coming, couldn't you try to stop her?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
All of this commotion is perfect for investigating.  
Matsuri's with him, so she should be safe for the moment...  
Aha! Found them. That's Inori and Homare...  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh, Inori~?  
 Is something wrong?  
  
**Inori：**  
Wh-wh-wh-wh-why would things be wrong?  
I mean, it was that brat Matsuri who said those things, not me...  
  
**Homare：**  
Hmm? Said what, exactly?  
  
**Inori：**  
Huh? You're not mad 'cause of the stuff we were saying about you?  
  
**Homare：**  
Ahaha. I wouldn't call you over here just for that!  
Now, before you tell me all about that conversation in detail...  
  
**Inori：**  
Eurghh! Oh noooo! I dug my own grave!  
  
**Homare：**  
Inori... You're sensitive to these things, so I want your opinion.  
Since we set up camp here, have you felt like we're being watched?  
This little one... Largo has been ever so restless the whole time.  
  
**Largo：**  
Growrrr!  
  
**Tomo：**  
They've noticed my eyes on them...?  
  
**Inori：**  
Umm... I don't really know.  
Are you sure it's not just wild animals?  
  
**Homare：**  
I'd like to think I'm imagining things...  
But let's be careful, just in case.  
It could be someone sneaky enough to fool even you!  
  
**Inori：**  
D-don't say scary things like that!  
  
**Homare：**  
Well then, let's leave it at that for today.  
Try not to oversleep tomorrow morning.  
 Nighty-night~! ☆  
  
**Inori：**  
She said her spiel and ran off...  
*sigh* Guess I'd better head to bed.  
Let me just find Kaya-P first...  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'm glad our cover doesn't seem to be blown, at least...  
But Homare's words are concerning.  
Is there a third party keeping watch on all of us...?  
  
**Inori：**  
Hyeeughh?!  
 Think you can bump into *me,* do you?!  
Try looking where you're—  
  
**???：**  
Mrghhh?  
  
**Inori：**  
Wh-wh-wh... What the heck is thiiiiiis?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
What's that?!  
  
**???：**  
MGRUOOOHHH!  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
The heck?!  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
I-it's a fire!  
  
**Kaya：**  
A fire?! We're in the middle of a fight!  
This isn't the time for fires!  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
I-I think the fire is more urgent!  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
H-hey... What's that freaky shadow...?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Quit getting distracted! Can't you try to face me like men?!  
Ugh, what exactly is...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wahhh?! Wh-what's going on?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Whoa there. You OK, Matsuri?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eek...?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Ahhh...  
 Guess that scene was a bit much for a kid.  
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare ya...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Forget that! Look behind you!  
`Tag 5`  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, for the... What now?  
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa...!  
Could this actually be...?!  
  
**Narration：**  
The silhouette that faced them before the firelight  
looked exactly like that of a winged dragon.  
  
**Homare：**  
The~re you are! ☆
