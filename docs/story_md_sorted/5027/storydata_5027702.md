**Narration：**  
Inori and Draggo's word-linking prowess is increasing by the day.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Ngh...  
This pair of dunces... They're really pushing me...!  
  
**Inori：**  
Heheheh. Even your insults just feel like excuses now!  
Nice work, Draggo! You're a real word-linking warrior now!  
  
**Draggo：**  
Mrghhhh! Gmrrh!  
  
**Inori：**  
Ahaha... Hey, don't be like that!  
  
**Kaya：**  
I don't know what he just said,  
but you two sure seem like good friends.  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh, what's this~?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Guahh! Boss?! How long have you been standing there?  
  
**Homare：**  
Quite a while, actually...  
But anyway, Kaya, I see our new friend's stolen your precious Inori! ☆  
  
**Kaya：**  
Come on, it's not like that!  
What's the big idea, boss?  
  
**Homare：**  
Even so, it's too soon to get complacent,  
so how about I join in as well this time?  
That's fine, isn't it, Inori?  
  
**Inori：**  
We were just getting tired of bullying Kaya-P two on one.  
You can both take us on together!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, you've done it now.  
 This fight's on! Let's do it, boss!  
  
**Inori：**  
Let's take them both down! Draggo!  
  
**Draggo：**  
Mrghhh! Gmrhh! Mghrrr!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus began a no-holds-barred final battle to end all battles.
