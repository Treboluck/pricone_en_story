# The Adventure Goes On
Upon their return, Tomo and Matsuri report to Jun that Dragons' Nest doesn't seem like a dangerous guild. Meanwhile, Homare and her guild inspect the artifacts they retrieved from the island, and reconfirm their true objective.
  
## Subtitle: The Adventure Goes On
  
**Narration：**  
On another ordinary afternoon in Landosol,  
two knights once more approach their ironclad superior  
as she stands outside the palace gates.

**Matsuri：**  
Matsuri here!  
 Tomo and I have returned from our special mission!  
  
**Jun：**  
Welcome back, Tomo, Matsuri.  
I'm glad you're all right.  
So, can you give me a report about your findings on Dragons' Nest?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Of course. Most of the expedition's crew were gangsters and ruffians.  
However, their actual goal  
 was a legitimate mission  
in line with their guild's official activities.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Sending gangsters to do her guild's work...  
That Homare sure is a fearless woman!  
  
**Tomo：**  
They went to search the island  
 for ruins and what lies within.  
Though I'm still not entirely sure  
what they intended to do with their findings...  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm... I thought the island was heretofore uninhabited,  
but from your tone, I gather there were indeed ruins there.

**Matsuri：**  
There were!  
 And there was a weird dragon-like monster!  
Oh yeah, and {player} was there too!  
He seemed pretty friendly with the dragongirls.  
  
**Jun：**  
Oh, is that true?  
That's very interesting news.  
  
**Tomo：**  
To be specific, we uncovered the remains of a ruin  
and a creature with dragon-like features.  
 That island is a wild place.  
No wonder it gives the Guild Association trouble.  
 But I'd wager...  
  
**Jun：**  
The dragonfolk are more of a potential danger...?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Yes... But even if they are gang members, I have to say  
I don't believe their guild would pursue purely evil goals.  
...I'm sorry, that was a very subjective assessment.  
  
**Jun：**  
No... If that's what you believe, then so shall I.  
Your instincts and judgment have always aided me greatly.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Trust me, Kaya and Inori really aren't bad people!  
Though... it *is* always hard to tell what Homare is thinking...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Well, though we may still have doubts, they're friends with him, too...  
So I'm sure they're good people at heart.

**Matsuri：**  
Yeah! I think we can get along!  
  
**Jun：**  
I see. If they're friends of that young man, I'm inclined to agree.  
Still, both of you seem to have grown a lot in such a short time.  
Tomo especially—you strike me as more mature than when you left.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Yeah! She's more reliable than ever!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Are you sure? Personally, I find it difficult to tell...  
But if you're right, it may be thanks to him and Dragons' Nest.  
So, shall we go tease him and invite him out to dinner as thanks?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Sure thing!  
 I've been dying for some good old Landosol food!  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm. My shift's almost over, so perhaps I'll come too.  
I'd like to show my appreciation for all your efforts.

**Tomo：**  
Oh, are you paying?  
 Perfect!  
Come on, Matsuri, I'll race you to the usual place!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wahh! C'mon, Tomo, that isn't fair!  
Wait for me!  
  
**Kaya：**  
So, what's the verdict, boss?  
This whole trip wasn't a complete waste, was it?  
  
**Homare：**  
Not from a guild perspective, no.  
But we're no closer to our main goal of finding a real dragon...  
  
**Homare：**  
I've made arrangements with nobles who have influence in high places.  
This won't be the last opportunity we have to visit Elpis Island.  
  
**Homare：**  
For them, it's a perfect chance to get our rogues off the streets,  
so the palace and Association won't hesitate to accept our support.  
  
**Homare：**  
As for Tomo and Matsuri's boss...  
 Captain Jun, was it?  
I think I'll have to find an opportunity to thank her...  
  
**Homare：**  
Ideally, I'd have liked to stay off Nightmare's radar...  
But silly old Kaya just had to almost awaken in front of them.  
They'll be at least a little wary of us now...  
  
**Inori：**  
Well, of course!  
Kaya-P back there was scarier than I've ever seen her!  
Even scarier than you get sometimes...  
  
**Kaya：**  
I'm sorry, OK?! I just kinda got heated up.  
Anyway, this \"awakening\"...  
 It's a bad thing if I do it now?  
Do you want me to awaken or don't you? Make your mind up!  
  
**Homare：**  
I do want you to, but try to have better timing!  
Still, that's not all we gained this time.  
Your awakening is progress...  
 but so is this.  
  
**Inori：**  
The tablet? It's just one of the Pseudo-Dragon's toys!  
W-wait!  
Are you planning to sell it to raise funds for our guild?  
  
**Homare：**  
Too bad! Not even close~! ☆  
 That beast found this in a ruin, you know?  
In this world's current history, up until its very recent rediscovery,  
the island of Elpis has had no contact with Astraea for many centuries.  
  
**Homare：**  
But this tablet doesn't seem all that old.  
It dates to an age when humans should have been long gone from Elpis.  
Well? Isn't that quite the paradox?  
  
**Inori：**  
Umm...? So what does it actually mean?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Maybe it's not conclusive, but now we've got real evidence.  
Proof that something's wrong with this world.  
  
**Homare：**  
Exactly~! ☆  
Whoever edited history itself, they failed to catch all the loose ends.  
Doesn't that suggest there's still room for us to get the better of them?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey, Inori, back on the island, didn't you act like you could tell  
what that Pseudo-Dragon was saying?  
  
**Inori：**  
It was just a vague feeling...  
  
**Kaya：**  
But like, if you could talk like Largo and the boss,  
couldn't that Pseudo-Dragon tell us a few things?  
  
**Homare：**  
It's quite possible! ♪  
 Communication with similar species  
may be an ability shared by us dragonfolk in general!  
I'd say it's worth investigating.  
 So... shall we head back to the island? ☆  
  
**Inori：**  
Bueghh?! Go back now?  
I was pretty happy to arrive home in civilization!  
  
**Kaya：**  
I'd be totally up for it!  
Although I do have a bunch of brawling jobs piled up in the city...  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh, no, I don't mean right now!  
Our last trip left us in the red, after all.  
We'll need a little time to save up for another.  
  
**Inori：**  
Urgh...  
 All right then, I'm in as well!  
But in return, I'm demanding a cash bonus!  
  
**Homare：**  
Mm-hm! Let's all do our best~! ☆  
Together, we'll find the nasty culprit  
 who reshaped this world...  
  
**Narration：**  
As they set their sights firmly on pursuing the world's secrets,  
the members of Dragons' Nest aimed for no less  
than the restoration of a world now lost...
