# Episode 5
On a warm spring afternoon, Mimi, Misogi, Kyoka and Lima are playing happily in Tsubakigaoka Park. As Misogi tells wild tales of Lima the Hero, the sound of children's laughter echoes endlessly in the spring breeze...
  
## Subtitle: Girl Talk on April 1st
  
**Narration：**  
The skies are clear in Tsubakigaoka on one sunny first of April.  
This afternoon, Misogi, Mimi and Kyoka have gathered in the local park.  
  
**Misogi：**  
...And that's how Lima the Hero and her allies  
defeated the terrifying Robo-Lima attacking Landosol!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Oh, wow!  
 Lima the Hero must be super strong!  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima,  
 llima llima! ♪  
(These apples are so delicious~! ♪)  
  
**Kyoka：**  
You shouldn't trust her, Mimi.  
I'm quite sure Misogi just made all of that up.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Wh-why would you think I'm a liar?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Well, today *is* April Fools' Day.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Huh? Huh? Was that story not true?  
So Lima the Hero and Robo-Lima aren't real?  
What's an \"April Fool\"?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Tch... Guess I couldn't fool Kyoka.  
Next year, I'll have to think up an even better one!  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima llima,  
 llima...?  
(Lima the Hero and Robo-Lima are based on me, right?  
What exactly does that girl think I am?)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima,  
 llima llima llima.  
(Oh well. These apples are good, so I'll humor her a little longer!)  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Honestly, the scale of that lie was way too large!  
Proper April Fools' pranks should be more subtle and believable...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Fooled ya! I was lying about it being a lie!  
Now, with this Robo-Lima Armor...  
Lima, let's morph into our ultimate form!  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima?! Llima llima~!  
(Huh?! What? What now?! What's this girl planning to do to me?!)  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ta-daaaa! Robo-Lima is here!  
  
**Lima：**  
L-llima~?! Llima~!  
(Waaahh! What is all this?! It's playing havoc with my fur!)  
  
**Mimi：**  
Woooow! It's Robo-Lima!  
That's so cool!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Heheh!  
How's that?! Robo-Lima is the real deal after all!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
That armor is obviously cardboard!  
You made it yourself, didn't you, Misogi?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Nuh-uh! It's the legendary Robo-Lima Armor on the real Robo-Lima!  
With this visor made from Giga-Ultra Ore Limamite X,  
our transformation is complete!  
  
**Misogi：**  
If you still don't believe me, I'll prove it!  
Get 'em! Robo-Lima Attack!  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima llima,  
 llima~!  
(Oh, all right then...  
The apples were tasty, so I'll play along!)  
  
**Mimi：**  
Waahh! Robo-Lima's coming this way!  
Kyoka, let's run!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Urgh...  
Wh-why does it take orders from Misogi...?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahahahah!  
 Robo-Lima, once you defeat Kyoka,  
I'll recharge your energy with an apple battery!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahh! Could it be the apples doing it?!  
In that case...!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Robo-Lima Missiiiiiile!  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima, llima llima!  
 Ptheh, ptheh.  
(Hee hee, this might be a little bit childish for girl talk,  
but it's still so much fun playing with human friends!)  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Waaahhh?!  
I-is this... Robo-Lima's spit?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Uwehh... Kyoka's all wet and sticky now...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
M-Misogiiii!  
Robo-Lima, come to me!  
 I'll give you a nice energy charge!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ah...! Are those the apples I brought?!  
Wh-when did you...?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Now, Robo-Lima! It's Misogi's turn to get attacked!  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima llima, llima llima!  
(Hee hee, I'm all charged up! Let's go! Robo-Lima Rush!)  
  
**Misogi：**  
Guahhhh! Robo-Lima's charging this way! Ruuuuun!  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima, llima llima!  
 Ptheh, ptheh.  
(This is starting to get really, really fun! Wait for meeee!)  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahh! Her spit got on my face!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Hmph!  
 Serves you right!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Woooow!  
 Robo-Lima really is strong after all!  
  
**Misogi：**  
You've done it now!  
Robo-Lima, activate your laser! Here we gooooo!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so the sounds of children's laughter and Lima's prancing hooves  
echoed merrily through the park until the sun went down.
