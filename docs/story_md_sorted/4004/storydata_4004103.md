**Pecorine：**  
Let's do this, Lima!  
Yaaahhhh!  
  
**Lima：**  
I'm on it, Pecorine!  
Hyaaahhh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That last attack stopped the enemy in its tracks!  
Talk about a winning combination!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm? Wait, something's still not right here!  
Uh, what *is* that?!  
  
**Mini Robo-Lima：**  
Llima llima... Llima llima...  
  
**Lima：**  
Aaaaghhh!  
Now lots of little ones came bursting out?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Try to remain calm, everyone! Those are also not Miss Lima!  
I think our enemy is trying to buy time  
while its main body repairs the damage we have dealt.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's really not going down easily, is it?  
Still, if it thinks a little thing like this will scare us off,  
it's got another thing coming! ☆
