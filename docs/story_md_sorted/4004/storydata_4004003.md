# Episode 3
Kokkoro is bothered by the giant object's robotic behavior. She theorizes that it might be an artifact left by some ancient civilization, and its objective may be to mine a valuable mineral named Giga-Ultra Ore Limamite X...

**Pecorine：**  
Umm, is this thing really even a monster at all?  
I get the feeling it's not exactly alive...  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh, I agree. If it looks like me,  
 why is it so uncute?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And it uses attacks that I have never seen...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah!  
 Could it actually be an artifact of some ancient civilization?  
I have read of such things in the records I perused in my hometown...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Koro... That's a bit too much of a leap.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Then...  
 maybe it's a super-invader from a totally different world?  
  
**Lima：**  
Ooh, that's so dramatic!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Uh, I don't think drama's the goal here!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We should also not discount the possibility  
that it was originally built not as a weapon,  
but as a tool for mundane labor.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
For instance, say there exists a valuable mineral...  
Let us call it \"Giga-Ultra Ore Limamite X,\" for example.  
This great contraption may have been designed to excavate it.  
  
**Karyl：**  
G... Giga-Ultra Ore Limamite X...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If, perchance, it held immense power  
 to grant its holder's desires,  
this Giga-Ultra Ore Limamite X would of course be fiercely contested.  
It would be natural to outfit the excavation tool with its own defenses.  
  
**Lima：**  
Giga-Ultra Ore Limamite X? Oh, please...  
Don't name that stuff after me too!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhh~? What would I do if I had some Giga-Ultra Ore Limamite X?  
First, I'd wish for a stomach that can hold even more food!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Uh, no. I think your appetite's more than big enough already!  
Wait, what's a Limamite X in the first place?!  
 Don't make weird stuff up  
out of nowhere! Apologize to the archeological community!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, what are your thoughts on this being?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's probably Lima's long-lost sister.  
**Choice: (2)**  It's probably a new invention of the Wisteria Company.  
`Tag 1`  
**Lima：**  
Whaaa?! I have a sister now?!  
Now that you say it, I almost feel like you could be right...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No way...  
But if it's Lima's sister, I couldn't bear to do it any more harm!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Listen to me, Lima's sister! Please stop attacking!  
Sisters should never have to face each other in battle!  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh, Pecorine...!  
 Thank you...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Of course it's not her sister!

`Tag 2`  
**Karyl：**  
Ohhh, you mean that mega-rich tycoon?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, so it is in fact a great vehicle designed for emergency rescue,  
deployed by a secret international-scale institution  
to aid those in grave need.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yet, through some accident, it has gone haywire  
and turned upon the very people it was supposed to protect...  
  
**Lima：**  
So despite your scary looks, you're actually just a cruel victim of fate...  
I can understand exactly how you feel...  
  
**Karyl：**  
If it was for rescuing people, why would it need a giant sword?!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Karyl：**  
Ugh, for the love of... There's no point theorizing now!  
Let's just focus on taking this thing down!
