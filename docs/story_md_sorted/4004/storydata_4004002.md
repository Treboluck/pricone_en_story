**Karyl：**  
This thing's body is way tougher than I thought!  
And how the heck's it so strong when it looks so dumb?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine, please try to concentrate.  
Spacing out during battle is most unsafe.  
Or has something of relevance occurred to you, perhaps?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, I'm sorry!  
I just feel like... I've seen this thing before somewhere.  
  
**???：**  
*pant*... *pant*... I finally made it...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? Oh, I know you! Lima, right?  
What brings you here?  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh, Pecorine!  
Well, I mean, what else? This gigantic object is—  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?  
 Wait a minute!  
You look like the spitting image of that thing!  
Don't tell me it's related to you somehow...?  
  
**Lima：**  
O-of course it isn't!  
But I did hear rumors that it looked like me,  
so I came to see for myself!  
  
**Lima：**  
Honestly... Just because of a slight resemblance,  
everyone I met on the way here has been treating me like I'm suspicious!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm, now that you mention it...  
The more I look, the closer the resemblance seems.  
  
**Lima：**  
H-how does that thing look like me?!  
  
**Lima：**  
Its fur's all dirty! Hasn't it heard of grooming?  
The hairs are all sticking out wildly,  
 like it just got out of bed!  
  
**Lima：**  
Plus, its skin is as hard as rock!  
I'll admit my skin's a little tougher than I'd like,  
but it's way more delicate than that!  
 I take good care of it, thank you!  
  
**Lima：**  
And just *look* at those awful eyes!  
I mean,  
 I do occasionally get compliments from the neighbors  
saying my eyes are so cute they seem to sparkle...  
  
**Lima：**  
But they certainly don't glare with light like that!  
That's not cute, it's just scary!  
So that thing is nothing like me!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
N-now, now. Let's calm down, shall we?  
  
**Lima：**  
Geez...  
Well, anyway, I'm sick of that thing causing trouble,  
so I want to take it down with you guys!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh! That would be a crazy big help!  
Let's do this together, then!
