**Lima：**  
Time for a snack!  
Good thing I brought some apples to power me right up!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh~! Those apples do look good...  
 *drool*  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hold it!  
Don't just try to snatch any food that you lay eyes on!  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh, did you want some too, Pecorine?  
Nobody's ever asked me to share with them before!  
Of course you can!  
 Ptheh, ptheh, ptheh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Stop thaaaaat!
