Ah! That brute's gone and healed itself up!  
Honestly, how stubborn can it be?!  
Give up and let us smash you!  
  
**Lima：**  
Lucky her! If I could fix my fur up in a jiffy like that,  
my daily routine would be so much easier!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Is this really the time to think about personal grooming?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Still, that proves our attacks are doing the job!  
We're not beaten yet, so we can't let it get us down!  
  
**Lima：**  
Agreed.  
Let's keep our spirits up and defend Landosol with all our might!
