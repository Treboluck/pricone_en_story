**Karyl：**  
Huh... Are the beaches around here always as warm as this, I wonder?  
Feels almost like a fancy tropical resort!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? Karyl, are you planning to set up shop here?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, of course not.  
I just thought it would be nice if we could use it as a getaway.  
Wouldn't a refreshing place to escape our troubles be the best?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank you very much.  
Miss Karyl, you are always considering what is best for us all.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Woo-woo! ♪ I love it when Karyl goes all nice-girl on us!  
Don't worry, Karyl, we love you to death as well! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
W-wait, say what?! It's not like that at all!  
I just want an excuse to relax on the beach myself!  
Don't make me sound like a sappy loser! I'll kill you dead!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aww, look at you getting embarrassed! It's so cute!  
How crazy is that?! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh...  
 Oh—while I hate to interrupt this heartwarming exchange,  
it seems this resort already has a monster guest.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Is it a shark or a manta ray...?  
I find its appearance rather confusing.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Like shark fins and ray fins...?!  
Those sound like ingredients we can't afford to miss out on!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Nobody mentioned ingredients!  
Now quit your drooling and get ready for battle!  
Whatever it is, that monster looks dangerous.  
 C'mon, let's go!
