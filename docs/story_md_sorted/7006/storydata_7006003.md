# Pride and Conviction
Bolstered by {player}'s support, Akino finds herself taking down monsters left and right. A monster that can deflect Saren's attacks soon appears, though, causing Saren to call for a tactical retreat. Akino, however, discovers a means to bypass its defense and defeat it.
  
## Subtitle: Pride and Conviction
  
**Narration：**  
Akino finds herself performing on equal footing with  
Saren after being cheered on by {player}.  
  
**Saren：**  
Good stuff, Akino!  
  
**Akino：**  
Ohohoho! Behold me in all my glory!  
  
**Saren：**  
Now I'm *really* curious about  
what {player} did to you.  
  
**Akino：**  
Wha—?!  
Th-that has nothing to do with it!  
  
**Saren：**  
Yeah yeah, whatever.  
More importantly—incoming monster! Stay alert!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Akino：**  
This seems like quite the fierce one!  
  
**Saren：**  
I'll deal with it!  
  
**Saren：**  
What?!  
My sword bounced right off it!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Saren：**  
Eeeeeek?!  
  
**Akino：**  
Saren! Are you okay?!  
  
**Saren：**  
S-somehow...  
We're going to need a proper strategy for this one, though.  
Let's retreat first—  
  
**Akino：**  
No. We must stand our ground and fight!  
  
**Saren：**  
You saw what just happened, didn't you?!  
Even the two of us attacking together won't make that thing budge!  
We need to retreat and make a proper plan of attack!  
  
**Akino：**  
Can you guarantee that we'll be able to retreat safely?  
That monster could have some means of performing long-range attacks.  
If that's the case, then we'll be ripe for the picking if we try to flee!  
  
**Saren：**  
W-well...  
  
**Akino：**  
Fight or flight comes only after we know what we're dealing with!  
Come at me, monster!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Saren：**  
Don't do it, Akino!  
Run!  
  
**Akino：**  
I shan't lose!  
Take this! Haughty Hack!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Saren：**  
Her counter actually had an affect on it...?  
Oh! I get it now! It's vulnerable whenever it tries to attack!  
  
**Akino：**  
If that's the case, then I have a plan.  
Saren! I'll bait it into attacking again, so you do the honors!  
  
**Saren：**  
Y-you're using yourself as bait?!  
  
**Akino：**  
There's no time to waste fretting!  
Let's take care of this beast at once!  
  
**Saren：**  
Akino...  
Ahh! Fine, fine!  
  
**Akino：**  
You there!  
What gave you the impression that you could take your eyes off me?  
Show me what you've got!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Akino：**  
Saren, now!  
  
**Saren：**  
Leave it to me!  
Haaah!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Akino：**  
W-we pulled it off, somehow...  
  
**Saren：**  
Thanks for being willing to put yourself in danger,  
Akino.  
  
**Akino：**  
Not at all.  
'Twas a breeze!  
  
**Akino：**  
With that little diversion out of the way,  
let us proceed onwards!  
  
**Saren：**  
At times like this I really can't match up to her, can I?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Something up?  
`Tag 1`  
**Saren：**  
Nothing really.  
Let's go after her!  
  
**Narration：**  
Though the monsters continued to grow stronger,  
the trio persisted onward.
