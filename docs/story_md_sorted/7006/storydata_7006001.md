## Subtitle: Of Friendship and Convictions
  
**Narration：**  
The search for clues behind {player}'s memories continues.  
As does yet another great battle between two fair maidens.  
  
**Saren：**  
According to what we know, monsters can drop  
clues pertaining to his memories.  
Except the ones  
around here don't seem to have any.  
  
**Akino：**  
*huff, puff* Y-you haven't even broken a sweat  
in spite of how many monsters we've fought...  
Truly impressive, Saren.  
  
**Akino：**  
I shan't let you show me up, though.  
We're just getting started!  
  
**Saren：**  
You really are a sore loser, aren't you?  
  
**Akino：**  
Y-you're the last one I want to hear that from!  
Or did you forget how stubborn you were after  
losing to me during our product investment competition?!  
  
**Saren：**  
Th-that was different!  
I was winning at first,  
but then you started negotiating with the manufacturers directly and  
got the price to drop! How could I give in after that?!  
  
**Akino：**  
Ohohoho!  
Focusing entirely on the product was your downfall, my friend!  
  
**Saren：**  
Y-you're talking big here,  
but let's not forget how stubborn you were  
when it came to seeing who could sell a new product best!  
  
**Akino：**  
N-now *that*  was a dirty move on your part!  
My product was  
cost-efficient, perfectly designed, and all around appealing!  
Yet you opted to throw in that bonus to boost sales!  
  
**Saren：**  
There's more to it than simply selling a good product. You need to  
make the customers feel like their purchase was worth it.  
Of course,  
that wouldn't be an issue if you understood your customer base. ♪  
  
**Akino：**  
G-grrrrrr!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You two get along well.  
`Tag 1`  
**Saren：**  
*That's*  your takeaway from our back-and-forth?!  
  
**Akino：**  
A-are you saying we don't get along?!  
  
**Saren：**  
Well... No, that would be a lie.  
  
**Akino：**  
Saren...  
Indeed!  
We're the best of friends!  
But also the fiercest of rivals!  
  
**Akino：**  
Now then, Saren!  
This contest is far from over!  
Let us finish what we started!  
  
**Akino：**  
I can't afford to lose!  
Not just for my sake,  
but for {player}'s sake, too!  
  
**Saren：**  
Wait up, Akino!  
And away she goes...  
Running off here is pretty much the opposite of doing this efficiently.  
  
**Saren：**  
That said, though, I'd hate to dilly-dally and have her  
brag about beating me to the punch in that gaudy tone of hers,  
so let's get going ourselves.  
  
**Narration：**  
Though he found himself at the whims of their antics,  
{player} couldn't but smile over  
how close the two seemed.
