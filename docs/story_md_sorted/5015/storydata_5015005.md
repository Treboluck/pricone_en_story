## Subtitle: Whitewing Bonds
  
**Narration：**  
Having fled from the terrifying Evil Magistrate,  
{player} and the members of Weissflügel  
take refuge in a remote corner of Oedo Town.  
  
**Monika：**  
*pant*... *pant*... I think we should be safe here for now.  
Now, Ayumi, how are your wounds?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I-I'm all right.  
He didn't actually hit me directly—  
just like Kuka, I was knocked flying by the shockwave.  
  
**Monika：**  
I... I see.  
Well, that's a great relief...  
  
**Kuka：**  
B-but that Evil Magistrate is still hunting for us...  
If he finds us, who knows what he'll do?  
 Gueheheheh... *drool*  
  
**Teahouse Owner：**  
There you are! I looked everywhere!  
The Magistrate will find you here!  
Come hide in my teahouse for now!  
  
**Monika：**  
W-we appreciate it!  
Everyone, hurry inside as quickly as you can!  
  
**Monika：**  
Whew... This should buy us time enough  
to tend to Ayumi's wounds.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
M-Monika,  
I really am mostly all right now...  
  
**Monika：**  
Even so, I want you to receive proper treatment.  
Please.  
  
**Mayor：**  
I quite agree.  
I'm so sorry for all we've put you through.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Mr. Mayor!  
You're all right too!  
  
**Mayor：**  
Yes... I'm sorry I couldn't do more to stop the Magistrate.  
  
**Monika：**  
Just who is that Magistrate fellow, exactly?  
  
**Mayor：**  
The Evil Magistrate is a monster that suddenly appeared in Oedo.  
With sheer brute force, it subjugated our entire town.  
  
**Kuka：**  
S-so he really is a monster.  
That explains why he was so strong...  
  
**Yuki：**  
But in that case, couldn't you simply call for aid from Nightmare?  
  
**Mayor：**  
No... the Magistrate has sent bribes to pacify the palace.  
In exchange for a portion of his taxes, they let him do as he pleases.  
  
**Mayor：**  
So even if we report him to Nightmare,  
\"We've received no reports of such activity\" will be their only response.  
  
**Kuka：**  
N-no way...!  
  
**Teahouse Owner：**  
The mayor is doing his very best  
to protect the people despite everything.  
If it weren't for him, the situation here would be far worse.  
  
**Mayor：**  
But with shops destroyed and poverty all over, the people are suffering.  
The Evil Magistrate has no interest in what we have to say.  
...  
Never in my life have I felt so powerless.  
  
**Ninon：**  
It's too awful... Letting that villain roam free in Oedo  
is more than I can bear to think of!  
  
**Mayor：**  
No... You shouldn't try to stand up to the Magistrate.  
You may still have a chance to escape.  
Flee this town and don't look back.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
D-do you really think  
we can just abandon the town in this state?!  
  
**Monika：**  
...No, the mayor is entirely right.  
All of you should leave this town behind.  
  
**Kuka：**  
M-Monika?! But why?!  
  
**Monika：**  
This enemy is not like ordinary monsters.  
If you do battle... you may lose your very lives.  
  
**All：**  
...?!  
  
**Monika：**  
I established this guild as a Landosol branch of Weissflügel,  
the military force to which I belong. However, the only Weissflügel  
soldier among us is me alone. It is none of your concern.  
  
**Monika：**  
...This battle is a job for the military.  
I cannot afford to place civilian lives in danger.  
So please, do as I ask and—  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Pinch Monika's cheek.  
**Choice: (2)**  Chop Monika on the shoulder.  
`Tag 1`  
**Monika：**  
Wueagh?!  
H-hey! Whad're you doigg?!  
Owwww! Dat hurds!  
  
Jump to tag 3

**Monika：**  
...Owww!

**Yuki：**  
You lucked out, Monika.  
If he hadn't done anything, I was about to use all this makeup  
to paint your face like a circus clown.  
  
**Kuka：**  
A-and I was going to use these ropes to tie you up in knots!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Monika, would you like to try a glass of aojiru,  
Togoku's famous bitter veggie juice?  
...  
Of course, there's plenty more where it came from!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I was going to use these bandages  
to give your arm a good squeezing! ♪  
  
**Monika：**  
Wh-why must I be subjected to all this?!  
I'm only worried for your safety...!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Honestly... I thought something was up when you hesitated before,  
but I can't say I expected this.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
U-um, it's true that we aren't real soldiers from Weissflügel,  
but we're all members of the Weissflügel: Landosol Branch guild!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
The leader of Weissflügel: Landosol Branch...  
The leader we follow would never abandon people in trouble.  
And, um... Where our leader goes, so do the rest of us!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I... I may not be the best person to say this, but...  
A... aren't we...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Aren't we all comrades?  
`Tag 4`  
**Kuka：**  
Y-you took the line I was about to say!  
This awkward atmosphere, and the stolen moment of sweet release...  
Oh, Mr. Sadist, this is exactly why I...  
 why I can't...!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Now, I must put my beauty before all else...  
But I can't deny I'm quite fond of this guild and its members.  
So I think we should all do our thing as usual.  
  
**Ninon：**  
What is a journey without companions?!  
We'll fight with you to the very end!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
That's right! Abandoning you here alone...  
That's the last thing any of us would dream of!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Let's fight together.  
`Tag 5`  
**Monika：**  
My friends...  
 Thank you.  
Then we of Weissflügel: Landosol Branch  
will do battle with the Evil Magistrate to protect the town of Oedo!  
  
**All：**  
Yeaaaahhh!

**Yuki：**  
But on a more sober note,  
 he's still too strong for us to handle.  
If we're taking him head-on, I think I'll pass.  
The loss of my peerless beauty would be a worldwide tragedy.  
  
**Monika：**  
Yes, I know.  
To begin, we must establish a plan of action.  
  
**Ninon：**  
If only he had some sort of fatal weakness...  
  
**Monika：**  
A weakness...  
 Come to think of it, why did the Magistrate  
begin targeting Kuka with such a fevered obsession?  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-I was really scared when that happened...  
 But his attacks seemed to  
be aimed mostly at my kimono, so I could evade them.  
 Though my belt  
was damaged as a result... Urgh... This costume isn't even mine...  
  
**Monika：**  
...That [[is]] odd. Monsters rarely target Kuka specifically.  
If anything, they find her behavior disturbing  
and try to keep their distance.  
  
**Yuki：**  
I suppose...  
Now that you mention it, that is unusual.  
  
**Ninon：**  
A monster being interested in Kuka,  
who even other monsters avoid, is weird to the extreme!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
W-well, it's true that the things she says  
and her sudden expressions of ecstasy  
can be a little off-putting...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ahhhh... I-I'm being derided as too creepy for monsters...  
This should be a depressing experience,  
 so why do I feel so excited?!  
  
**Teahouse Owner's Wife：**  
Everyone, I've brought tea for you all.  
Don't you think you should take a break?  
  
**Monika：**  
Oh—thank you. By the way, who might you be?  
  
**Teahouse Owner：**  
That's my lovely wife!  
Heheh. Ain't she a beauty like you've never seen?  
  
**Ninon：**  
She is a very beautiful woman,  
but I think  
 she would look even better in a kimono!  
  
**Monika：**  
That reminds me... I see your wife is wearing Landosol clothes too.  
Why is it that the women here don't wear eastern clothing?  
  
**Teahouse Owner's Wife：**  
Ah, well... I guess it started around when the Magistrate arrived.  
When women go out alone at night,  
someone has been stealing the belts clean off their kimonos.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Th-their belts? You mean he strips them of their clothing,  
a-a-a-and exposes their naked bodies...?!  
  
**Teahouse Owner's Wife：**  
No, it's just the belts that get stolen.  
Even their valuables are untouched. But it's so creepy...  
  
**Monika：**  
So everyone switched to western clothing...  
And yet I see your husband here  
is still wearing a kimono with a fine belt...  
  
**Mayor：**  
Well, you see, men's belts never get stolen.  
It might be because women's belts use wider fabric,  
making them easier for the culprit to snatch.  
  
**Ninon：**  
A kimono belt thief... A damaged belt...  
An Evil Magistrate...  
 targeting not Kuka herself, but her clothes...  
Especially... her kimono's belt...?  
  
**Monika：**  
Hm...?  
Is something wrong, Ninon?  
  
**Ninon：**  
...Could it be...?!  
I think I may have discovered the Magistrate's weakness!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
R-really?!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Good sir! Have you any spare women's belts?  
Bring those,along with any extra fabric you may have available!  
  
**Teahouse Owner：**  
R-right! I guess we do still have my wife's belt...  
I'll ask around and see if anyone can find us that fabric!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Now, Ayumi and Yuki, you can help me, and...  
...Kuka...? This won't be scary at all, so come over here for me~! ♪  
  
**Kuka：**  
Th-that tone of voice... This cold chill...  
After all I've been through, I can tell—  
I should run for my life!  
A-and yet... something inside me is longing to stay... Ahhhh... ♪  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Is this going to be safe?  
**Choice: (7)**  Aren't you going to stop her?  
`Tag 6`  
`Tag 7`  
**Monika：**  
Haha...  
 It'll be fine.  
Let's trust in our comrade's plan, shall we?  
  
**Monika：**  
Of course, we'll need your help too.  
Given your ability, you'll need to take a central position.  
We're counting on you, mighty shogun!  
  
**Mayor：**  
Sorry, ah...  
I've been  
 wondering about this for a while,  
but are you really...  
  
**Ninon：**  
...Shogun! Monika!  
Three of us isn't enough for this,  
so we need your help over here!  
  
**Monika：**  
Looks like there's work to do.  
I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor.  
We'll hear you out later!  
  
**Mayor：**  
A group of heroes fighting to protect the peace...  
And at their center, the one who leads them, their \"shogun\"...  
  
**Mayor：**  
Can he really be the shogun the tales speak of...?  
  
**Narration：**  
Gathering together huge quantities of fabric,  
{player} and co. prepared for their showdown  
with the Evil Magistrate.
