# A Humiliating Retreat
Arriving at the source of the scream, Monika and co. find an Evil Magistrate extorting taxes from the populace. Realizing that he is the source of all the town's problems, they attempt to do battle with him, but are overwhelmed and forced to make a hasty retreat.
  
## Subtitle: A Humiliating Retreat
  
**Narration：**  
Rushing out of the teahouse, {player} and the members  
of Weissflügel: Landosol Branch reach the source of the scream.  
A crowd has gathered there, and two figures stand at its center.  
  
**Mayor：**  
Sir Magistrate... Right this way.  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Ah, so this is the establishment defying my decrees.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I guess that shop is where the trouble's happening.  
What exactly are those men talking about?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Oh! I know one of them!  
 That's the mayor of Oedo Town!  
He's a good Landosol man  
 who came here  
to help the town thrive and achieve its full potential!  
  
**Yuki：**  
And the man by his side  
 who he's calling \"Sir Magistrate\"?  
He looks less human than even the demonfolk.  
  
**Ninon：**  
I've never seen him before either...  
But... There's something super suspicious about him!  
  
**Monika：**  
A \"magistrate\"... The \"Samurai Road\" book I was reading earlier  
spoke of \"evil magistrates\" whose nefarious deeds  
would often be thwarted by the heroes of Togoku.  
  
**Monika：**  
Indeed, they are so infamous  
that the name of \"Evil Magistrate\" is synonymous with villainy.  
  
**Ninon：**  
B-but this town is run by a friendly mayor,  
and anyway, I've never seen any Evil Magistrates here before!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Th-then just who is that man there  
being called by such an ominous name?  
  
**Mayor：**  
Two days late on taxes... Just a warning for now, then.  
All right, let me call the shop's owner...  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
No need for that.  
 Raze it to the ground.  
  
**Mayor：**  
Excuse me...?!  
Didn't we agree on up to a week's deferral?  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
And I said that there is no need for that.  
Or did you not hear me?  
  
**Mayor：**  
B-but, ah...  
All right... As you wish...  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Heheheh. Men who would defy me  
have no place in this town. Hahahahahah!  
  
**Ninon：**  
That Evil Magistrate is trying to destroy the shop!  
  
**Monika：**  
Let's stop him. Everyone follow me!  
  
**Yuki：**  
I'd really rather not get involved in conflicts like this, but oh well...  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Hmm? Who are you interlopers?  
  
**Monika：**  
That's enough, villain! This open oppression  
defies all that we proud soldiers of Weissflügel hold dear!  
I will apprehend you, and turn you over to Nightmare and the palace!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Surrender now, and pay the piper his dues!  
  
**Mayor：**  
Visitors from outside?  
 You mustn't stand up to the Magistrate!  
If you anger him too greatly, he could crush the town underfoot!  
Please, just leave this place!  
  
**Ninon：**  
So that's how it is...  
 Everyone, have no fear!  
For we have that hero among heroes,  
 the mighty shogun, on our side!  
  
**Mayor：**  
Th-the shogun...?!  
The king of Togoku who united the nations  
and brought peace to the lands?!  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Wh-what is this?! I've heard nothing of a shogun ruling here!  
I was told this town would fall easily to petty threats!  
Was that all a lie?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
...U-um, his attitude certainly shifted quickly.  
  
**Monika：**  
The book did say that they're weak to authority figures...  
This really is a classic Evil Magistrate.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Heheheh... Now, behold the face of the one you fear!  
This man is the noble and mighty shogun!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  H-hi, I'm the shogun...  
**Choice: (2)**  Hello? Are there any shoguns here?  
`Tag 1`  
**Ninon：**  
Sh-Shogun! Restrain your natural modesty!  
The situation calls for vim and vigor!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Ninon：**  
Shogun!  
I know you must remain undercover in your daily life,  
but this is the time to unveil your true identity!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Townsperson 1：**  
That's the shogun?  
  
**Townsperson 2：**  
Uh... I'm not buying it.

**Evil Magistrate：**  
Heh... Heheh... Hahahahahah! What a farce!  
I should have known there would never be a king of Togoku  
in a place like this!  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
As thanks for your clownery, I will play along with your little game.  
Heheheh... You may have one man,  
but a gaggle of girls like you can never hope to overcome me!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Eek?!  
Th-that gaze... It sends shivers running down my spine!  
  
**Monika：**  
You think me no more than a girl?  
I am a proud soldier of Weissflügel, and—  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Oh, you brought a brat, too.  
I have no interest in children's games!  
Out of my sight!  
  
**Monika：**  
I... I am a fully grown woman!!!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
M-Monika!  
You can't slice him with that sword!  
  
**Monika：**  
I know, I know!  
A scabbard strike, avoiding any fatal spots... Take thiiiiis!  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Was that a shoulder massage?  
Heheheh... You really are a little brat.  
  
**Monika：**  
Wha—?!  
M-my attack had no effect whatsoever?!  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Now, it's time you all learned  
what happens to those who dare to defy me!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Waahh!  
  
**Ninon：**  
A-are you OK, Ayumi?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Y-yes... M-my legs just kind of gave out on me...  
  
**Monika：**  
Wh-what is this ferocious aura?!  
And this sheer malice...  
 Can it be?!  
  
**Monika：**  
Everyone! Draw your weapons!  
That's no human... It's a monster!  
  
**Kuka：**  
...Wh-what?!  
A... a monster in the middle of town?!  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
I'll take care of this girl here first!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Wha...  
 Waaaaahhhhh!  
  
**Monika：**  
A-Ayumiiiii!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Th-that golden katana... It's so destructive!  
I thought the shockwave might send me flying!  
  
**Monika：**  
Yuki!  
Back us up and tend to Ayumi's wounds!  
  
**Yuki：**  
I suppose this is no time to be avoiding conflict.  
Leave it to me!  
  
**Monika：**  
With that sheer power, it's too dangerous to approach him!  
  
**Ninon：**  
In that case, taste my spiky shuriken!  
Shwip-shwippity-shwip!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Th-they were all deflected!  
  
**Monika：**  
Ngh... He has us outmatched.  
All units, prepare to retreat!  
  
`image display end`  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Heheheh...  
 Do you really think I'd allow that?  
Time to get serious...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Urgh...  
  
**Monika：**  
Kuka!  
D-did the shockwave before knock you out?!  
Stand, Kuka! Another attack is coming your way!  
  
**Kuka：**  
A-all right... B-but my belt has gotten all tangled...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Whew... I managed to stand up.  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Is that... a kimono...?  
That... belt...  
 Nnnnggguooohhhhh!  
  
**Monika：**  
Wh-what now?  
His movements suddenly became dull?  
  
**Kuka：**  
E-eeeeek!  
Why is he only chasing after me nowwwww?!  
Ah, but this revulsion is awakening new feelings in me...!  
  
**Monika：**  
Is this our chance?!  
Ninon! Help me stage our escape!  
  
**Ninon：**  
I'm on it!  
Ninpo: Smoky Bomb!  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Nghh... A smokescreen?!  
  
**Ninon：**  
*cough* *cough*... N-now, everyone!  
While he can't see, let's... *cough cough cough*  
  
**Monika：**  
Wh-  
why are you the worst affected by the smoke?!  
...Oh, heck! Let's just run for it!  
{player}, you grab Ayumi!  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
They got away...  
 Ah well.  
This has served as a fine demonstration for the humans.  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Now none will dare to defy me,  
 and my rule will be absolute.  
Heheh... Ahahahahahah!  
  
**Narration：**  
Though their attack had ended in failure,  
{player} and co. at least succeeded in fleeing  
from the Evil Magistrate's assault.
