**Monika：**  
Well, Evil Magistrate?!  
We have overcome all your foul schemes!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-it was a close call, though...  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Heheh... Heheheheheh...  
Ahahahahahahah!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Wh-what is it now?  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
I acknowledge your strength! You are fine warriors!  
I thought you feeble humans, but no, you are much more!  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
As such, I will grant you the honor of serving me.  
Submit to my will, and you will have all the authority you desire!  
  
**Ninon：**  
That's not the goal any of us have been fighting for!  
We fight to protect Oedo Town from your villainy!  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Oh, it's Oedo you want, is it?  
Then by all means, you may have this little town!  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
I have accomplices within the royal palace itself.  
With their help, I can always find a different town to rule!  
  
**Kuka：**  
D-does your greed know no end at all?  
It's because of people like you  
that honest folk can't live their lives in happiness!  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Here! Take this town of Oedo!  
In return, I ask only that you defeat any fools who dare defy me!  
Bwahahahahahah!  
  
**Monika：**  
Enough, Evil Magistrate.  
No, mechanical doll with a cursed heart.  
It's time we brought down the curtain on your performance of villainy!
