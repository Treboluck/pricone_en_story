# The Terrible Tourist Industry
Merchants desperate to sell their wares... Residents not wearing their usual eastern clothing... Realizing that something is not right in Oedo, the group resolves to investigate, but Monika in particular seems unusually hesitant.
  
## Subtitle: The Terrible Tourist Industry
  
**Narration：**  
{player} and the members of Weissflügel  
are enjoying their outing in the town of Oedo.  
There seems to be no end to the unique wares on offer.  
  
**Monika：**  
A soft, sweet filling in a delicious baked crust...  
 So this is taiyaki!  
To think such flavors existed in this world...  
I salute the land of Togoku for creating this fine confection!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Mm, Oedo Town's taiyaki are delicious too!  
There's a real depth to the flavor, isn't there?  
  
**Monika：**  
Hold on, Ayumi.  
These taiyaki are delicious \"too,\" you say?  
Do you mean to suggest that taiyaki can be found in Landosol?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Oh, you didn't know about them, Monika?  
There's a little stall in Landosol's main plaza,  
and the taiyaki there are just as delicious!  
  
**Monika：**  
...I must visit this stall ten times a week.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
W-wait, multiple times a day?!  
  
**Ninon：**  
I have returned...  
  
**Yuki：**  
Whew. We finally found you.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Urgh... This kimono is certainly very lovely,  
but it's not easy to walk in...  
  
**Monika：**  
And just where have you three—  
Actually, the huge load Yuki's carrying answers that question.  
  
**Yuki：**  
From decorations like hairpins to accessories like combs,  
I must surround myself with elegance...  
This is a necessary expense to hone my own beauty!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Still, I suppose I bought a little too much.  
So, {player}... Here you go! ♪  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Y-Yuki!  
Don't make him carry all that!  
He's already carrying everyone's luggage as it is!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Then... In exchange for carrying my possessions,  
I'll allow him to gaze upon me for ten whole seconds. ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That's a good deal.  
**Choice: (2)**  *staaaare*...  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuki：**  
I knew you'd understand!  
Now, feast your eyes upon my incomparable form!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Yuki：**  
Shouldn't you be more careful?  
If you stare too long and hard, my dazzling beauty may blind you! ♪  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Monika：**  
Kuka and Ninon haven't bought nearly as much, I see.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Th-the things I'm interested in aren't, ah...  
usually displayed out here in the open...  
Oh, but if it weren't for Ninon, I'd have bought much more!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh? What do you mean?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Well... As I walked around,  
all these merchants approached me with their wares...  
Trying to sell food, accessories, occasionally even weapons.  
  
**Monika：**  
Even weapons?  
It would be one thing if this were a warzone,  
but I've never heard of merchants peddling weapons to tourists.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ninon explained all the items for me in detail.  
If she hadn't pointed out that they were of no real use to me,  
I might have given in and bought them out of sheer curiosity...  
  
**Monika：**  
Excellent work, Ninon.  
You boldly protected Kuka from nefarious sales tactics.  
As a reward, take this taiyaki  
 that I purchased just now.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Oh, Monika.  
Thank you very much...  
  
**Monika：**  
You seem short of energy, Ninon. Is something the matter?  
 ...Ah?!  
Could it be... you wanted the custard filling, not the sweet bean paste?!  
Custard taiyaki are also delicious,  
 but these are my favorite of all!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Y-you've really gotten hooked on those, huh...  
  
**Ninon：**  
I'm also a fan of sweet bean paste, but no, that's not it.  
I was just thinking that Oedo today  
seems somehow different from when I visited before...  
  
**Teahouse Owner：**  
Ah, so this is where you ended up!  
  
**Monika：**  
Why, if it isn't  
 the proprietor of the teahouse  
where I purchased these taiyaki.  
Did you want something?  
  
**Teahouse Owner：**  
I thought you might have finished the taiyaki by now,  
so I brought some dango! You'll buy them too, right?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Huh...?  
Th-they do look tasty, but we're still eating these...  
  
**Monika：**  
Well, he did bring them all this way for us.  
Let's see... I'll take one each of the salty and sweet flavors.  
  
**Teahouse Owner：**  
Coming right up!  
A pair of skewers for each of you six.  
  
**Monika：**  
T-two *each?!*  
I... I really just wanted the two for myself!  
A-ah well.  
 I suppose I can still eat plenty.  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-I'll have some as well...  
  
**Yuki：**  
So sorry, but I really don't have room...  
  
**Teahouse Owner：**  
Hey, once you're done with those, drop by again!  
I'll have our sweetest anmitsu ready for you all!  
We've got souvenirs aplenty, too, so you should take a look around!  
  
**Monika：**  
Sweetest, you say...?!  
N-no, wait a minute!  
 I didn't mean to promise we'd—  
...And he's gone.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Th-the people here  
certainly are eager to sell their goods, aren't they?  
  
**Monika：**  
Indeed.  
I didn't think he'd follow me all the way here...  
  
**Yuki：**  
I suppose after witnessing my beauty, he could hardly resist  
finding an excuse to come here and gaze upon me again...  
I'm sorry for the trouble, everyone.  
  
**Monika：**  
Th-that's one interpretation...  
Still, if we're not careful, we may find all the merchants  
we've visited today chasing us to sell more wares.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Something's definitely strange!  
  
**Ninon：**  
It's true that Oedo Town has always been big on selling to tourists,  
but I've never seen them use tactics like this!  
  
**Monika：**  
The town seemed full of vigor to me at first,  
but I'm starting to think that's not quite right.  
Far from lively, these people seem almost desperate...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Besides, it's super weird that we haven't seen any women in kimonos!  
I was just walking around town with Kuka,  
and her outfit got funny looks from everyone!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-I even thought I heard whispers like \"Poor thing...\"  
and \"I suppose she'll be next...\" as I walked by the townsfolk...  
  
**Monika：**  
E-excuse me?!  
That sounds positively ominous!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Hearing those degrading comments from all around  
made me... made me feel...  
 Eheh... Gueheheh...  
  
**Monika：**  
...I should have known better than to worry about you.  
  
**Monika：**  
Still, I must say,  
it seems like some manner of incident is afoot.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Oh dear... So much for our nice relaxing vacation.  
Let me guess. You think we'd better investigate?  
  
**Monika：**  
N-no...  
Well, personally, as a soldier, I wish to defend the people,  
but it would be wrong of me to, ah...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
...What's wrong, Monika?  
  
**Monika：**  
N-nothing at all!  
Very well! We of Weissflügel: Landosol Branch will investigate  
this matter, so that we may enjoy Oedo in its rightful state!  
  
**Narration：**  
So {player} and his traveling companions,  
after deciding on a time and place to meet up,  
went their separate ways to inquire among the locals.
