# Oedo Investigators
Failing to make progress in their investigation, the group sits at a teahouse wondering how to proceed. The owner once again starts to get pushy with his wares, but is moved by Ninon's plaintive reaction and agrees to tell them what's really going on. Just then, a scream rings out from outside.
  
## Subtitle: Oedo Investigators
  
**Narration：**  
Having completed their individual investigations,  
{player} and the members of Weissflügel  
meet up at the agreed upon teahouse to discuss their findings.  
  
**Monika：**  
Anmitsu... Beautiful *and* delicious...  
The red bean paste, draped with a sweet black sauce...  
So this is perfection... A perfect harmony...!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Togoku cuisine really is good, isn't it?  
I'm worried I might put on weight...  
  
**Yuki：**  
That should be no issue.  
These Togoku sweets seem much less fattening than Landosol's cakes.  
  
**Ninon：**  
The sweets of Togoku are all delicious,  
but strawberry daifuku is my favorite!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  So, how did the investigating go?  
`Tag 1`  
**Ayumi：**  
W-well, um...  
  
**Monika：**  
...Could you not tell  
that we were indulging in sweets to avoid that topic?  
  
**Yuki：**  
For the record, whenever I asked anything,  
the townsfolk just started stating obvious facts  
like \"Your beauty is greater than the gods.\"  
  
**Yuki：**  
In fact, they even offered to provide  
trinkets to complement my beauty,  
so I ended up buying a few more hairpins.  
  
**Ninon：**  
It was the same for me...  
All of my questions were cunningly evaded,  
and they kept trying to sell me things instead.  
  
**Ninon：**  
I tried my best to refuse,  
but this Deluxe Great Lucky Cat's charms  
were just too tempting to resist!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Oh, absolutely!  
Before I knew it, I was buying a fine set of sturdy ropes,  
far thicker than the vines that usually entrap me...  
  
**Kuka：**  
W-well, I admit I was  
tempted by them without much prompting...  
 *drool*...  
  
**Monika：**  
...I-I'm glad you found something to your liking.  
My experience was similar. As I tried to establish a rapport,  
I was sold this konpeito candy...  
 I must try it later.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I managed to escape without buying anything,  
but because of that, I didn't get to ask any questions at all...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
H-how about you, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  They tried to sell me toys.  
**Choice: (3)**  They tried to sell me kimonos.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kuka：**  
T-t-t-toys, you say...?!  
Mr. Sadist, just who were you planning to use those on?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Huh? Just normal toys for children?  
Oh, um, I thought...  
 Never mind! It's n-nothing at all!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Ayumi：**  
...{player} in a kimono...?!  
Aaaahhhh... Th-that I have to see!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Urgh... Why didn't I suggest it  
back when we were at the clothing rental shop?  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Ninon：**  
Looks like we only found souvenirs,  
and no new information at all...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
It's pretty clear there's *something* not right here, though...  
  
**Monika：**  
Yes, indeed. This behavior all seems far too aggressive  
to explain as an ordinary sales technique.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Then we must investigate further!  
  
**Monika：**  
Yes. I can't ignore this mystery.  
Let's go outside and try asking the townsfolk once more together.  
  
**Teahouse Owner：**  
Oh—wait a minute!  
You can't leave yet!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh? Is something wrong?  
I'm sure we paid the bill...  
  
**Teahouse Owner：**  
No, no, you should order something else!  
Look, why not try our famous green tea crackers?  
  
**Ninon：**  
...  
  
**Yuki：**  
I can understand your desire to keep my beauty close by,  
but I'm afraid we're in a hurry.  
  
**Teahouse Owner：**  
That's OK!  
You can eat these while walking!  
  
**Kuka：**  
B-but I think we've all eaten more than enough right now...  
  
**Teahouse Owner：**  
Some of these manju buns, then!  
They're nice and portable, they'll last for days, and...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Please... stop doing this!  
  
**Monika：**  
N-Ninon...?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Why... Why must you try so hard to sell your goods  
that you ignore people's feelings?!  
  
**Teahouse Owner：**  
Wh-why...? Well, that's...  
Th-that's got nothing to do with outsiders like you!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Oedo Town was a happy place  
filled with Togoku hospitality and a plucky downtown spirit!  
But now... This is all wrong... It's not right...  
  
**Teahouse Owner：**  
W-well, dang...  
  
**Monika：**  
Good sir... My friend Ninon is a lover of Togoku culture,  
and a lover of this town that treasures it.  
That's why its current state pains her so deeply.  
  
**Monika：**  
If there's a reason behind this, please tell us.  
There may yet be something we can do to help.  
  
**Teahouse Owner：**  
D-dang it all!  
 D'you think...  
D'you really think  
 I *want* to be doin' business like this?!  
  
**Teahouse Owner：**  
But I... I've gotta pay the Magistrate's taxes somehow...  
  
**Monika：**  
The \"Magistrate\"? Who exactly would that—  
  
**Townsperson's Voice：**  
Aaaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
A-a scream?!  
It came from outside!  
  
**Monika：**  
Good sir,  
please wait here for a moment!  
Let's move, everyone!  
  
**Narration：**  
So {player} and co. rushed out of the teahouse  
towards the source of the scream.
