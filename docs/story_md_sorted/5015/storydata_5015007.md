# Peace in Oedo
The Weissflügel members receive a letter of thanks from Oedo Town, complete with an invitation. When they arrive back at the town, they are welcomed as the heroes who brought peace to Oedo. And against the backdrop of a great shogun statue, the townsfolk cheer wildly for their one true shogun.
  
## Subtitle: Peace in Oedo
  
**Narration：**  
A little while after their defeat of the Evil Magistrate,  
the members of Weissflügel: Landosol Branch are spending an  
ordinary day at the guildhouse when they receive an intriguing letter.  
  
**Monika：**  
Everyone, this letter is an invitation from the people of Oedo Town.  
They would like us to visit again in order to thank us properly.  
  
**Ninon：**  
An invitation?!  
Then that means we can go back to Oedo soon!  
  
**Monika：**  
Well, yes, I suppose so.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Ah, I see. They couldn't bear to be without my beauty for long.  
To think I stole the townsfolk's hearts so swiftly...  
Occasionally,  
 my beauty scares even me.  
  
**Monika：**  
Um, I don't think that's exactly the reason...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
What's life been like there since we defeated the Evil Magistrate?  
  
**Monika：**  
That much was quite clear from the letter.  
With the tyrant gone, his accomplice in the palace was arrested,  
and the town has recovered the peace it originally enjoyed.  
  
**Monika：**  
Without the need to pay unreasonable taxes,  
the merchants will doubtless be far less aggressive.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Then we should go right now!  
I can't wait to see the happy Oedo again!  
Haha...  
  
**Monika：**  
Yes, you're right.  
 Let's enjoy ourselves to the fullest.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Huh...?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Y-you're not going to object?!  
  
**Ninon：**  
I-I only made that suggestion out of wishful thinking...  
I didn't think you'd really approve it!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Um... Monika,  
 could it be the taiyaki I bought you just now  
has gone to your head and stopped you from thinking straight?  
  
**Monika：**  
Wh-why are you all so surprised?!  
Was what I said really so strange?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Didn't you make everyone promise to train hard?  
**Choice: (2)**  You're acting awfully kind today...  
`Tag 1`  
**Monika：**  
Well...  
 Yes, I suppose I did.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Monika：**  
When you say that, it sounds like I'm not usually a kind person!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Monika：**  
But the Oedo incident was an ordeal for us all.  
I think we've earned a little proper recreation.  
  
**Monika：**  
Besides, ah... it made me feel closer to all of you than ever...  
And... I suppose that made me happy...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Oh, Monika...!  
  
**Monika：**  
W-well, never mind all that!  
Are we setting off for Oedo Town or aren't we?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-it really is a beautiful place...  
I'll never get tired of the sight.  
  
**Townsperson 1：**  
Hey!  
Look, over there!  
  
**Townsperson 2：**  
Could those people be...?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Wh-what's this about?  
The gazes of the townsfolk all seem to be turning our way...  
  
**Yuki：**  
Yes, all eyes are upon me...  
My beauty always does  
 make me the center of attention!  
  
**Mayor：**  
Welcome to Oedo, Master Shogun and company!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Oh! It's Mr. Mayor!  
  
**Mayor：**  
Thank you all for coming.  
And above all, for saving our humble town from the peril it faced!  
Now feast your eyes upon this symbol of our eternal gratitude!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Why, that's...  
 a statue of you, Shogun!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Oh, wow... I kind of want one too...  
  
**Mayor：**  
To express our gratitude, we set our finest artisans to work!  
We've also composed an epic saga chronicling your great exploits,  
so allow me to recite it for you in full!  
  
**Monika：**  
A-an epic saga?!  
You went as far as all that?!  
  
**Mayor：**  
Our tale begins in the streets of Oedo.  
The Evil Magistrate was going about his usual wickedness  
when the mighty shogun stepped out with a flourish!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Th... this already sounds a little different from reality...  
  
**Mayor：**  
Behind the incomparable shogun stood his loyal attendants.  
First, the fearless Monika unsheathed her blade  
with a heaven-rending flash...  
  
**Monika：**  
W-wait, isn't this a little overdramatic?!  
 My first strike was blocked!  
And besides, just unsheathing my blade rends the heavens?!  
What kind of chaos would I unleash with an actual attack?!  
  
**Mayor：**  
Radiant as an angel, Kuka, with a belt spanning countless mountains,  
stood unflinching and unafraid in the path of a thousand blows...  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-I-I-I didn't do anything that impressive!  
Actually, that whole scene was completely mortifying, so please don't...  
Oh,  
 but... this agonizing shame is a little thrilling...?!  
  
**Townsperson 1：**  
I tell ya, we've gotta make more shogun merch!  
For starters, a Shogun Manju Bun!  
Heck, let's make a whole Shogun Platter!  
  
**Townsperson 2：**  
Oh, what about accessories?!  
Fans, hairpins... or even netsuke ornaments!  
  
**Townsperson 1：**  
In that case, we simply have to make  
a dress-up mechanical doll that captures Yuki's divine beauty!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Th-these people are all acting very strangely...  
Should they really be this overexcited?!  
  
**Monika：**  
C-could it be... another villain has arisen  
to disturb the people's hearts?!  
 Ninon!  
If anything comes to mind, tell me...  
  
**Ninon：**  
This is it...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
...N-Ninon?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Now this is the Oedo Town I remember!  
Fights and festivals are the flowers of Oedo!  
Everyone, join me in a mighty cheer for our shogun!  
  
**Monika：**  
You're on their side?!  
  
**Teahouse Owner：**  
All right! Leave it to us, girlie!  
Everyone, you with me?!  
  
**Mayor：**  
Oh, yes!  
 I would be honored to take part!  
  
**Townsfolk：**  
Shogun! Shogun! Shogun!  
Shogun! Shogun! Shogun!  
  
**Ninon：**  
C'mon, guys! Come over and join the fun!

**Monika：**  
Oh... oh, fine, then!  
If chant I must, then chant I shall!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-I'd be too embarrassed to chant out loud...  
...Ah?! The shogun is Mr. Sadist...  
 Which means...  
He's behind all this?!  
 What a cunning ploy to humiliate me!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Well, he was a big help to us this time around,  
so I suppose I can offer him the rare treat of my angelic voice! ♪  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I-I think I can do this!  
It really isn't my style...  
but if we're chanting {player}'s name, I'll do my best!  
  
**Ninon：**  
OK then, guys! All together now!  
  
**All：**  
Shogun! Shogun! Shogun!  
Shogun! Shogun! Shogun!  
  
**Ninon：**  
C'mon, Shogun!  
At this rate,  
 we'll have all the lands conquered in no time!
