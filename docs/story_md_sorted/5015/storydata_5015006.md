## Subtitle: Whitewings in Formation
  
**Narration：**  
While the Weissflügel members were busy preparing a plan of action,  
the Evil Magistrate has been traveling around the town,  
claiming his exorbitant taxes from the honest townsfolk.  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Well, I think that's everything for this sector.  
Time to move on to the next district.  
  
**???：**  
You will go no further!  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Wh-who goes there?!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Deke-deke-den!  
One! Flounders of humans' bloody feast!  
  
**Kuka：**  
T-two...! Creepy dudes who wallow in lewds...  
Ahhh, lewds...  
 *drool*...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Three...  
D-d-demands that paint this... water... world...?  
  
**Yuki：**  
Four: used utensils insufficiently cleaned.  
Ah, but how beautiful I would look by comparison...! ♪  
  
**Monika：**  
Five...! N... needles that will pass no thread...!  
  
**All：**  
Meet your end at our hands!  
We are Weissflügel: Landosol Branch!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
This is, um... th-the most embarrassing thing I've ever done!  
  
**Kuka：**  
...Th-they're watching... Everyone is staring  
with cold and judging eyes... But  
 that's the best part...!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Ahhh... Even in this situation, the eyes of the world are drawn to me...  
Truly, my beauty is the gravest of sins!  
  
**Monika：**  
E-endure it, everyone!  
I'm sure this is all an important part of the plan!  
  
**Ninon：**  
So cool...  
 That was so cool!  
It's even better when we do it as a team!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I-I get the feeling it had nothing to do with the plan!  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
My, my... Well, if it isn't the mighty shogun  
and his entourage of sniveling cowards.  
I'm impressed you dare to show your faces after last time.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Heheheh.  
Will you be so confident after you see this?!  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Hah... What kind of joke is this?  
You've brought... a bundle of patchwork cloth?  
How is that going to help you?  
  
**Ninon：**  
A bundle of cloth...  
Are you sure that's all it is?  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Hrmm...? That flap at its base...  
C-could that be... a kimono belt?!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Indeed it is! Behold, Mr. Evil Magistrate!  
How do you like this long, long belt?  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Belt... Belt...  
Beeeelt... Beeeeeelt....  
Give that... belt to meeeeee...!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Heheheh...  
 I suspected as much!  
You were the one stealing those belts all along!  
  
**Monika：**  
Wh-what did you say?!  
  
**Ninon：**  
When he attacked Kuka, she wasn't hurt, but her belt was damaged...  
Because it was her belt that he was trying to steal all along!  
  
**Monika：**  
Ah, I see.  
 The proprietor of the teashop did mention  
that the belt thief first appeared  
around the same time the Evil Magistrate arrived.  
  
**Ninon：**  
...Th-that information was a key part of my deduction!  
  
**Yuki：**  
...She'd forgotten it, huh.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Th-that's the face of someone who just remembered...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Wow... Ninon is so smart...!  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
The belt... Give me the belt...  
Must pull...  
 Let me pull it...  
You know... you... like it...!  
  
**Monika：**  
Wh-what's this?  
The Magistrate is acting strangely...  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Evil Magistrates...  
 pull kimono belts...  
The belt...  
 The... belt...

**Evil Magistrate：**  
NNGGUUOOOOAAAGHHH!!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Th-the Magistrate's body is changing form!  
It looks like...  
 one of the mechanical dolls we saw in the shops?!  
  
**Monika：**  
That would explain why my scabbard attack had no effect at all.  
So this is a monster born from a mechanical doll,  
imitating the Evil Magistrate it represents...  
  
**Monika：**  
And that predictable behavior lets us manipulate him to our advantage.  
Impressive, Ninon! When I first heard your belt plan, I was incredulous,  
but your grasp of the situation far exceeded mine!  
  
**Ninon：**  
...M-m-m-m-my point exactly!  
I definitely didn't just think that since he aimed for Kuka's belt,  
a bigger belt might distract him!  
 Nothing like that at all!  
  
**Yuki：**  
That reaction... She was just going on complete instinct, huh?  
  
**Kuka：**  
E-even a fool like me can tell she's bluffing now...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Wow, Ninon's amazing... I need to be more like her!  
  
**Ninon：**  
N-now!  
All that remains is to tie this belt around the kimono-clad Kuka,  
and we'll have the perfect Evil Magistrate bait!  
  
**Kuka：**  
U-ummm... About that part. Even for me, being tied up  
and used as bait for a terrible monster...  
 sounds positively thrilling,  
but also, um... more than a little terrifying...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Kuka... you're our only hope.  
**Choice: (2)**  Stop moving and let me tie you up.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kuka：**  
...Ahh! Using honeyed words in such a cruel situation?!  
You truly are a natural born and incomparable sadist!  
Um... I-i-if you'll have me, I'll gladly submit to your will!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kuka：**  
A-a public declaration of bondage?!  
He's finally thrown all pretenses aside!  
B-but... when he speaks so assertively, I can't defy his orders...!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Ninon：**  
That's my shogun!  
 Superb negotiation skills!  
Now for some ninja clone speed knot-tying... Shubababa!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
L-looks like someone needs to hold Kuka steady...  
I suppose I can... Waaahhh?!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Honestly... I can't bear to watch this.  
Allow me to share the load as well.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Yuki... Thank you so much!
