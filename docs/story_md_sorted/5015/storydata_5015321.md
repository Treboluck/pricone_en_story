**Evil Magistrate：**  
Oh? You defeated my phonies.  
How very impressive!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Heheheh... As if we would ever fall for such a simple trick!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-I thought we struggled quite a bit...  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Then how about this?!  
Lowly peasants! Behold my riches!  
  
**Monika：**  
Wh-what's this?  
He threw something this way...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Those are koban coins!  
And those ornaments are Lucky Cat Kings!  
All of them are priceless treasures!  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
All these precious items you could never obtain...  
No peasant can resist the temptation!  
Go on, display your basest greed for the world to see!  
  
**Monika：**  
Hah... If you think a proud soldier would be swayed by bribery...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Th-that box! Could it be?! The Golden Monaka!  
Said to be the finest of all Togoku sweets,  
even I have never tasted a single bite!  
  
**Monika：**  
...I... I will not... be tempted...!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Th-there's nothing here that I particularly want,  
but the sheer thrill  
 of being pelted with items  
is too much for me to take!  
  
**Ninon：**  
B-both of you, try to focus!  
It looks like I'll have to handle this myself!
