This incredible strength...  
He certainly is living up to his namesake,  
the embodiment of all Togoku's evil...  
  
**Ninon：**  
But Evil Magistrates in the Togoku stories

**Kuka：**  
Wh-what? They aren't...?!  
From the menace in his eyes, I thought he must be  
some kind of truly legendary sadist...  
  
**Monika：**  
I was similarly assuming that, though weak to authority,

**Ninon：**  
As a rule, they're weak to women and money,  
and end up being defeated by the hero in a single strike!  
  
**Monika：**  
...Perhaps this battle will be easier than I thought.  
Comrades, let us finish the wretch!
