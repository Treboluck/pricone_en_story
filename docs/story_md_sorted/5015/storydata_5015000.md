# Oedo Awaits!
Though they still have no notable achievements to their name, the members of the guild Weissflügel: Landosol Branch have been making steady progress with their day-to-day work. Deciding that they've earned a break, they set out to pay a visit to the town of Oedo at Ninon's recommendation.
  
## Subtitle: Oedo Awaits!
  
**Narration：**  
The members of Weissflügel: Landosol Branch,  
together with {player}, are out collecting materials  
for their guild's latest assignment.  
  
**Monika：**  
All our missions have been like this lately...  
When will we be able to conquer an actual monster threat?  
  
**Kuka：**  
A-actually, I don't mind collection jobs...  
After all, sometimes my arms get tangled in tentacle-like vines...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ahhh, they're tying my hands up right now! The more I resist,  
the tighter they become, as though trying to tear me apart...  
And all of this out here in the open! Oh, I can't... I can't...!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
K-Kuka?! Are you okay?!  
I'll get those off you right away!  
  
**Kuka：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
 Th-thank you very much.  
Ah, but you could have waited a little longer...  
No... you should have simply left me to my fate!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Th-the things that Kuka says are a deep mystery to me,  
but I too am quite fond  
 of jobs like this!  
  
**Monika：**  
I can't say I dislike them myself...  
But with mundane tasks occupying all our time,  
my pride as a valiant soldier of Weissflügel is languishing unfulfilled...  
  
**Yuki：**  
Well, you military types have a different way of life from us.  
Isn't that the issue here?  
Personally, I'd rather place the pursuit of beauty above all else!  
  
**Monika：**  
...Hm?!  
P-perhaps you're right.  
I suppose I am the only actual soldier here.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Something up?  
**Choice: (2)**  Are you tired? Do you need a piggyback ride?  
`Tag 1`  
**Monika：**  
Ah... No, it's nothing!  
Nothing at all...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Monika：**  
D-do you take me for a child on a field trip?!  
I am certainly not exhausted! And I can walk on my own!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Ayumi：**  
Oh, but all those jobs we've completed  
have really added up, haven't they?  
  
**Yuki：**  
I hear the rewards have amounted to  
quite a hefty sum in our guild's coffers.  
...Though I'm not privy to the exact values.  
  
**Monika：**  
If I were to tell you, you'd spend every last rupie on yourself!  
Still, for a guild performing mundane missions,  
it's true that our funds are nothing to sneeze at.  
  
**Yuki：**  
We shouldn't let all that money go to waste.  
What do you say we put those funds towards...  
enhancing my beauty still further?  
  
**Monika：**  
Why would we do that?!  
We should use them to benefit the whole guild!  
  
**Yuki：**  
But if my beauty grows...  
Our whole guild... nay, the entire world will be blessed!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
W-well,  
 I can sort of see the logic in Yuki's idea.  
If the money's going to waste, why not treat ourselves a little?  
We could go on a trip together or something!  
  
**Monika：**  
No, recreation isn't the goal.  
Couldn't we put it towards a brand-new training scheme?  
  
**Ninon：**  
I agree with Ayumi!  
I would love to go on a grand pleasure trip with you all!  
  
**Kuka：**  
P-pleasure, yes!  
 Ahhh!  
I-I-I-I long for sweet release!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Y-you're still stuck in those vines?  
At any rate, an outing sounds magnificent to me too!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Looks like everyone's pretty into the idea.  
**Choice: (5)**  Don't you want to have fun as a guild, Monika?  
`Tag 4`  
**Monika：**  
Ahh... So be it, then.  
I suppose we have all earned a break.  
  
**Monika：**  
Though it still pains me to think that word of our deeds  
has yet to reach my homeland...  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Monika：**  
Th-that's not the issue here.  
I just thought there were more important things we could be doing...  
  
**Monika：**  
But I suppose it would be wrong to spoil everyone's fun.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Monika：**  
Very well! If you'll all agree to train hard afterwards,  
I shall lead you all on a recreational outing!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Training, huh?  
Well, I suppose it's a small price to pay for a free vacation.  
  
**Yuki：**  
But in return, we'd better find a truly inspiring location to visit!  
A place with scenery that will complement my beauty! ♪  
  
**Ayumi：**  
A-as... as long as {player}'s there, I don't mind  
where we go...  
 Oh, but somewhere romantic would be ideal!  
The softer the starlight, the more wonderful he'll look bathed in it...!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I'd like... somewhere without too many people.  
 Oh, but wait...  
Being ravished by Mr. Sadist in front of a crowd...  
 \"Show them all  
what a naughty girl you are\"?! Th-that sounds good too...!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
How about you, Monika? Where would you like to visit?  
  
**Monika：**  
I-I'd like, um...  
somewhere with lots of sweet treats...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh?  
Um, I'm sorry. I couldn't quite hear you just now...  
  
**Monika：**  
I-I said nothing!  
I'm fine with wherever you all want to go!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
A... are you sure?  
Still, this is awkward. With so many different preferences,  
I'm not sure how we'll find a destination to satisfy everyone...  
  
**Monika：**  
That may be true... But this is a rare opportunity!  
It would be a shame not to account for everyone's preferences...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hohoho!  
Friends of mine, you seem ready to throw in the sumo towel,  
but fear not! You can leave this to me!  
  
**Monika：**  
Come to think of it, we didn't hear your opinion yet.  
Is there somewhere you'd like to go?  
  
**Ninon：**  
I desire a destination that fulfills all your wishes!  
A place with fine scenery, a minimum of crowding,  
and also full of romance!  
 The perfect vacation spot!  
  
**Monika：**  
Yes, but surely we'll never find...  
 Wait.  
Do you have somewhere specific in mind, Ninon?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Indeed I do!  
Its name is...  
 Oedo Town!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Oedo Town?  
That doesn't sound familiar.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Just what kind of place is it?  
  
**Ninon：**  
You'll have to wait and see  
 when we arrive!  
  
**Narration：**  
So {player} and his friends from Weissflügel,  
trusting in Ninon's confident recommendation,  
set out for the little-known town of Oedo.
