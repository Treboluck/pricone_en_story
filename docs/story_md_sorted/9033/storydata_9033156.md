**Karyl：**  
Heheh, how'd you like my strategy?! A perfect plan!  
We should've just blasted wildly from the beginning!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What's the matter, Kokkoro? You look a bit concerned...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
No...  
 Rather than careful planning based on knowledge,  
sometimes decisive action is the best solution...  
I have learned a valuable lesson today.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Uh, honor student much?!  
I dunno how she can live like that at her age.  
...Maybe I'll try teasing her.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh...? I just spotted something moving!  
D'you think it could be a second chameleon?  
 ...Haha, not!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah!  
 Miss Pecorine, lend me one of your rice balls!  
This time, I will be the first to attack!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thieving beast number two! You will not escape from me!  
Yaaaahhhh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm... Where could it have gone? Over here?! Yah! Yah!  
Or this way, perhaps?! Hi-yahhh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A second mealy one...?! Now it won't just be a hotpot—  
we can have steak and crispy legs too!  
Wait for me, Kokkoro! I'm coming with you!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey—wait, you two! I-I just imagined it! It isn't real!  
So hurry up and get back here!
