**Narration：**  
{player} and Hiyori, having taken on a monster extermination quest together,  
find themselves out of town taking care of business.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
This is it! Down you go!  
  
**Monster：**  
Rrrrghhhhh!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Good stuff, Mr. Knight!  
And with that, we're done for the day!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Things sure go a lot quicker with you helping, don't they?  
Thanks,  
as always!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Now that we're done, let's go grab a bite to eat.  
My treat, too!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Whoa! W-what's with this light?!  
It's so bright!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey, wait a minute...!  
This happened before, didn't it...?!

**Captain：**  
One, two, three, four!  
Yup, looking good!  
You especially, Hiyori. Keep it up!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I will, thank you!  
  
**Captain：**  
That's what I like to hear. Seems like you're all still good to go,  
but let's take a quick break. Getting kinda tired myself, here.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Okay!  
Phew...  
Guess I'll go get some fresh air.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hmm?  
Is that who I think it is?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It is!  
Hey, over here!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Lemme guess, you came to see me practice?  
Aww, that's so sweet of you!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Just kidding, haha. Is something up?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I got lost, so here I am.  
`Tag 1`  
**Hiyori：**  
Really?!  
 Okay,  
lemme show you the way back once I'm done.  
Don't go anywhere until then!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Actually, just come in and watch.  
Might as well, now that you're here!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Don't worry, everyone else'll be fine with it.  
If anything, they'll appreciate some input!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
So yeah, no need to stand about.  
Come on, let's go!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey!  
I've got a friend here that wants to watch. Is everyone cool with that?  
  
**Captain：**  
Hmm? No issue on our part. Who is he, though?  
Did you get yourself a boyfriend, perhaps?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Nope.  
**Choice: (3)**  You bet she did.  
`Tag 2`  
**Hiyori：**  
Urgh...!  
I mean, it's the truth, but still.  
You could have played it up a bit...

`Tag 3`  
**Hiyori：**  
Er, what?!  
H-hold up! Where'd that come from?!  
We're, uh, not in that sort of relationship...  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Hiyori：**  
He's my...  
Actually, what ARE you to me?  
We're friends, and uh...  
  
**Captain：**  
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.  
Long story short, it's just a matter of time.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
H-huh?!  
Come on, what's with that grin?!  
I just stated a fact!  
  
**Captain：**  
Worry not, my pretty little dunce.  
If he wants to hang around and watch, he's more than welcome.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yay!  
Right then, back to it we go.  
Think it's time we go for a full twist!  
  
**Captain：**  
Really? We still haven't managed to pull one off, so far.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I've got a good feeling about this one.  
Besides, we gotta get it down sooner or later!  
  
**Captain：**  
Oh ho. You wanna show him your stuff, don't you?  
Fair enough. I'll back you up.  
Okay troops, get ready!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Awesome! All right, on your marks—

**Hiyori：**  
Well, that sure was embarrassing...  
Messing up's one thing, but I went and sprained my ankle too...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
And on top of that, now you gotta carry me. Sorry...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Man, this sucks. I was so sure I'd pull it off today.  
Was hoping I could show you something cool,  
but so much for that!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Don't worry about my ankle, though.  
It's just a little sprain, so no big deal.  
A few days of sitting around and it'll be brand new!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  You've got my support.  
`Tag 5`  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh... So you wanna help me out until it heals, huh?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ehehe. That sounds good.  
Okay, then! I'm already feeling a little better now!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Ready to walk on your own now?  
**Choice: (7)**  You've got even more of my support.  
`Tag 6`  
**Hiyori：**  
Huh? Come on, you know the answer to that.  
Gimme some more support!  
  
Jump to tag 8  
`Tag 7`  
**Hiyori：**  
Ahaha. Thanks!  
Feels like I'm on my way to a speedy recovery now.  
  
`Tag 8`  
**Hiyori：**  
Well. If you're gonna support me, then I'll do the same!  
It won't make up for carrying me home,  
but hey. This is what cheerleaders do!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Come on, let's go! Carry that gal all the way to the goal!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
How's that? Feeling a bit more spirited?  
I hope you are... cause I put all my feelings into it!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
You're going out of your way for me,  
so it's only fair that I get myself back in shape quick.  
So yeah, good luck until then. ♪

**Ameth：**  
And there we have it. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So that's what Hiyori looks like in cheerleader gear...  
Not bad. Not bad at all.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, it sure seems like she's fond of people giving it their all.  
And that just makes her want to help them all the more.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Makes sense,  
considering her fondness for you.  
You've always got your hands full with something.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That said, it wouldn't be fair to rely on her all the time.  
Keep an eye on her, make sure she's holding up well.  
You know the drill. That's enough for today, though. Catch you later. ♪

**Hiyori：**  
*yawn*  
Huh? Did I, uh, randomly fall asleep again?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, looks like it wasn't just me.  
We gotta be more careful, though. Last thing we need  
is monsters jumping us when we're out for the count.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
What's that? You'd force yourself awake to keep me safe?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That's nice, but you'd... have a hard time on your own.  
You gotta get yourself in shape first!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Okay, how about this?  
You get started on that, and I'll support you as you go!  
That'll help you get stronger quicker, don't you think?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yeah, just like in that dream!  
Wait. You had the same one?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Huh... Well, that makes things easier.  
We'll just copy what we did there!  
Nothing better than knowing someone's cheering you on.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Also... I'd kinda, uh...  
I wouldn't mind if you carried me back to town. Just once.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
T-trust me! It'll be a good way to get into shape!  
  
**Narration：**  
Unable to refute her endless reasonings,  
{player} carried Hiyori back to town.
