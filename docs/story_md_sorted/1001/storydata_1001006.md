**Narration：**  
With the martial arts tournament a day away,  
Hiyori finds herself resting at the Twinkle Wish guildhouse.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Tomorrow's the big day,  
so might as well rest up. Gotta be in tip-top shape!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Let's see...  
Yup, I don't have anything scheduled.  
Awesome! Time to chill out!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
*fidget*  
  
**Hiyori：**  
*fidget, fidget*  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...*fidget*! *fidget*!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Argghhh! I need something to do!  
There has to be something! Anything!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Practice is out of the question, though.  
Then I won't be in perfect shape for tomorrow.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I know! I can go for a walk!  
No better way to refresh the mind and soul like a nice stroll, I'd say!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hmm... Well here I am.  
It's not enough, though! Just walking around can't keep my mind off things!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Come on... There has to be something.  
...  
Hmm? Is that who I think it is?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It is! Mr. Knight!  
Hey hey, do you need a hand with anything?  
I'm like, super free right now! I can help with anything and everything.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, you don't?  
Aww, that sucks.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
How come? Well, you know I've got that tournament tomorrow, right?  
I decided to take today off for it, but....  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I just can't settle down if I'm not doing anything!  
How am I supposed to cope with this?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I'm begging you. Help me out here.  
Do you have any genius ideas?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Take some deep breaths.  
**Choice: (2)**  You could try... tying yourself up?  
`Tag 1`  
**Hiyori：**  
Sure, I'll give it a shot!  
*inhale*  *exhale*  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey, wait a minute! That's the trick for when you're nervous!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Hiyori：**  
Great idea!  
OK, give me a hand.  
Tie me up so I can't move about!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Wait, how's that gonna help me rest?!  
It'll just tire me out mentally!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Hiyori：**  
Urgh... This is a nightmare.  
How do people normally rest?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hmm? You think I should stop pushing myself?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I'm, uh, not really doing that though?  
If anything, I'm doing the opposite by avoiding practice and stuff.  
Not that it's helping much.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  There's no need to rest if you're already in top shape.  
`Tag 4`  
**Hiyori：**  
...Oh.  
Now I get it. Forcing myself to rest is the issue in the first place, right?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I've already put the effort in,  
so it'd be stupid to stress out over this.  
Thanks. I needed that.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Right then. Time to stop being dumb. No point in changing myself,  
so I'm just gonna be who I always am. That's the best way to prepare.  
  
**Girl：**  
Ow...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
And with that said,  
it's time to go help that person over there!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'll join you.  
`Tag 5`  
**Hiyori：**  
Thanks!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey, are you okay? Did you hurt yourself?  
  
**Girl：**  
I think I sprained my foot, yeah...  
It hurts whenever I try to move it.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh no, that's terrible!  
Don't worry, we'll get you back to town!  
  
**Girl：**  
I'm thankful for the gesture, but are you sure?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Absolutely. If someone's in need, then I'm there to help!  
Right, Mr. Knight! Let's do this!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I'm glad we found her so quick.  
Things could have went south real fast there.  
Her foot's gonna heal up in no time as well, so that's a relief.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Thanks for helping out, by the way.  
Tomorrow's gonna go real well now. I can feel it!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
So, uh... Come cheer me on, if you can.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh...  
Well, work's work.  
It wouldn't be right to skip it.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I'll hurry over the second I'm done.  
`Tag 6`  
**Hiyori：**  
Right,  
got it. I'll be sure to keep winning until you do.  
Don't be too slow, though! Otherwise I might win the whole thing.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ehehe. Just kidding!  
  
**Narration：**  
In that moment,  
Hiyori found herself with another reason to win the whole tournament.
