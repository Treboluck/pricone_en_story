**Narration：**  
On one of his usual strolls about town,  
{player} stumbles across Hiyori, who seems to be looking for something.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Man, this is weird...  
It should be around here somewhere...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, Mr. Knight!  
What's good?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hmm? You wanna know what I'm doing?  
Well, uh...  
D-don't worry about it! It's no big deal!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hmm? I looked like I was in a pickle?  
You really do know me well, don't you?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Really though,  
don't sweat it! I can handle it on m—  
  
**Hiyori：**  
W-whoa?! What's the deal?!  
I-it's so bright!

**Hiyori：**  
Hey, Picky!  
Where'd you go?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I swear it flew this way...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
You'd think it'd reply, what with it being a parrot and all...  
Hey, Picky! Where are you?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Urgh... So much for that.  
Now what do I do?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It's a bit far,  
but maybe I should head back and ask for help.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Hold up. Where the heck am I?!  
It's a school for sure, but it ain't my school!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh man, are you kidding me?  
I really chased it all the way out here?  
Good job, dumbo!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
W-what am I supposed to do now?!  
Err... School should, uh, be that way?  
But I came from that way, didn't I...?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Uh-oh. I'm lost, aren't I?!  
Not good, not good!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You okay?  
**Choice: (2)**  Get her attention.  
`Tag 1`  
**Hiyori：**  
Do I look okay?!  
I gotta ask for directions, but there's no one around!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Correction! There *was* no one around!  
H-hey there!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Hiyori：**  
W-whoa, someone's actually here to help?!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Hiyori：**  
I'm so glad you're here. Are you a student here, by any chance?  
I'm, uh, kinda lost...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Long story short, the parrot we're keeping at school escaped.  
So I went and chased after it, but somehow got lost on the way...  
Would you mind giving me directions back?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I never even found it, to boot...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Huh? It's up in that tree?  
  
**Picky：**  
Catch me if you can! Catch me if you can!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, you're right!  
How'd it get up there?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Don't worry, Picky!  
I'll get you down in a jiffy, so just stay put!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Right!  
The tree's not that big, so I should be able to climb it.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
First things first, though.  
Don't you dare look up, okay? I don't want you peeking under my skirt!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I mean it, buster!  
Stay right there until I get back. That's an order.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Up! We go!  
Don't fly away on me, Picky!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Aaand...  
 there we go! Picky's been secured!  
Now for the hard part. Stay put while I get us down from here...  
  
**Picky：**  
This sucks! This sucks!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
H-hey there! Don't struggle!  
...  
Oh, shoot! I-I'm gonna fall!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Owwie...  
Wait a minute, it doesn't hurt as much as I expected?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Whoa, are you okay?!  
Sorry... You held up your end of the bargain,  
but I ended up flattening you.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh!  
You actually went out of your way to save me?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Thanks! That was super duper kind of you!  
And look, both me and Picky are fine thanks to it.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Right, time to head ba—  
W-wait! I'm still lost, aren't I?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
What's that? You'll show me the way back? Thanks!  
By the way, do you mind if I ask how old you are?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Really?! You're older than me?!  
I swear I thought we were the same age, haha.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Okay, thanks for getting me this far!  
I'm pretty sure I could make it back from here with my eyes closed.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Really though, thanks so much for your help.  
Not just for showing me the way, but also with Picky.  
You really saved my butt! Catch you later!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh yeah! Hey, what's your na—  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, he's gone already.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Well that sucks. I wanted to get his name.  
Hopefully I'll bump into him again sometime...

**Ameth：**  
And there we have it. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Think of what you just saw as something of a dream.  
Chances are you'll forget about it the second you wake up,  
so no need to brood over it that much.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That said, leave it to her to get lost like that.  
Hiyori's pretty much the definition of tunnel vision, isn't she?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Most people wouldn't go that far for a parrot, right?  
But she did. She knew people would be sad about it,  
so she put herself out there to find it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She really is something, isn't she?  
The sort of person that just can't stand to see others in trouble,  
so she'll prioritize them over herself.  
Probably makes her life a lot harder.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Then again, you're the same as her.  
Makes sense that you get along.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You know how much she's willing to push herself.  
Try and stick by her as much as you can.  
Make sure she doesn't burn herself out.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, that's enough for today.  
Catch you later. ♪  
  

---  
  
**Hiyori：**  
M-mmm...?  
Huh, when did I fall asleep?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Looks like you were sleeping, too.  
So both of us just collapsed in the middle of the street?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey.  
Call me crazy, but did you have a dream where you helped me out?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I knew it! Guess who had the same dream?  
Hmm, I wonder if this has any connection to those dreams the four of us were having...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Anyway, thanks for helping me out!  
It was just a dream, but I still felt super hopeless.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Being stuck somewhere I didn't know was bad enough,  
but not knowing if anyone would help was even worse.  
I was honestly scared...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
But then you came! And all that fear just went poof,  
you know?  
Like it was never there in the first place.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I guess that's what it's like to feel super relieved, huh?  
I wouldn't mind feeling like that more, if I'm being honest.  
So maybe I'll start relying on you a lot more...  
*glance*  
  
**Hiyori：**  
You're fine with that?  
Wahey! Thanks!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Well then, no point in waiting...  
Truth is, my pet managed to escape.  
Do you mind helping me look for it?  
  
**Narration：**  
With this new experience behind them,  
Hiyori became much more willing to rely on {player}.
