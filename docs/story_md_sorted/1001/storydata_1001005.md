{player} offers to be Hiyori's sparring partner for an upcoming martial arts competition, but the situation gets slightly hairy when he accidentally grabs her tail after getting caught in a grappling hold.
  
## Subtitle: The Tail's Off-Limits!
  
**Narration：**  
After another day of helping out at the nearby dojo,  
Hiyori sees off the young students there.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Good stuff, everyone!  
Take care on your way home, okay?  
  
**Children：**  
Okay-dokie!  
  
**Boy：**  
Thanks as always, teach!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Nice and lively, even after practice. That's what I like to see!  
Can't let them show me up,  
 so it's time for my own practice.  
Not long until the tournament at this point!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I'd hate to get in the way while the dojo's still in use,  
so let's go find somewhere else.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hmm? Isn't that...?  
Oh hey, it is!  
Mr. Knight! What're you doing here?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Another walk? Figures!  
Me? I've got a martial arts tournament coming up,  
so I'm about to head out of town for a bit of practice.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Offer to help.  
`Tag 1`  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, you wanna come along?  
Sounds good!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
No time to waste. Let's get rolling!  
There's a little spot I use all the time, so I'll take you there.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ta-da! Here we are!  
Feel free to chill out.  
I'll get ready in the meantime.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hmm? You wanna know about this stuffed animal?  
I can't remember how or when,  
but Yui got it from somewhere.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Look at that white, fluffy fur. It's so huggable!  
It's also the perfect size, so I'm using it as a training dummy of sorts.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I'd prefer it if practice felt closer to the real thing,  
but I don't really have any proper sparring partners.  
Most of the time I just end up going at it on my own.  
Like this!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
The best part about this thing is that it just. Won't. Break!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That said, it's not perfect either.  
It's good for regular strikes and stuff, but anything more advanced  
is a bit tricky. Throws,  
grapples, all that good stuff.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Offer to be her sparring partner.  
`Tag 2`  
**Hiyori：**  
Whoa, I didn't expect that!  
Awesome, though! I'll take you up on that.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Let's start with grapples, then.  
I'll try and put you in one, so you do your best to get out of it.  
Anything goes, so feel free to retaliate if you need to.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Okay. Let's get this started.  
Ready or not, here I come!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Dodge her.  
**Choice: (4)**  Retaliate.  
`Tag 3`  
**Hiyori：**  
Heh, fooled ya!  
I knew you'd dodge if I did that!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Hiyori：**  
Whoa!  
Close, but you're gonna have to do better than that.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Hiyori：**  
Aaaand!  
Gotcha!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hehe, I thought you'd last a little bit longer.  
Oh well. The stranglehold's locked in tight,  
so you won't be escaping anytime soon.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Try and escape anyway.  
**Choice: (7)**  Attack her.  
`Tag 6`  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey now, you shouldn't struggle like that...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ah, man. I told you, didn't I?  
You're locked in, so the more you struggle, the more it'll hurt.  
  
Jump to tag 8  
`Tag 7`  
**Hiyori：**  
Nah, that won't work.  
Think about it. You're already one arm down,  
and your other one won't reach me in this position.  
  
`Tag 8`  
**Hiyori：**  
So, how about it? Feel like giving in?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Not yet?  
Fine by me!  
We've got time, and I can keep this locked in all day!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Don't get too stubborn, though. I don't wanna hurt your arm tha—  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Persist.  
`Tag 9`  
**Hiyori：**  
Whaddameow?!  
Anything but the tail!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Aww... I broke the hold...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
R-really, though.  
Grabbing the tail isn't fair. That's the first time anyone's done it...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I-I'm calling foul play on that one!  
You had other ways to get out of that hold, didn't you?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Well, I AM the one who put you in it in the first place...  
You just refused to give in, though.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
A-anyway! That's the last time I practice grapples with a guy.  
*sigh* I really gotta find a girl to spar with, don't I?  
  
**Choice: (10)**  What if we stick to strikes, then?  
`Tag 10`  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, that's a good idea!  
They're a lot simpler, so there shouldn't be any issues.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That stuffed animal can only get me so far, if I'm being honest.  
It's not bad, but the best kind of practice is with other people.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
So yeah, let's keep at it.  
Also, thanks. I really appreciate it.  
  
**Narration：**  
Seeing how determined {player} was to help her out,  
Hiyori couldn't help but feel incredibly happy.
