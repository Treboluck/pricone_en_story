## Subtitle: A Promise Worth Keeping
  
**Narration：**  
Hiyori, on her way back to Landosol after finishing up a job,  
finds herself under attack by a particularly tough monster.  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Urgh...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It ain't over yet!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That said, this monster's way tougher than usual!  
I might actually lose at this rate...!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Help Hiyori out.  
`Tag 1`  
**Hiyori：**  
Mr. Knight?!  
How come you're here?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Monster first, talk later.  
`Tag 2`  
**Hiyori：**  
Right, good point. Let's waste this thing!  
  
**Monster：**  
Rrrrghhhhh!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Phew... Down it goes.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Thanks for the help, Mr. Knight!  
Honestly, that was just a bit too close for comfort. Ehehe.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, so you just happened to be in the area?  
Either way, I still owe you one!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I'd have bailed if you were even a second slower.  
That thing was brutal.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hmm? You owed me one for last time?  
Hey, not true at all!  
We both helped each other out back then!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Well, I guess I owe you one now.  
Wouldn't be right to leave things as is.  
So yeah, give me a call if you need anything!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh come on, no need to hold back.  
  
You can say no all you want,  
but that won't stop me!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
What's that? You're just gonna repay me in turn?  
Ahh, so that's how you're gonna play it...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
In that case, I'm just gonna have to repay you for repaying me!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Actually, there's way too much repayment going on here.  
I'm starting to lose track,  
haha.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
In fact, this might go on forever if we keep at it.  
Especially since we keep helping each other out.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Not too bad in and of itself,  
but there has to be a better way to handle it.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, how about this?  
There's two of us, so let's make the most of it.  
Plenty of other people could do with our help.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Sounds good, right?  
That'll break us out of this loop nice and good.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
If you wanna help someone out, then I'll join you.  
And if I wanna help someone out, you can join me.  
Makes sense,  
right?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Sounds good.  
**Choice: (4)**  Let me think about it.  
`Tag 3`  
**Hiyori：**  
Awesome!  
Sorted, then!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Hiyori：**  
Huh?!  
D-don't tell me I got too ahead of myself...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
We need to sort out how to get in touch with each other first?  
Wait, you're already thinking that far ahead?!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Hiyori：**  
Glad that you're on board with this.  
Hmm. How about we make it official, though?  
With a pinky promise, of course!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Bit hard to do that like this, though.  
Gimme a sec... There we go!

**Hiyori：**  
Ahaha! I bet you thought they were real paws.  
But nope! They're just gloves.  
Anyway, let's get on with it.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Pinky pinky promise!  
A broken promise means a broken finger!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It's official now, so no going back on it!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That said, I know you wouldn't break a promise.  
So let's help as many people as we can!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, we weren't done yet.  
Ehehe.  
There we go!  
  
**Narration：**  
{player}, knowing how important this promise was,  
swore to himself that he would never break it.
