**Narration：**  
One day, Hiyori and {player}  
accept a request to escort a caravan.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Mr. Knight, look! I think those people over there are escorts as well!  
It really is a huge caravan, isn't it?  
  
**Escort 1：**  
So you're the other guys taking the job, huh...?  
You better not hold us back.  
  
**Escort 2：**  
Hehe. Doesn't matter if they're a bandit or a monster, we'll cut down  
*anyone* who gets in our way!  
Got it?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yikes.  
...What a scary bunch.  
I wonder if they'll actually protect the caravan.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Mr. Knight. Suddenly, I'm not so sure about this anymore...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are you okay?  
**Choice: (2)**  Are you all right?  
`Tag 1`  
**Hiyori：**  
Okay...  
Um, yeah. Yeah! I'm okay now.  
You're here with me, so I know everything will be fine, no matter what  
happens!

`Tag 2`  
**Hiyori：**  
Yeah...! I'm all right.  
Just a tiny, tiny bit though.  
Eheheh. Thanks for worrying about me!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Man：**  
Heeey, you two!  
Get to your stations! We're about to depart!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yes, sir!  
Let's go, Mr. Knight!  
There's no point in hanging around here getting all  
worked up, is there?!  
  
**Man：**  
We're going straight through the forest with no breaks!  
Everyone, be extra vigilant of your surroundings!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yes, sir!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...  
Walking through the gloomy forest like this really takes me back  
to that time I came to the woods with Mr. Knight and the others.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Back then, the bandits dressed up as monsters  
and attacked us...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Hold on. I think I just heard something...  
It might've been tailing us since we entered the forest...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Excuse me!  
Please stop for a minute!  
  
**Man：**  
Is something wrong?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I think we're surrounded by people or monsters!  
We should spread out before proceeding!  
  
**Man：**  
Are you certain?!  
Okay, everyone, stay alert in case of an attack!  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Tch! They're on to us!  
Pretty perceptive bunch!  
Let's get down to business!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
You got it!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
So you finally showed yourselves!  
You've been following us, haven't you?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Let's all work together to take them down! Here I go!  
  
**Escort 1：**  
Just when escort duty was getting boring.  
There couldn't be more perfect prey! Yahhhh!  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Tch! You've got quite the swing, huh?!  
Hrraaagh!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Whoa! You won't get away with that!  
Hyah!  
  
**Escort 2：**  
There's no way I'll lose either!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Uwah!  
I get the feeling this one likes to get messy...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It's going well!  
Let's keep the pressure on!  
Yahhh!  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Ooow, ow, ow...  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Damn you...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Phew...  
Looks like we got them all.  
Everything's fine now!  
  
**Man：**  
Right. Thanks to you noticing them shadowing us,  
we were able to keep damage to a minimum. Good job!  
  
**Man：**  
But I think it might be a good idea  
to return to Landosol and regroup.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
We gotta hand these bandits over to Nightmare, and do loads of other  
stuff, right?  
If you like, we can take it from here!  
  
**Escort 1：**  
Reprobates!  
They've sure got some nerve thinking they can attack us like that!  
Eat a fist, you little rat!  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Ouch... Please stop...  
We'll never do anything like that ever again...  
  
**Escort 2：**  
You can't trust a word that comes out of the mouths of scumbuckets  
like these!  
Kiss my foot, you cockroach!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
P-please don't... Someone stop him...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Why are you still attacking them?!  
You're taking it too far!  
  
**Escort 1：**  
This way we don't have to go back to Landosol!  
It's better if we take care of them ourselves!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Wait! They've already shown remorse for their actions!  
There's no need to keep terrorizing them!  
  
**Escort 2：**  
Huh?! Why are you standing up for these lowlifes?  
Listen, if you don't wanna get hurt, then get outta my way!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Forget about it!  
There's absolutely no way I'm gonna move from this spot...!  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Y-you...  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
*sob*... *sob*  
  
**Escort 1：**  
Listen,  
as long as we help the client, it's fine!  
  
**Escort 2：**  
Besides, all we're doing is dishing out the appropriate punishment for  
the crime they committed. They were trying to steal other people's stuff.  
So it makes perfect sense.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
No, you're wrong!  
This isn't something *you* should be doing!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You are going a bit overboard.  
**Choice: (5)**  That's enough.  
`Tag 4`  
**Hiyori：**  
Right! You can't torment a prisoner  
just 'cause they did something bad!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Hiyori：**  
There's no need to harm them like this...  
Even though they've done bad things, they're still human beings!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Escort 1：**  
Tch. Quit your preaching!  
When a person does something bad, they deserve everything they get!  
  
**Man：**  
Hmmm... I-I suppose...  
They are criminals in the first place...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
But... using that logic, it wouldn't matter how small the bad deed was,  
you would use it as justification to inflict pain on someone.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That's just wrong!  
So you can't hurt these people any more!  
  
**Man：**  
...You're right.  
If you say so, we'll go back to Landosol and surrender the prisoners to  
Nightmare.  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
...H-hey, little girl.  
Why did you stand up for bandits like us...?  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
How open-minded...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Why...?  
'Cause you guys were in trouble.  
Right, Mr. Knight?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I scratch your back, you scratch mine!  
`Tag 7`  
**Bandit 2：**  
...Are you for real?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Why would I lie at a time like this?  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Hahahah...  
You guys are somethin' else.  
We truly are sorry. We'll atone for our sins like grown men...  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
We'll never do anything bad again, and we'll turn ourselves in once  
we're back in Landosol. Also, we promise to do everything you tell us to.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Well,  
can you promise me that you won't touch your weapons  
until we make it back to Landosol?  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Sure, we can agree to that...  
But aren't you gonna confiscate them from us...?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Nope!  
I have total faith in your word!  
So please don't do anything bad ever again. Got it?  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Y-yes...! We promise!  
  
**Escort 1：**  
Tch. What's with that brat...?  
Suddenly taking away all of the fun. Unbelievable.  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
Well then, we will take custody of these bandits.  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Little lady, thanks for everything that you did for us. Sorry again...  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
And you too, young lad, thanks.  
  
...I can say with certainty that we owe you our lives.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
No problem. Thank you too!  
We're both really glad that you kept your word!  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
...If only we were able to meet someone like you sooner.  
Farewell.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...  
There they go.  
I really hope they do reflect on their mistakes.  
  
**Escort 1：**  
Ha! Don't count on it!  
  
**Escort 1：**  
Eventually there'll come a day when you pushovers will start to regret  
being so naive.  
  
**Escort 1：**  
Make sure we never see your faces again! Bye!  
You'll both die a dog's death someday, you stupid idiots!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Pushover...  
Am I really that much of a soft touch?  
Was it wrong of me to stand up for the bad guys?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Not at all.  
**Choice: (9)**  You're very admirable.  
`Tag 8`  
**Hiyori：**  
...Yeah,  
you're right.  
It doesn't matter who they are—if I see someone in trouble,  
I can't just ignore them!

`Tag 9`  
**Hiyori：**  
I'm not admirable at all.  
I saw what was happening and just acted out of impulse, that's all.  
  
`Tag 10`  
**Hiyori：**  
Mr. Knight.  
Thanks for cheering me up.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I don't care if I get called a pushover.  
From now on, as many times as necessary,  
no matter the kind of  
person, I'll help anyone in need!  
  
**Narration：**  
With a reinvigorated spirit,  
thus vowed Hiyori deep within her heart.
