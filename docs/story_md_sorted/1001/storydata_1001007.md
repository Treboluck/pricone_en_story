## Subtitle: Something to Fight For
  
**Narration：**  
With the martial arts tournament in full swing,  
Hiyori has successfully progressed to the finals.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oww...  
I'm pretty beat up,  
ahaha.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Should've figured it wouldn't be so easy.  
There's a ton of strong competitors from all over the continent.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I managed to make it this far, at least,  
but my body won't hold up much longer. Moving's already proving to be a struggle.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That said, I can't give in now that I'm at the finals.  
Losing's not an option... I gotta win this!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...I wish he was here, but I guess work was too busy after all.  
Actually,  
no. He'll come for sure. I don't care if it's after I win,  
so long as he's there to see it. That's all that matters.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Right, let's do this!  
  
**Announcer：**  
Ladies and gentlemen, and all those in between! The finals are upon us!  
Competitors, please make your way to the arena!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Okay!  
I'll be right there!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Haaah!  
  
**Opponent：**  
What's the matter, kid?! That all you got?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh man, he's strong!  
I figured he'd be as exhausted as me, but he's not!  
  
**Opponent：**  
You're lookin' a bit out of breath.  
Got tired after making it all the way here, did you?  
Sorry, but I ain't gonna hold back!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I-I don't need your pity!  
I wanna fight you at your best! Otherwise it's not even worth winning!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Or so I said, but I'm at my limit here.  
I won't last much longer...  
  
**Opponent：**  
No time for breaks!  
This tournament's over!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
This isn't good...!  
Ugh! I hate this! I made it so far, too!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Don't give in!  
`Tag 1`  
**Hiyori：**  
Was... was that Mr. Knight's voice?  
Where is he?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh... It's him. It's really him...  
He... He actually made it!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
He made the effort to get here. For my sake!  
I can't let him down. I won't let him down.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I'm winning this!

**Opponent：**  
Grrggh! W-what the...?!  
Where'd that burst of strength come from?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It'd be lame if I lost here! Especially while he's watching!  
Get ready! You're goin' down!  
  
**Opponent：**  
Don't write me off just yet, kid!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Urgh...  
N-No big deal!  
This is nothing...! I'm gonna win, no matter what!  
  
**Opponent：**  
Graagh!  
  
**Announcer：**  
And down he goes!  
Which makes Hiyori our new champion! Congratulations!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I... I did it!  
I won, Mr. Knight!  
  

---  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Finally home... Thanks for the help, Mr. Knight.  
I, uh, don't think I'd be able to walk properly right now.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You okay?  
**Choice: (3)**  Congratulations.  
`Tag 2`  
**Hiyori：**  
I-I'm fine.  
If anything, I'm more buzzed about winning!  
Urgh! Oww...  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Hiyori：**  
Thanks!  
I only pulled it off thanks to you!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Hiyori：**  
Truth is, I was ready to give in.  
It just seemed so hopeless, you know?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
But then it happened. I heard your voice resound through the arena.  
That somehow gave me the energy to keep going.  
So yeah, it's all thanks to you!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That's why I...  
I wanna...  
tell you... something...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
H-Huh?  
The... the relief's kinda... starting to... wash over me...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Sorry, I think I need to crash...  
I'm... I'm struggling... to keep my eyes open...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Thanks, Mr. Knight...  
I was... so, so... happy...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Zzz... Zzz...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Thank you so much. I mean it...  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus Hiyori got some much deserved rest.  
In the arms of her beloved {player}, no less.
