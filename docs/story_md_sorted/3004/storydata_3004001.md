# Caon Episode 1
Caon, formed as a means to protect their fellow beastfolk, is a guild of many unique characters. Though their personalities may clash, their focus remains as one, and thus they find themselves on patrol tonight as well.

**Maho：**  
Hmhmhmm... ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Arf?! That tickles!  
Spare me already, Princess!  
  
**Maho：**  
Come on, Makoto.  
Be a li'l more steady for me.  
  
**Maho：**  
Your hair's just always all over the place, ya know?  
Makes me all fidgety when I see you like that.  
  
**Maho：**  
Don't go forgettin' that you're a girl as well.  
I'll make you nice and purdy, just like you should be.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Urgh...  
Is there really any point, though?  
Not like I've got anyone to show off to in the first place!  
  
**Makoto：**  
And besides, my hair's just gonna get  
messy again after another scrap or ten.  
You're wasting your time here!  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh? Mighty confident about that happening, aren't we?  
Sure hope you're not getting yourself involved in anything too dangerous.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hmph.  
That's just part of the job, ain't it?  
  
**Makoto：**  
It's not even a dirty job, either.  
Keeping our fellow beastfolk safe is the whole reason Caon exists.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Don't worry. I'm not running around picking fights on my own.  
I wouldn't put that sorta burden on you.  
  
**Maho：**  
That's the last thing on my mind.  
I'm much more concerned about your safety.  
  
**Maho：**  
There's no good in letting your fists  
do the talking over your mouth.  
  
**Maho：**  
And it'd be an awful shame if a beauty like you was covered in scars.  
Just have a li'l think before you spring into action, okay?  
I'd hate to imagine anything happening to you.  
  
**Maho：**  
Really now.  
Y'all can be too hot-headed for your own good.  
Trustin' your instincts is one thing, but y'all take it a li'l bit too far.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Heh!  
It's not all bad, is it?  
Saves us the hassle of walking on eggshells and all that.  
  
**Makoto：**  
If there's one thing you won't find in Caon,  
it's people with a bunch of secrets.  
Live on instinct, act on instinct.  
That's how we do it. ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Would you *please* have the decency to be quiet?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hmm?  
What's the deal, Kasumi?  
Did I get on your nerves or something?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hmph.  
Fancy ourselves the center of attention, do we?  
My issue isn't with you, alas.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It *is* with that dancing dolt over there, though!  
Is there any need to keep that up at all hours of the day?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hmm...  
No denying that I'm pretty dumb compared to you.  
But hey. It's nighttime now!  
  
**Kaori：**  
All day. All night. All year!  
I'm always jiving! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
How about you join me for a post-meal dance?  
All that pent up stress'll go whoosh!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Argh, I swear!  
Do me a favor and cut it out with that stupidly loud instrument,  
at the very least!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Sheesh.  
How did I end up with an office this loud?  
I can't even organize my thoughts here!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aww, Kasumi! You're supposed to be the smart one!  
This is *our* guildhouse, not your office.  
Complaining about what other people do is bad manners, y'know?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Just laugh it off, feel good, and get along.  
That's the secret to world peace. ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
*You* have the cheek to tell *me* about manners?  
Look at you! You're a half-naked dancing deviant!  
I-I've got serious concerns about your character!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ahaha. ☆  
I'd love to jump into a proper bikini,  
but it's a bit too chilly around these parts.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I swear to Ameth,  
I'm talking to a brick wall here.  
 And it's beyond infuriating!  
Try saying something logical, for pete's sake!  
  
**Makoto：**  
N-now now...  
No need to fight, you two.  
  
**Maho：**  
Aye.  
We're all friends here. Understood?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hmph.  
I suppose it's only fair that I get reprimanded.  
More so considering my position.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Only a proper fool would cause friction  
in the place they're freeloading at.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oh, no worries. That wasn't a fight.  
Just one-sided abuse from Kasumi.  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'm down for the dance of peace, though.  
Get that book outta here and let's jive. ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hey! I was still reading that!  
I-it's brand-new, too!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ahaha...  
And now we're back at square one. Go figure.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm...  
Suppose that's just how it is here.  
  
**Maho：**  
I oughtta get my act together, though.  
I'm listed as the guildmaster, whether I like it or not.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Seems pretty fine as-is, if you ask me.  
Free-spirited and lively, just the way I like it. ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
That said, though.  
Kinda feels like the guildhouse is starting to get a bit too full.  
Which is impressive considering how big it is.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Guess it makes sense that people'll get a bit stressed out  
when we're packed up like sardines in here.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Which makes this as good a time as any for a walk.  
Can double as us going out on patrol, too,  
so I ain't taking no for an answer.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Dancing and reading's all well and good,  
but I'm gonna need you lot to do some work now and then!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Gotcha!  
Fair enough, too. It's bad manners to run around inside.  
Let's get going, Kasumi. ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Whoa! Don't hug me out of the blue like that!  
You're a little bit too touchy-feely for your own good, you know that?  
  
**Kaori：**  
I get that a lot!  
But hey. All us beastfolk are family in the end, right?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Nah. Not just us. Beastfolk, humanfolk, demonfolk, elves.  
We all gotta get along.  
That's the real secret to world peace. ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'm afraid it's not that simple, my dear.  
You might want to get your head stuck in a book sometime.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The more you read, the more you'll understand  
just how much evil lurks within this world.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Will do, will do!  
You always look like you're having a buncha fun, so I want in on it too!  
Got any nice recs for me, maybe? ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I do indeed. A plethora of classics.  
That said,  
they may prove to be a little bit difficult for you.  
  
**Kaori：**  
No worries!  
But hey. If I'm gonna read, then you should dance with me sometime.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'll get in touch when I feel like it.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Now that we've reached a compromise, though,  
I can't help but feel like perhaps *I'm* the odd one out here.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Let's agree on a stalemate, shall we?  
I was partly in the wrong, myself.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Nah. I'm sorry too.  
Makes sense to get kinda annoyed if  
someone's being super loud all the time.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
No need to apologize.  
You weren't that loud in the first place,  
so I'm to blame for making mountains out of molehills.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
If anything, I'm sure it'd make for the perfect  
accompaniment to my reading should I get used to it.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Most importantly, it's my responsibility to adjust myself to  
Caon's atmosphere. The last thing I want is to get myself kicked out  
for disrupting everyone else's lifestyles.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Especially when all that would be waiting for me is  
the stray cat life once again. I've been here a little bit  
too long to go back to that.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
All that said, however, I'm very much against the concept  
of moving.  
Enjoy your walk together. I'll enjoy my books.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Naaah. We gotta go together.  
The wind's blowing all the way from back home today! ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ahaha...  
From foes to friends, huh?  
Making me feel dumb now for getting worried.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Not that I'm complaining, though.  
Nothing wrong with everyone getting along. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Yup, yup!  
Nice and peaceful, just how it should be. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Now, then.  
Time for a mighty fun walk.  
  
**Maho：**  
All together, hands held.  
Then none of us will get lost. ♪
