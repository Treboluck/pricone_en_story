# Caon Episode 3
Knowing an inspector from the Menagerie is scheduled to pay Caon a visit, Maho attempts to dress Makoto up. Makoto makes a swift escape, however, leaving Kasumi to devise a special plan in response. Dubbed \"Operation North Wind and the Sun,\" she works together with Maho and Kaori to seize and dress Makoto up once and for all.

**Kaori：**  
Haitai, everyone!  
I'm back! ☆  
  
**Kaori：**  
Me and Kasumi were out patrolling!  
'Cause we're besties! ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Let's be a little more transparent, Kaori.What *actually* happened  
is that you shoved me on your shoulders,  
walked right out of the  
guildhouse and forced me to tag along until you were done.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Some would class that as kidnapping, you know.  
And trust me. A criminal and their victim are by no means \"besties.\"  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You really are a curious one though, aren't you?  
Most people wouldn't even bother with someone as odd as me.  
Don't you find it boring to be around me all the time?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Nah. Not at all.  
You're pretty much the exact opposite of me,  
so it's always real fun talking to you. ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Well then.  
Not that I mind. It's hardly a bother.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
If anything,  
it makes me really happy that she's always trying to keep me involved.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
She wants to be friends with me.  
But I can't just leave it all to her. I have to make an effort myself, too.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Outta the way, troops!  
Quit standing right in front of my escape route! That's my only lifeline!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Eek?!  
Wh-what's all this about?!  
  
**Maho：**  
Makoto!  
No need to run from me!  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh!  
Welcome back, you two. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Do you two mind helpin' a gal out?  
I was gonna dress Makoto up all purdy,  
but she ran off the second she noticed.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha...  
Guess you're playing dress-up with her again?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hmm. I'm not a fan of that, if I'm being honest.  
Forcing someone to wear what they don't want isn't  
a sign of affection. It's simple abuse.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Damn right! You tell her!  
Spare me already, Princess. I'm begging you!  
  
**Makoto：**  
You know all that frilly stuff doesn't suit me!  
It's way too girly!  
  
**Maho：**  
Aw, gosh. You're a fine girl as well, Makoto.  
At least let me brush your hair.  
You'll be mighty cute by the time I'm done. Promise.  
  
**Makoto：**  
No chance!  
I ain't gonna be cute no matter what you do!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Anyway!  
I've gotta help out back home,  
so I'm off!  
  
**Maho：**  
Wait!  
Shucks. Was hopin' today would be the day I get her dressed up all lovely.  
  
**Kaori：**  
You and your clothes, Maho.  
They aren't *that* important. We were all born in the nude.  
Might as well lay it all bare, I'd say.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Nope.  
We'll be having none of that.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That aside, though.  
You seem awfully persistent today.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I can only assume that there's a reason you  
absolutely *need* to get Makoto all dressed up.  
  
**Maho：**  
Yeah... It's a li'l bit sudden,  
but the Menagerie's sending an inspector over here tomorrow.  
A real bigwig, at that.  
  
**Maho：**  
All 'cause of what happened with Nightmare not that long ago.  
Them takin' their business straight to us caused a real stir.  
  
**Maho：**  
The top brass had a big discussion and did some negotiatin'.  
Turns out they're leanin' towards  
settlin' things peacefully.  
  
**Maho：**  
That ain't as simple as it sounds, of course.  
They still need to deal with the aftermath,  
not to mention inquiries and the like.  
  
**Maho：**  
It's my job to deal with the person comin' in for the inspection,  
but Makoto played an awful big part in that whole mess.  
Only makes sense that they're fixin' to have her be part of the meeting.  
  
**Maho：**  
Which brings us to today.  
I wanted to make sure she at least looks the part.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha!  
Yeah, Makoto does have that rough look about her.  
Could almost pass as a bandit or something.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Makes sense that you don't want her turning up looking like that.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That's no excuse for trying to cover her in your frilly whims, I'd say.  
Either way, though. The situation is crystal clear now.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Long story short, there's no need to dress her up like a doll.  
We *do* need to make sure she's presentable, however.  
  
**Maho：**  
Yup.  
But that's the kicker.  
She just ain't havin' it.  
  
**Maho：**  
It's the perfect chance to dress her up all nice and purdy, ya know?  
A real shame, if you ask me.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
This would all be a lot simpler if you put your own desires aside, you know.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The Menagerie folks are our superiors at the end of the day, though.  
We can't afford to run the risk of coming off as being disrespectful to them.  
  
**Maho：**  
Aye.  
Moreso when some of the responsibility falls on us in the first place.  
  
**Maho：**  
Worst comes to worst, they might even disband the guild.  
We can't be havin' that now, can we?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That would be a significant issue, yes.  
I most definitely don't want to go back to the stray cat life anytime soon.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Okay, that makes things easier. Allow me to help out.  
A little bit of stimulation, and these ashen brain cells of mine  
will conjure up a plan in no time. ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
There we go.  
Fear not, oh guildmaster of mine.  
We'll have Makoto fixed into a proper lady in no time. ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Man.  
I could *really* do without all that sorta nonsense.  
But well. I know she's got good intentions, at least.  
  
**Makoto：**  
It's just...  
Dressing me up all nice just isn't gonna work.  
It ain't my style.  
  
**Makoto：**  
If anything,  
dressing like that might even rub people the wrong way.  
Or even worse, someone might just go, \"Who's this clown?\"  
  
**Makoto：**  
Now the princess and Yui...  
Those kinds of clothes definitely suit them.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I'd be lying if I said I *wasn't* interested,  
  
but it's just... kinda embarrassing to say out loud.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Whatever, though.  
I don't need to be cute.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hmm?  
Yo, if it ain't {player}!  
Didn't think I'd bump into you here. ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
On your way back home from a shopping trip, I guess?  
We're both headed the same way, so let's go together.  
  
**Makoto：**  
You're as feeble as they come,  
so I'll keep you nice and safe. ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hmm?  
Hey there.  
Why're you coming in so close?  
  
**Makoto：**  
I smell nice?  
 Oh, right. The princess used some  
perfume on me earlier. Went on about how smelling  
nice is the first step towards cuteness or something.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Not really keen on having smelly stuff sprayed on me, though.  
Hmm?  
Right, that's enough sniffing for you.  
You're making me feel embarrassed here.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Actually, now I'm curious...  
Do you like girls that, uh, dress up all pretty and cute  
and use nice perfume?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sorry. That was a weird question.  
Forget I said anything.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hmm?  
Shh! Quiet!  
I can sense someone suspicious in that back alley over there!  
  
**Makoto：**  
You stay back.  
It's been pretty sketchy around town recently.  
Could be a thief for all we know.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Man.  
Can't even get home without issues these days.  
  
**Makoto：**  
That's more reason to avoid cute, frilly clothes though.  
Glad I made a run for it when I did.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Doubt I'd be able to go all out when I'm worried  
about getting them all dirty or whatever.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Getting rough and tough is just right for me.  
That's how I was born. And how I'll always be!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh?! Something came flying out!  
I'll knock it right back at 'em! Hiyahhh!

**Makoto：**  
Urgh!  
Did it just explode?!  
Nah, that's not it. It split apart!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Pleh... The hell is this?  
A paintball?  
Or not. It's a plastic bag stuffed with paint.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Heh! ♪  
I laid the trap, and you took the bait, my dear Makoto.  
Hook, line and sinker.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Wait, Kasumi?  
What's the deal here?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Are you the one that threw the paint at me?  
If so, then you owe me an explanation.  
Expect me to get pissed if the answer's not good enough, too.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha!  
That one's on me.  
No one chucks stuff like I do. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Caon's united as one to carry out Operation North Wind and the Sun.  
And it's a mighty fine plan,  
 if you ask me. ♪

**Makoto：**  
You're all in on this nonsense?  
You guys must be real bored.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Heh.  
Struggling to parse your current situation, are we?  
Then allow me to explain.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Our dear guildmaster tried to force you into cute clothes,  
but that proved to be a tremendous failure.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That raised a simple question.  
Why force you into different clothes,  
when we can make you want to get changed of your own will?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You're not the type to mind the details.  
But you *are* the type to mind being covered in paint.  
If anything would make you want to get changed, it's that.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Thus, my plan was a simple one.  
In order to dress you up, we need to strip you down first. ☆  
  
**Maho：**  
Eheheh. Kasumi came up with the plan in a flash after spottin'  
some of the picture books I'd been collecting.  
You know I love me a li'l fairytale.  
  
**Maho：**  
It went awfully well too, I'd say.  
Just like the story the name comes from. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Kasumi was right.  
Forcin' you to do somethin' against your will just ain't right.  
I should have made you feel comfortable about it.  
  
**Maho：**  
A mighty good lesson, if I do say so myself.  
Thanks for the help, everyone. I really appreciate it. ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Heh.  
Come now, Maho.  
No thanks are needed between us.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Besides.  
I simply did what needed to be done.  
Caon is just as important to me as—nyeh?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
One bop on the head for all of you, coming right up.  
Your turn next, Kaori. Smackie. ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Waugh?! I'm all for peace and all against violence!  
Also, watch out when you're bopping us.  
The skull's way more solid than  
the bones in your hand, so you could end up hurting yourself.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Thanks for the warning.  
One bop for you too, Princess. Smackie. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Wah?  
Well, gosh. Eheheh...  
  
**Maho：**  
Makoto gave me nice li'l pat on the head.  
What a lucky gal I am. ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hey. That's not fair...  
I'm impressed at how sweet she can be in spite of  
looking like a ruffian at the best of times.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'll be honest, though.  
I expected you to be a bit more... incensed.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Do allow us the opportunity for an excuse.  
The Menagerie's sending along an inspector to the guildhouse tomorrow.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
We needed you to change into a much more appropriate outfit,  
even if it required forcing you to do so.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Well then.  
I do remember the princess mentioning something about that,  
now that you mention it.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Anyway.  
I ain't even close to pissed, so don't worry.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Especially since you all had Caon's best interests in mind.  
  
**Makoto：**  
That said, though. Really?  
Even I know the protocol when it comes to that sort of stuff.  
I'll make sure to dress properly tomorrow.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I'm not leaving it up to the princess, though.  
That's an accident waiting to happen.  
Lemme pick something based on my own taste.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Chances are I can just borrow some of my mom's good stuff.  
  
**Makoto：**  
More importantly...  
How about you lot quit coming up with dumb ideas  
and do some actual guild-related work for once?  
  
**Makoto：**  
If anyone's gonna get a scolding from the bigwigs,  
it's you.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
She has a point.  
Do we have any counterclaims to her argument, Maho?  
  
**Maho：**  
Not a one.  
As such, what say we all go shopping for clothes after this?  
  
**Maho：**  
Makoto's not the biggest fan of my tastes,  
but that ain't no issue if we all give suggestions together.  
Seems mighty efficient to me.  
  
**Maho：**  
Well.  
That, plus the fact that I just want to go shopping with y'all. ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Err. You realize I still gotta help out at home, right?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Don't worry your pretty li'l head.  
We can all go help out together once we're done. ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That makes sense.  
Conveniently enough,  
we've even got {player} here. How about you come with us?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
A little input from the opposite sex  
should keep things nice and balanced.  
  
**Maho：**  
Aye. Agreed.  
You'll never hear me complain about a shoppin'  
trip with my prince. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Eheheh.  
Now you've got a li'l sweetheart to show off to,  
don't you, Makoto? ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Come on, don't get him involved too.  
Though I guess it's not an issue if he's fine with it.  
  
**Makoto：**  
And I know for a fact that you lot ain't gonna  
change your minds at this point.  
  
**Makoto：**  
First thing's first, though.  
Someone wanna lend me a towel? I feel disgusting here.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Once I'm done with that...  
Well. I guess I can tag along.  
  
**Makoto：**  
You cool with that, {player}?  
Sorry for getting you involved in our dumb business.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sheesh. It's just one thing after another, ain't it?  
Talk about a handful.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Caon, the so-called protectors of the peace in Landosol.  
Never a boring day when I'm with you lot. ♪
