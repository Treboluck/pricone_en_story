## Subtitle: Our First Time Together...
  
**Narration：**  
Today, Akari and {player} have arranged to hang out together,  
but Akari has arrived at the meeting point a little early.  
  
**Akari：**  
I can't wait to spend some quality time with {player}!  
Who knows what might happen...  
  
**Akari：**  
I messed up last time, with the whole lingerie incident...  
But as long as I don't take him to a place like that,  
it should be fine this time, right?  
  
**Akari：**  
It's not like we haven't gone out to do stuff together before,  
but this is the first time we've met up just to hang out.  
My first time with {player}... I can't wait!  
  
**Akari：**  
Where should I take him?  
I wonder what kind of places he'd enjoy...  
  
**Akari：**  
Ohhhh... I do hope he shows up soon!  
  
**Akari：**  
...H-huh?  
This is when we said we'd meet up, right?  
There's no sign of him anywhere...  
  
**Akari：**  
It's not like {player} to be late for an appointment...  
But I guess everyone messes up once in a while!  
I'll wait a little longer.  
  
**Akari：**  
He's still not here...  
It's long past the time we said we'd meet up...  
  
**Akari：**  
I can't imagine he'd just cancel on me  
without even sending a message...  
  
**Akari：**  
C-could it be  
something serious happened to him?!  
He could be in danger!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hey, Akari.  
`Tag 1`  
**Akari：**  
Huh...? {player}?  
Are you okay?!  
  
**Akari：**  
W-well of course I'm flustered!  
Do you have any idea how late you are?  
I thought something had happened to you!  
  
**Akari：**  
It was no big deal...? Really...?  
So you're not even going to tell me why you're late?  
  
**Akari：**  
I was really worried about you, you know!  
I thought you might have been injured, or worse...!  
I really thought you were in trouble...!  
  
**Akari：**  
And now you show up and you won't even explain yourself?!  
You're terrible!  
 I'm not talking to you anymore!  
  
**Akari：**  
*pant* *pant*  
Maybe running away was excessive...  
But it's his fault, not mine!  
  
**Akari：**  
*pant*...  
I ran all this way to the spot with my favorite view  
But I wish I could have come with {player} instead...  
  
**Akari：**  
All he did was show up late...  
Maybe I blew up a bit too much...  
I'm sure he had his own reasons...  
  
**Akari：**  
Yeah!  
I've decided. I'll go back and apologize!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH!  
  
**Akari：**  
Wh-whaaaa?!  
A monster?!  
O-oh no, what do I do?! This is the worst timing!  
  
**Akari：**  
I've got to run!  
A-although... it doesn't actually look that strong,  
so maybe I should fight it?  
 ...No, running is definitely the safer—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH!  
  
**Akari：**  
A-aaaahhh!  
Nooooo!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Protect Akari.  
`Tag 2`  
**Akari：**  
{player}?!  
You took the monster's attack for me...!  
  
**Akari：**  
It's only a flesh wound...? B-but...!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Let's run.  
`Tag 3`  
**Akari：**  
Huh? Th-that's what we're doing now, huh?!  
I'm running, I'm running, you can stop pulling me!  
  
**Akari：**  
I don't see the monster chasing us...  
I think we managed to lose it.  
  
**Akari：**  
U-um, listen, {player}...  
Thank you so much for saving me.  
And, um... I'm sorry for getting mad at you back there.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'm the one who should say sorry.  
`Tag 4`  
**Akari：**  
No, it's not your fault at all.  
I am curious about why you were late, but...  
Oh, I didn't mean it like—  
  
**Akari：**  
...Huh? What's this package?  
  
**Akari：**  
A present for me?!  
You were running late because you bought this on the way?  
  
**Akari：**  
So you didn't want to explain because you were hoping to  
surprise me...  
 I'm so sorry, I didn't even think of that...  
  
**Akari：**  
Thank you for the present, {player}!  
Is it OK if I open it already?  
I wonder what's inside!  
  
**Akari：**  
This is... the lingerie you picked out for me before!  
Oh, that's so lovely!  
I'll think of you whenever I put it on!  
  
**Akari：**  
But... I can't believe you went back there on your own...  
  
**Akari：**  
Huh?!  
 You asked Yori to help you out?  
  
**Akari：**  
...Huh. Is that right.  
You were hanging out with my sister before meeting up with me.  
  
**Akari：**  
That does it! I'm gonna become the cutest girl in the world!  
Even cuter than Yori! You wait and see!  
  
**Narration：**  
For some reason, Akari suddenly seemed more determined than ever.
