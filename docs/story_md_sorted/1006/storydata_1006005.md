## Subtitle: So Big and Strong!
  
**Narration：**  
Today, {player} has agreed to help Akari  
explore a remote cave.  
  
**Akari：**  
{player}, thanks so much for helping me with this!  
Our guildmaster asked us to go on one of her errands...  
  
**Akari：**  
But today, my sister had something else important to do...  
I didn't want to come all on my own,  
so it's such a relief to have you here with me!  
  
**Akari：**  
What's the errand about exactly?  
Oh, we just need to fetch  
a rare magical crystal from the depths of this cave.  
  
**Akari：**  
It's not one of those caves that's home to monsters,  
so it shouldn't be dangerous at all!  
  
**Akari：**  
I know that in my head, but...  
I-it is pretty dark in here.  
It makes me kind of nervous...  
  
**Akari：**  
Aaaaaahhhhh!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Y-you're grabbing a bit tight there...  
**Choice: (2)**  Soft sensation... on my arm...?!  
`Tag 1`  
**Akari：**  
Ohh... I'm sorry...  
I just got... really scared...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Akari：**  
Oh, you big perv, you!  
This really isn't the time for that!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Akari：**  
I-I heard a noise!  
Help, {player}! There's something lurking nearby!  
  
**Akari：**  
...Huh? It's just running water?  
Thank goodness... It was so sudden, it made me jump...  
  
**Akari：**  
But you know, {player}...  
Your arm's so big and strong... Wow...  
Just holding onto it makes me feel really safe...  
  
**Akari：**  
It's hard to walk with me hanging on like this?  
W-well, that makes sense...  
I'd love to stay like this for longer, but I'll back off...  
  
**Akari：**  
U-ummm... {player}...  
I'm still scared,  
 so could we at least hold hands?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Sure, if you like.  
`Tag 4`  
**Akari：**  
Yayyy!  
Eheheh... That makes me feel much better!  
Right, let's go finish off this little errand!  
  
**Akari：**  
Look, {player}! I think this is the end of the cave!  
So, um... Where's that crystal...?  
  
**Akari：**  
Oh! I found it!  
All we need to do now is take this back!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH!  
  
**Akari：**  
A-a monster?!  
I thought there weren't supposed to be any in this cave!  
{player}... Wh-what should we do?!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Let's run.  
`Tag 5`  
**Akari：**  
Wahh!  
 Ah—{player}—! What are you...?!  
You're going to carry me out of here?!  
B-but... You mean, in your arms like this...?  
  
**Akari：**  
...Well, no... I guess I don't mind...  
Actually, this is kind of lovely...  
  
**Akari：**  
All right... I'll trust you to take care of me...  
So be gentle, okay?  
  
**Akari：**  
I think we must've come far enough.  
I still can't believe there were monsters after all...  
That was such a shock!  
  
**Akari：**  
But... I never thought you'd carry me like a princess either...  
That made my heart race more than anything!  
You can be so bold sometimes, {player}...  
  
**Akari：**  
Lying in your arms like this feels so comfy and warm...  
I want to stay here forever...  
  
**Passerby 1：**  
Huh...? What do you think those two are doing?  
  
**Passerby 2：**  
Gallivanting about like that in public...  
Honestly, kids these days!  
  
**Narration：**  
More than a few of the bemused onlookers  
got the wrong idea about {player} and Akari that day.
