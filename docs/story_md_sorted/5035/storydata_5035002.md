# The First Step
The \"New Generations\" girls set out on their journey to the town where the audition is to be held, receiving lessons from Piña Colata along the way. But when they try to hold a guerrilla concert in a small village, their nerves get the better of them, and it ends in failure.
  
## Subtitle: The First Step
  
**Narration：**  
\"New Generations\" and the Gourmet Guild  
have borrowed a carriage and set out on their journey  
to the town of Musa where the idol audition is to be held.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Okay, I've set things up for the night.  
I cast a security charm,  
 so we'll know if any monsters approach.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Thanks, Karyl.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Since the Guild Association  
kindly lent us a carriage,  
the journey has been very smooth so far.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, it's great not having to trudge along all day, at least.  
But I've gotta say...  
  
**Mio：**  
One, two, three, four...!  
  
**Piña Colata：**  
Pi!  
Nyanya-pi!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You're stepping forward too early, he says.  
`Tag 2`  
**Mio：**  
Huh?!  
...Got it!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
One, two, three, four!  
  
**Piña Colata：**  
Pinya!  
Nya-nya-nya!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You're glancing around too much, he says.  
`Tag 3`  
**Uzuki：**  
I-I'm sorryyyy!  
  
**Rin：**  
One, two, three, four...!  
  
**Piña Colata：**  
Pinya!  
Nya-nyapi!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Don't forget to smile, he says.  
`Tag 4`  
**Rin：**  
...*sigh*  
That's a bit of a tall order...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Everyone, are you all right?  
Singing all day in the carriage, then dancing until this late hour  
each night seems like a strenuous lesson plan...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, they've got the stamina, at least.  
And since they've been adventurers up till now,  
they can even hold their own in battle.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Our main obstacle is the sheer lack of time to prepare.  
We will arrive in Musa one or two days before the audition.  
There will be little chance to rehearse before the main event.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah, true.  
But at the end of the day, that's what they signed up for.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Besides, don't they all seem to be having lots of fun? ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, welcome back, Miss Pecorine.  
How did your brief hunting expedition fare?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, I got a great haul!  
Eheh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Guehh!  
Isn't that thing you're carrying...?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This way, \"New Generations\" girls! The wait is over!  
I've prepared a delicious dinner! ☆  
  
**Mio：**  
Oh, great timing!  
We were just saying it might be time for a break!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Oh, Pecorine, thank you so much! ♪  
Mmm, and it all smells so good! ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Remember, try not to eat too much. Today's lessons aren't over yet.  
  
And actually, if we're going to be idols,  
we should pay attention to our figures, too.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You're not allowed to eat too much...?!  
Idol work really is a tough career...  
I don't think I'd stand a chance at it!  
  
**Mio：**  
Huh?  
It's not that big a deal!  
Besides, what's a little food gonna do after all that exercise?!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Pecorine, what's on the menu today?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Right! ♪  
Today's dinner features crunchy Gryphon fritters!  
Along with a helping of butter-fried Cave Snail! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait. I *knew* we'd end up with monster dishes!  
Didn't I tell you \"If you're gonna hunt, hunt something that's edible\"?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh?  
This is all edible, though!  
Just look! ☆  
  
**Mio：**  
Ooh, tasty fried chicken! ♪  
*chomp*  
  
**Uzuki：**  
What an enormous escargot! ♪  
*munch*  
  
**Rin：**  
It looks worrying, but the taste...  
Yeah. I guess it's not bad.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Go on, Karyl, you try too!  
Eat up quick, or it'll be gone before you know it!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, bah! This'll teach me to be lazy!  
Tomorrow morning, I'm fetching all the ingredients myself!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Thanks for the meal! ♪  
  
**Mio：**  
Thanks for the meal!  
  
**Rin：**  
Thanks for the meal.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh, I'm glad you liked it! ♪  
  
**Mio：**  
I gotta say, Peccy-o, you sure know how to chow down!  
I could hardly believe my eyes!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh. Oh, it's nothing special! ☆  
  
**Rin：**  
Really?  
I'm sure you ate at least five times as much as me...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't think too hard about it.  
Her stomach's a leaky bucket with more holes than walls.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
By the by...  
Everyone, how are your lessons coming along?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
We've only just started, but it's so much fun!  
Right, Rin?  
  
**Rin：**  
...I suppose.  
  
**Mio：**  
The audition's going to be great!  
Right, Shiburin?!  
  
**Rin：**  
...Are you sure?  
We're still a long way from being ready. Isn't it too soon?  
  
**Piña Colata：**  
Pinya!  
Pinyanya, nya-nyapipi!  
  
**Mio：**  
Huh?  
What's Piña saying this time?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Well...  
`Tag 5`  
**Pecorine：**  
Over here, everyone! Gather around and watch!  
A wonderful idol show is about to begin! ♪  
  
**Piña Colata：**  
Pinya! Pii-nyaa! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Piña Colata seems super excited too! ♪  
Oh—this green guy isn't a monster, OK? ☆  
It's just a big old costume!  
  
**Villager 1：**  
What's this?  
Is there a show happening?  
  
**Villager 2：**  
\"Idols\"?  
Are those different from bards? Or are they like the circus?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Whoaaa...!  
A-all those people...!  
  
**Mio：**  
Th-there sure is a crowd...!  
  
**Rin：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
There are around twenty people at most.  
I suppose you could call it a crowd, but...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, this is only a little waypost village.  
I guess the whole community's starved for entertainment?  
Honestly, what a ruckus for this time of day!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
We're going to sing and dance  
in front of that whole crowd of people... aren't we?  
  
**Mio：**  
Y-yeah...  
That's right.  
That's what idols do.  
  
**Rin：**  
...  
  
**Karyl：**  
C'mon,you three! Get yourselves out there already!  
It's like the green weirdo said—  
you can't build confidence without experience!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It is only natural to feel a little nervous.  
But please do your very best.  
Miss Karyl and I will be here to support you with music and lighting.  
  
**Karyl：**  
We've set up the Sound Record and the magic to amplify it.  
The rest is up to you guys.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
B-but this is so...  
We're not ready to sing for all these people...!  
  
**Mio：**  
Y-yeah...  
M-maybe this wasn't such a good...  
  
**Rin：**  
...Let's do it.  
  
**Mio：**  
Shiburin?!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Rin...?  
  
**Rin：**  
It's too late to be getting cold feet now.  
Sooner or later, we knew we'd have to do this.  
Didn't we?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Y... yeah!  
  
**Mio：**  
You're right... Thanks, Shiburin!  
Let's at least see what we can do!  
  
**Villager 1：**  
Oh—here they come!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
H-hi there, everyone!  
  
**Rin：**  
We are \"New Generations\"...!  
  
**Mio：**  
We're idols in training!  
W-  
we hope you enjoy the show!  
  
**Villager 2：**  
Ahaha. It's cute how nervous they are!  
  
**Villager 1：**  
I don't really get it,  
 but good luck!  
  
**Mio：**  
Okay... Let's do this!  
  
**Uzuki & Rin：**  
Yeah...!  
  
**Mio：**  
O-oh no! I messed up the very first line!  
H-huh? Was that lyric right?!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
W-wahh!  
I totally stepped on Rin's foot!  
I'm so sorry!  
  
**Rin：**  
Focus, Uzuki. Eyes on the audience!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A-all three of them are getting crazy nervous!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahaha...  
Wow, they're a total mess!  
Just look at Rin—her face is all scrunched up!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ehm, Miss Karyl...  
It is not very nice to laugh...  
  
**Karyl：**  
You've got it backwards!  
We can't let failure get to them, so it's better to laugh it off  
instead of acting like it's the end of the world!  
  
**Piña Colata：**  
Pinya...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  The show isn't over yet!  
`Tag 7`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, indeed.  
Please do your best until the end,  
brave performers of \"New Generations\"...!  
  
**Narration：**  
However...  
The guerilla concert ended as little more than a string of failures.
