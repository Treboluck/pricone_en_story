## Subtitle: Road to Stardom
  
**Narration：**  
A few days before the fateful meeting  
of \"New Generations\" and the Gourmet Guild...  
  
**Mio：**  
Wow... I've never seen one before, but wasn't it amazing?!  
That idol concert thingy!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Yes!  
Carmina and all the other idols were sparkling so brightly!  
Weren't they, Rin?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Mm...  
Well...  
 I guess it wasn't as bad as I expected.  
  
**Mio：**  
Ohhh?  
Even Shiburin, who was super reluctant to come,  
is really changing her tune!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
That just shows how great today's concert really was! ♪  
Idols are so amazing...!  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh... come on, you two.  
Don't get too excited.  
We still need to get back to job-hunting tomorrow.  
  
**Mio：**  
Awww, don't try to act all cool on us, Shiburin!  
Right now, I'm so excited I might not be able to sleep tonight!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
...  
  
**Mio：**  
...Hm?  
What's up, Shimamu? Why'd you stop walking?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Um... Listen, Rin, Mio...  
I was just thinking...  
  
**Rin：**  
Thinking what?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Well... um...!  
Why don't we try doing it too?  
Being... idols, I mean!  
  
**Rin：**  
Wha... Where did this come from, Uzuki?  
Of course we can't do such a crazy thing...  
  
**Mio：**  
Hmm...  
Hmmm...  
  
**Mio：**  
...Yeah! ☆  
Yeah, I like it! Let's try being idols!  
Great idea, Shimamu!  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh?! You too, Mio?!  
I mean, it's impossible...!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Why's it impossible?  
Rin?  
  
**Rin：**  
Well... Think about it for a moment.  
Up until just this evening, we'd never even seen an idol concert.  
  
**Mio：**  
No problem, no problem!  
It'll work out somehow! ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Again with the baseless claims...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Umm... Hey, Rin.  
Do you really... feel satisfied with our guild activities right now?  
  
**Rin：**  
...Huh...?  
W-well, I...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
We keep doing these adventurer jobs,  
and sure, I know that's really important work.  
But... but... I just...  
  
**Rin：**  
Uzuki...  
  
**Mio：**  
...Hey, Shiburin.  
What was our original goal  
when we first formed \"New Generations\"?  
  
**Rin：**  
...Well, of course...  
We've never actually had...  
...This guild has never had a real objective.  
  
**Mio：**  
Yeah. That's right.  
In the beginning, we just sort of happened to team up.  
  
**Mio：**  
That's why, to search for our guild's objective,  
we took on all kinds of different jobs  
and went adventuring in all sorts of places.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
I... I always felt like  
there might be something else we should do besides adventuring.  
So... please, Rin. Even if it's just for a little while...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Will you try being idols with us?  
  
**Rin：**  
...*sigh*  
I can see you're both serious.  
In that case...  
  
**Rin：**  
Let's settle this.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And so... Miss Rin chose \"paper\"...  
  
**Mio：**  
And I chose \"scissors\"! ♪  
Winner!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's how you decided you'd try being idols, huh?!  
It all sounds so fun!  
 How crazy is that?! ☆  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Yes! ♪  
It's crazy! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Umm, so, ah... This may be a presumptuous question...  
But I must ask, Miss Rin,  
are you truly satisfied with such an outcome?  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh?  
Well... I can't deny I lost.  
And besides...  
  
**Rin：**  
It's true that adventuring  
was just something we wound up doing to search for our purpose.  
  
**Rin：**  
If the others really want to try this,  
I don't mind going along with them.  
Although...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Although?  
  
**Rin：**  
Well, we don't know anything about being idols,  
so we posted a job with the Guild Association.  
  
**Rin：**  
But the people who accepted it  
don't seem to know much about idols either...  
I feel like this is all getting a bit too haphazard.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
A... ahahaha...  
  
**Mio：**  
Hmm... That's our Shiburin.  
She knows how to hit where it hurts...  
  
**???：**  
Pinya.  
Nya-pinya.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Um... By the way,  
I've been wondering for a while, but... Who's this guy?  
  
**Mio：**  
Your pet?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Of course not!  
He just kind of...  
 started following us around.  
  
**Rin：**  
If he's not a pet... is he a monster, then?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In the city, his presence came close to causing a panic.  
Thankfully, the knight of Nightmare who arrived on the scene  
was a friend of my lord's, so we were able to clear things up...  
  
**Karyl：**  
But he refuses to go back to the forest.  
And now he's followed us inside the guildhouse, too...  
What the heck even is he?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Hmm...  
He does seem friendly and harmless, though!  
His cries are unique, too.  
  
**Rin：**  
Y-you think so...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm afraid I don't think we can keep him here...  
So we'll have to take him back later.  
Oh—do you want a rice ball?  
  
**???：**  
Pinya, pinya! ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So, ah...  
 How exactly do you ladies of \"New Generations\"  
plan to proceed from here?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Ummm...  
On our own, we don't have any idea  
how to get started with becoming idols.  
  
**Rin：**  
Maybe we should join up with another idol guild.  
The bulletin board idea isn't working out, after all.  
Right, Mio?  
  
**Mio：**  
Ahaha...  
 But um, where would we meet real idols?  
I heard the Carmina girls  
have gone flying off for a tour on a different continent.  
  
**All Three：**  
Hmmm...  
  
**???：**  
Pinya.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  ...?  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
What is it now?  
The big guy just handed {player} another slip of paper.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It doesn't look like a job request this time.  
What does it say?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I shall read it, my lord.  
...  
Oh my...  
\"Introducing the first ever Up-and-Coming Idol Audition\"...?  
  
**All Three：**  
\"Up-and-Coming Idol Audition\"?!  
  
**Mio：**  
L-let me see!  
Can you give us a good look at that flyer?!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
\"Calling the pop idols of a new era!  
Join us in Musa, town of arts and music, for a big audition opportunity!\"  
  
**Rin：**  
Um...  
\"To the winner, we're offering a song by a famous composer.  
Plus various bonuses, including a solo concert.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wow!  
That sounds like a pretty neat event! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
But isn't Musa Town a long way off?  
From Landosol, it would take at least a week.  
And there'd be monsters on the way...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The audition date is rather soon... Will there be enough time?  
  
**Rin：**  
Y-you're right.  
We haven't prepared a thing yet...  
Surely it's too late to start now.  
  
**Mio：**  
But look, Shiburin!  
How often do you get a chance like this?!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Yeah!  
Rin's definitely got a point that we're underprepared, but...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Preparations to become an idol, you say.  
Hmm...  
  
**???：**  
Pinya!  
Pinyanya! Nya!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-what now?  
What's the fluffball saying, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  To become an idol, you need... \"lessons.\"  
`Tag 2`  
**Uzuki：**  
\"Lessons\"... Like, in singing and dancing?  
  
**Mio：**  
I guess that makes sense.  
But who're we supposed to ask to teach us?  
  
**???：**  
Pinya!  
Pinyanya! Nya!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  He says he'll do it.  
`Tag 3`  
**Uzuki & Mio：**  
Whaaaaaa?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Uh, hold on.  
What even *is* this green thing?  
It was already weird enough that it had the audition flyer...  
  
**???：**  
Pinya-pinyanya.  
  
**Karyl：**  
And the translation?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  \"Piña Colata,\" he says.  
`Tag 4`  
**Rin：**  
Huh? That's... his name?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh! That's what they call you, big guy?  
Heyas! ☆ I'm Pecorine!  
Nice to meet you, Piña Colata!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Um, wait...  
{player}, do you understand what he's saying?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Seems like it.  
'Course, nobody knows why. Maybe they're just that similar.  
Like, their dopey faces.  
  
**Mio：**  
Oh, then how's this?  
If Piña Colata really does know his stuff  
about what it means to become an idol...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
With the aid of my lord,  
he may be able to share that knowledge...  
or so it seems safe to conclude.  
  
**Mio：**  
Oh, wow!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
To add one more observation...  
I believe the further one travels from the city,  
the higher the danger of encountering monsters.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
We'd be travelling a pretty long way, wouldn't we?  
  
**Rin：**  
Timing-wise, we'd have to do our lessons on the road...  
So we'd definitely need to hire protection.  
  
**Mio：**  
Oh, I get it!  
Then I guess this means... Gourmet Guild members!  
We need your help!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Please help us out!  
So that we can become real idols!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Sure thing!  
It's been a while since I last went on a gourmet journey!  
Sounds like fun! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, I guess this works out.  
Doesn't sound like it'll be too difficult.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We promise to support you however we can.  
It is a pleasure to work with you.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Let's all get along.  
`Tag 5`  
**All Three：**  
We'll be counting on you!  
  
**Piña Colata：**  
Pinya~!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Seriously though, what *is* this big green lunk?
