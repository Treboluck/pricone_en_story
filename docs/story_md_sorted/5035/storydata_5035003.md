**Uzuki：**  
*sigh*...  
  
**Rin：**  
*sigh*...  
  
**Mio：**  
*sigh*...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Our friends from \"New Generations\"...  
Ever since returning from their guerilla concert,  
their spirits have been terribly low.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Looks like it's really getting to them, huh...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Y-you don't think this is my fault for laughing at them, do you?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't worry, Karyl.  
If we all eat a hearty meal and get our bellies nice and full,  
I'm sure the mood will improve!  
  
**Karyl：**  
If only everyone was as easy to satisfy as you...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Still, while Miss Pecorine may be an extreme example,  
it is true that a good meal can often calm one's spirits.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The village folk kindly shared some fresh ingredients,  
so I think I may prepare a nice warm dish.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'll help too.  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh, sounds like fun!  
Let me help out as well! ♪  
  
**Uzuki：**  
...*sigh*  
Nothing went how we'd planned it, huh...?  
  
**Rin：**  
...That's for sure.  
  
**Mio：**  
Maybe we're just... not cut out to be idols...  
  
**Rin：**  
...Maybe not.  
  
**Rin：**  
So, what now?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Wh... \"what now\"...?  
  
**Rin：**  
Do we give up on the idol thing?  
Is it time to call it quits?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
...  
  
**Mio：**  
...  
  
**Piña Colata：**  
...Pinya...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
...!  
  
**Mio：**  
Shimamu...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Yes, Mio!  
  
**Mio：**  
I won't quit!  
I'm still gonna be an idol!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
That's right!  
So what if we messed up a little bit this one time?!  
  
**Mio：**  
Aghhh, it kills me!  
I can't believe how bad I screwed up!  
Next time, I swear I'm gonna do better!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Yeah!  
 And... I'm sorry, Rin.  
We're the ones who got you mixed up in this,  
but we almost lost our nerve!  
  
**Rin：**  
Yeah... You're telling me.  
But, you know...  
  
**Rin：**  
Haha... I'm relieved.  
If you two really said you were gonna quit,  
I'd have had to keep going on my own.  
  
**Mio：**  
Shiburin...?!  
  
**Rin：**  
I won't deny I was embarrassed, and scared,  
and wanted to run and hide...  
  
**Rin：**  
But all those people watching...  
They looked up at us and applauded.  
Maybe it was pity, or they were just being nice... But even so.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
...Yeah.  
At the time, I was so overwhelmed I couldn't appreciate it properly...  
but that's a pretty amazing thing!  
  
**Mio：**  
Yeah. It really is...!  
Ahhh...! What's this feeling?!  
My whole body's itching to take action...  
 I want to try again!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Yes! So do I!  
  
**Rin：**  
...Yeah.  
Next time, let's do it right.  
  
**Piña Colata：**  
Pinya!  
Pinya-nya-nyaaaa!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Piña Colata?  
What's gotten into you now?  
  
**Mio：**  
Is it just me, or is he getting super excited?  
  
**Rin：**  
But I think he seems... kind of happy.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  He says he's glad you're feeling better.  
`Tag 2`  
**Uzuki：**  
Oh—you guys!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Geez.  
He makes you do a concert you're not ready for,  
and then he's \"glad you're feeling better\"?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Despite the cute face...  
 Wait, no.  
Despite that ugly mug, you're a real slavedriver, aren't you?  
  
**Piña Colata：**  
Pinya?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl...  
Let us not resort to violence.  
  
**Mio：**  
H-hey, guys!  
While we're here... we've got a little request for the Gourmet Guild!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes? What is it?  
If you're hungry, dinner will be ready soon! ☆  
  
**Rin：**  
No, not that...  
Would we be able to stay here a few more days?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh?  
  
**Piña Colata：**  
Pi...?!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Sure thing.  
`Tag 3`  
**Piña Colata：**  
P-pinya!  
Pinya-pinya!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Are you totally sure?  
I get the impression Piña Colata's against the idea...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  We might arrive too late, he says...  
`Tag 4`  
**Uzuki：**  
It's true, there aren't many days left until the audition.  
But the three of us...  
  
**Rin：**  
...Yeah.  
We can't just leave things like this, can we?  
  
**Mio：**  
We need one more chance  
to show the people here a real idol performance.  
So please...!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Makes sense to me.  
`Tag 5`  
**Piña Colata：**  
P-pinya...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I can appreciate your concerns, Mr. Piña Colata...  
But my lord seems to have made his decision.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We're with you on this too!  
This village's honey cuisine  
 is super delicious, you know! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, I'd say do what feels right.  
We'll sort out food and stuff so you can focus on your training.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Our current schedule remains rather tight overall.  
But if we travel light and brave a slightly more dangerous route,  
I believe it is still possible to shorten our journey to Musa a little.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Ohh...! Are you sure?!  
Kokkoro, you're so reliable even though you're so little!  
  
**Rin：**  
No doubt.  
You'd do well to learn from her, Uzuki.  
About cleaning up, for starters.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
A... ahahaha...  
  
**Mio：**  
All right!  
With that settled...  
Let's get straight back to our lessons!  
  
**Uzuki & Rin：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Mio：**  
Whoa, what a noise!  
Who was that?  
Shimamu?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
D-don't look at me!  
  
**Rin：**  
...Sorry. That one was me.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha! ☆ Maybe it's bad to overeat,  
but you can't starve yourself either, Rin!  
It'll harm your performance!  
  
**Rin：**  
Mm... You're right.  
I'll keep that in mind.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well then, everyone, please join us for a meal.  
And after that...  
  
**Piña Colata：**  
Pinya!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  The lessons can begin!  
`Tag 6`

**Uzuki：**  
Okay!  
 Wh-whoaaa!

Uzuki, are you OK?

Ahaha...  
I was so focused on my fingers, I forgot about my legs...

**Pecorine：**  
Excuse me~! ☆  
Can we have enough bread to fill this sack?! ♪  
  
**Villager 1：**  
Sure thing!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Also... some honey, milk, and butter, if you please.  
  
**Villager 1：**  
Coming up!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, and... some juicy Killer Bee larvae!  
  
**Villager 1：**  
Always a pleasure!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hold it right there!  
Strike that last one!  
There's no way in heck I'm eating baby bug monsters!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Here goes!  
Full power... Princess Strike!  
  
**Rin：**  
Blade of violet... cleave the enemy!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Whew!  
I think that was the last of them?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Admirable work, everyone.  
It seems the monsters were drawn here by the sound of singing.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Figures.  
And hey, you guys, you're not half bad in a fight!  
  
**Mio：**  
Eheheh! ♪  
Well, we weren't adventurers for nothing!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Taking care of the monsters around here  
should make the villagers happy too, right? ♪  
  
**Mio：**  
Okay!  
Then let's keep on singing and draw them all here! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
By the way, Rin.  
What was all that \"blade of violet\" stuff about?  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh, that's, um... just a sort of... good luck chant.

One, two, three, four...!

**Piña Colata：**  
Pi, pi, pinya!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Our friends from \"New Generations\"...  
In just a few days, they have come so very far.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Agreed.  
I'm no expert, but even I can tell they're way better than before.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yep, yep! How crazy is that?! ★  
Maybe that guerilla concert was exactly the motivation they needed!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Since then, it's like they've all gone into overdrive.  
I've really gotta wonder...  
  
**All Three：**  
Five, six, seven, eight...!

I'm so...  
 so happy we did this!

Everyone, your concert was dazzling.  
However...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Sorry for the wait!  
I brought the carriage as requested!

C'mon, guys, no basking in applause!  
Hurry and jump in!
