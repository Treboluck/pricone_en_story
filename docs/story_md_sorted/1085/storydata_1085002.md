## Subtitle: Everyone Loves Santa Claus
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is helping Kurumi  
with her practice for the upcoming play.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Okay...  
Can you read out the lines on the script for me?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh? There's a word you don't know?  
Your memory's been slowly coming back, but I guess that  
makes sense considering you couldn't read at all before.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Well, if you can't read it,  
then I'll just have to teach you. Ehehe. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Which one is it?  
I've been reading a lot of the difficult books Mama Saren has,  
so I can recognize most words. Or I think I can, at least! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Awww. There's no reason to hide it.  
Are you embarrassed about it?  
You've got amnesia,  
so it only makes sense that there's things you can't do.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Don't worry, I won't laugh. So let me see it. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh, this word...  
It's, uhhh, \"apple\"? I think.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Yeah. This is where the evil queen tries to kill the princess,  
so it should be that.  
  
**Suzume：**  
{player}!  
Could you go on a grocery run for me?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wait. Why are you two sitting so close together?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Kurumi's already a young lady, you know.  
You need to be a bit more careful...  
{player}?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Waugh! Suzume!  
Umm, {player}'s been helping  
me out with my practice for the play...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ohhh.  
That explains why you're practically stuck together, eyes on the script.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hehe. What a relief.  
I was a bit worried because you're usually so shy.  
  
**Suzume：**  
But you seem rather attached to {player}.  
He does always take care of you, so that makes sense.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Umm, Suzume...  
You asked him to go on a grocery run, right?  
Can I help out?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
He might not be able to do it on his own,  
so it'll end up taking a while.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I'm tired from all the practice too, so it'd be a nice break.  
P-please?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Well, I don't see why not.  
We need plenty of stock considering New Year's is coming up,  
so if anything having more people to carry it all is better.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hehe. Don't worry, Kurumi.  
I know you just want to be around {player}.  
So go ahead and make the most of that time.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Okay. I'll leave it to you two.  
And thanks for always helping out with chores and the like. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
It's okay.  
Santa'll bring me a present if I'm a good girl, won't he? ♪  
  
**Suzume：**  
Yup. And we have plenty of good kids here.  
Santa might actually struggle to carry all of your presents! ♪

**Kurumi：**  
Over here, over here.  
This way! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Look over there. You see that big store?  
We should be able to get most things from there. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
{player}?  
That's the wrong way. Don't go wandering off...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-is going shopping with me really that boring?  
You look like you're totally out of it...  
I'm having a lot of fun, though.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ehehe.  
This reminds me of when we first met.  
I-it almost feels like we're on a date... ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's a \"date\"?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh, you don't know?  
You really don't know anything, do you?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Does that mean you've never been on a date before?  
That'd make me the first person you've been on one with, then.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
E-ehe... Oh, umm, a date is basically...  
when two people that like each other go shopping and stuff...  
I think? I'm not that sure myself.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You see it often in romance novels and whatnot,  
so I've always wanted to experience something like it myself.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You're an adult, though,  
so you probably just think you're hanging out with a kid.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
As for me, though. Can I treat it like a date? Ehehe...

**Kurumi：**  
Hey, you're not even listening.  
What's wrong?  
You've been a bit fidgety this whole time...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Waugh!  
Don't grab me out of nowhere! You're scaring me!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Urgh... I don't really mind this,  
but I'd prefer it if you said something beforehand...  
Getting touched out of nowhere is really surprising, you know...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh? \"What's that?\"  
Ohhh. You mean the person dressed as Santa selling cakes?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Heehee. We're still two weeks away,  
but there are already so many decorations and things around.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
That's what was distracting you this whole time, right?  
Because you don't remember what this time of the year means.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
P-phew... What a relief.  
I thought being with me was making you bored.  
Ehehe. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um, that's Santa. He's a symbol of the season...  
Oh. But you don't remember what  
this holiday is in the first place, do you?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
It's basically the birthday of a really important person  
from long ago. Everyone celebrates the day with delicious food,  
plus singing, dancing, and all sorts of other stuff. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh, and also,  
Santa'll bring you presents if you're a good kid.  
Um, was that a good enough explanation?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ehe.  
My parents are Lost,  
so I figured I wouldn't get any presents.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But this year I've got everyone from the orphanage,  
so I might just get something special.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wh-what's wrong?  
You look kind of confused.  
Did I not explain it well enough?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh?  
You're confused why I'm saying that since Santa's the one that gives the presents?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Well, uh...  
I'm kind of a grown-up, so I already know.  
It's not actually Santa that brings the presents, but...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wait. I shouldn't be telling that to someone with amnesia, should I?  
He might be shocked if he finds out  
it's the parents that give the presents.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
If anything, he's better off not knowing.  
Yeah. I'll keep it a secret.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
It's a lot more exciting when you believe it's Santa, too.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ehehe. I should stop being so gloomy myself.  
I'd rather be excited for what's coming.  
That's a lot better, I'd say.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Right?  
Mom. Dad.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
E-ehe.  
Friends give each other presents, too.  
We're doing a big exchange party at the orphanage. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
So let's finish up quick and go pick out presents for that.  
Together, of course. Assuming you're okay with it. ♪
