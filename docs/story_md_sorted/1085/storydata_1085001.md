## Subtitle: A Very Blue Holiday
  
**Narration：**  
Two weeks before the holidays, Kurumi and {player} are putting up decorations around the Sarendia Orphanage together  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Try moving it a bit more to the side...  
Oh. I meant to the right...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Eeek! Don't shake me like that!  
I don't want to fall,  
I don't want to fall!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Urgh. Sorry for being such a scaredy-cat.  
We'll never finishing decorating like this...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I knew this was a bad idea.  
We should get a platform for you to stand on and decorate.  
Letting me do it while on your shoulders won't work.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh?  
You don't remember how to decorate a tree  
thanks to your amnesia?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
E-ehe...  
You really don't know anything, do you? I-It's kind of adorable... ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Waugh?!  
I told you not to shake me! Did I make you mad?  
I'm sorry, I'm sorry! It was supposed to be a compliment!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Urgh...  
You're normally so kind, but you can be a real meanie sometimes.  
Is scaring me and taking me by surprise that fun?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sorry.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kurumi：**  
O-oh. No, it's fine.  
Being teased and messed with feels a lot better  
than being treated like a stranger.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
It shows that we get along...  
Even better, that we're a real family. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
*sigh*  
  
  
**Choice: (2)**  What's wrong?  
`Tag 2`  
**Kurumi：**  
Waugh. Sorry.  
I'm just a bit depressed lately. It's hard not to sigh...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I'm the complete opposite of Ayane and the others.  
Always down, always reserved...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Is something on your mind?  
`Tag 3`  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh. I can't hide anything from you, can I?  
Then again, anyone could tell I'm down when I'm  
sighing this much.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Feel free to rely on me.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kurumi：**  
Ehe... You're a lot more talkative today.  
Towards me, specifically.  
It's kind of nice to know you're that worried about me. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um... I'll take you up on that, then.  
There's an event in town in two weeks, right?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Other orphanages like ours, plus hospitals and caring facilities,  
all put money together to fund it.  
And Mama Saren organized it all.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
The plan itself is really nice. There's plenty of people  
that are hospitalized or don't have any family,  
so this gives them a way to enjoy the holidays with everyone. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
There's going to be a play during the event, too.  
And I was chosen to be the lead for it...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I've been practicing every day,  
but I just don't have the confidence to perform in front of such a big crowd.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Everyone always praises my acting, you and  
Mama Saren included. That made me want to keep it up,  
so I've been acting at other orphanages now and then.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
That's what led to me getting this role.  
Which I'm happy about, but...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
The play at this event is on another level.  
It's even got people from a proper theater troupe.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
And there'll be so many people watching.  
I don't think I have it in me to play the leading role...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I'm so scared...  
I've even been having nightmares where  
I forget my lines in the middle of the play.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
All the preparations and advertising have already started, though...  
And everyone's cheering me on, telling me to give it my best.  
I can't back down at this point.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But I... I... I can't do it.  
Just thinking about it pushes me to the brink of breaking down.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Don't cry.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kurumi：**  
Urgh....  
I shouldn't cry. I shouldn't run. I know that, but...  
Why am I such a coward?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  There, there.  
`Tag 6`  
**Kurumi：**  
Whoa!  
Don't let go of me! I'm still on your shoulders!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
*sniff* You're trying to cheer me up, aren't you?  
I appreciate it, but this issue's too complicated  
for even you to do anything about...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I'll do whatever I can.  
`Tag 7`  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh... Then how about this?  
Can you turn back time? Undo all of this in the first place?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You can't, can you? You're not some deity.  
Urgh... Why do I have to feel like this when the holidays are so close?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
This was supposed to be a fun time of the year.  
The first time I'll spend the holidays with everyone  
from the Sarendia Orphanage. With my family.
