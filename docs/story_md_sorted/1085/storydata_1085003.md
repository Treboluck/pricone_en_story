## Subtitle: Sleep Tight on the Holy Night
  
**Narration：**  
Two weeks later, on the night before the play,  
Kurumi finds herself overcome with restlessness  
  
**Kurumi：**  
...  
  
  
**Kurumi：**  
This isn't good...  
I-I can't sleep. Not a bit...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I'm too nervous about the play.  
How is it tomorrow already?  
That, plus we had the party this afternoon.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I had too much fun, I think.  
I'm exhausted, but all the excitement is still there...  
I know I need to sleep, but I just can't.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
And the more I think about, the more I panic.  
Why am I always like this? Nothing ever goes right...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Mmm...  
What's wrong, Kurumi?  
Can't you sleep?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh...  
Sorry for being so restless, Ayane.  
Did I wake you up?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yeah... You should get to sleep.  
There's lots to be excited about tomorrow.  
  
**Ayane：**  
And Santa's coming, too.  
It'd be really awkward if you met eyes with him.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Actually, has he come already?  
What time is it?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Uhhh... Mama Saren—  
Err, I don't think Santa's come yet.  
We don't have presents by our pillow.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ahh.  
Ehehe. I can't wait to see what we get.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I want it to be tomorrow already, so I'm going back to sleep.  
You should do the same.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Urgh. I want to, but it's not working...  
Ayane, do you mind talking to me until I'm more tir—  
  
**Ayane：**  
Zzz... Zzz... ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ah... She's already asleep.  
I'd rather not wake her up again, so I'll leave her be...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I need to sleep, too.  
Maybe I'll go practice out  
in the garden for a bit. It'll tire me out,  
plus I feel like I need a bit more practice anyway.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Then again, I'll get scolded if I go outside this late.  
Plus, Mama Saren would get worried if she came in to  
leave our presents and I wasn't here.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But I can't exactly practice in here, either.  
Otherwise I'll wake Ayane up.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh?  
Wahhh! I can hear footsteps!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Is it Mama Saren?  
I need to pretend I'm asleep!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
It'll be really awkward if she finds out I'm awake,  
just like Ayane said!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh! The door opened!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Waugh! The footsteps are getting closer!  
I need to put on an act and convince her I'm asleep!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I'm asleep!  
Incredibly asleep! It's safe to leave the presents!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Z-Zzz... ♪  
Zzz... ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hawhoa?!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
What?! What was that?!  
Something just touched my foot!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Waaahhh! I even let out a weird sound!  
But why my foot?  
Mama Saren usually leaves our presents by our pillows...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Waugh! Th-that tickles!  
Something's touching the back of my feet!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
What's going on?! I don't get it!  
Stop! Stop it!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-it's too tickly!  
She'll realize that I'm awake at this rate!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Waaahhh! This is just scary now!  
Is this really Santa?!  
Why are my feet being touched this much?!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Th-this can't be Santa! I need to get up!  
I'm scared, but I need to see what's going on!  
If it's a monster, I can smack it with my hammer!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
S-stop it!  
I don't know who or what you are, but go away!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
H-huh?  
{player}?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That's my name.  
**Choice: (2)**  Sorry for waking you up.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I was right, then.  
It's too dark to see, but the outline kind of matched.  
Phew... Thank goodness it wasn't a monster. ♪  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh? Oh. Don't worry.  
I wasn't actually asleep at all.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kurumi：**  
Wait, forget that!  
Wh-what are you doing?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wh-why were you tickling my feet that much?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Because I'm Santa.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ohh, so that's it.  
You're giving everyone their presents after Mama Saren asked you to?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Suzume had to handle the cleaning after our party earlier,  
and she ended up falling asleep when she finished.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
And Mama Saren's carrying Suzume to her room now,  
so she asked you to give out the presents. Is that the gist of it?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ehe. I tried to keep it a secret,  
but I guess you ended up finding out anyway.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
That's right. Parents and guardians are the real Santa.  
They're the ones that give us presents.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
And you've become part of our family,  
so you have the right to play that role.  
Now it all makes sense. Ahh... What a relief. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But wait. Now I'm even more confused.  
If you were being Santa, then why were you touching my feet?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
H-huh?  
You look even more confused than me.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Doesn't Santa put presents in socks?  
`Tag 5`  
**Kurumi：**  
Errr, that's right...  
Did you... did you try to put my present in my actual socks  
after hearing that from Mama Saren?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I don't wear socks when I'm asleep, though.  
But you didn't know that, so you spent time  
trying to figure out where my socks were?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-is that it?  
You know, you make some really weird assumptions sometimes...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Not that I can blame you, considering your amnesia.  
You've forgotten even stuff that a kid like me knows.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But, well,  
I was really scared when you started touching my feet.  
And it was tickly. So promise me you won't do it again.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehe. Look over there.  
Can you see that big stocking between our pillows?  
That's where you put the presents. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ehehe. It's nice and big,  
so it can fit most presents.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But you didn't know about that,  
which is why you did what you did.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You really can be troublesome, can't you? ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Mmm... Are you still awake, Kurumi?  
The play's tomorrow, you know. Go to sleep already.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh no. Ayane's waking up again.  
Can you put the presents in the stocking and hurry on out?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I don't think she knows about Santa's identity.  
She might be really upset if she sees you.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
That, plus I'm sure Mama Saren has a present for you as well.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But she can't give it to you until you're asleep,  
so you'd better get to bed or she'll be up all night.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Yeah. Giving her a present back would be nice.  
Or just saying thanks, at the very least.  
But let's leave that for tomorrow.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Okay.  
Ehehe. Good night. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Thank you for the present.  
I really appreciate it. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehe. All of that's left me exhausted.  
And talking to him helped calm me down.  
I should be able to sleep now... ♪
