## Subtitle: She Who Brings Joy
  
**Suzume：**  
Sorry to keep you waiting, Master!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I mean, eheheh, {player}...  
I've finished preparing your meal, so please eat up!  
This is a token of my gratitude for carrying my cargo for me!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ack?  
Oops, ahh, GAHHH?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I-I'm so sorry.  
I almost fell over.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I did a lot of walking today, so I'm unsteady right now.  
Thanks for supporting me. You're a big help.  
  
**Suzume：**  
You also prevented me from dropping your food on the ground.  
Um, {player}?  
Sorry, but do you mind letting go of me?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm okay!  
I don't have any injuries or anything!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Goodness... It was an accident this time, so I'll turn a blind eye to it,  
but you can't go around randomly embracing girls like that.  
Just kidding.  
I shouldn't be acting high and mighty after needing your support.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hehe.  
In any case, here's your food.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Kurumi...  
I mean, one of the children I take care of at the Sarendia Orphanage  
cooked today. She even made enough for me.  
  
**Suzume：**  
All I had to do was reheat it,  
so it was ready in a flash. She really helped me out.  
Kurumi's a better cook than I am, so I can guarantee that it'll taste good.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hehehe.  
I was worried about the children at the Orphanage,  
because neither Miss Saren nor I was around for them...  
  
**Suzume：**  
But it sounds like they all took good care of themselves while we were away.  
They even took proper care of the cleaning and laundry.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I told them to leave it for later since I'd do it myself,  
but oh well.  
And on top of that, they prepared food for us too.  
  
**Suzume：**  
They felt bad about always being the ones looked after,  
so they went ahead and did what they could.  
They're really all such good-hearted, mature children.  
  
**Suzume：**  
It's almost as if they don't need me...  
Hm?  
What's the matter, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I want seconds.  
**Choice: (2)**  I want to eat your cooking as well, Suzume.  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzume：**  
Oh? Looks like you've already polished off your meal.  
Men sure do eat a lot.  
Please wait a moment. I'll cook up something extra for you.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzume：**  
Wha?  
Erhm... But I'm not even that good at cooking.  
Do you still want me to cook for you despite that?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Do you really want to eat my handmade food that much?  
Eheheh.  
That makes me happy to hear. Or, rather, I feel quite honored.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Suzume：**  
Right then, I'll whip something up for you.  
While you wait,  
umm...  
go ahead and read some of  
the picture books there, or play with some toys.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Yes,  
these are the kinds of things I brought back from my hometown. Picture books and toys.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I also brought back some used clothes as well.  
They may not be necessities,  
but having them brings joy.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Miss Saren makes sure we have everything we need for our daily lives.  
I figured all I needed to do was provide the children everything else.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I made the trip back home when that thought came to mind.  
However,  
my priorities are all wrong if doing so makes the children feel lonely.  
I'm such a good-for-nothing. I never think things through properly.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Eheheh.  
It seems as though the children have been waiting this whole time for my return.  
  
**Suzume：**  
They all ran over to hug me when they saw my face,  
and they loved all the toys and picture books as well.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm clumsy, useless, and am always causing trouble to those around me.  
But even if I'm not absolutely required,  
perhaps I've at least become somebody whose presence brings joy.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Eheheh.  
Sorry. I'll go and cook something up.  
  
**Suzume：**  
You must be tired, {player}, so please relax  
and make yourself at home.  
 Unfortunately, it would pose  
a moral dilemma to allow you to stay the night, however.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hm?  
You want to play with those toys?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Those toys are for infants...  
You sometimes behave like a young child at times,  
don't you?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Very well. Let's play together after dinner.  
I, Suzume, will play with you  
to your heart's content!  
  
**Suzume：**  
No, in fact,  
I will shower you with my services,  
Master!
