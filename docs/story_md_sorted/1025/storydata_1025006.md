## Subtitle: My Precious Family
  
**Suzume：**  
Phew.  
We've finally made it into town.  
Now we can rest our minds at ease for the time being.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Goodness me, I was so flustered.  
I had a lot of cargo this time,  
so I loaded it all onto a cart to push it along.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Then you came along to help me, {player}.  
The two of us pushed the cart...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Then I fell over quite a few times,  
scattering my cargo all over the place.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Just before we reached town, the wheels got unhitched and we ended up  
stuck in a ditch...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Then, as I was panicking about what to do, the wheels actually fell off.  
In the end, the cart fell apart into pieces.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I can't just put this down to simple clumsiness. I'm so unlucky.  
{player}, if you hadn't picked up and carried all of the  
cargo for me, I might've hopelessly come to a standstill.  
  
**Suzume：**  
You really were a great help to me. I will absolutely repay you.  
Let me thank you somehow. Anything, just say the word.  
I'm a klutz, though, so I can't pull off anything too fancy.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  No need to thank me.  
**Choice: (2)**  I want you to treat me to a meal.  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzume：**  
Whaaat?! That doesn't sit well with me.  
You're so very humble, {player}.  
However, it is the way of a maid, to repay one's kindness through service.  
  
**Suzume：**  
If you think of anything, please feel free to tell me.  
I will most certainly repay you.

`Tag 2`  
**Suzume：**  
*chuckle*  
The grumble bug in your belly's growling!  
It is time for dinner, after all.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Understood!  
Please leave it to me, Master!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ackkk! I called you \"Master\"!  
I have trained to be a fine servant ever since I was a child.  
As such, it's become a habit of mine to call others that.  
  
**Suzume：**  
In any case, I will treat you to as many meals as you please.  
It would be rather costly to eat at a restaurant,  
so I will cook something for you at the Sarendia Orphanage!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Suzume：**  
Hehehe. Anyway, you must be a little tired now.  
Shall we sit down and rest somewhere around here?  
There just happens to be a bench over there.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Landosol is quite expansive.  
It's actually pretty far from here  
to the Sarendia Orphanage in the outskirts.  
  
**Suzume：**  
It might be a bit of a stretch, to get there without taking a rest.  
  
**Suzume：**  
*chuckle*  
You still appear to be quite full of energy, {player}.  
Men sure are amazing. You're so physically strong!  
  
**Suzume：**  
As for me, I feel as though my legs have turned to mush.  
Urgh, the soles of my feet hurt.  
  
**Suzume：**  
EEEEK?!  
{player}, why are you touching my feet?!  
I just told you, they hurt!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, I see. You're giving them some medical care for me.  
Wrapping them up in bandages...  
I'm sorry. I really am just a walking pile of trouble.  
  
**Suzume：**  
It's no use. At this rate...  
I'll never be  
the fine servant my parents are.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ah, yes.  
I come from a family with a long history as servants.  
  
**Suzume：**  
My parents are two of the best in the business...  
My father is known as the \"Uber Butler\",  
and my mother is known as the \"Super Maid\".  
  
**Suzume：**  
They both serve different masters,  
so I haven't seen them for a while, though.  
Only my grandmother was around when I visited home.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Even as a child, I was pretty much attached to milady.  
I always tended to her every beck and call.  
  
**Suzume：**  
In fact, I have spent more time with her  
than I have with my biological parents.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I don't really see my parents as my \"family\".  
My hometown doesn't quite feel like \"home\" to me either.  
  
**Suzume：**  
It may sound a little sad,  
but that was the type of family I was born into.  
There's nothing I can do about that.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Moreover, I feel as though Miss Saren is...  
and now the Sarendia Orphanage  
are my family, and my home.  
  
**Suzume：**  
*chuckle*  
I'm sorry I seem to have become a little gloomy.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I must be tired.  
{player}, do you get along with your family?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh?  
You live under the same roof as someone you see as your little sister?  
Please take good care of her.  
  
**Suzume：**  
After all, one's family is much like one's treasure.  
Actually, they are more like the ground.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Not having one causes unease and loneliness...  
You don't have a place to stand,  
so you lose your balance and fall over like me.
