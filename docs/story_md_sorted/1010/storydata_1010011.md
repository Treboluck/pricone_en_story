**Narration：**  
It's noon at the Caon guildhouse, and Maho is packing for a journey.  
  
**Maho：**  
Phew... Okay, my clothes are all packed up.  
  
**Maho：**  
Next, I'll pack daily necessities,  
and I guess maybe I should bring my father's letter too...  
  
**Maho：**  
This letter from my father...  
What am I gonna do with it?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What are you doing?  
`Tag 1`  
**Maho：**  
Ah—my prince! ♪  
I'm so glad you came.  
  
**Maho：**  
Huh...? That outfit...  
Are you on a delivery job right now?  
  
**Maho：**  
Huh...? The delivery address is here?  
But nobody answered, so you came inside...?  
I'm sorry, my prince. I guess I didn't hear you 'cause I was busy packing.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Are you going somewhere?  
`Tag 2`  
**Maho：**  
The other day, I got this letter from my father,  
askin' when I was gonna visit.  
So I'm thinking I'll drop by my hometown.  
  
**Maho：**  
'Course, after checkin' in about this an' that,  
I'll come straight back to Landosol!  
I'd never dream of stayin' away from my prince for long! ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
It's just... as I think I've mentioned,  
my family runs a business back home.  
  
**Maho：**  
Right now, I'm in Landosol to broaden my horizons,  
but one day, I'll have to take over from my folks.  
  
**Maho：**  
\"One day,\" huh...  
I wonder when that'll be...  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh—sorry for zoning out.  
I oughtta be takin' receipt of that package you brought.  
  
**Maho：**  
Wahhh...!  
Um, my prince?  
I was hopin' to take my package,  
so it'd be mighty helpful if you could stop all that glowing...

**Maho：**  
Hehe.  
I'm so pleased the library had this book! ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
D'you wanna look too, my prince?  
I really recommend it! ♪  
  
**Choice: (3)**  We're here to study, so let's focus.  
`Tag 3`  
**Maho：**  
That's easy for you to say,  
but since makin' plans for this trip back home,  
I can't seem to focus on studyin' at all...  
  
**Maho：**  
Only one thing can soothe my heart, an' that's this book I love...  
Studying's important too, but readin' this book  
would do me so much good... *glance*  
  
**Maho：**  
I'll study real hard when I get home,  
so if I can just take a little break... *glance* *glance*  
  
**Choice: (4)**  ...You know what, let's take a break.  
`Tag 4`  
**Maho：**  
Hehe. I always knew I could count on you, my prince! ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
You know,  I really do love this book so much!  
It's a fairy-tale romance about a princess and a prince!  
  
**Maho：**  
The princess and the prince are in love,  
but their countries are actually at war!  
  
**Maho：**  
Despite all that, they stay true to each other  
through all kinds of obstacles...  
  
**Maho：**  
...Till at the end, they both set off for heaven  
where they can be together forever an' always.  
  
**Maho：**  
Most of the time, I love stories where everyone gets a happy ending,  
but in this one, the scene where the lovers make their vow  
is just so beautiful...  
  
**Maho：**  
Look—right here. \"No matter what, your love will never bloom.\"  
That's what the priest tells them.  
Even so, they can't give up on their love, so they swear an oath.  
  
**Maho：**  
\"Even if death parts us…\"  
\"...I will be with my prince always.\"  
  
**Maho：**  
Then, to seal the solemn vow,  
the prince kisses her on the hand! ♪  
  
**Choice: (5)**  That's a wonderful scene.  
`Tag 5`  
**Maho：**  
Isn't it just?  
I love this scene so much, I've reread it a thousand times!  
  
**Maho：**  
...I'm sure those two are so happy up in heaven.  
Bein' with someone you love like that... it's the stuff I dream of! ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Never changing, never goin' away, just stayin' together forever...  
What I wouldn't give for a life like that...  
  
**Maho：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  What's the matter?  
`Tag 6`  
**Maho：**  
Oh... it's nothing really!  
It's just, I was thinkin' about something, that's all.  
  
**Library Announcement：**  
The library will be closing soon.  
We ask all visitors to kindly prepare to leave the building.  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh, it's already this late.  
Guess we oughtta get goin'.  
  
**Maho：**  
...Listen, my prince.  
There's a place I want to visit.  
Will you be a darlin' and come with me?  
  
**Maho：**  
This really is a mighty fine view...  
I can see your school, my school...  
basically the whole town!  
  
**Maho：**  
I'm ever so fond of this town, you know. ♪  
It's got my friends, my prince...  
so much to love!  
  
**Maho：**  
If I went to a school back home,  
I bet I wouldn't have half as much fun.  
  
**Maho：**  
...Hey, my prince.  
Can I ask you something...?  
  
**Maho：**  
...If I disappeared from this town, what would you do?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Why would you ask a question like that?  
`Tag 7`  
**Maho：**  
...My father asked me something.  
  
**Maho：**  
\"Will you take over our kimono shop or not?  
I need you to decide while you're still in school,\" he says.  
  
**Maho：**  
...In a few more years, I'll have to make my choice.  
Whether to take another path, or follow in my parents' footsteps...  
  
**Maho：**  
But either way,  
it could mean goodbye to this town, and to you, my prince.  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh, my prince...  
How long d'you think we've still got left together...?  
  
**Maho：**  
O-oh boy!  
I got awful serious for a moment there, huh? ♪  
Please, forget I said a thing!  
  
**Maho：**  
Well, we should get goin'.  
I hope you'll walk with me until—

...  
  
**Ameth：**  
...Oh! S-sorry.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I was... just a bit taken aback by all that.  
It made me get all flustered just watching...  
  
**Ameth：**  
I think I mentioned to you before  
that your amnesia gets in the way sometimes,  
making you more stoic... But I take that back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
...You're  
that girl's prince through and through!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh, how beautiful...  
A kiss on the hand and a solemn vow...

Mmnhh...? Oh... my prince.  
I didn't fall asleep just now, did I...?  
  
**Maho：**  
...You were sleepin' too, huh?  
You've dozed off on me a few times before,  
but both of us together is a first.  
  
**Maho：**  
And to think I'd have a dream about you makin' a vow to me...  
  
**Maho：**  
Huh? You dreamed that too?  
Now, isn't that the most mysterious thing!  
  
**Maho：**  
A-actually, my prince...  
If I told you I've really got worries just like in the dream...  
  
**Maho：**  
Ahh...!  
Y-you don't have to get down on your knees for me again!  
  
**Maho：**  
Hehe. Whether it's a dream or not,  
my prince will always be my prince, huh? ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
...All right. You give me the package you brought,  
then I'll get back to my packing.

...I've gotta live up to the me in that dream.  
First up, I'd better tell Father  
exactly how I feel, and what I really want to do...!  
  
**Maho：**  
I'm still not sure how it'll go...  
but I'm sure I'll be fine.
