Hey, hey! Mr. Prince!  
I've had enough of headpats.  
Carry me next! ♪ Like a princess! ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh...?  
My prince is here, sure enough, but who're these other guests?  
  
**Mother：**  
I-I'm terribly sorry for barging in!  
We ran into Mr. Prince here at the front door,  
and when he went inside, my little girl tagged along…  
  
**Maho：**  
Everyone's welcome at our guildhouse, so don't you worry!  
Aren't you the momma and daughter who got split up the other day?  
  
**Mother：**  
I'm so grateful for your help that day.  
That's why we dropped by—to thank you properly.  
  
**Child：**  
Nice lady! Mr. Prince!  
Thank you very much!  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh my! Please don't worry about it.  
This is just part of our job in Caon! ♪  
  
**Mother：**  
Here—these are some cakes I baked.  
I hope you'll share them with your prince and all your guild members.

Aren't I awesome?! ♪

No!  
I wanna stay with Mr. Prince!

Come on.  
It's not nice to cause trouble for Mr. Prince, is it?  
  
**Maho：**  
Hehe. I knew no gal could resist my prince's charms! ♪  
Little lady, have you taken a liking to my fine prince?

Oh...?!  
  
**Mother：**  
There she goes again... What did I say about not causing trouble?  
Come on, let's go now.  
Miss Maho, thank you so much for everything.

Mr. Prince!  
Please wait till I become a princess!  
  
**Maho：**  
Ah...  
Please come again anytime!  
  
**Maho：**  
...Well then, I'll go an' cut this cake up.  
My prince, you can sit over there on the sofa.

Now I just need to make the tea...

**Maho：**  
I thought I'd made my peace with it...  
My prince is a wonderful fella,  
so it's only natural that I'm not the only one sweet on him...  
  
**Maho：**  
...Look at me, gettin' all jealous of a child.  
I should go back to my prince an'...

Oh—I didn't mean to keep you waitin', my prince.  
I'll bring the tea and cake right away,  
so you just hold on, okay?  
  
**Maho：**  
Huh...? Wh-what now, my prince?  
There isn't somethin' on my face, is there?  
  
**Maho：**

**Maho：**  
A-anyway, I'm fine, so just wait over there...

**Maho：**  
I-I'll have you know I'm sixteen years old!  
A-at our age, doin' things like this is…  
  
**Maho：**  
Huh...? The other day, I did the same thing for you...?  
  
**Maho：**  
W-well, it's fine an' dandy when I do it,  
but when a guy does it to me, it's, ah, a... a li'l bit embarrassing...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Should I stop?  
`Tag 6`  
**Maho：**  
Ahh... Well, I didn't say I dislike it or anythin'...!  
So, um... I guess... C-could you keep it up a bit longer?  
  
**Maho：**  
My prince's hands... They're so warm.  
Feels almost like a mother's hands...  
  
**Maho：**  
...It's been so long since I let anyone treat me all nice like this...  
  
**Maho：**  
I-it's embarrassing to have a fella treat me this way, but...  
Hehe. A part of me wants to let my prince do this forever...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Are you feeling better now?  
`Tag 7`  
**Maho：**  
Huh...? Oh... Yes!  
Th-thanks to you, I'm feelin' right as rain!  
Nobody else could make me this happy...  
No one but my destined prince! ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
...Truth is, I'd've loved to go on a bit longer,  
but it ain't right to be greedy...  
  
**Maho：**  
Ahhh...  
My prince's warm hand is moving away...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Should I carry on?  
`Tag 8`  
**Maho：**  
Huh...? How'd you know what I was thinkin'?  
Was it my tail or my face that gave it away?  
  
**Maho：**  
N-no need for that!  
I'm not some kinda spoiled baby...  
So... Well...  
  
**Maho：**  
...  
  
**Maho：**  
...Can we stay like this just a little longer?  
  
**Narration：**
