**Maho：**  
Welcome back, my prince. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Sure have been comin' a lot lately, haven't you?  
Not that I'm complaining.  
  
**Maho：**  
People are free to come and go most of the time here,  
so you can go the full day without seein'  
anyone now and then.  
  
**Maho：**  
As for today, Makoto and Kaori came along.  
But one left after the other arrived.  
  
**Maho：**  
Not that I blame them, since they seem mighty busy.  
It's just a li'l bit lonely when  
they go home so quickly. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Oops.  
Shame on me for making you stand about.  
Come on in.  
  
**Maho：**  
Go take a seat.  
I'll get us some tea and sweets. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Actually.  
What brings you here today, anyway?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  To see you, of course.  
**Choice: (2)**  Had to pick up something I left here.  
`Tag 1`  
**Maho：**  
Oh ho?  
You mean it?  
  
**Maho：**  
You sure know the way to a gal's heart.  
Goes without saying that I felt the same. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Hey!  
I just heard that there tummy of yours rumble.  
  
**Maho：**  
Sly li'l fella you are.  
You're just here to pinch some sweets 'cause  
you're hungry, ain't ya?  
  
**Maho：**  
That's fine, though.  
Come on in.  
Little worse than havin' an empty stomach, is there?  
  
**Maho：**  
Eat to your heart's content.  
You always look mighty happy when eatin', too.  
I could watch you all day long. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Ehehe.  
All that said, you're more than welcome here  
even if you don't need anything. ♪

`Tag 2`  
**Maho：**  
Oh?  
Didn't know you left somethin' here.  
What was it?  
  
**Maho：**  
Ohhh! Your clothes, wasn't it?  
They got all dirty after I got you wrapped up in a spell gone wrong...  
And then you borrowed some after takin' a bath, I'm sure.  
  
**Maho：**  
Then you trotted on home with them still on...  
  
**Maho：**  
And completely forgot about your own clothes, right?  
Clumsy li'l fella, aren't we? ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm...  
Get the feelin' that I put it away with all the  
other washing I did with it.  
  
**Maho：**  
Gimme a li'l sec.  
I'll go find it for you. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Ah. Here we go.  
This is it, isn't it?  
  
**Maho：**  
Ahaha.Lookit that. Stuffed away with all my clothes.  
It might smell a li'l bit like mine,  
but ain't much we can do about that now.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Maho：**  
But really, though.  
Just knowing you came along makes me mighty happy. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
The more we get along, the easier it is to prove that  
all the the other human and beastfolk can do the same.  
  
**Maho：**  
So yeah. Let's make the most of it.  
Letting race get in the way of how we  
treat each other is a real waste, you know?  
  
**Maho：**  
That's how you feel too, right?  
  
**Maho：**  
That said...  
There's some beastfolk that either hate  
or are just plain afraid of humanfolk.  
  
**Maho：**  
If any of 'em ever try to start somethin' with you,  
then come speak to me.  
  
**Maho：**  
Yeah.  
Like I said, I *am* Caon's guildmaster in the end.  
  
**Maho：**  
You'll find me here all day everyday.  
I mean. It's where I'm livin' now.  
  
**Maho：**  
I moved here to Landosol for...  
certain reasons, to say the least.  
  
**Maho：**  
Yeah.  
Think you can tell by my accent already,  
but my homeland is a li'l bit far from here.  
  
**Maho：**  
Under normal circumstances, I never would've been able to leave.  
I'd succeed my parents' store and live the rest  
of my life trapped in my li'l cage known as \"home.\"  
  
**Maho：**  
Wasn't too fond of that idea,  
so I decided to be selfish.  
  
**Maho：**  
I convinced 'em to let me go live on my own, under the pretense  
that it was to broaden my horizons.  
They agreed, but only for a li'l while.  
  
**Maho：**  
Ain't no parents more overprotective than mine.  
They even bought out this whole building  
just so I could live in it.  
  
**Maho：**  
But it's awfully big for one person...  
So here I am, using it as our guildhouse.  
  
**Maho：**  
Not just that, either.  
I'm lettin' any beastfolk without anywhere to go stay here, too.  
  
**Maho：**  
As for Caon itself, that came about 'cause I'm  
acquaintances with someone high up in the Menagerie.  
  
**Maho：**  
And well.  
Things just sorta ended up like this before I knew it.  
  
**Maho：**  
It ain't all fun and games,  
but everyday's just been real exciting lately. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
I even got to meet my darlin' prince...  
So as far as I'm concerned, I made the right choice to leave.  
  
**Maho：**  
I can't be selfish forever, though.  
It's still my duty to take over the store for my parents.  
  
**Maho：**  
If I had things my way, though...  
I'd love to just stay here.  
Drinking tea and chattin' away, livin' the slow life.  
  
**Maho：**  
All my friends are here.  
My darlin' prince is here.  
I wanna enjoy this time with y'all as much as possible.  
  
**Maho：**  
Ehehe...  
Sorry for gettin' all sentimental on you.  
  
**Maho：**  
No good host gets their visitors down like that.  
How about I dance a li'l dance  
to lighten the mood?  
  
**Maho：**  
A big ol' smile suits you best, after all.  
  
**Maho：**  
Don't worry.  
I ain't the least bit unhappy or misfortunate.  
  
**Maho：**  
At the very least,  
I ain't goin' through the sort of tragedy  
a princess in a fairy tale would. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Ehehe.  
And if anything *were* to happen,  
I'd come to you for help.  
  
**Maho：**  
So yeah.  
Keep showin' me that smile of yours.  
  
**Maho：**  
How about I bring some more sweets?  
  
**Maho：**  
Okay-dokie.  
You li'l glutton, you.  
  
**Maho：**  
Okay, my prince.  
Open wide. ♪
