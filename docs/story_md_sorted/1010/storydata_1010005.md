La-la-la.  
Mahorin... ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Twinkie twink... ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
The weather sure is lovely today.  
And Landosol's as peaceful as can be. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
It's making me all happy, too.  
Think I'm about ready to forget that I'm in the middle of the street  
and go for a li'l nap. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Guess I'll find myself a bench and doze off for a bit there.  
Hafta make the most of this.  
  
**Maho：**  
Ain't nothin' better than takin' a nap when  
you're feelin' all relaxed and content. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Imagine that.  
Just the sorta bench I was hopin' for.  
Down we go. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm...  
Sunlight's a li'l bit strong.  
A lot more than it is back home, I'd say.  
  
**Maho：**  
Shoulda brought a parasol with me.  
I'll end up lookin'  
like Kaori if I nap in this.  
  
**Maho：**  
Or I would, if I had any real sunlight tolerance.  
Can't even get a nice li'l tan.  
I just turn red like a tomato and get sore all over.  
  
**Maho：**  
Let's see if I can whip together a spell to deal with the UV rays.  
  
**Maho：**  
If I mix together these two spells, then use them like this...  
Yup. Seems like it'll work.  
  
**Maho：**  
Ehehe.  
Mighty lucky I came up with this. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Miracle Mahorin,  
twinkle twinkle hoy! ☆  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh?  
Guess I done goofed again.  
Really ain't good with this sorta fiddly magic.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm...  
Looks like the steam I made to block out the UV rays  
messed with the atmosphere and caused a big ol' explosion.  
  
**Maho：**  
On the bright side, that made the air  
all nice and cool now.  
Good result, if you ask me. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Think I could turn this into cooling magic  
if I work on the formula a li'l bit. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm...?  
That person collapsed over there seems mighty familiar.  
Ain't it... my prince?  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh gosh.  
Lying down on the road like that's  
gonna get his clothes all dirty.  
  
**Maho：**  
Aww.  
I was too late...  
  
**Maho：**  
How about this?  
I can fix 'em up with a quick li'l spell. ♪

`Tag 1`  
**Maho：**  
Gotcha. It's been nice and peaceful these days,  
so I'm just full of magical energy.  
Lemme get right to it. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Miracle Mahorin, twinkle twinkle hoy! ☆  
Make my prince a squeaky clean boy!  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm?  
Any reason why you're rollin'  
all around on the ground?  
  
**Maho：**  
You're gonna get your clothes even more dirty, you know.  
  
**Maho：**  
It'd do you mighty good to listen to what others say.  
  
**Maho：**  
What?  
I sent you flyin' with my magic?  
  
**Maho：**  
Real sorry about that...  
I dunno why, but any sorta magic I use ends up  
takin' on some offensive properties.  
  
**Maho：**  
I ain't a fan of conflict or hurting others either,  
so it's real odd.

`Tag 2`  
**Maho：**  
Oh no.  
How come you're so scared, my prince?  
  
**Maho：**  
Is it me? Are you scared of me 'cause I'm a beastgirl?  
  
**Maho：**  
I guess we're a li'l bit different from you humanfolk.  
Seems like they used to think we  
were a breed of monster way back when, too.  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh gosh.  
We're just two star-crossed lovers, separated by species... ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Is it really fate that we must be apart, though?  
Just 'cause we're different types of folk?  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm?  
You feel like you're about to die after takin' a hit from that spell?  
That's why you're shivering in fear?  
  
**Maho：**  
W-want me to fix up a li'l healin' spell for you?  
  
**Maho：**  
Th-there's a 50% chance it'll end up like  
an offensive spell, yeah...  
  
**Maho：**  
You'd rather not?  
Aww...  
  
**Maho：**  
Terribly sorry. I mean it.  
I really oughtta learn how to handle my magic better.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Maho：**  
Lookit you.  
You're all banged up and dirty thanks to me.  
  
**Maho：**  
How about we hop on  
over to Caon's guildhouse?  
  
**Maho：**  
Yeah.  
We've plenty of clothes for you to change into,  
plus we can get you all healed up.  
  
**Maho：**  
Are you fine with that?  
  
**Maho：**  
You are?  
Now that's a relief.  
Let's be on our way, then. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
I know I can be mighty clumsy at times.  
But I still wanna support my darlin' prince.  
  
**Maho：**  
Ehehe.  
That's a princess's duty, after all.  
I'll always be there for you. ♪
