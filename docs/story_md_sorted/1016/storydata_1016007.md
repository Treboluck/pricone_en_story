Oh... What am I gonna do?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hey, it's whiz-boy!  
Whattup?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
You have no idea what good timing you have!  
Like, seriously, no idea!  
Can you help a sister out?  
Pretty please?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
One of my modeling friends just got like, her first  
boyfriend ever.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
But then she went and dropped this major bomb⁠—she doesn't know  
what boyfriends and girlfriends even do together!  
So she came to me for help, right?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
But like, I've never had a boyfriend either!  
I've never even been on a date, so like, I'm not exactly the  
best person to ask...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I just kinda feel bad, 'cause like, she definitely wanted me  
to help her, so I wanna do *something* for her.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
So like, could you do me a solid and be my boyfriend?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  ...Say what now?  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzuna：**  
You heard me! Be my BF for a day!  
Then we can go on a date together!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
That way, I can figure out what to say to her!  
Basically, just keep your schedule open, 'kay?  
Byyye!  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh! Hey, whiiiz-boy!  
You're like, right on time!  
Classic whiz-boy!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Who, me?  
I only just got here.  
'Kay, let's get this show on the road!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hm? You don't know what the plan is today?  
Don't you worry! I've got everything under control!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Basically, we're just gonna walk around  
town doing some window-shopping and stuff.  
I wanna see what the fashion vibe is!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
We good? Then let's mosey!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
We sure walked a lot! My legs are killing me...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
'Sides, I'm pretty sure it's lunchtime too.  
Let's take a breather.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
S-so, hey... I made us a lunch. Are you cool with that?  
You are, right?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
'Kay, then let's dig in over here.  
Here's yours, whiz-boy.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I'm pretty darn confident about my cooking skills, but...  
Wh-what do you think?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It's devilishly delicioso!  
**Choice: (3)**  I've never had anything this tasty in my life.  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzuna：**  
Omigosh?! Are you okay?!  
Did I make you forget how to speak English, too?!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh? It just means tasty?  
Ugh, then why didn't you just say  
tasty?! You scared the bejeebers outta me!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh my *gawd*, you little cutie! Don't be silly!  
You're making it sound like you don't mean it!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
But, well, I know you.  
You'd never do anything mean just to be mean.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Suzuna：**  
So thing is, I actually do a lotta cooking.  
Pretty much any simple food you can think of,  
I can cook with ease!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
But... tbh,  
I'm really happy that you liked this.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
This is the first time I've had a guy other than my little  
brother eat my cooking, so like,  
I was pretty wound up about  
it.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
It was like, after I asked you out, my mind wouldn't  
stop going in circles...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Like, where should we go? What should I put in our lunch?  
What kinda stuff do you like?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
For reals, I thought my head was gonna explode!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
But y'know, I think that was just part of what made  
today so much fun.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh, that's it!  
I got it! I totally got it!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
The most important thing is to just think about your partner  
a whole lot!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
As long as you do that, your date'll be fun no matter what!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Thank you sooo much, whiz-boy!  
You just gave me the best advice-piration ever!  
Idk how I'm gonna thank you for it!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Actually, I do know! We should go on another date!  
And this time, I'll put even more of my heart into it!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I'm gonna make sure you have the time of your life,  
so you better get hyped!
