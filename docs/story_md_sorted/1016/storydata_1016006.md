## Subtitle: Costume Conundrum
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is waiting to meet up with Suzuna.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Whattup?  
Sorz, I know this is like, pretty random.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I just kinda had something I wanted to talk to you about.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Basically... My work clothes have been going missing  
lately.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
It's like, any time I look away, they're just gone.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
At first I was like,  
I'm probably just out  
of it or something.  
But like, there's no way I'd  
be out of it this many times, y'know?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
So I was like, oh man, I gotta talk to someone about  
this!  
And of course, I thought of you.  
'Cause like,  
you're totally dependable and stuff.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
So how about it? Will you help me catch the creep?  
Pretty please?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Of course.  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzuna：**  
You mean it?!  
Score! You're the best, whiz-boy!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
All right, come with me, B.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I've got a fashion show today,  
and I just know the  
thief is gonna show up. You keep watch here!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
All right. The show's over, and I put my clothes  
like, *right* out in the open.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Now all that's left is to wait for him to make his move.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Ahaha, it feels like we're detectives or something!  
Tbh, this is actually kinda exciting! I love it!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You should probably take this more seriously.  
**Choice: (3)**  Yeah, this is pretty fun.  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzuna：**  
Awww, what?! I can't help it! It's always like,  
so much fun to be around you!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Suzuna：**  
Inorite?! Though tbh,  
I think anything could be fun as long as  
I'm with you.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh? Did you hear that?  
Hey, I just saw someone!  
Over by my bag!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
And look, she's got my clothes and everything!  
Then that must be it! She's the culprit!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hey, she's getting away!  
Sic 'em, whiz-boy!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Hold it right there!  
`Tag 5`  
**Woman：**  
Huh? What is it?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I'll tell you what it is, you jerk! You stole my  
clothes,  
and that is *extremely* grr-face of you!  
What's your problem?!  
  
**Woman：**  
I did what?  
Suzuna, are you hearing yourself?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
How come you know my na—  
Wait, you're from my agency!  
How come my agency's stealing my clothes?!  
  
**Woman：**  
Um... Sorry, what's going on here?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Like you don't know! Someone's been stealing my stage clothes!  
And that someone is YOU, isn't it?  
  
**Woman：**  
*sigh* Well, I can't be too surprised, considering  
who I'm talking to.  
I'm not stealing your  
clothes. I'm washing them. At the office.  
  
**Woman：**  
I've been doing this every single night.  
Did you really not notice until now?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
O-oh yeah... I did kinda wonder  
how they kept  
getting so nice and clean...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Sooo, uh... Major oof on my part, huh?  
Sorry I thought you were a thief.  
Oh, and, uh... Thanks for washing my clothes, too.  
  
**Woman：**  
You're welcome.  
Oh, but Suzuna?  
Could you at least wash your own undies?  
You keep leaving them here.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Wait, for serious?!  
  
**Woman：**  
Yes, for serious.  
See? You left these today.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Aaaagh! Stop! Stop!  
I got the whiz-boy here, dude!  
Don't just wave 'em around like that!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Whiz-boy, cover your eyes!  
  
**Narration：**  
Perhaps this humiliation was karmic retribution for Suzuna's  
wild misunderstanding.
