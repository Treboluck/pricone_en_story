## Subtitle: The Power to Protect
  
**Narration：**  
Finding herself with a free moment in between her duties,  
Pecorine heads out to a monster-infested region  
in search of promising ingredients.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Huh? Why, if it isn't {player}!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heyas~! ☆  
Fancy running into you here!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I was just on my way out to hunt some monsters—  
do you want to come too?  
I'll treat you to a tasty dish once we're done! ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Should you be leaving the city?  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh—are you thinking I've snuck out of the palace again?  
Eheheh. Nope, this time I'm on official leave!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Although... it's not the longest of breaks, so I've gotta hunt quickly  
and whip up a meal as fast as I can!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Working on a tight schedule  
really limits the kind of monsters you can hunt, you know?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Even so, I'd never compromise on flavor,  
so I promise you won't be disappointed!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I can't wait!  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Then you're going to come with me?  
Thank you so much!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The monsters I'm after today aren't too dangerous,  
so don't you worry about a thing! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Mmm, isn't this perfect hunting weather?!  
The monsters we're looking for will attack of their own accord,  
so I'm sure this won't take long!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  What happened to \"not dangerous\"?  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, believe me, they really aren't!  
For all their aggression, they're super weak!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Time's of the essence,  
 so let's get this done in a jiffy!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, this is weird.  
Normally they all attack at once, but today there's no sign of them.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Could our clash with the Kaiser  
have had some kind of effect on monster distribution?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We heard rumors in town about a giant creature, too...  
Maybe this calls for a proper investigation...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What's this noise? It's rumbling my stomach from the outside...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, look! Those are the monsters we're after!  
Let's chase them, {player}!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Huh, they got away.  
I've never seen those monsters turn and flee before.  
Normally they're eager to leap straight at me...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Something's definitely a bit weird today.  
  
**Man：**  
Aaaarghhhhh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A scream?!  
It came from over that way, right?!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Let's check it out!  
`Tag 4`  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes! We should hurry!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No matter how things change, you're always the same old you.  
That makes me... really happy.  
  
**Giant Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That cart's being chased by a huge monster!  
We have to help them!  
Excuse me! You should toss your cargo and flee!  
  
**Man：**  
Are you crazy?!  
I'm not tossing anything!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wh-whoa! I didn't expect that reaction.  
It can't be more important than your life, can it?!  
  
**Man：**  
These supplies are for the Landosol restoration!  
I can't just abandon 'em!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Ahh!  
That's the reason...?  
In that case, I'll help you however I can!  
  
**Man：**  
Don't be dumb!  
You oughtta run yourself, before you get killed!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm actually a lot stronger than I look!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Here I go...!  
Princess Str—  
  
**Giant Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
H-huh?  
The monster ran off without even looking at me...?  
What could this mean?  
  
**Man：**  
That ain't the monster I'm running from!  
There's an even crazier one chasing after us!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh, it suddenly got dark... Wait!  
What the heck is that gargantuan monster?!  
  
**Gargantuan Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Man：**  
That's your guy!  
We're running from him!  
Dammit! He's gonna catch us!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wow, this monster's crazy huge!  
We have to stop it quickly!  
  
**Man：**  
Stop that thing?  
How's anyone supposed to do that?!  
Running's our only chance!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's on a course straight towards Landosol.  
We have to stop it here, no matter what!  
Or all the recovery efforts will have been for nothing!  
  
**Man：**  
Y-yeah, but...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Look at you!  
You're putting your life on the line to help the city rebuild!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
After seeing that spirit, I can't even consider running!  
It's my duty to protect everyone in that city!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll take care of this somehow.  
So I need you to trust me and save yourself!  
  
**Man：**  
...  
  
**Man：**  
All right...!  
But this better not be the last I see of you two!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Of course!  
  
**Man：**  
When we meet again, I'll treat you to somethin' tasty!  
See you around!  
 Yahhh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I have a huge appetite, so I hope you're prepared!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Now then.  
You kind of ended up staying here with me,  
but in your current state, this is...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'll fight with you.  
`Tag 5`  
**Pecorine：**  
Hee hee.  
I had a feeling you might say that.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
{player}, can I ask you to power me up?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  On it!  
`Tag 6`  
**Pecorine：**  
Thank goodness!  
Your power's working just fine!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let's give this our all, then!  
Hiyaaahhhhh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
We're definitely slowing it down, but this is getting pretty tough...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Still, I'm not the kind of girl who gives up so easily!  
I'll try again and again!  
Take... this!  
  
**Gargantuan Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Waaaahhhhhhh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
It hadn't even gotten serious yet?  
This is a pickle...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A monster this dangerous  
can't be allowed anywhere near Landosol, can it?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I've had enough of losing the things I really care about!

**???：**  
...  
...  
  
**???：**  
...A new key.  
From the peak of creation's tower to the depths of heaven.  
  
**???：**  
Deeply, softly.  
Toward the newly opened eyes deep within.  
Speak the words...  
  

---  
  
**Choice: (7)**  A new... key.  
`Tag 7`  
**Pecorine：**  
This sensation is...!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  ...\"Speak the words...\"  
`Tag 8`  
**Pecorine：**  
{player}...!  
All right, then!  
Time to do this!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm filled with a warm and incredible strength!  
With this, I might be able to beat that thing!  
No—I *will* defeat it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Suddenly I feel like that big guy looks pretty tasty!  
He's not the monster we came to hunt,  
but I'm always happy to try new ingredients!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
With all that meat, we can try a ton of recipes, too!  
Let's try it raw, try it grilled,  
and smoke a bunch of leftovers to eat another day!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
My Princess Form makes me hungrier than ever,  
but with this on the menu, it'll be no problem at all!  
  
**Gargantuan Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hee hee.  
It's way too late to try running from us now!  
  

---  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll show you what the two of us can do together!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Meat needs to be fresh! Let's make this quick!  
Yaaaahhhh! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Full power, and beyond! ☆ Princess Strike!  
  
**Gargantuan Monster：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Please don't turn out to be poisonous after all this, okay? ☆  
  

---  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We did it!  
What a rare ingredient! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let's gather our guild and everyone from the palace  
and throw a monster munch party!  
Things may be tense right now,  
 but sharing a meal will help us get along!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Now, we'd better start by slicing this meat...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahahah...  
Using this Princess Form power  
really does make me super hungry.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
With a whole mountain of meat here...  
it can't hurt if I take a little bite, right?  
  
**Narration：**  
Most of the colossal monster's meat ended up in Pecorine's belly,  
but the remainder was more than enough to throw a party,  
and everybody agreed it was delicious.
