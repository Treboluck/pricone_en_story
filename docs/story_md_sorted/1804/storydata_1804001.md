## Subtitle: Restful Moments with You
  
**Narration：**  
Drowning in royal duties in the aftermath of the Rage Legion attack,  
whenever Pecorine finds a moment to rest,  
she looks for an out-of-the-way spot near the palace to unwind.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...  
  
**Knight：**  
Nothing to report.  
Guess I'll head back to HQ.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Whew! That guard finally left.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
As the Princess, I should probably be glad that security's tight,  
but with all these watchful eyes, it's so tricky to sneak out...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I've gotta find somewhere quiet to rest.  
Acting proper all the time makes my body ache...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I want to do some real exercise!  
To hunt monsters, cook them, eat them...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  ...Peco?  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
...?!  
Is that another guard?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? It's you, {player}?  
Thank goodness...!  
 Wait, why are you in here?!  
  
**Knight：**  
Voices...? Hey! Is somebody there?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
W-wahh! The guard's coming back this way!  
We need to hide!  
  
**Knight：**  
...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heyas~! ☆  
It's been a while!  
It's such a pleasure to see you again, all full of energy!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But, um... seriously, why are you here?  
It's a good thing it was me who found you.  
Entering the palace like this could get you arrested!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You didn't... risk your safety to come and see me, did you?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Where am I?  
**Choice: (3)**  I just kind of ended up here.  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
...Oh boy. You're just totally lost, huh?  
You could've said yes, if only to make me happy...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But oh well. Honesty's important too,  
so I guess you don't need to change a thing! ♪  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, I see. You just ended up...  
 Wait.  
Doesn't that mean you're totally lost?!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Knight：**  
...Was I imagining things?  
Just in case, I'll ask HQ to tighten up security...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It should be safe to come out now, {player}!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmmm. Well, I say \"safe,\" but if you stay here,  
there'll be trouble for sure. So you should really go home...  
That might be tricky on your own, though, huh?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I don't think Kokkoro or Karyl are anywhere nearby, either...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I know! Once I'm done with my duties,  
I'll escort you home to the guildhouse.  
Can you behave yourself until then?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Yeah!  
`Tag 5`  
**Pecorine：**  
Nicely said!  
Well then, let's try to get you to my room  
without anybody else seeing you.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Be very, very quiet, OK?  
I know the guards' schedules, so we ought to be fine,  
but I did just hear something about tightening security...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Shhhh...  
`Tag 6`  
**Pecorine：**  
Heheh. Looks like you're being a good boy today.  
Thank you very much!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I didn't think it would happen like this,  
but I'm so happy to see you.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's lonely in here on my own.  
The people here are so strict,  
I can't even invite you guys to visit.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Royal duties... Endless meetings...  
They're all very important, I know,  
but working so hard that I miss mealtimes is tough.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And the palace food is tasty, but the manners are such a drag.  
I want to dig in to a hearty monster meal with you guys again!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But no. I know I shouldn't say these things.  
If I want to keep my Gourmet Guild and Twinkle Wish friends safe,  
I've gotta face Mr. Gorschin and the others on their own turf!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Uh-oh—if we keep chatting, another guard will come!  
Let's get you safe inside my room.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Okay—we're here!  
Thank goodness nobody spotted you!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  This is...  
`Tag 7`  
**Pecorine：**  
Why are you acting all nervous?  
Did something here catch your eye?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Oh, of course.  
For you, this place must hold some not-so-happy memories, huh?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But don't you worry!  
I'm gonna wipe those memories clean away  
by doing a great job as Princess!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Now then.  
It's great that we made it, but the tricky part starts now.  
Lots of people come to see me here, after all.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm, let's see...  
For now, can you hide just behind the throne?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes, that spot should do nicely!  
I'm sorry I have to make you hide instead of offering tea and cakes.  
I'll give you a proper welcome next time, OK?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Today, I only have a little bit of work left to do.  
So once that's done, let's go home to our guild...  
 house...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...My real home is here at the palace, isn't it...?  
When I'm with you, I get more confused than ever.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  What's wrong?  
`Tag 8`  
**Pecorine：**  
O-oh, it's nothing at all!  
Well then, I'll get back to my important work now!  
No more Pecorine. Time to be Princess Eustiana!  
  
**Noble：**  
Lady Eustiana.  
These are the repair fees from the incident in the dungeons,  
and the city restoration budget after the recent explosion damage.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes... Thank you very much.  
Let's see. These seem to be in order, so please proceed with them as is.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh... but for this budget,  
please check with the citizens about the extent of the damage.  
Some homes could be damaged inside, even if they look outwardly fine.  
  
**Noble：**  
As Your Majesty wishes.  
Next, this is the budget for your banquet with the nobility.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ummm...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If we have funds to spend on banquets,  
I'd rather put more of them towards the city repairs...  
  
**Noble：**  
...Lady Eustiana?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh—yes!  
These look fine as well.  
 Please continue with them as is!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I can't be short-sighted. It's the Princess's job to see the big picture.  
Let's call this an investment in our nation's future!  
  
**Noble：**  
Next, these are from the Council...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhhh, I'm finally finished!  
You can come out now, {player}!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
How did you like me in work mode?  
Did I seem to be doing an OK job?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  You work so hard.  
`Tag 9`  
**Pecorine：**  
W-wahh?!  
 Ooh, a headpat just for me!  
You're always so forward! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Are you imitating Kokkoro, I wonder?  
It's so nice to give people praise and encouragement!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
In that case, would it be okay...  
if I acted like a kid and indulged myself for once?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...No, no. You can't let me do that.  
I still have to keep working hard!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Pat her more.  
`Tag 10`  
**Pecorine：**  
You... still want to baby me?  
Then I guess... just a little longer.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
My royal work is important, and I do take pride in it...  
but not seeing you and the Gourmet Guild makes me so lonely...  
I want to join you guys for a food tour again...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Okay, enough being childish!  
If I moan any more, Karyl will get all mad at me!  
  
**Choice: (11)**  We'll help you too.  
`Tag 11`  
**Pecorine：**  
With you guys to help me,  
I bet we'd sort out tons of stuff in a jiffy!  
Then we'd have time to eat all we like!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You know my appetite better than anyone, right?  
If food's on the line, I might ask a whole lot of you!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But... I mustn't.  
There are plenty of things left that I can take care of alone.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll work my way through those,  
and when I reach a problem I can't solve myself, only then...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's when I'll accept your offer, and ask for lots and lots of help.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Then, once the problem's cleared up,  
we can all eat some tasty monster meals together!  
  
**Chamberlain：**  
Excuse me.  
I'm here to clean the... Wait. Hmmm?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahh! W-wahh?!  
{player}, you have to hide...!  
  
**Chamberlain：**  
...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha... I guess our cover's blown.  
L-listen, {player} isn't doing anything bad really,  
so please don't arrest him...  
  
**Chamberlain：**  
Lady Eustiana. I understand you're at that age,  
but it's not very proper for a princess to be alone in her room with a boy.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Chamberlain：**  
I'd hate to report this and cause extra trouble.  
I'll pretend I saw nothing, so you two continue your little chat.  
Just try not to get too carried away.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Th-thank you...  
 very much...?  
  
**Chamberlain：**  
Well then, I'll go and clean some other areas first.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And off she goes...  
I-I didn't expect  people to think of us quite like that,  
but I suppose it makes sense...  
  
**Choice: (12)**  What do you mean?  
`Tag 12`  
**Pecorine：**  
U-umm...  
In your state, it might be a bit too soon for that topic!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But... apparently it's okay if we keep talking,  
so could you stick around a bit longer?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let's head home after we've had a nice long chat!  
  
**Narration：**  
Though she tried to act unfazed,  
Pecorine's ears had turned a deep scarlet.
