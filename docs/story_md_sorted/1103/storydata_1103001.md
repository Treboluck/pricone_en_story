## Subtitle: Beware of Lost Children!
  
**Narration：**  
{player} recieves a letter for the  
Sarendia Orphanage on a certain summer's day.  
  
**Saren：**  
Good morning, {player}.  
Hm? There's a letter for us?  
  
**Saren：**  
Let's see... It's from the Salty Watermelon?  
Ohh. That's the beachside cafe Suzume worked at.  
What could it be about?  
  
**Saren：**  
Greetings to our friends at the Sarendia Orphanage.  
The weather has been awfully hot as of late, hasn't it?  
With that in mind, why not pay a visit to the beach?  
  
**Saren：**  
The beach, huh...  
  
**Saren：**  
It's been nothing but work lately,  
plus the children said they wanted to go somewhere.  
Not to mention the heat.  
  
**Saren：**  
Okay, that settles it! There's no harm in going  
on a little jaunt every now and then.  
Staying the night will  
cost a pretty penny, though, so let's make it a day trip!  
  
**Saren：**  
Now this is what I call great weather!  
The sea breeze feels so nice, too. ♪  
Perfect for taking a dip.  
  
**Saren：**  
If it weren't so packed, that is.  
  
**Saren：**  
Sheesh.  
I expected it to be busy,  
but not *this* much.  
  
**Saren：**  
Eeek! H-hey there, {player}.  
Don't grab my sleeve out of nowhere like that...  
Wait, it's not you?  
  
**Girl：**  
Wahhh... *sob, sob*  
Mommy... Where are you?  
  
**Saren：**  
A lost child?  
There, there. Don't worry.  
Let's search for your mommy together.  
  
**Girl：**  
*sniff* *sob*  
You'll help me find Mommy?  
  
**Saren：**  
Of course I will. Leave it to me.  
Can you tell me more about her?  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm...  
Doesn't seem to be anyone that fits the bill around here.  
Do you remember where you got split up?  
  
**Girl：**  
Um. It was over there.  
  
**Saren：**  
Ohhh. That'd make sense, considering how many people there are.  
Got it. Let's hold hands so you don't get lost again.  
  
**Girl：**  
Okay!  
You kind of remind me of my mommy!  
But you're also like a sister!  
So you're a mommy-sister!  
  
**Saren：**  
A-a mommy-sister, is it? Ahaha...  
  
**Saren：**  
Sheesh...  
Why is everyone so determined to call me Mommy or Mama?  
Even the children at the orphanage do it.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm... This search isn't going well.  
We'll be here all day at this rate.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Whose child is this?!  
`Tag 1`  
**Saren：**  
Whoa!  
Why'd you raise your voice like that?  
You scared me.  
  
**Saren：**  
Huh? That's how we should search for her mother?  
It does beat walking around aimlessly, true.  
  
**Saren：**  
Okay. I'll join in.  
I'd hate to leave it all up to you.  
  
**Saren：**  
Excuse me! We have a lost child here!  
Is her mother anywhere around here?  
  
**Girl：**  
Oh, over there...  
It's my mommy!  
Mommy! ♪  
  
**Mother 1：**  
Oh, there you are!  
Thank goodness! You have no idea how worried I was about you!  
I'm so terribly sorry. Thank you for finding her.  
  
**Saren：**  
Not at all.  
I'm glad we managed to get you two back together.  
  
**Saren：**  
Goodbye, little one.  
Don't let go of your mommy's hand anymore, okay?  
  
**Girl：**  
Okay!  
Thanks so much!  
Bye-bye!  
  
**Saren：**  
Bye-bye! ♪  
  
**Saren：**  
Thanks, {player}.  
That was a big help.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm? What's wrong?  
You're awfully silent.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  My throat's parched...  
**Choice: (3)**  Getting lost must be awful.  
`Tag 2`  
**Saren：**  
Hardly a surprise, considering all the shouting.  
  
**Saren：**  
H-hey, wait a minute! Don't try and drink the salt water!  
That'll only make it worse!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Saren：**  
Yeah. She came here to have fun,  
so going through that must have felt terrible.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hehe. It's very like you to be so empathetic, though...  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Boy 1：**  
Waaaaaahhh!  
Mommy! Where are you?!  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh... Another one?  
  
**Saren：**  
Hey there. Don't cry.  
We'll help you find your mommy.  
  
**Boy 1：**  
*sob* *sniff, sniff*  
Thanks, miss.  
  
**Saren：**  
Now then, how should we go about this?  
We can try shouting again,  
but I doubt we'll last long.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Kids should always be smiling.  
`Tag 5`  
**Saren：**  
Yeah. Ideally there'd be a lost and found area for children...  
Then again, that'd involve personnel costs and the like...  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, I've got it!  
This should work!  
  
**Saren：**  
Hey, {player}.  
Let's make a play area for the children here!  
  
**Saren：**  
Huh? You're curious why we're not making a lost and found area?  
Oh, we are making one. The play area itself will be the lost and found.  
Low effort, no cost!  
  
**Saren：**  
No time to waste!  
Help me out!  
  
**Boy 1：**  
Whoa!  
There's a rocking horse, a seasaw, and even a swing!  
Can I really play here?  
  
**Saren：**  
Of course.  
I'm sure your mother will come by if you're here, too.  
  
**Boy 1：**  
Really?!  
Okay, hmm...  
What should I do first?!  
  
**Boy 2：**  
Hey, this looks fun!  
Lemme join in!  
  
**Boy 1：**  
Sure!  
Let's play!  
  
**Saren：**  
The kids are all gathering, just as planned.  
They look like they're having fun, too. Thank goodness.  
  
**Saren：**  
Now we just need to hope their parents notice all the laughter—  
  
**Mother 2：**  
Oh! So this is where you were!  
You had me worried sick, you little rascal!  
  
**Boy 1：**  
Hey, it's Mom!  
Come play with us!  
  
**Saren：**  
Hehe. He went from tears to a big smile in no time.  
I'm glad that worked out.  
  
**Saren：**  
We don't need to go hoarse shouting, and the children can  
cheer themselves up by playing here. And while they're having fun,  
their parents will hear their voices and come by to check the area.  
  
**Saren：**  
It's a perfect idea that covers all bases.  
No more lost children!  
  
**Saren：**  
Mmm! A job well done really feels great!  
  
**Saren：**  
Thanks for helping out, {player}.  
I think I owe you some nice, refreshing juice.  
Let's get going, shall we?  
  
**Narration：**  
Saren flashed a smile full of satisfaction as they set off.
