## Subtitle: Thoughts by the Beachside
  
**Narration：**  
With the lost children issue solved,  
Saren and {player} are relaxing on the beach.  
  
**Saren：**  
Now then, what should we do?  
Oh, silly me. I almost forgot something imporant.  
  
**Saren：**  
It should be in my bag...  
Perfect. There it is.  
  
**Saren：**  
Curious, are we?  
This is called sunscreen. It's used to prevent sunburn.  
Though this is a prototype.  
  
**Saren：**  
Remember when Suzume worked at the beachside cafe?  
She mentioned that her skin was all sore  
and prickly after getting sunburned.  
  
**Saren：**  
That got me thinking.  
Wouldn't it be great if we had suncreen that's more effective  
than the stuff currently on the market?  
  
**Saren：**  
With that in mind, I went searching for herbs and the like  
that seemed useful. Then I did a bit of mixing, and voila.  
  
**Saren：**  
It'd be a waste to not try it while we're at the beach.  
And if all goes well, it should make for good business.  
  
**Saren：**  
Now then. Let's plop a bit on my hand...  
A bit colder to the touch than expected.  
Likely due to the herbs, I'd assume.  
  
**Saren：**  
Now to spread it over my body.  
Yup. This feels about right.  
Next up—  
  
**Saren：**  
Hey, {player}.  
Would you mind putting some on my back?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sure.  
`Tag 1`  
**Saren：**  
Thanks.  
That's a big help.  
Down we go...

**Saren：**  
This goes without saying,  
but you'll be in for it if you touch me anywhere inappropriate.  
  
**Saren：**  
I might be letting my guard down just a little too much.  
But searching for Suzume among this crowd  
doesn't exactly sound like the easiest option.  
  
**Saren：**  
That, plus I really doubt he'll do anything weird.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh. Now I get it.  
I feel comfortable around him, don't I?  
  
**Saren：**  
Mmm!  
Oh, sorry. I got a bit tickly there.  
Yeah, keep going.  
  
**Saren：**  
Don't miss any spots, okay?  
Hehe. I'm making myself feel like a queen here.  
  
![110300202.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/110300202.webp)  
**Saren：**  
Eeek?!  
H-hey!  
I don't remember giving you permission  
to slip your hands under my swimsuit!  
  
**Saren：**  
Huh? You'd miss a spot if you didn't do that?  
  
**Saren：**  
I mean, sure, but...  
Wah?!  
C-come on! You're making me squeal here!  
  
**Saren：**  
You need to sit back and think about what  
slipping your fingers into a girl's swimsuit actually suggests.  
  
**Saren：**  
Ahhh?!  
Y-you big dummy! You did it again!  
  
**Saren：**  
Huh? Your finger slipped?  
Argh! Quit overcomplicating the process!

**Saren：**  
*sigh* I'm already feeling exhausted.  
You really didn't miss any spots, though.  
Thank you.  
  
**Saren：**  
Now then.  
The product needs testing, so I'll go on a  
a walk and take in some rays!  
  
**Saren：**  
You sit back and relax...  
Hm? You want to come with me?  
  
**Saren：**  
Mainly because you're worried about me?  
Ahaha. Don't worry. I won't get lost  
like those kids from earlier.  
See you in a bit.  
  
**Saren：**  
Okay. Now to find somewhere I can relax—  
  
**PUA：**  
Hey there,  
hot stuff!  
How about we hit up the beachside cafe for a drink or two?  
  
**Saren：**  
Thanks, but no thanks.  
Goodbye.  
  
**Saren：**  
Well that put a damper on my mood.  
Let's get back to positive vibes—  
  
**Man：**  
Hey there, cutie-pie!  
Let's get along and have some fun!  
  
**Saren：**  
Does this really need to happen so frequently?  
*siiigh*  
  
**Saren：**  
Look. I'm not interested in pickup artists.  
Just get out of my sight, will you?  
  
**Saren：**  
*sigh* So much for finding somewhere I can relax.  
All these weirdos can't get their eyes off of me.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh... Is this what {player}  
was worried about?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Hey!  
`Tag 2`  
**Saren：**  
Oh. Hello, {player}.  
What's wrong?  
  
**Saren：**  
Huh? You couldn't help but be worried,  
so you decided to chase after me?  
I-is that right.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hey, do you mind hearing me out?  
This is, um, a little embarrassing after I already turned you down, but—  
  
**Saren：**  
Would you like to come along on a stroll with me?

**Saren：**  
Hey, look!  
There aren't many people over there!  
Let's go!  
  
**Saren：**  
Hehe. ♪  
I'm glad you came with me.  
  
**Saren：**  
No one's bothering me now,  
so it's a lot more enjoyable than when I was alone.  
  
**Saren：**  
And you get a good deal out of it, too.  
Not many people have the honor of going on a stroll  
along the beach with a cutie like me. ♪  
  
**Saren：**  
Hehe. That wasn't very elegant of me, was it?  
I guess I'm a bit excited.  
  
**Saren：**  
Not that you can blame me, of course!  
The ocean's so pretty, and the sky's co clear.  
Truly an amazing view if there ever was one.  
  
**Saren：**  
It'd be a waste to experience this all on my own.  
Having someone else to share it with makes it all the better.  
  
**Saren：**  
I guess that's what's truly important.  
Being with someone like—  
  
**Saren：**  
...

**Saren：**  
Hey, {player}.  
What are we to each other?  
  
**Saren：**  
Friends?  
Well,  
you're definitely not wrong.  
  
**Saren：**  
Leaving it at that doesn't feel right either, though.  
  
**Saren：**  
Our relationship is sort of a strange one,  
now that I think about it.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  We're family.  
**Choice: (4)**  We're joined at the hip.  
`Tag 3`  
**Saren：**  
The fact that you can say that goes to show justhow much you fit in at the orphanage now.  
That's great,  
and I'm really happy, but...  
  
**Saren：**  
Why does that make me feel a bit lonely?  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Saren：**  
Hm... That's one way to put it, yeah.  
We do live under the same roof, after all.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Saren：**  
I don't know. Something just doesn't feel right.  
There should be a clearer way of expressing it.  
  
**Saren：**  
For example...  
  
**Saren：**  
Lovers, maybe?  
  
**Saren：**  
W-wait, what I thinking?!  
All those books are getting to my head!  
  
**Saren：**  
There's no way we're in that sort of relationship!  
No way at all...  
  
**Saren：**  
Eeek?! D-don't get so close all of a sudden!  
Huh? It's because I went silent?  
Err...  
It's nothing. Really.  
  
**Saren：**  
M-more importantly!  
We're at the beach, so let's make the most of it!  
  
**Saren：**  
Come on! Let's go!  
  
**Narration：**  
Saren takes {player}'s hand,  
a slight hint of shyness on her face.
