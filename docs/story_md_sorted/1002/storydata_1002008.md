# Yui Episode 8
Yui struggles to tell {player} how she feels, even within one of her dreams, while he's too dense to even realize in the first place. Taking this to heart, she decides to try out a certain charm she learned from the dream.

**Yui：**  
Oh,  
good morning. I take it you've got work today, as well?  
...Is the sun always this bright?  
  
**Yui：**  
Wait.  
This isn't sunlight...  
  
**Yui：**  
That's it! It's the strange light from a while back!

**Yui：**  
The bell hasn't rung yet, has it?  
I wouldn't mind taking a look over the test questions before we start.  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh, there it is.  
  
**Yui：**  
I guess I'll check over the qu—  
Hmm?  
  
**Yui：**  
Does {player} not have an eraser?  
It looks that way, at least.  
  
**Yui：**  
I wish I could help,  
but we're in the middle of a test. I don't want to get yelled at...  
  
**Yui：**  
Wait. No.  
I need to stop thinking like that.  
  
**Yui：**  
If {player} was in my position, he'd help them out.  
That's the sort of person he is!

**Yui：**  
Hey, {player}...  
  
**Yui：**  
You need an eraser, right? Use this one.  
  
**Yui：**  
Shhh...  
Here you go. Just make sure we don't get caught, okay?  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh, don't worry about me.  
I've got another one.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Thanks. Good luck on the test.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
Yeah, thanks. You too.

**Yui：**  
Phew...  
  
**Yui：**  
Wait a minute.  
Did I...  
Did I just give him the one I normally use?  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh no. Ohhh no! This is bad.  
This is really bad!  
  
**Yui：**  
That's the one I wrote his name on!  
  
**Yui：**  
I saw that post online about writing the name of the person  
you like on your eraser and just... went with the flow, then forgot about it!  
  
**Yui：**  
It's my eraser, so he'll be weirded out if he sees his name on it.  
No doubt about it...  
I need to do something, and fast!  
  
**Yui：**  
Sorry, {player}.  
Do you, uh,  
mind if we switch erasers?  
  
**Yui：**  
Look, this one's a lot better.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  It's okay. This one works just fine.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yui：**  
The eraser might be okay,  
b-but I'm certainly not...!  
  
**Yui：**  
Uh oh. We'll get noticed if I raise my voice like that.  
Urgh, why did I have to lend him that one?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Double check the eraser.  
`Tag 4`  
**Yui：**  
Nooo!  
Don't look under the sleeve!  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh... So much for not raising my voice.  
Here comes the scolding and test retakes...  
Oh well, though.  
It was worth it.

**Ameth：**  
So, how'd you like that little present?  
Bet it was a nice little dream for you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I gotta say, though. You really are a turbo dunce, aren't you?  
You should work on fixing that someday,  
otherwise you'll be in for some real trouble down the line.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's enough for today, though. Catch you later. ♪

**Yui：**  
Mmm...  
Did it happen again?  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight... Well,  
I guess we both had the same dream again.  
  
**Yui：**  
Sorry. I shouldn't have raised my voice like that.  
What was that thing called? An eraser?  
I guess I didn't want you to see what was written on it.  
  
**Yui：**  
What did it say?  
Sorry, I don't really remember.  
All I know is I didn't want anyone, you included, to see it.  
  
**Yui：**  
Urgh...  
It was his name written on it, but there's no way I can tell him that.  
  
**Yui：**  
That's a good idea for a charm, though.  
Maybe I'll try it out for real.
