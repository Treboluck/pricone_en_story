## Subtitle: Secret Feelings
  
**Narration：**  
One day, {player} pays a visit to  
Yui's guildhouse in search of her.  
  
**Yui：**  
From top to bottom the cleaning goes... ♪  
  
**Yui：**  
Who could that be?  
Just a minute! I'm coming now!  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight!  
Hey there!  
What brings you here today?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I wanna discuss work...  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
Discuss work...?  
Hold on a sec.  
I'm actually right in the middle of cleaning...  
Let me just finish off this bit here.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Help Yui clean.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
Oh? You sure...?  
  
**Yui：**  
Let's see...  
...  
I guess if you help me out, we'll be able to talk sooner.  
All right, do you mind organizing the bookshelf?  
  
**Yui：**  
With you lending me a hand,  
we'll probably be done by noon. ♪  
  
**Yui：**  
I'll be replacing the flowers.  
Let me know when you're done with the bookshelf.  
  
**Yui：**  
Thank goodness... He's feeling better now.  
  
**Yui：**  
Ever since the battle ended, we've been seeing more and more of each  
other, and I feel like we've gotten closer as a result.  
  
**Yui：**  
Also...  
being able to do things together like this  
makes me really happy.  
It's so much fun.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Read the contents of a book.  
`Tag 3`

**Yui：**  
\"Dear Diary, I was lucky enough to bump into Mr. Knight in town today.  
I only managed to speak to him for a bit,  
but I feel like we're getting on  
better than before.\"  
  

---  
  
**Yui：**  
\"Dear Diary, I went to help Mr. Knight with his work,  
but I messed up something pretty important...  
I hope he doesn't hate me for it...\"  
  

---  
  
**Yui：**  
...Huh? He sure is quiet all of a sudden.  
Is he done tidying?  
  

---  
  
**Yui：**  
\"Dear Diary, unlike when we first met,  
I'm able to talk to Mr. Knight more naturally now.  
Little by little, I'll keep chipping away at him.\"  
  

---  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight, Is everything all—  
  
**Yui：**  
Ahhhh! Th-th-th-th-that's...!  
You can read anything but my diary!  
  
**Yui：**  
This is bad...! I never thought anyone would ever read it,  
so I wrote about my love for him like it was nothing!  
  
**Yui：**  
*Pant* *pant*...  
You didn't... read my diary, did you...?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Only the beginning.  
`Tag 4`  
**Yui：**  
Urghhh...  
  
**Yui：**  
Well, if it was just the beginning, I guess it's not a big deal...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'm happy you wrote about me.  
`Tag 5`  
**Yui：**  
You're happy? Really...?  
Can I ask why it makes you feel that way...?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Unlike my memory, written records actually remain.  
`Tag 6`  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight...  
  
**Yui：**  
So he is upset about losing his memory...  
Not having anyone know a thing about you must be scary...  
And lonely...  
  
**Yui：**  
I remember you, Mr. Knight.  
Whatever happens, I always will...  
  
**Yui：**  
...Oh, right. Can you give me back my diary?  
  
**Yui：**  
Ah!  
S-sorry about that!  
I can't believe I dropped it right when you were about to give it back.  
  
**Yui：**  
And it fell open when it landed too...  
...  
What exactly did I write on that day again...?  
  

---  
  
**Yui：**  
\"Dear Diary, Mr. Knight helped me with my shopping today.  
I wonder if we look like lovers when we walk together...  
I wish I'd plucked up the courage to tell him how I feel—\"  
  

---  
  
**Yui：**  
Wahhh...! At this rate, he's going to find out exactly how I feel!  
  
**Yui：**  
Wait...! Could that be a good thing...?!  
But I want to tell him how I feel properly...  
I-I need to stop him!  
  
**Yui：**  
You can't read any more than that!  
  
**Yui：**  
Owww... S-sorry!  
I panicked and couldn't stop...  
  
**Yui：**  
The bookshelf is falling!  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight, watch out!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Protect Yui.  
`Tag 7`  
**Yui：**  
...Ngh...  
Mr. Knight, are you...  
okay...?  
  
**Yui：**  
Ahhhhh...! He's way too close...!  
Our bodies are stuck together! I can't even move a little bit, or else—  
  
**Yui：**  
Aaaaghh!  
M-Mr. Knight! That's my...!  
  
**Yui：**  
I haven't sorted out my feelings yet,  
so I'm not ready to do this!  
  
**Yui：**  
Forgive meee!  
  
**Narration：**  
Thus, Yui fled the guildhouse, and when she apologetically returned a  
short while later, {player} was still silently cleaning.
