## Subtitle: A Reliable Partner?
  
**Narration：**  
{player}, having taken on a monster extermination job,  
gets ready to set off to his destination.  
  
**Yui：**  
Hey there, Mr. Knight.  
I take it you've got work?  
  
**Yui：**  
Monster extermination, huh...  
Hey, do you mind if I tag along?  
You're always helping me out, so it's only fair to repay the favor.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Not at all.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
Great! Thanks.  
I'll back you up with my magic, so you fight to your heart's content.  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRRRRUOOOGHHHH...  
  
**Yui：**  
Good job out there. That makes ten, doesn't it?  
There could be more around, so best to keep our guard up.  
  
**Yui：**  
Fire resistance, ice resistance... There we go.  
I gave you some extra buffs,  
so you should be good to g—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
Look out!  
  
**Monster：**  
Rrrrghhhhh!  
  
**Yui：**  
The more we defeat, the more keep popping up...  
I'm surprised this is happening when we're so close to town...  
  
**Yui：**  
Wait a minute. Your arm's injured!  
Let me heal you up!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll leave it to you.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
Yup!  
Then again, this is about the most I can do.  
  
**Yui：**  
I won't lie,  
there was a time when I hated the fact that I was just  
a support member. But now I've got you relying on me...  
  
**Yui：**  
If you're gonna get injured,  
then I should just buff your body as a whole!  
  
**Yui：**  
One buff alone might not be enough, so I'll stack another on top.  
  
**Yui：**  
Still not enough! One more!  
  
**Yui：**  
Hmm... Maybe one more...  
  
**Yui：**  
Just a little bit more...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I think I'm good now...  
`Tag 3`  
**Yui：**  
Fair point.  
 I stacked plenty of them,  
so you should be ready for action.  
I'm not sure how  
many monsters are left, but you can handle them easily now.  
  
**Monster：**  
Rrrrghhhhh!  
  
**Yui：**  
Amazing!  
You took it down in one hit again!  
  
**Yui：**  
Seems like it was the last one, too.  
Good job out there, Mr. Knight.  
  
**Yui：**  
Let's go a bit further out. If nothing turns up, then we can go back to town.  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight...?  
Is something wrong?  
  
**Yui：**  
Wait, are you okay?!  
Get a grip!  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh no, he's freezing!  
His body must be giving out after exerting himself too much!  
What should I do...?  
  
**Yui：**  
O-okay, he needs his stamina back!  
I'll warm him up first!  
  
**Yui：**  
Please wake up... I'm begging you.  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight!  
Oh, thank goodness.  
Sorry, I completely forgot that magic doesn't enhance your stamina.  
You'll get stronger but also feel the effects if you exert yourself too much.  
  
**Yui：**  
You should be able to move now that your body's warmed back up.  
Can you?  
  
**Yui：**  
Hmm...? Wait, why is my face so close to his?!  
I know I was worried about him, but this is a little much...!  
  
**Yui：**  
S-sorry about that!  
Hard to move if I'm so close, right?  
Ahaha...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  ...  
`Tag 4`  
**Yui：**  
...  
Is it just me, or is he blushing as much as I am?  
  
**Yui：**  
Let me heal you up a bit, too. Can't be too safe.  
  
**Yui：**  
There we go.  
Okay, we should get going.  
  
**Yui：**  
How're you feeling?  
You're not tired or anything, right?  
We've walked a fair bit, so let me heal you up again.  
  
**Yui：**  
Phew. We made it back without any issues.  
I guess we got lucky.  
Hey, Mr. Knight. Did me being there today make a difference?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  More than you can imagine.  
`Tag 5`  
**Yui：**  
Really?  
That's a relief.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I'm no good without you.  
`Tag 6`  
**Yui：**  
I'm the same!  
As much as I try, I'm just a mess if you're not there.  
  
**Yui：**  
Hehe.  
Well, I guess we're even.  
  
**Yui：**  
That's a surprise. I had no idea he felt that way about me...  
But still. It's thanks to him that I'm here in the first place.  
I owe him a lot more than he thinks.  
  
**Yui：**  
If that's how you feel,  
then I'll do whatever I can to help you out. Promise!
