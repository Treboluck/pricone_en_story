## Subtitle: Blooming Love
  
**Narration：**  
As Yui makes her way back to Landosol after shopping in a nearby town,  
she notices someone sleeping in the shade of a tree.  
  
**Yui：**  
Is that... Mr. Knight?  
It's pretty dangerous to be napping  
in a place like this...  
  
**Yui：**  
There's a light shining from Mr. Knight...!  
Isn't that the strange light from a while back?  
  
**Yui：**  
It's too bright...!  
Mr. Knight...!

**Yui：**  
...Good morning, {player}.  
  
**Yui：**  
Me? I came to get something I forgot.  
You seemed like you were having a nice nap,  
so I stayed quiet so as not to wake you.  
  
**Yui：**  
...I can't tell him that I was watching his sleeping face  
and lost track of time.  
  
**Yui：**  
I wonder if he'll go home now too.  
...I hope we can walk together.  
  
**Yui：**  
...This classroom after school  
is straight out of a dream, don't you think?  
  
**Yui：**  
...If this really is a dream, then maybe  
I can tell him how I feel...  
  
**Yui：**  
Umm...  
Can we go home together?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Of course.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
Thank you...!  
  
**Yui：**  
A chance like this sure is rare...  
Can I really  
tell him how I feel...?

**Yui：**  
...Thanks for walking home with me today.  
  
**Yui：**  
...By the way, the offline meetup the other day was real fun, wasn't it?  
  
**Yui：**  
...Oh yeah! Yesterday, Makoto...  
  
**Yui：**  
The more we walk, the more my will to tell him what's in my heart  
escapes me...  
What should I do...?  
  
**Yui：**  
At this rate...  
  
**Yui：**  
Ah...  
This is where we... part ways.

**Yui：**  
...My house is this way.  
...Thank you  
for walking home with me today.  
  
**Yui：**  
...I guess I'll see you tomorrow...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I wanna hear what you've got to say.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
What I've got to say...?  
  
**Yui：**  
{player}... So you realized there was something  
I wanted to tell you, but couldn't...  
  
**Yui：**  
...I understand, you know.  
...That you being so kind to me doesn't mean anything special.  
  
**Yui：**  
But it doesn't matter if it's nothing special. At least, that's what I keep  
telling myself... I just don't want you to hate me, so I keep my feelings  
inside... Because maybe one day, these feelings will fade away...  
  
**Yui：**  
...Even though I know they won't.  
  
**Yui：**  
...To be honest, I always  
want to be with you.  
  
**Yui：**  
Not just on the way home, but actually by your side, forever...  
And... I want you to be by my side...!  
  
**Yui：**  
...What I'm saying is...  
  
**Yui：**  
I really... like...  
you...  
  
**Yui：**  
...S-sorry! Suddenly spewing my feelings all over you  
is a bit annoying, right...?!  
  
**Yui：**  
...G-goodbye!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'll always be by your side.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yui：**  
{player}...!  
Really...?  
Are you sure? It's me we're talking about...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'm sure because it's you.  
`Tag 4`  
**Yui：**  
...Thank you.  
  
**Yui：**  
...You know, it's not that far, so would you mind seeing me to my  
house...? I want to spend more time talking to you...

How was today's dream? I saw some interesting things. ♪  
  
**Ameth：**  
Yui made a bold move, didn't she? You too, of course.  
Who'd have thought you'd say such a thing...?!  
You'd better take full responsibility!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Until next time. ♪ I wish you two happiness. ♪

**Yui：**  
...Urghhh.  
...It was just a dream,  
but I confessed to Mr. Knight...  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight!  
G-good morning...!  
  
**Yui：**  
I was wondering if... you'd like  
to go grocery shopping together...  
  
**Yui：**  
...  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight  
... I had a dream.  
I was with you in a classroom... with a view of the setting sun....  
  
Do you by chance remember it...?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Nope. Sorry.  
**Choice: (6)**  I was with you...?  
`Tag 5`  
**Yui：**  
...Of course you don't. Sorry for asking such an odd question.  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Yui：**  
Yeah...  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Choice: (8)**  It feels like I made some kind of important promise...  
`Tag 8`  
**Yui：**  
...Don't worry about it.  
...Thanks for trying to remember.  
  
**Yui：**  
I guess it was all just a dream after all...  
  
**Yui：**  
So only in a dream can I actually tell him how I feel...  
  
**Yui：**  
...No.  
Thinking like that will get me nowhere!  
  
**Yui：**  
I was able to say it in my dream, so one day I want to be able to say  
the same thing in real life as well!  
  
**Yui：**  
You know, Mr. Knight...  
I actually have one more wish.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  I'll do what I can to help fulfill that wish.  
`Tag 9`  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight...!  
Thank you...  
I'm going to try hard!  
Someday, I'll make my wish come true!  
  
**Narration：**  
Because of the dream she shared with {player},  
Yui developed a new wish, which she decided she  
would pursue until its realization.
