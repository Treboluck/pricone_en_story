**Narration：**  
Yui, having made a quick escape from the guildhouse,  
eventually returns to finish cooking.  
  
**Yui：**  
Here we go. Fresh omurice, right off the pan.  
 Sorry for the wait.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh baby, here we go!  
 Yui's cooking is pretty much chef tier,  
so get ready for a treat.  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh, you're just exaggerating.  
My family runs a restaurant, so I just kind of picked it up naturally.  
Don't expect anything fancy.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey, mind telling me why you came running out the guildhouse?  
Did something happen?  
Don't tell me you got in an argument.  
  
**Yui：**  
Err, well...  
You see...  
  
**Makoto：**  
And here I was hanging around, waiting for the right time to head back in.  
Oh well, there's food on the table now. That's good enough. ♪  
  
**Yui：**  
You're something else, Makoto.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Aight. Less talking, more eating.  
Don't wanna let it get cold!  
  
**Yui：**  
Good point.  
Feel free to dig in, Mr. Knight.  
Hopefully it's to your tastes.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Chow time.  
Yup. That's the good stuff!  
Honestly,  
I wish you'd cook for me every day of the week.  
  
**Yui：**  
Thanks. Just don't expect that to actually happen.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh man, I just had a genius idea.  
Hey, {player}. How about you let Yui personally  
feed you? I bet it'll taste even better like that.  
  
**Yui：**  
What?!  
Where did that come from?!  
  
**Yui：**  
S-sorry about that. She just really likes her jokes,  
so no need to take her seriously. Okay?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm taking her very seriously.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
You are?! P-  
please don't put me on the spot like this...  
  
**Yui：**  
I mean, I'd like to. I'd *really* like to...  
It's just... It's too embarrassing!  
  
**Yui：**  
Then again. This is my moment, isn't it?  
How am I supposed to be brave on the battlefield if I can't even do this?  
  
**Yui：**  
Okay. I'll do it.  
The food's here. The spoon's here. The courage... is here!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Atta girl! Show him what you're made of!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hold up.  
This... ain't quite the romantic episode I was hoping for.  
  
**Yui：**  
Right! I'm going in!  
  
**Yui：**  
Open wide...  
  
**Yui：**  
H-how is it?  
Does it taste okay?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It's delicious.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
Phew...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You should give it a try.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yui：**  
Good point.  
*munch*  
Mmm! You're right!  
I was kind of worried that I'd made it too strong, but this is perf—  
  
**Yui：**  
...  
  
**Yui：**  
Did I... Did I just take a bite from the same spoon as him?  
Oh lord, I did!  
That means we practically kissed...!  
  
**Yui：**  
Ah, ahhh...!  
  
**Yui：**  
*collapse*  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yui?! You okay?!  
Come back to us! YUUUIII!  
  
**Yui：**  
*wither, wither*
