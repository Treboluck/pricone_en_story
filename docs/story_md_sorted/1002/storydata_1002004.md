Yui and {player} are shown a dream by Ames, who's amused by their attitude towards one another within it. Upon waking up, Yui makes the bold claim that she wants to spend more time with {player}.
  
## Subtitle: So Close, Yet So Far
  
**Narration：**  
{player} was, as usual,  
tagging along for Yui's training session.  
  
**Yui：**  
Thanks again, Mr. Knight.  
It's always nice having you here for these.  
  
**Yui：**  
Two secs. I kind of hurt my foot there.  
I can fix it right up though, so don't worry.  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh?  
This spell shouldn't have this much of an effect...  
  
**Yui：**  
What's going on here?  
I-It keeps getting brighter!  
  

---  
  
**Yui：**  
Let's see...  
Yeah, this should be the right seat.  
  
**Yui：**  
I guess I'm not sitting beside Makoto anymore.  
A shame, but I guess that's the point of rearranging everyone's seats.  
  
**Yui：**  
This is kind of nerve-wracking.  
Hopefully I can get along with whoever's beside me...  
  
**Yui：**  
In an ideal world, it'd be {player}.  
As if, though. That'd be too convenient.  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh, here they come! I need to say hello!  
Okay, deep breaths. Don't come on too strongly...  
  
**Yui：**  
Umm... It's a pleasure.  
  
**Yui：**  
Wait.  
What're you doing here, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  We're sitting beside each other.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
Really?!  
Well then... That's nice.  
I guess things can work out conveniently.  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh, sorry.  
I'm just... kind of shy,  
so it's nice sitting beside someone I know.  
Especially since we went to the same middle school.  
  
**Yui：**  
I'm not lying, at least.  
Just... bending the truth a bit. Just a little bit.  
  
**Yui：**  
This is my chance, though. I can't waste it!  
  
**Yui：**  
H-hey, umm...  
  
**Yui：**  
Err...  
The weather sure is nice today, huh?  
Still plenty of cherry blossoms in bloom, too.  
It's, uh, really pretty...  
  
**Yui：**  
Sorry,  
just ignore me!  
  
**Yui：**  
Augh...  
My nerves got the best of me. I barely talked to him after that...  
  
**Yui：**  
It's about time to head home,  
too. I should at least say bye.  
  
**Yui：**  
See you tomorrow, {player}.  
Sorry again for the... weird stuff I said earlier.  
It won't happen again.  
I hope.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Thanks for taking the time to talk to me.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
Huh? No, not at all!  
If anything, I should be thanking you for bothering to listen.  
We went to the same middle school, but we never really spoke, so...  
  
**Yui：**  
Hey... This is kind of a weird thing to ask,  
but do you mind if I talk to you again tomorrow?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Not at all.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yui：**  
Thanks. That's a big relief.  
Anyway, see you tomorrow!

**Ameth：**  
Ahaha! That sure was a riot!  
So how did you like it? Sure was a great present, wasn't it?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I know you're curious, so let me spill the beans. That was a little  
\"dream\" I conjured up for you, based on fragments from your  
and Yui's memories.  
Surprised? I bet you are.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Man though, talk about a maiden in lo—  
Actually, no. I shouldn't say any more than that.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hey. Don't grill me because you're too dense to get it.  
Honestly, Yui sure has some... questionable taste.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway. If you wanna experience more of that,  
then go gather up some more memory shards.  
  
**Ameth：**  
They're way more important than you'd imagine, too.  
If anything, they're one of your best bets for understanding  
what's going on in this world.  
 So yeah. Good luck. ♪

**Yui：**  
Mmm... Where am I?  
Oh, right. I was in the middle of healing my foot, then everything got really bright...  
  
**Yui：**  
It... looks like it's healed up.  
That's good, at least.  
  
**Yui：**  
Hey, Mr. Knight. Is it just me, or were we in a completely different place just there?  
It was kind of like... a school?  
  
**Yui：**  
I won't lie, it would've been nice if that was real.  
Going to school together seems like it'd be fun.  
  
**Yui：**  
Hanging out like we are right now is great,  
but there's something so appealing about meeting up after school and all that.  
  
**Yui：**  
O-of course, just as classmates!  
Never, ever would I fantasize about us being besties. Or even us dating!  
Yup, that's it! Just comrades in arms, doing comrades in arms thing!  
  
**Yui：**  
I want us to be together through the best times and the worst times.  
So yeah. Please don't hold back if you ever need something.  
I'll be there, no matter what!  
  
**Yui：**  
...I guess it's about time we make our way back.  
Thanks again, Mr. Knight.  
It's always a pleasure. I mean it.
