## Subtitle: Operation Lunchtime!
  
**Yui：**  
And that's the gist of it.  
He's been coming along with me ever since, which is nice.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Well then.  
Lemme be straight here. You fancy him, don't you?  
  
**Yui：**  
F-fancy?!  
No! We're just, uh, good friends!  
More importantly, we're here to shop!  
 Let's focus on that!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Fine, fine. You're a real handful, you know that?  
...  
Hey, Yui. Look over there.  
Isn't that {player}?  
  
**Yui：**  
Come on, Makoto.  
No need to tease me like tha—  
Wait a minute.  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight?!  
H-hey there!  
Lovely weather we're having, isn't it?! W-what're you doing here?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh man...  
She's as stiff as a board.  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh, you're looking for somewhere to eat?  
Well then...  
  
**Makoto：**  
This is as good a chance as any, Yui.  
  
You should invite him over for lunch.  
  
**Yui：**  
What?!  
N-no way! I'm not ready for that sort of progress...  
  
**Yui：**  
O-oh, don't mind us!  
Anyway, we've got to go.  
Important shopping and all tha—  
  
**Yui：**  
Hey...  
Would you,  
uh, mind joining us for lunch? We won't force you, of course.  
  
**Yui：**  
We're actually shopping for ingredients right now,  
and there's no better spice than eating with others.  
How about it?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sounds great.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
Really?  
  
**Makoto：**  
That's that! Let's get the shopping out of the way quick, then.  
Good for you, Yui.  
  
**Yui：**  
Phew, finally home.  
Feel free to take a seat, Mr. Knight.  
Me and Makoto will handle the cooking.  
  
**Makoto：**  
You heard the lady. Keep your butt in the seat.  
So Yui. I get that you're into him,  
but how'd it happen in the first place?  
  
**Yui：**  
Shh, he might hear you.  
Anyway—  
  
**Makoto：**  
So he might be the knight you keep dreaming about?  
Hmm... Guess that makes sense, all things considered.  
Think I'd kinda act the same if that was the case.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Aight! Lemme show you how a good friend rolls.  
  
**Yui：**  
Makoto?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh, shoot! Forgot I had some work left to do!  
You two hold the fort here.  
I'll go get it wrapped up nice and quick!  
  
**Yui：**  
Where'd that come from?!  
Aaand she's gone...  
  
**Yui：**  
N-no worries!  
We're down a person, but I can still cook on my own.  
  
**Yui：**  
First and foremost, meal prep.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let me help.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
Really? You honestly don't need to worry about it.  
W-well, I guess I could use another pair of hands.  
  
**Yui：**  
Wait, when did you get behind me?!  
You were sitting down just a second ag—  
Ahh!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Help her.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yui：**  
Urgh... That...  
didn't hurt at all?  
Huh?  
  
**Yui：**  
M-Mr. Knight?!  
W-what's going on here?!  
  
**Yui：**  
And why are you h-hugging me?!  
We're so close... Too close!  
  
**Yui：**  
I... This is...!  
I just can't!  
  
**Yui：**  
I'm sorry!  
  
**Yui：**  
Urgh...  
I went and ruined the whole thing...  
I'm such a dunce!
