## Subtitle: This Time, For Sure
  
**Yui：**  
It's still alive...?!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAAARGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
I won't make it in time...!  
  
**Monster：**  
RRRAAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Shield her.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight!  
Now's my chance!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRRRRUOOOGHHHH...  
  
**Yui：**  
Are you okay?! Don't worry, I'll heal you up.  
  
**Yui：**  
Thanks for that.  
I wish I was strong enough that you wouldn't need to shield me, though.  
I hate seeing you get hurt...  
  
**Yui：**  
One day, for sure. I'll be the one protecting you.  
  
**Yui：**  
Hmm... Yup,  
I've got everything.  
  
**Yui：**  
Another day, another repeat of that same dream.  
The other person in it sure does remind me of Mr. Knight...  
  
**Yui：**  
He's super kind,  
and he's always there for me...  
  
**Yui：**  
Yeah, they really are similar.  
I know it's just a dream and all, but I can't shake this feeling I've got.  
There has to be some connection between them.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Greet her.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
Oh,  
hey there.  
I didn't expect to meet you here.  
  
**Yui：**  
Me?  
I'm, uh...  
I'm considering heading out of town to train up.  
  
**Yui：**  
I really, really hate being dead weight.  
Everyone's always protecting me during battle, so I want to do the same.  
  
**Yui：**  
You wanna come with me? Really?  
Well, I did feel a little... hesitant, if I'm being honest.  
So yeah, I'll take you up on that.  
  
**Yui：**  
This feels like a good spot.  
Monsters are bound to be lurking about this far off the main road—  
  
**Monster：**  
RRRAAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
...!  
That was quick!  
We've been spotted, but it's still pretty far away.  
We should have enough time to hit it with some magic first...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAAARGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh...?  
 Did it just, uh, start dashing towards us?  
  
**Yui：**  
N-not good, not good!  
Calm down, me! First things first—stop it in its tracks!  
  
**Yui：**  
S-stay strong!  
Be brave!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAAARGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
Nope! Noooope!  
  
**Yui：**  
*sob*  
  
**Yui：**  
I'm so sorry, Mr. Knight...  
You put the time aside to come along,  
but I'm just wasting it.  
  
**Yui：**  
Fighting on my own's just too much...  
I try to put myself on the frontlines, but my body just freezes up.  
  
**Yui：**  
I want to change. I want to become stronger.  
But it looks like that'll never happen...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  There's no need to fight on your own.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yui：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'm here with you.  
`Tag 4`  
**Yui：**  
Thank you. I mean it.  
Okay, you're right. Let me give it one more shot.  
  
**Yui：**  
If things go south, then you can help me out.  
But I'll give it everything I've got!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAAARGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
Here it comes!  
Are you ready, Mr. Knight?  
Let's go!  
  
**Yui：**  
Weh!  
  
**Yui：**  
Nice, it landed!  
  
**Monster：**  
RRRAAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
Eeek!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Make the save.  
`Tag 5`  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight?!  
Urgh! Down you go!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRRRRUOOOGHHHH...  
  
**Yui：**  
Did you see that, Mr. Knight?!  
I did it!  
It was close, but I really did it!  
  
**Yui：**  
...Oh, I'm so sorry!  
I got too caught up in the excitement.

**Yui：**  
Wait, that wound looks pretty bad!  
Give me just a sec. I'll heal you right up!  
  
**Yui：**  
He's always there for me, no matter the circumstances. Just like in those dreams...  
That's not good enough, though. I wanna be able to support him, too.  
  
**Yui：**  
Sorry. It's my fault you got hurt.  
If only I was stronger. Then this never would have happened...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Don't apologize. I'm always happy to help you.  
`Tag 6`  
**Yui：**  
Thanks. That means a lot to me.  
Umm... I can't promise that it'll be anytime soon,  
but I'm gonna  
get stronger. Not just for my sake, but yours as well!
