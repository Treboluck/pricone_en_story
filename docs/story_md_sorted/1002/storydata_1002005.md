## Subtitle: One Step at a Time
  
**Yui：**  
There we go.  
Thank you very much.  
  
**Staff 1：**  
I'll get in touch if I get my hands on any other spellbooks that might interest you.  
  
**Yui：**  
Uh-oh. These bags pretty heavy already.  
I'm only one store in, too.  
  
**Yui：**  
I can't help it, though. There's still so many spells I don't know.  
What's more,  
I've been coming across a lot more situations  
where magic is essential these days.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Offer to carry her bags.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
Oh, Mr. Knight! Don't worry about it.  
It's a bit heavy, but nothing I can't handle on my own.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  That won't do.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
Thanks.  
Hey, do you mind if we visit another store?  
There's still a few more spellbooks I'd like.  
  
**Yui：**  
He really is so kind...  
Always willing to help, whether it be in real life or in those dreams.  
  
**Yui：**  
Now that I think about it, this kind of feels like we're on a date.  
  
**Yui：**  
A... date? Oh no.  
This isn't good. I'm starting to get all nervous!  
Okay. Calm down, Yui. Breath in, breath out.  
  
**Yui：**  
Well, that didn't work!  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh! This is the store I was talking about.  
Phew. We almost went right by it.  
Good afternoon!  
  
**Yui：**  
Hmm? Wait a minute...  
  
**Staff 2：**  
Welcome!  
Remember that magazine you asked about? It finally came in!  
  
**Yui：**  
U-uh-oh! I got the wrong store!  
This one doesn't sell spellbooks!  
  
**Yui：**  
Err. I, uh,  
have no recollection of these events. None whatsoever. Nope.  
  
**Staff 2：**  
Really? That's a shame. I guess this month's issue  
of \"Your Coach in Love\" will have to go to someone else.  
  
**Yui：**  
Don't say its name out loud!  
Urgh, this is so embarrassing. Someone get me out of here...  
  
**Yui：**  
W-wait a minute!  
L-let's not get ahead of ourselves.  
Today's just, uh...  
  
**Yui：**  
I mean, I *did* order it.  
I just don't want him to know about it.  
  
**Yui：**  
This magazine's so popular, though.  
If I don't buy it now, it'll sell out right away.  
  
**Yui：**  
Okay. I'll take one copy.  
  
**Staff 2：**  
Good stuff!  
I'll even give you a little discount since you're with your boyfriend.  
  
**Yui：**  
M-my boyfriend?!  
N-no, you've got it all wrong!  
  
**Staff 2：**  
Oh, really?  
 All the stores around here started giving discounts to couples,  
so we took up the same policy.  
  
**Staff 2：**  
My bad, though. I saw him carrying your bags,  
so I assumed you two were pretty much official.  
  
**Yui：**  
I've spent enough as it is today, so a discount WOULD be nice.  
But I don't want to lie, either...  
  
**Yui：**  
If anything, I don't even deserve a discount.  
Not when I still haven't found the courage to tell him how I feel.  
  
**Yui：**  
I'm sorry. You see—  
  
**Choice: (3)**  We'll gladly take the discount.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yui：**  
Huh?!  
 What?!  
Wh-what's gotten into your head, Mr. Knight?! We're not—  
  
**Staff 2：**  
Right-o! One discount, coming up!  
Here's your book... and here's your change!  
  
**Yui：**  
W-waugh!  
Th-thank you! Very much!  
  
**Staff 2：**  
Thanks for your patronage!  
Also, you two make a sweet couple!  
  
**Yui：**  
Umm... H-hey, Mr. Knight.  
Thanks for that.  
I-I really appreciate it.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Always nice to get a discount.  
`Tag 4`  
**Yui：**  
Y-yeah!  
 That's precisely what I meant!  
Ahaha!  
  
**Yui：**  
What if... What if it's not just that clerk?  
Do we... actually look like a couple to everyone else?  
  
**Yui：**  
If we do, then that just proves how close we've gotten, right?!  
I mean. There's no two ways about it. I really do like him.  
How does he feel about me, though?  
  
**Yui：**  
H-hey, Mr. Knight!  
Err... H-how do you—  
  
**Yui：**  
A-actually, forget I said anything!  
Sorry, just ignore me!  
Urgh...  
  
**Yui：**  
Umm, do you mind helping me carry this stuff back to the guildhouse?  
S-speaking of which!  
I'll make you some nice tea once we get there!  
  
**Yui：**  
Argh...!I'm such a mess! These nerves are too much!  
Makoto, where are you?!  
I won't make it through the day like this!
