## Subtitle: Time to Say Goodbye?!
  
**Narration：**  
As usual, Miyako is playing with {player}.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Wait right there, {player}!  
You have no chance of winning tag against flying Miya—  
Whoaaa?!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Urghh... M-Miyako fell to the ground...  
Wh-what happened just now?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are you OK?  
`Tag 1`  
**Miyako：**  
I... I don't really know...  
But my head feels all hurty...  
Uhhh... Ahhh....  
  
**Miyako：**  
Urghhh... Lately Miyako hasn't been feeling so good...  
And it's only getting worse...  
  

---  
  
**Miyako：**  
Huhhh?! Miyako's body is randomly vanishing?!  
What's going on?  
  
**Miyako：**  
O-oh no...  
Could Miyako be... passing on to the next life?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I don't want you to go...  
**Choice: (3)**  Passing on is a good thing, right?  
`Tag 2`  
**Miyako：**  
Ahhhh... Me either...  
Not being able to play with you anymore sounds lonely...  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Miyako：**  
R-really?  
Yay then! Lucky for Miyako! Eheheh!  
  
**Miyako：**  
...B-but... If Miyako passes on...  
How will I play with {player} anymore?  
That sounds not fun...  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Miyako：**  
I'll never see you ever again...  
Aahhh...  
  
**Miyako：**  
...  
  
**Miyako：**  
...Oh! But!  
  
**Miyako：**  
But, but, Miyako is just a ghost,  
so I always knewed I would disappear sometime. So I'm fine!  
No need for worrying, {player}!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ummm...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Actually, there's one thing  
Miyako was planning to say to {player}...  
before passing on and disappearing.  
  
**Miyako：**  
I know how to plan and stuff, so I thought about it every day!  
Made sure I was ready for whenever this happened!  
Heheh!  
  
**Miyako：**  
It's just... This was a bit sudden, so...  
I was kind of surprised, that's all.  
Eheheh...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hey, {player}...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Thank you for everything.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Since Miyako met you, every day has been lots of fun.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Before meeting {player}, I would just eat pudding,  
randomly float around Landosol sometimes,  
and when I got hungry, eat some more pudding again.  
  
**Miyako：**  
That was pretty fun too, but...  
Now everything's different!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Now I play with {player}, eat some pudding, play some  
more with {player}, eat more pudding, then play with  
{player}, play with {player}...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Play with {player}, play with {player}...  
Play with {player}, play with {player}...  
Play with {player}...  
  
**Miyako：**  
It was fun before, but... Now is way, way more fun...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako is only a ghost... And you're a real living person...  
So playing with Miyako probably isn't much fun, but...  
You always find time for me anyway...  
  
**Miyako：**  
...That makes me happy.  
  
**Miyako：**  
So thank you, {player}!  
  
**Miyako：**  
...  
  
**Miyako：**  
I... love you!  
  
**Miyako：**  
...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Eheheh... That's the end of the one thing...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Now I can pass on with no problems!  
Ahhh, but... I wish I could've eaten a belly full of pudding first...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Buy pudding for Miyako.  
`Tag 5`  
**Miyako：**  
{player}? Did you buy pudding for Miyako?  
That's so nice...  
I'll eat it all up!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Munchy munchy...  
Maybe not quite enough though...  
This won't fill Miyako up full...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Buy more pudding for Miyako.  
`Tag 6`  
**Miyako：**  
Munchy munchy... Munchy munchy...  
That feels much betterer!  
Almost getting to full!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Buy more and more puddings for Miyako.  
`Tag 7`  
**Miyako：**  
This is the yummiest!  
Miyako just realized. Miyako can never be full of pudding!  
There's always room for more and more pudding!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Is it me, or are you getting more... lively?  
`Tag 8`  
**Miyako：**  
Huh? Now that you mention,  my head feels less hurty...  
And my body isn't vanishy either!  
Eating all that pudding made me feel way better! Hmm?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ah! I know what happened now!  
Recently, I've had so much fun playing with {player},  
I forgot to eat much pudding!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Not eating enough pudding made Miyako's body feel funny!  
Now that I ate all that pudding, everything's back to normal!  
Problems all solved!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Thank goodness Miyako didn't pass on!  
Now I can keep on eating all the puddings  
and playing with {player}!  
  
**Miyako：**  
All this relief makes me feel hungry...  
Good thing we still have leftover pudding!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  ...Any chance of a refund?  
`Tag 9`  
**Miyako：**  
No refunds!  
This pudding was a present from you to Miyako!  
It's all Miyako's pudding now!  
  
**Miyako：**  
But... it is lots of pudding...so I'll share a little bit with you too.  
I think if you eat pudding with Miyako,  
it will give Miyako even more energy!  
  
**Narration：**  
...Somehow, {player} had a feeling that Miyako wasn't going to be passing on any time soon.
