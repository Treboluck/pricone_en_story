**Miyako：**  
No point searching so hard for old things about Miyako.  
Better to spend time buying pudding!

But... But... This feels quite complicated for Miyako...  
Darling Big Bro Master doesn't remember his own bride...  
That makes Miyako lonely...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hey, Darling Big Bro Master...  
Did you even forget the special promise we made?  
  
**Miyako：**  
...You know.  
Our very... super special... mega important promise...  
  
**Miyako：**  
This is the place, Darling Big Bro Master!  
When we went our separate ways, we promised to meet again here!  
Surely you remember a little bit?  
  
**Miyako：**  
We promised to meet here... at this bank...  
and take out all of our moneys!  
Then we'd spend all the moneys on buying pudding!  
  
**Miyako：**  
What's wrong, Darling Big Bro Master?  
{player}'s money is sister and wife Miyako's money too,  
right?  
 Quick, take the moneys out of the bank!  
  
**Miyako：**  
...Ummmmm.  
  
Wh-why do I feel... you might not totally believe Miyako?  
Trust your friend Miyako and get those moneys quick!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Friend? Not sister-wife-maid?  
`Tag 8`  
**Miyako：**  
Ahhhh!  
Th-that was, um... Just a little tongue slip thingy!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Come on, if you take out moneys and buy Miyako pudding,  
you get royal tax cuts!  
 100% off!  
  
**Miyako：**  
...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Umm. Miyako... just remembered something else...  
A very important errand! Bye-bye now!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Why won't such a classic scam work for Miyako...  
  
**Narration：**  
And so Miyako's true identity remained a mystery...
