**Narration：**  
One day, {player} is enjoying a leisurely walk  
when suddenly Miyako shows up in a deathly panic.  
  
**Miyako：**  
This is bad! It's the worstest! It's the terriblestest!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako looked in all the shops, but there's no pudding!  
All pudding disappeared from the world!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Somehow pudding got really popular!  
Pudding is sold out everywhere!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako needs pudding!  
Do something quick!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ahh! What's this bright light?!  
Isn't this... just like that one time before?!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Too shiny agaaaiiinnnn!!!

**Miyako：**  
{player}! There's no pudding!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Somehow everyone went crazy for pudding!  
There's none left at the supermarket, none in cafes or anywhere...  
  
**Miyako：**  
...There was a program on TV about a \"pudding diet\"?  
As if pudding could help anyone get thin!  
Silly sheeple shouldn't trust TV so much!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  If there's none anywhere, what can I do?  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll buy you pudding another time, OK?  
`Tag 1`  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako can't live without pudding!  
I need pudding right here right now!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako can't wait that long!  
I need pudding now or I'll collapse!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Miyako：**  
Only one option left...  
{player}, you make pudding!  
If there's no pudding, we can make our own!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Here we go then! Operation Pudding, start!  
Here. Miyako brought a bucket!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  ...To throw away the trash?  
**Choice: (5)**  ...For making sandcastles?  
`Tag 4`  
**Miyako：**  
Sigh... You lose your common sense?  
How would making pudding make trash to fill a bucket?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Obviously this bucket is to make pudding in!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Miyako：**  
You can be very silly sometimes.  
If you run off to the beach, who'll make the pudding?  
  
**Miyako：**  
We'll use this bucket to make one GIANT pudding!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Miyako：**  
Now we're all ready to start the pudding-making!  
The head chef is me, Master Chef Miyako Izumo! Eheh!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Lovely Assistant {player}, your first order is...  
Crack all these eggs into the bucket!  
Crack neatly and with good rhythm!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Good! Next up you take the sugar and milk,  
pour 'em into the bucket and mix well!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Good job good job!  
Now you make the caramelly sauce!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  ...Aren't you going to help at all?  
`Tag 7`  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako's helping by cheering you on.  
You can use my cheering energy to make pudding!  
  
**Miyako：**  
The bucket of pudding is complete!  
It looks deliciable...

**Miyako：**  
Time for the most important job... tasting!  
Munchy munchy... Chompy chompy!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Yep. It tastes pretty okay.  
Pudding bought in shops is about ten times more yummy,  
but pudding is pudding, and pudding is good!  
  
**Miyako：**  
This spoon feels too small...  
Miyako wants to eat with a shovel!  
Chompy chompy... Munchy munchy!  
  
**Miyako：**  
No matter how much I eat there's still more! It's infinite happiness!  
Who needs quality when we have quantity?  
Bucket pudding is the bestestest!  
  
**Miyako：**  
{player}, you did very good work.  
Many thanks from Miyako!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Oh yes. Don't forget to wash the dishes.  
Also, the fridge is totally empty now.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Could it be those eggs and milk... were for making dinner later?  
Oh well! No problem really.  
Dinner is tiny and pointless next to bucket pudding! Munchy munchy!  
  
**Miyako：**  
You really are the bestest, {player}!

**Ameth：**  
So Miyako loves pudding just as much over \"there,\" huh?  
She sure knows what she likes...  
  
**Ameth：**  
In the end, we never did find out how she became a ghost...  
This may be a trickier mystery than I thought.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Even from where I'm standing,  
Miyako is a unique case, to say the least...  
Though I guess that's what makes her so cute.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ah well, we'll just have to wait and see!  
Well then, I'll see you around!  
  

---  
  
**Miyako：**  
Oh! You finally woke back up!  
I was all snoozy too until just now.  
  
**Miyako：**  
I had the deliciousest dream though!  
You made me a whole bucket of pudding!  
  
**Miyako：**  
You had that dream too?  
This is just like the other time...  
So much mystery...  
  
**Miyako：**  
But that bucket of pudding really was yummy!  
Makes me want to go eat real pudding right now!  
Oh, but... all the shops are still sold out...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ahh! I've got a great idea!  
If we have no pudding, we can make it like in the dream!  
  
**Miyako：**  
C'mon, c'mon!  
Make bucket pudding for Miyako!  
  
**Narration：**  
So in preparation for Operation Pudding, Take Two,  
{player} and Miyako headed off to buy ingredients.
