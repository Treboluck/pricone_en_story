## Subtitle: The Path of Pudding
  
**Narration：**  
{player} and Miyako are exploring a deep, dark cave.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Munchy munchy! Pudding is so yummy!  
Munchy mu...  
 Hmmm?  
  
**Miyako：**  
M-Miyako is all out of pudding...  
{player}! Gimme more puddings quick!  
  
**Miyako：**  
You have no puddings?  
Then time to go home to Landosol!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Anyway, how long do we have to keep doing this cave-walking?  
You said there might be hints to how Miyako became all ghosty,  
but this whole place is just dark and empty.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I think we're lost...  
`Tag 1`  
**Miyako：**  
Whaaa?!  
Are you for serious?  
 That's not even funny!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Don't throw empty pudding pots!  
`Tag 2`  
**Miyako：**  
This trip was uselesser than useless!  
Time to go home and eat pudding!  
Your treat for starting this wild goose hunt!  
  
**Miyako：**  
...You don't remember which way is back?  
But then... How do we get to not cave places?!  
  
**Miyako：**  
We just have to search from here?  
That's no good! Miyako can't walk any more!  
Too tired from walking!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Maybe Miyako was floating and didn't walk one step,  
but I'm still tired anyway!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ahhh! Wh-what about pudding?!  
If we're stuck here in this dark empty cave, how can we buy pudding?!  
Without pudding to eat, I'd probably die!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Ghosts can die?  
`Tag 3`  
**Miyako：**  
Oh yeah. Miyako's already dead.  
  
**Miyako：**  
But... not eating pudding is worse than dying...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hmm?  
Why do you keep looking around scaredly?  
...Checking for nearby monsters?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ahh... Monster attacks now would be pretty not good...  
Miyako is already dead, so no problems...  
But you might become dead too.  
 ...Hm?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ahhh! If you die too, we'll be ghost buddies!  
That sounds like lots of fun maybe!  
If both of us are floaty ghosts, we can be together forever!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Eheh! Together forever...  
That's almost like getting married!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Welcome home, Darling {player}!  
You want dinner first? Or a bath first?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Let's have some food.  
**Choice: (5)**  A bath sounds good.  
`Tag 4`  
**Miyako：**  
Yay, dinnertime! Today's dinner is... pudding!  
Darling {player}, hurry and get pudding!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hmm? Getting pudding is darling {player}'s job...  
Them's the facts!  
Quick, get pudding!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Miyako：**  
Good choice!Miyako will go get in the bath right now!  
Meanwhile Darling {player} can get dinner ready!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hmhmhm~♪  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako had a perfect comfy bath!  
Whew... All refreshed...  
Anyway! Time now for some after-bath pudding!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hmm? Why's there no pudding ready on the table?  
Hurry and fetch pudding!  
  
`Tag 6`  

---  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hmmm?  
Wait a minute...  
  
**Miyako：**  
When we're both floaty ghosts, how do we buy pudding?!  
  
**Miyako：**  
No pudding is a problem!  
Death without pudding is worse than life!  
You need to stay not dead!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Owie...  
 That hurted...  
I bumped my foot on something...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ahh! I know this... It's the pot for my last pudding!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Now that I look... There's more pots that way!  
That makes sense... I was eating puddings all the way here...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Oh!  
If we follow the pudding pots, we'll find the exit!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Perfect plan! Miyako is the geniusest!  
C'mon, let's go home already!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Yaaay, we found a not cave place!  
All thanks to Miyako! Eheh!  
Now! Time to reward Miyako's skills with extra-special pudding!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hmm? Too tired so you're going home now?  
No way, no way!  
Miyako is hungrier than hungry! Pudding first, then home!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Munchy munchy...  
Eating pudding with {player} is the tastiest!  
Definitely best if you stay alive and not dead!  
  
**Narration：**  
And that was the end of that adventure.
