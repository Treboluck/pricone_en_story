**Narration：**  
As usual, Miyako is haunting {player}  
with great persistence.  
  
**Miyako：**  
{player}! Time for pudding!  
Buy pudding for Miyako!  
Miyako will die with no pudding!  
  
**Miyako：**  
You're all out of money?  
That's not Miyako's business!  
Just buy pudding now!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Wahhh! What's this weird light?!  
I...it's so bright! Owie, my eyes!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Too shinyyyyyyyy!!!  
  

---  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ah, it's {player}!  
Where're you going?  
  
**Miyako：**  
School? For studying?  
Uerghh... Just the sound of that makes Miyako's head hurt...  
Being alive sounds no fun...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Forget about all that!  
You're with Miyako now, so go buy pudding!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Can't buy pudding because of class?  
That's not any of Miyako's business!  
Just buy pudding nowwww!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako doesn't take no for any answers!  
  
**Passerby 1：**  
Oh, freaky...  
Is that weirdo talking to himself?  
  
**Passerby 2：**  
I think he's got a screw loose...  
Let's steer well clear of that one.  
  
**Miyako：**  
People are looking at you funny?  
Ohhh, well, normal people can't see ghosts like Miyako,  
so they just think you're a weird person who talks to air!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Don't worry about silly people like that!  
What about going to buy—  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hey! No running away!  
Stop there right now!  
  
**Narration：**  
During class...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Pudding now! Pudding now!  
Go buy pudding now!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Grrr... Why're you all quiet?  
Miyako might have to try drastic measures!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Time to drag you to the pudding shop myself!  
Heeeeave... and ho!  
  
**Schoolboy：**  
What the heck?  
Why'd {player} suddenly stand up?  
  
**Io：**  
Settle down, {player}!  
Don't make a fuss in class!  
  
**Narration：**  
During gym class...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Now you're playing soccer?  
No time for games! Time for pudding!  
Hurry and buy pudding for Miyako!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Nobody will notice if you sneak out now.  
So let's go to the shop together!  
  
**Schoolboy：**  
{player}! The ball's headed your way!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Wah? Wahhh?!  
What's that flying round thing?!  
It's gonna hit Miyako!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Save Miyako.  
**Choice: (2)**  Look the other way.  
`Tag 1`  
**Gym Teacher：**  
Gooooal!  
Team A wins!  
  
**Schoolboys：**  
All right!  
Nice going, {player}!  
You totally nailed that one for us!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Miyako：**  
Bweghh!  
O-owiiiieee...  
  
**Gym Teacher：**  
Own goal!  
Team B wins!  
  
**Schoolboys：**  
The heck do you think you're doing, {player}?!  
It's all your fault that we lost!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Miyako：**  
Awww...  
With all these people, I can't get near {player}...  
How will we buy pudding now...?  
  
**Narration：**  
On the school roof at lunchtime...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Finally, it's time for eating!  
Time for eating pudding! Miyako will eat it for you!  
  
**Miyako：**  
...No pudding?  
Bahhhh! All you seem to say today is no!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Grrr...!  
For that, you get this!  
  
**Schoolboy：**  
Whoaaa?!  
{player} jumped over the guard fence?!  
Don't do anything hasty! You have so much to live for!  
  
**Narration：**  
After school...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding,  
pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding,  
pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding...  
...Huh? You'll buy me pudding now?  
Yaaaay! I knew asking all day would work!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Also, um... it was pretty fun being like your classmate today!  
Heheh... Maybe school isn't all bad!  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hmmm... I thought taking a look into the \"other side\"  
might provide some clues to how Miyako became a ghost...  
But I suppose it wouldn't be that easy.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Still, Miyako never changes, does she?  
She's no different \"there\" from how she seems \"here.\"  
  
**Ameth：**  
And since she's a ghost there too, she couldn't go to school...  
I guess you managed to give her a valuable experience.  
Though for you, I expect it was little more than a nuisance!  
  
**Ameth：**  
What's wrong? You look awfully nonplussed.  
Oh, the scene you just saw was a kind of dream I created  
based on fragments of your memories together.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Collecting fragments of your memories like this  
is our best shot at closing in on your real identity.  
So I hope you'll keep up the good work.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, that's all from me!  
  

---  
  
**Miyako：**  
Uhhhhh... Ahhhhh...?  
Hmmm? Where is this place?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ohhh... Miyako must have been asleep...  
Were you asleep too?  
  
**Miyako：**  
That's so weird!  
Oh! Now I remember I had a fun dream!  
I went to school with you!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Huh?! You dreamed about the same thing?  
That really is the weirdest!  
  
**Miyako：**  
The dream was weird too...  
Ahhh! Come to think, I woke up before I could eat pudding!  
{player}, I want pudding!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding,  
pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding,  
pudding, pudding, pudding, pudding...  
  
**Miyako：**  
...Huh?  
You'll really go buy pudding?!  
Yaaaay! Pudding for Miyako!  
  
**Miyako：**  
You were so stubborn in the dream,  
but the real you is much more easy!  
  
**Narration：**  
Miyako completely failed to realize  
that {player}'s patience had already been worn down  
by a whole dreamful of nagging.
