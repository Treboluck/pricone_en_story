**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. That is...  
quite a big fish.  
I sense an extraordinary amount of hostility from it.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's definitely not some cute little fish.  
That's a Sea Drake.  
They don’t normally venture out from the bottom of the sea like this!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You guys better watch out! You'll be frozen like popsicles  
if you get hit by any of that icy breath it spits out.  
There won't be any time to save you if that happens!  
  
**Percorine：**  
*drool*...  
Stewed fish, grilled fish, fish sashimi, fish hot pot!  
What fishy dishes are you into?  
  
**Karyl：**  
What are you two daydreaming about?!  
I told you to watch out!
