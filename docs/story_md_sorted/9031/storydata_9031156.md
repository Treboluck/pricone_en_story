Finally, it lies defeated.  
Is everyone quite all right?  
Miss Karyl does not seem electrified this time, at least.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aw, but it was cute when she got all stuttery!  
Right, Karyl?  
...Um, Karyl?  
  
**Karyl：**  
This goes here, and this over here...  
Oh, can't forget to set up the parasol.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl... She has even changed into her swimsuit already.  
Usually, she would never fail to retort to Miss Pecorine's loving jabs...  
She must be very deeply focused on enjoying this vacation.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh. That's just one more thing to love about her! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Hey!  
Quit standing around and help me set this stuff up, why don't you?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Okay~! ♪  
By the way, Karyl, I was thinking about having a barbecue.  
Do you think there's space for that?  
  
**Karyl：**  
...I just set up a barbecue area right over there.  
Oh, and I found a spot that Kokkoro can use for meditating.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wha...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
W-well, I knew you'd insist on doing these things...  
And it's best if everyone can enjoy themselves...  
 Waagh?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I love you sooooo much, Karyl!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...One big hug for you.  
  
**Karyl：**  
N-not you too, Koro...  
Oh, geez, can you both get *off* me already?!
