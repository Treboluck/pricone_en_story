**Pecorine：**  
Now, you're not escaping this time!  
Not until your sweet little fins are safely stashed inside our bellies!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Stewed fish, gyoza, tasty fried rice! ♪  
And to finish, throw it all in a soup! ♪  
How crazy are the delicacies of the sea?! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
*pant* *pant*...C... can you please be quiet?  
After all that running, your bizarre song...  
is just tiring me out even more...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Y-you're so cruel, Karyl!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*pant* *pant*... A-at any rate,  
 you impress me today, Miss Karyl.  
To think you kept up with Miss Pecorine at full pelt...  
I must confess, I was worried I might lose sight of you both...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You must have been looking forward to our vacation  
even more than I had realized.  
The kindness in your heart is so touching. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
H-huhhh?!  
Hey, Koro, what nonsense are you spouting?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, Karyl...!  
I never knew you cared about all of us so much!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Y-you've got it all wrong!  
I just wanted to get away from everything...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Together with us, you mean! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah, all of us together...  
 Ahh!  
I-I-I-I didn't say that! Forget that last part!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. Well, now we truly cannot afford to lose.  
In order to grant Miss Karyl's wish,  
let us dispose of this monster at once.
