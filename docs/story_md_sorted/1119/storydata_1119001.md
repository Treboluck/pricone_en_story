## Subtitle: A Lucky New Year's Guide
  
**Narration：**  
Around the time the New Year's festivities are beginning to settle down,  
a certain little guide knocks on the Gourmet Guild's guildhouse door  
for the first time in a short while.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, I have returned.  
Your faithful Kokkoro is here.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Welcome home, Kokkoro.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Alas, it took me far too long to return here to your side.  
My home village is some distance from Landosol, you see...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh? My lord—your hair is ruffled from sleeping.  
Pat pat... There.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Now that I have returned,  
I hope to serve you once more in every way I can possibly muster.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We are already a few days into the new year,  
so I think it is time to concern ourselves with appearances once more.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Also, it has been some time since I cleaned your ears,  
so perhaps you should show them to me now.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Here—rest your head safely upon my lap.  
Well then... Rub... rub... ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. Does that tickle?  
This will not take long, so I hope you can bear it.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I know—let us converse to take your mind off it.  
I would love to hear how you spent New Year's  
in as much detail as you care to give.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Did you have an auspicious first dream of the year?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh my...!  
A dream in which you fled from many Miss Pecorines trying to eat you?  
That sounds rather traumatic.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Aside from that, you were fairly busy attending to various jobs?  
That is a shame,  
 but I do admire your earnest efforts.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm free today, so let's do New Year's stuff.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well then, allow me to serve as your guide to the new year.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
On my way here, I passed through the city center,  
and it still seemed alive with festivities.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Festivals in Landosol tend to last longer than average,  
which seems lucky for us.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Even if New Year's Day is behind us...  
Now that I have returned to your side, my lord,  
allow me to start the new year as I mean to continue it.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Considering the year is long since begun, this temple is very lively.  
Now, let us head to the altar and pray for fortune in the year ahead.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Why did you change into that outfit?  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
I presumed that if you are to enjoy New Year's,  
this clothing might be the most fitting to accompany you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Besides, this first act of guiding you  
is an occasion worthy of celebration for me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So for today, it feels right to dress in my most special vestments.  
  
**Temple Staff：**  
Free sweet amazake!  
Get it while it's hot!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord? You seem tempted by the sweet drinks on offer.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But of course. We should not let our bodies grow cold,  
so let us take some to drink as we walk to the altar.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*blow*...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wait a little longer, my lord.  
I must cool the amazake to ensure that you do not scald your mouth.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*blow*... *blow*...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah... Are you so eager to drink that you can wait no longer?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This may still be rather hot,  
but if you wish to partake regardless, I suppose you may.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Go ahead. Try to take it slowly,  
so as to ease yourself into the heat.  
Slowly, all right? Very slowly...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Hmm. It is still too hot for you?  
Then I suppose I will continue to blow upon it.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*blow*... *blow*...  
*blow*... *blow*...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I expect that will suffice.  
Here, my lord. Drink up and enjoy—  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh my. A very large group of visitors has suddenly arrived.  
My lord! Do take care not to lose sight of me in the crowd!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Phew. The crowd has largely passed.  
Now, my lord, take the sweet amazake and enjoy...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Oh? Where are you, my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I have blown on your drink thoroughly, so it is no longer hot.  
Please come and take it. ...My lord...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The altar is just ahead of us,  
yet I cannot see any sign of my lord...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Did the crowd of visitors sweep him away  
and separate him from me, perhaps?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord! My lord...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I have searched most of this vicinity, but with so many visitors,  
it may be difficult even to catch sight of him.  
  
**Man：**  
Aw yeah! I got Great Luck!  
  
**Woman：**  
Oh wow, that's so lucky!  
I heard the fortune slips here  
are spookily accurate when it comes to romance!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. Fortune slips, you say...?  
  
**Man：**  
Romance...? \"The one for you is right before your eyes,\" it says here!  
Right before me? Wait... you?  
 N-nah, it couldn't be...  
  
**Woman：**  
...I think that fortune might be right.  
  
**Man：**  
Huh?! Do you mean it?  
T-truth is, I've liked you for a long time too...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh my...!  
It seems the fortunes here are most effective.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Perhaps I should try purchasing one myself.  
It may aid me in the task of locating my missing lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ordinarily,  
I would prefer to receive divine guidance from Lady Ameth alone,  
but with my lord's safety at stake, I cannot be choosy.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Lady Ameth, forgive me this small unfaithfulness...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Now, let us see.  
What portents could be written upon this slip of paper?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm.  
\"The one you seek is close at hand.  
The key to your fortune is a hot drink\"...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Alas, my predicament  
is that the one I seek is *not* currently nearby...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Besides, how can a hot drink be the key to my fortunes  
when the cup of amazake I have here has long since grown cold?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Actually, I suppose I have not yet returned  
to the stall where we first received it.  
Could it be...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord!  
So this is where you have been all this time.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Thank goodness you found me!  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
I must apologize for making you wait so long.  
When did you return here, my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. As soon as you were swept away and lost sight of me,  
you thought it prudent to return to the stall we had recently visited?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, we must be more careful in the future.  
Now that I have found you, I cannot lose you again.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, please hand me the amazake you are holding.  
If you just received it, it must still be rather hot.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If I just... mix it with the cooled amazake like so,  
the two should blend to a mild temperature.  
...There. Try it now.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Mmm, it's good!  
`Tag 5`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. That is good to hear.  
Finally I am able to treat you to a pleasant beverage.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well then, shall we proceed to the altar together?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What's this?  
To avoid further separations, you would like to join hands with me?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, my lord's hand... It feels so warm and so very reassuring...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Let me say... My lord, I am so glad to see you again.  
  
**Narration：**  
This time, the two of them made it safely to the altar,  
where {player} made an offering and a wish  
using the coins Kokkoro had prepared.
