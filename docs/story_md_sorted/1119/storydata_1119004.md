## Subtitle: The Key to the Year
  
**Narration：**  
Having completed her duties as  
{player}'s guide to the delights of New Year's,  
Kokkoro returns with her lord to the city center.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Many of the stalls have begun to close up shop.  
It would appear this is the last day of this year's New Year festivities.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am so glad that I was able to spend today with you, my lord,  
and enjoy the festivities while they lasted.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hm? Is this Lady Ameth's first message of the year?  
My lord, perhaps we should take a seat on this bench.  
  

---  
  
**Kokoro：**  
A very happy new year to you, my lord.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I am honored that you came all this way simply to visit me.  
Surely you must have had more important plans...  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I see.  
Your only plans were to eat, sleep, and watch comedy on television.  
Well, that is certainly one way of enjoying the vacation.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Me, you ask?  
As you know, I do not have many friends to visit,  
so I have been sketching the animals here.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
It is one of my homework tasks,  
and since the zoo sees so few visitors in this season,  
it has been going most smoothly.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Admittedly it is a little cold outdoors,  
but I find the sounds of the animals' cries quite soothing.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's play something together.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokoro：**  
Hmm... It is true that I had just completed my initial sketch.  
Besides which, I could hardly refuse an invitation from my lord.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I can include this in my picture diary as well,  
so it is a welcome proposition.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
As I recall, my father has some New Year's toys stashed away.  
Let me see if I can find them.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Oh my... I do believe I have won yet again...  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Why is it, my lord, that you seem able to land  
on \"Return to Square One\" spaces so many times in each game?  
  
**Kokoro：**  
This was our tenth game already,  
and yet you still have not won even once...  
While Sugoroku is indeed a game of luck, this seems quite perplexing...  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Actually, during my New Year's homework,  
I learned of the expression \"New Year's Day is the key to the year.\"  
  
**Kokoro：**  
At this rate, your year may be doomed  
to play out as a string of failures, my lord...  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I cannot allow such a thing,  
so let us find an activity at which you can prevail.  
I will return to my home and search for other New Year's toys.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Apologies for the wait, my lord.

**Kokoro：**  
Are you... curious about my kimono?  
My father suggested that I wear it for the occasion.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
It is a child's kimono, so it was not especially difficult to put on.  
Although I did require some measure of support from my mimi.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Up until now, I have had very little opportunity to go out for New Year's,  
so this is the first time I have worn such an outfit.  
D-does it suit me, I wonder?  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Oh... I see.  
I am honored that you would compliment me.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I confess I thought such fine garb may look a little silly on me,  
but you sound so very certain, I suppose I will trust in your words.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
At any rate, let us play hanetsuki next.  
This game is entirely skill-based, so bad luck will not stand in your way.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Now, you may begin, my lord.  
Bat the shuttle with your paddle, and try to aim just in front of me.  
  
![111900402.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/111900402.webp)  
**Kokoro：**  
Ahhh!  
My lord, where are you aiming?!  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Oh my. This is your first time playing hanetsuki as well?  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I suspect it is best to relax and swing the paddle more gently.  
Rather than hitting it over my head,  
try to give the shuttle a subtle swat...  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Off it goes again?!  
However, this time I am prepared... Yahh!  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I reached it!  
I successfully received your shot, my lord!  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Now, my lord, try to hit it back to me in turn!  
  
**Kokoro：**  
A magnificent swipe at thin air...  
  
**Kokoro：**  
...Hee hee.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Ah... I am very sorry.  
I did not mean to laugh at your failure!  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I am just having such fun playing with you.  
Just as I explained before,  
I have never played like this on New Year's in the past.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I feel I am beginning to understand this season's joys better.  
Or perhaps it's simply because I am with you?  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Starting the year by sharing this learning experience with you  
makes me so glad.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
My lord, let us have a wonderful new year.  
I hope to be able to serve you faithfully in the...  
 Hm?  
  
**Kokoro：**  
\"What about the penalty,\" you say?  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Well, in hanetsuki,  
it *is* traditional for the victor to paint marks upon the loser's face...  
  
**Kokoro：**  
What?! You wish to carry out this tradition as well?  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I suppose I do have some paint for use in my homework,  
but I would not dream of dirtying your face with it, my lord!  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Ahhh, my lord!  
Why are you rummaging through my supplies?!  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Please do not hand me the brush with such a broad smile!

**Ameth：**  
My little Kokkoro in a kimono!  
Ahhhh, her cuteness knows no bounds!  
  
**Ameth：**  
I wasn't expecting a New Year's gift like this  
from you of all people!  
  
**Ameth：**  
You're probably the only person who can put  
a smile like that on her face.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Inviting her to play when she was doing her schoolwork  
wasn't exactly the most responsible move...  
But I think I'll let it slide this time!  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm sure you'll have all sorts of surprises in store this year,  
but don't forget to look after Kokkoro for me!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, thanks again for the gift!  
  

---  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, I see you have awoken, my lord.  
Was the dream you were granted this time a pleasant one?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It was a lucky dream, because you were in it.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
S-such words are far more than I could possibly deserve...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Still, if those are your honest feelings, they make me happy.  
Enriching your life, in any way I can, is my sworn duty.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As such, I feel proud as your guide  
to have begun this new year in a promising fashion.  
This has been a fulfilling day for us both.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I will continue to offer my support  
to make the year ahead of us a wonderful one, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Now, the air grows colder with the sunset, so take my hand  
and let us share a little of our warmth as we walk homeward.  
  
**Narration：**  
And the touch of one another's hands was more than enough  
to make the chills of winter fade away  
and fill their hearts with the warmth of seasons to come.
