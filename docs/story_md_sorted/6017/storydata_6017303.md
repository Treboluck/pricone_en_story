**Ram：**  
This is such a busy city.

**Ram：**  
What was it like? That's not very easy to explain.  
If you've lost your memories, maybe you should try learning

**Ram：**  
The capital... Well, it was packed with people.  
Much like this city, I'd like to say, but I wonder.  
Does that go for their shadowy underbellies too?

Full of flowers to water and clothes to wash.  
Though it's Rem who does almost all of that.
