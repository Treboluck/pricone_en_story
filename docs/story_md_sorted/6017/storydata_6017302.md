**Ram：**  
Do you have any siblings?  
Oh, of course. You have no memories.  
Would you *like* to have them, then?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Not particularly.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'd love to have a little sister like Rem.  
**Choice: (3)**  I'd love to have a big sister like you.

Rem's *my* little sister. You can't have her.

`Tag 3`  
**Ram：**  
Well, of course. But you're nowhere near worthy of that.

I might consider you as a candidate.
