**Rem：**  
While walking in the shopping district,  
I overheard something about a \"Living Storm.\"  
Do Landosol's storms have life of their own? How very curious.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  They sure do.  
**Choice: (2)**  I think they meant Anna.  
**Choice: (3)**  I am Sigurd of the Fulgor!  
`Tag 1`  
**Rem：**  
Our world also has its share of great storms,  
but none of them possess the gift of life...  
Some things in this world are beyond my ability to understand.

Oh, this Miss Anna is a friend of yours?  
Properly, Miss...  
Annero... Annerose vo...  
 von... Ste... Stechpalm, you say?  
Your friend's name is even longer than Master Roswaal's...

Whatever brought on that sudden outburst?! It's just something  
you automatically say on reflex?  
 What an awkward condition. It happens  
whenever you hear that name?  
 The name... \"Living Storm\"? Tee hee.
