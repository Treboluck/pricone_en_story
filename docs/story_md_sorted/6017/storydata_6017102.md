Oh, about Puck?  
 Yes, I guess you would be curious.  
There don't seem to be any beings like him in this world...

**Choice: (1)**  It's amazing how he's a great spirit!  
**Choice: (3)**  It's amazing how a cat can fly and talk!

Yes, he may be cute and love to joke, but he is a powerful spirit.  
Still, I hope you'll be friends with him anyway.

**Emilia：**  
He's not actually a cat at all,  
but spirits seem to be rare in Landosol,  
so I can see why you'd think that.
