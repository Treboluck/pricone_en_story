**Pecorine：**  
Heheh! Another win for us!  
I can't allow myself to become a monster meal  
until I've tasted every flavor in the world!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Still, that monster... I have never seen the likes of it in Astraea.  
I thought we were fairly well-traveled, but...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I heard this area's supposed to be rich in precious minerals,  
but with beasts like that around, how can anyone explore it?  
We'd better send a report to the Guild Association.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Those small wings, scaly and insufficient for flight...  
Abnormally developed muscles, and a steely-sharp beak and talons...  
Its body seemed somewhat unnatural compared to other birds.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Urgh... Its meat looked really tough too...  
I bet I'll ruin my knife just trying to slice it...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Really... Is that all you think about?  
On this remote island, we may all too easily become the prey ourselves.  
We should be wary of more ambushes like this one.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Urgh... Now Kokkoro's scolding me like a mom...
