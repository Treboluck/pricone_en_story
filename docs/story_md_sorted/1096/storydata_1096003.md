# Ninon (Oedo) Episode 3
Ninon receives a mysterious message, delivered by arrow and written in code. Assuming it's a challenge to a duel, she does battle with the shadowy sender, but {player} finds out that it's a misunderstanding and stops her. Awed by her shogun's show of mercy towards his enemies, Ninon's devotion grows still more passionate.

**Narration：**  
{player} walks with Ninon through Oedo Town  
sampling the local tastes of the region.  
Today, Ninon is introducing him to her favorite delicacies.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Mmmm! These miso skewers are super delicious!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Once, there lived a legendary shogun  
said to have unified the warring lands for hundreds of years.  
  
**Ninon：**  
According to \"Bushido,\" the book I read before,  
this shogun lived to a then unfathomably old age  
thanks to his daily diet  
 of miso and more miso!  
  
**Ninon：**  
So, Shogun, if you eat lots of miso,  
 you will surely rule for centuries!  
I too will eat my fill, so I can stay with you through it all!  
Today, we feast on tasty sticks!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hmm?!  
 Shogun! Look out!  
  
**Ninon：**  
It didn't hit you, did it, Shogun?  
  
**Ninon：**  
...Hm?  
Oh! This arrow has a letter attached!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hm, hm...  
I see how it is...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What does the letter say?  
`Tag 1`  
**Ninon：**  
I have not the slightest idea!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Because this letter is written in a clever code!  
To use such an impenetrable cipher,  
the sender must be quite the master of secrecy...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Oh! A map and time are written here too!  
Pictures and numbers like this are much easier to decode!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Which can only mean...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!  
This is a challenge to a duel!  
The sender must be an enemy warlord opposing your rightful conquest!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Really?  
`Tag 2`  
**Ninon：**  
A letter with a time and place, sent by arrow? What else could it be?  
This is a most traditional method from the eastern lands!  
  
**Ninon：**  
All great conquerors are fated to face such challenges!  
Let us go forth and dispatch our foe!  
  
**Narration：**  
As the appointed time draws near,  
{player} and Ninon await the letter's sender  
at the specified location.  
  
**Ninon：**  
This is the spot for sure.  
A battle of life or death awaits. We must stay fully alert!  
  
**Assassin 1：**  
Hey there. Glad you could make it!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Are you two the senders of that letter?  
  
**Assassin 1：**  
Yeah, that's us.  
  
**Assassin 2：**  
We're glad you showed up right on time.  
Today, we called you here to—  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ohhhh no!  
No need to explain  
 what is plain to see!  
  
**Ninon：**  
A ninja hides her heart beneath her blade.  
We say no more than must be said!  
  
**Assassin 1：**  
Oh? You wanna kick things off right here?  
Well, that makes things quick!  
  
**Assassin 2：**  
Then... let's see what you're made of!  
Try not to get hurt too badly!  
  
**Ninon：**  
It's you who should take care!  
  
**Assassin 1：**  
Well then. Let's get right down to it!  
  
**Assassin 1：**  
Hahh! Yahh!  
Your shogun's life is forfeit!  
  
**Ninon：**  
H-he flew through the air?!  
  
**Assassin 2：**  
C'mon, girl! No time to get distracted!  
Hayayah!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Did he just throw exploding shuriken?! What amazing ninjutsu!  
  
**Ninon：**  
These may be more powerful foes than I thought!  
I will have to give this battle my all!  
  
**House of Ninjas Manager：**  
Hahaha! Just as flashy as I hoped.  
I bet this fight will draw in a whole crowd of customers!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Like you... hoped?  
**Choice: (4)**  Customers?  
`Tag 3`  
`Tag 4`  
**House of Ninjas Manager：**  
Hmm? It's like I wrote in the letter.  
I lost my temper the other day, but when I thought things over,  
I realized I was wrong.  
  
**House of Ninjas Manager：**  
The way she played the crowd, and that water run!  
That girl's a bone fide ninja through and through!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Now there is nowhere to run!  
Ninpo: Shadow Clone no Jutsu!  
Shwip-shwip-shwip!  
  
**Assassin 1：**  
Gahhh! I can't tell which one's the real deal!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Eheheh! Are you feeling scared now?  
  
**House of Ninjas Manager：**  
Not sure about those... \"shadow clones\"...  
 but she's doing pretty great!  
The crowd will love it to bits!  
  
**House of Ninjas Manager：**  
Anyway, point is, I invited her to be the star performer  
in a new action show to advertise our House of Ninjas!  
  
**House of Ninjas Manager：**  
I even wrote the invitation in code!  
It's more fun if you get into the spirit of things, right?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  We couldn't decipher it...  
`Tag 5`  
**House of Ninjas Manager：**  
Oh, c'mon, don't joke around with me!  
  
**House of Ninjas Manager：**  
...Huh? That face... You really didn't manage to solve it?  
That code was just a game my kids came up with...  
But she thought it was a real challenge to a duel?  
  
**House of Ninjas Manager：**  
Well, that's not good!  
Those guys she's fighting right now are only stuntmen,  
putting on a flashy battle show using our special effects!  
  
**House of Ninjas Manager：**  
We'd better stop her quick, or someone'll get—  
  
**Assassin 1：**  
Guaahhh!  
  
**Assassin 2：**  
Ugyaaahhhh!  
  
**House of Ninjas Manager：**  
Arghh! Were we too late?!  
  

---  
  
**Ninon：**  
Heheheh! How'd you like my Ninpo: Spheres of Paralysis?!  
  
**Assassin 1：**  
My eyes! My eeeeyes!  
It burns! It stings! It huuuurts!  
  
**Assassin 2：**  
Aaaatchoo!  
I... I can't stop... sneez—aaatchoo!  
  
**Ninon：**  
My spheres are filled with a blend of pepper and chili!  
I'm glad their effects match the effort I put into them!  
...A-  
aaatchoo! Urgh...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Now then.  
I will admit your skills were impressive.  
  
**Ninon：**  
However! You chose the wrong opponent.  
That man right there is the shogun who will soon rule the lands!  
As his retainer, I cannot be so easily defeated!  
  
**Assassin 2：**  
W-wait, please! Let us explain!  
This isn't a real duel, it's a...  
 buaaaatchoo!  
  
**Ninon：**  
No need for empty excuses!  
Are you ready to pay?  
Then let justice be served to my shogun's foes!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Ninon, wait!  
`Tag 6`  

---  
  
**Ninon：**  
Whoa!  
Shogun, is something the matter?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Huh? An \"Ac... tion Show... Rehear... sal\"... you say?  
What is that? Some new kind of ninja technique?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hmmm... I don't quite understand.  
But for now, you want me to let them go, is that right?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Showing mercy to villains who tried to take your life...  
You have the character of such a wise and noble ruler!  
  
**Ninon：**  
I swear I will serve you as long as I live!  
...A-aaaatchoo...!  
  
**Narration：**  
Awestruck at {player}'s boundless mercy,  
Ninon's love for her shogun grew even stronger...  
and her sneezing didn't stop until well past midnight.
