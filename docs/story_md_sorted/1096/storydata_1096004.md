## Subtitle: Your Right-Hand Ninja
  
**Narration：**  
On a bright and sunny day, Ninon and {player}  
sit at a teahouse and gaze out at the busy tourist town of Oedo.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Leisurely, leisurely, yes...  
This is the most pure form of peace...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Oh yes! After I advertised the House of Ninjas,  
I heard it became the most popular tourist spot in all of Oedo!  
  
**Ninon：**  
If many visitors come to the House of Ninjas,  
we will undoubtedly find more retainers to add to your retinue!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Right now your retinue may be just me,  
but it will surely grow into a cornucopia of followers!  
And when it does, conquering the lands will be easy!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's all thanks to you.  
`Tag 1`  
**Ninon：**  
Such kind words! I am honored!  
But this is all thanks to your shining glory!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Oh, yes! Shining just like that!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Heheheh.  
 I already know  just how amazing you are,  
so there is no need to demonstrate with such bright light.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Wait...  
 Waaaaaahhhhh!

`Tag 2`  
**Ninon：**  
This is training!  
 To become a true ninja, I must first look the part!

Hm? What's all this? There's quite the commotion!  
Is something about to start?

Hey, hey, hey! Pretty lady! Why don't you come along with us?

However! Justice will always be the winner!  
Shuriken attack! Shwip-shwip-shwip!  
  
**Staff：**  
Whoaaa! That was close!

In that case...  
  
Jump to tag 7

My shogun would never say such things!

Demons of this mortal world, I must slice you down!

**Ameth：**  
Aaaand welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That was a fealty offering—I mean, a present from me.  
Did you have a nice dream?  
  
**Ameth：**  
It was fun to see how the new you handled it.  
Since she looks up to you as her \"shogun,\"  
you'd better try to live up to her big expectations.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, I'll see you later! ♪

**Ninon：**  
Mnhh...  
Ahh! Was all that a dream?  
I feel like I was terribly rude to my shogun...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Exile me if you must,  
but spare me the shame of execution...  
Not the barbecue... Shudder... shudder...  
  
**Boy：**  
When I grow up, I'm gonna be a ninja and fight evil!  
  
**Girl：**  
Me too! I'm gonna be a cool kunoichi!  
  
**Mother：**  
Haha.  
 Then the two of you had better eat your greens,  
get plenty of exercise, and study hard at school!  
  
**Boy & Girl：**  
Yes, Mom!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hahaha!  
This town is filled with so many promising future retainers.  
The lands you rule will surely prosper!  
  
**Ninon：**  
...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Shogun... Shogun...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Even if you recruit many retainers,  
I will always be  
 your right-hand ninja, won't I?  
  
**Ninon：**  
I hope you'll always keep me by your side!  
  
**Narration：**  
That day, Ninon found herself hoping for more from her future  
than just her shogun's conquest of the lands.
