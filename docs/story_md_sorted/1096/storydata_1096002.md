Ninon is hired to advertise a House of Ninjas attraction. She performs her usual ninja techniques to attract customers, but the manager thinks she isn't taking it seriously, and corners her in anger.

## Subtitle: The Great Ninja Escape
  
**Narration：**  
One day, {player} is taking a stroll in Oedo Town  
when he hears a familiar voice gathering an audience.  
  
**???：**  
Come one, come all!  
Witness miracles you'll tell stories of for generations!  
No payment required!  
  
**Narration：**  
As he weaves his way through the crowd,  
{player} spots Ninon making a scene at its center.  
  
**Ninon：**  
C'mon, folks, we're about to start!  
...  
Oh?! Hey! Shogun!  
You showed up at the perfect time!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What're you doing?  
`Tag 1`  
**Ninon：**  
I was hired by the Guild Association  
to put on a performance with my ninja techniques!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Apparently the fine establishment known  
as the Oedo House of Ninjas is struggling to make ends meet.  
  
**Ninon：**  
That's why the house's ninja chief  
put in a publicity request with the Guild Association.  
And that's the long and short of how I ended up  
 putting on a ninja show!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Not only can I collect funds for our conquest,  
I can also seek promising new retainers to serve my shogun!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Some of those details sound iffy, but OK.  
`Tag 2`  
**Ninon：**  
For my shogun's sake, I must work hard!  
  
**Ninon：**  
And with that...  
Ladies and gentleninjas in the crowd!  
We're about to start the show!  
  
**Ninon：**  
First up, one of the ninja basics.  
...Rummage... rummage...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Huh? Where did it go?  
It's missing from my pocket. It didn't run away, did it?  
Rummage...  
 Aha! There you are!  
  
**Ninon：**  
...Ahem!  
You, young boy! Come to the stage.  
  
**Boy：**  
O-okay.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Here. A pretty frog I caught down by the pond.  
It's fresh from nature, so take good care of it!  
  
**Boy：**  
Yaaay!  
 Thanks, ninja lady!  
  
**Ninon：**  
No need for thanks.  
And that was my Ninpo: Summoning no Jutsu!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You... just caught it at the pond, right?  
**Choice: (4)**  Can I have one too?  
`Tag 3`  
**Ninon：**  
No, no! This too is the way of the ninja!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Ninon：**  
Ahh!  
 How shameful! I neglected my shogun!  
Fear not! I will catch another for you within the day!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Ninon：**  
Now! Next up, I will teach you how to walk like a ninja!  
  
**Ninon：**  
A true shinobi must fully conceal their presence  
and walk without making a sound.  
I'll show just how it's done, so everyone try to imitate me!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Are you all ready?  
Then let's begin!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ninpo: Sneaky-sneaky, snoopy-hidey,  
 not a creak or crack!  
Everyone, try it with me!  
  
**Tourist Man：**  
L-like this...?  
  
**Tourist Girl：**  
Ahaha!  
Daddy, you're walking just like when you come home at midnight!  
  
**Tourist Woman：**  
Darling, please stop embarrassing yourself!  
  
**Tourist Girl：**  
You're like a real ninja, Daddy!  
 That's so cool!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Very good!  
 I knew I could count on the people of Oedo!  
Shogun, we will surely find promising retainers in this crowd!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Now! My next technique is the water walk!  
I strap these special webbed sandals to my feet...  
  
**???：**  
Whoa, whoa. Hold it right there.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hmm?!  
  
**House of Ninjas Manager：**  
Young lady, are you the bona fide ninja the Guild Association sent?  
  
**Ninon：**  
I am, yes! You must be the House of Ninjas' chief!  
As you see, my ninja performance has the public marveling in awe!  
A smashing success indeed!  
  
**House of Ninjas Manager：**  
Uhhh, no. All you've done so far is mess around.  
We're paying a pretty hefty sum for your services here...  
So I need you to take this a bit more seriously.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ohh?! What was the problem?  
I am always serious about...  
 Wha—?!  
  
**House of Ninjas Manager：**  
Hm? Something wrong? Why the sudden shock?  
Listen, miss, if you can't do as you're told—  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ahhh! Mr. Chief-san!  
Do you see that ghostly flame in the air?!  
  
**House of Ninjas Manager：**  
Ehhh?! A ghostly flame?!  
Where is it...?  
...  
I can't see one anywhere. Hmmm?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Heheheh. Ladies and gentleninjas,  
you just witnessed the Look Over There no Jutsu in all its glory!  
This advanced ninpo can save you from the direst of dangers!  
  
**Ninon：**  
But beware—if you use it unwisely,  
you may fall victim to a nasty counterattack.  
So please, use it only when the need truly arises!  
  
**House of Ninjas Manager：**  
Why, you... little...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Mr. Chief here knew exactly what I was doing.  
You kindly played the victim to help my demonstration, right?  
  
**House of Ninjas Manager：**  
What did I say about taking this seriously?!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ahh! A face like a wrathful deity?!  
Did I do something to earn the chief's anger?!  
B-but... I can't imagine what! Oh, how awful!  
  
**Ninon：**  
At this point, I must now resort to a classic ninja trick!  
This one is called... Run For Your Life!  
Yahhh!  
  
**House of Ninjas Manager：**  
Buegh!  
 *cough* Is this... monja-yaki flour?!  
Enough of your party tricks...  
Hey! Get back here!  
  
**Narration：**  
Though Ninon flees with all her might,  
the enraged proprietor of the House of Ninjas  
finally corners her in front of a pond.  
  
**Ninon：**  
*pant*... *pant*... You are tenacious...  
But I cannot let fire or steel take me!  
  
**House of Ninjas Manager：**  
*pant*... *pant*... Nowhere to run now, girl!  
  
**Ninon：**  
No, I won't give in!  
I still have my trusty water sandals!  
  
**House of Ninjas Manager：**  
Yeah, sure you have. Like they'll do a damn thing!  
It's time to give it up already!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ah! Shogun! I knew you'd come!  
Focus your great glory on my nimble feet, please!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Got it!  
`Tag 6`

**Ninon：**  
Behold my most secret power! Ninpo: Water Walk no Jutsu!  
  
**House of Ninjas Manager：**  
Sh-she ran across the pond?!  
This girl's techniques are as crazy as her speech!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ladies and gentleninjas! Did you enjoy today's show?  
I hope you'll visit us again! Until that day, sayonara!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Farewell to you too, wrathful deity!  
Ka-vanish!  
  
**Narration：**  
As Ninon vanished into the distance,  
the onlookers gave their biggest applause of the whole day.  
  
**Narration：**  
But none of them realized that the pond Ninon had run across  
was actually shallow enough to cross on foot.  
  
**Ninon：**  
My feet are soggy as soy sauce...
