## Subtitle: A Special Strategy
  
**Jun：**  
...Hmm?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Mmm?  
 Ahh! Over at the prison entrance...  
Behind Miss Jun's back stands my lord!  
So he recovered after all! Ahh, thank goodness! ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh? My lord seems to have some plan in mind...?  
But what could it be?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Use your ability to power up your allies.  
**Choice: (2)**  Tear the helmet from Jun's head.  
`Tag 1`  
**Jun：**  
Hmm? This shining glow...  
Young {player}, you activated your ability?  
  
**Jun：**  
However, your friends are thoroughly defeated.  
No amount of strength will save them.  
I can handle them alone. No problem whatsoever!  
  
**Jun：**  
Still... it would be inconvenient  
if your ability were to revive them each time I render them immobile.  
  
**Jun：**  
This time I will make absolutely certain  
that you are knocked out for the count, young {player}!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh! My lord, look out! Run for your life!  
If you dare harm my lord, you must get through me first!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Arghh...  
At this point, all I can do is cling to Miss Jun's leg and slow her down...  
I only pray it will buy my lord enough time to escape!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Given his personality,  
it is difficult to imagine he would abandon me to my fate here...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But now, with my lord's power,  
I may have enough strength to throw off Miss Jun's balance!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Then perhaps my lord can take that chance to defeat her...  
 Huh?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My body... It is not surrounded by the warm glow of my lord's power...  
Which means... he has not lent me his strength on this occasion.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My legs are as powerless as ever, as well,  
so I cannot get to Miss Jun before she reaches my lord!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
B-but why?  
Did my lord's ability fail him for the first time?  
  
**Jun：**  
Young man!  
I have no quarrel with you, but in the name of justice, you must fall!  
  
**Jun：**  
...Wh-wha...?  
Uweaaaghhh?!

**Kokkoro：**  
Huh?  
Miss Jun raced up the stairs at incredible speed...  
and crashed squarely into the wall of the corridor above?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Like a comedy skit...  
B-but why?  
I was so sure Miss Jun was an indomitable warrior with years of training.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
How could she fail so spectacularly?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha! I get it!  
That was actually pretty sneaky!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
{player} powered up that armored lady!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
With all that power in her legs,  
she kicked off more strongly than she meant to,  
and couldn't stop herself from barreling into the wall!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh... That does make sense.  
Miss Jun is a friend of my lord's, after all.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
He *would* consider her an ally.  
So he was able to extend his ability to her as well.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A clever ruse, turning his ability's nature on its head...  
You have grown so much, my lord. I am lost for words!

`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wha...? My lord, what are you doing?  
You really should not touch a woman's face so suddenly!  
  
**Jun：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh...?  
Miss Jun suddenly stopped in her tracks.  
Why is that?  
  
**Jun：**  
Uweh... Ehhhh...?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Somehow... Miss Jun seems defenseless all of a sudden.  
Like an entirely different person  
from the indomitable foe we were facing seconds ago...  
  
**Jun：**  
How could you do this, young man?!  
How cruel! Please, give my helmet back!  
  
**Jun：**  
W-with my real face exposed, I... I can't...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh...?  
My lord charged at Miss Jun while loudly apologizing!  
  
**Jun：**  
Y-  
yeaaarghhhh?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh... Miss Jun lost her balance and tumbled down the stairs...  
I-is she all right...?  
  
**Jun：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ohhh... She is utterly incapacitated.  
I see... Due to the bonds of friendship they share,  
my lord must be familiar with her weaknesses.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So he took advantage of one in a moment of brilliance.  
Most impressive work, my lord.  
Haha... Though it does feel a little underhanded...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord!  
Your plan was a stunning success!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
However, we do not have time to revel in victory...  
Please allow me  
 to search Miss Jun for a key to Miss Pecorine's cell.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
With that, we can rescue her and make our escape at once.  
Just as Miss Jun was saying,  
I can hear many footsteps above.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am sure Miss Jun's strength is not the norm,  
but even ordinary guards could prove a fatal obstacle  
if they are able to corner us.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I think we should be fine.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Huh? What makes you say that?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm, I see.  
I did think that your recovery was remarkably rapid...  
So someone actually came to your aid as you lay unconscious above?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
An individual of not insignificant standing  
within the ranks of Nightmare, who even gave the order  
for the other knights to leave this place?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Now that you mention it,  
the gathering footsteps seem to be growing more distant...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
How very strange.  
Who was this person, and why did they come to our aid?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You said that they were a member of Nightmare?  
A knight whom we have befriended...  
 Miss Tomo or Miss Matsuri, then?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
However, even if they were here,  
I should have thought they would be brainwashed like Miss Jun...  
They would surely not come to our aid at this juncture,  
 or so I expected...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Besides which,  
 I seem to recall  
their standing in Nightmare was not all that high...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As knights of common birth,  
they are not even able to enter the palace,  
 are they?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. I hear Miss Neneka can take on a great many forms,  
so perhaps she transformed herself into a Nightmare official?  
Could that be the answer?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I understand she is captive also,  
but her clone can move with relative freedom...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...I am unsure what to think,  
 but perhaps it matters not.  
Miss Jun did possess the key we seek.  
With this, we should be able to open any cell in the dungeons.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You will be free once more, Miss Pecorine! ♪
