**Kokkoro：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Such strength!  
Her words remain calm and collected,  
yet her every movement cuts like a knife!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Any falter would certainly cost me my life...  
And yet if I fall in this battle, all will truly be lost.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
For our future! For our friends!  
For the sake of sharing a meal once more with the ones I love!  
I cannot allow myself to be defeated!  
  
**Jun：**  
Impressive tenacity. You must truly wish to save your friend.  
I hate to torment such a good girl any more than I must,  
so please give in and let slumber take you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Never!  
It is far too early for me to sleep.  
Would a good girl not keep to her bedtime?  
  
**Jun：**  
Sadly, it falls to me to put you to bed whether you like it or not.  
  
**Jun：**  
I hate to say this, but if you resist too long, other guards  
may hear the commotion and come running. Ordinary knights  
with no connection to you, who would take your lives without hesitation.  
  
**Jun：**  
To infiltrate the palace is a capital offense, so that is the usual way.  
So you see, you are out of time. I can't hold back any longer.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wha...?  
Even now, through all this, you have been holding back?  
  
**Jun：**  
I'm sorry.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Aaahhhh...!  
  
**Jun：**  
...Oh, how careless.  
I knocked her in the wrong direction.  
She tumbled down into the dungeons below us.  
  
**Jun：**  
I must pursue at once and restrain her properly.  
With that, my duty will be done.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...U-urgh...  
Falling down those stairs, I think I lost consciousness for a moment...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
How terrible! I hear footsteps approaching.  
That knight named Jun is coming after me!  
I must get to my feet and ready myself to face her!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hope is still not entirely lost!  
We did not forge our bonds only to fall at a hurdle like this!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Isn't that right, my Gourmet Guild friends?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ko... kko... ro...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Miss Pecorine!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Of course—I fell down a flight of stairs...  
For better or worse, I must now be in the dungeons!  
In fact, I am right beside Miss Pecorine's cell!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh, Miss Pecorine! How I have missed you!  
It pains me so to see you in this state...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Your beautiful hair, your clothes, all of them in tatters...  
How dare they do this to you? I must protest this treatment!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Thank you.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Neneka filled me in, so I knew about the plan,  
but still, I can hardly believe you came.  
It's too crazy... You're the one who's in tatters!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Come on, now! Please take better care of yourself.  
When you're in pain, you can't enjoy the taste of good food.  
That's a real tragedy. Much worse than my situation.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You didn't need to do this! You could have just left me here.  
I'm the one who rushed in like an idiot and got myself captured.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You should have shaken your head and forgotten all about me.  
No... I'd be happy if you remembered me just once in a while.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Ah yes, we had some nice meals together...  
What was her name? Something cute and memorable...  
The perpetually peckish 'Pecorine,' was it...?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You're the one who gave me that name, you know.  
I really love it a lot... ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine...  
P-please do not strain your voice.  
I will have you out of there soon,  
 even if I have to destroy these bars.  
  
**Jun：**  
Regrettably, that will not be possible.  
  
**Jun：**  
I'm sorry. I must take this opportunity to capture you,  
and throw you into a cell alongside young {player}.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh?! Where is my lord?  
I do not see him nearby... Can it be...?  
  
**Jun：**  
Oh... I suppose I left him in the corridor.  
How careless...  
I have noticed my thoughts seem duller than usual of late.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord... So you still live...  
 for now, at least.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That is most reassuring news,  
 but the situation remains dire.  
My lord lies unconscious, while I am badly injured,  
and Miss Pecorine still locked in her cell.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Labyrinth and their other associates  
must still be very busy with their own mission  
to destroy the brainwashing apparatus...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So we cannot hope for a heroic rescuer  
to conveniently appear in our hour of need.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Brainwashing?  
 Ah, of course! That device is still at large!  
Those stationed at the palace are most likely under its influence.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That must be why Miss Jun  
was able to attack my lord without hesitation.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Or not... It may simply be her firm devotion to her duty  
that drives her to act this way.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Either way, even while brainwashed,  
Miss Jun remains kind enough to show concern for us.  
If possible, I would have liked to meet her in better circumstances...  
  
**Jun：**  
Now then.  
Have I made myself quite clear?  
It's time we put an end to this unfortunate business.  
  
**Jun：**  
Above us... I hear the sound of countless footsteps.  
My subordinates must have rushed to the scene of the commotion.  
We can waste no more time. Let's make this nice and quick.

**Kokkoro：**  
I think not!  
As long as there is breath in my body, I will not give in!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Even in the most hopeless of situations,  
a single miracle can always turn things around!  
And my lord is a man who can work miracles!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I serve my lord because I trust in him with all my being!  
At first I was following Lady Ameth's guidance,  
but now... my own heart wills it!  
  
**Jun：**  
Such a very stubborn girl.  
You leave me no choice. If words will not sway you, I must use force.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Kokkoro!  
Please just run! At least save yourself!  
It doesn't matter what happens to me anymore!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But of course it matters!  
Must you always say the most ridiculous things?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I'll not hear another word from you, Miss Pecorine!  
Even I have limits to what I can accept!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh! Our kind little Kokkoro... got mad at me?!  
  
**Jun：**  
How very sweet...  
Have you two forgotten your situation?
