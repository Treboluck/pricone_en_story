# Interlude 12
In the interlude world in between stories, Nebbia holds Ameth back from heading to the palace herself. With {player} still caught in one struggle after the next, Ameth has no way of contacting him through dreams, so instead she asks Nebbia to deliver a message to Karin.
  
## Subtitle: Interlude 12
  
**Ameth：**  
Nebbia, handle things here for me.  
I'm going to descend the Tower of Sol and head to the palace!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Wha...?!  
Hey, hold on a second, Fio!  
What's gotten into you? Have you lost your mind?  
  
**Nebbia：**  
And heck, can you even survive outside?  
Both of us are still only barely hanging on  
to our own fragile existences  
 after the reconstruction!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
The world outside the tower  
 might see you as a bug and delete you!  
Well, I guess we don't have any way to tell  
if those services are still running...  
  
**Nebbia：**  
And it's true that the Shadows,  
despite being clear bugs, are hanging on pretty well.  
But isn't that because someone's actively maintaining them?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Who cares about any of that?!  
I have to go now,  
 before it's too late!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
I said calm down!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Gwahh?!  
You meanie!  
 Did you just hit me?!  
Even my mother never hit me!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Uh, who even is our mother? Lady Minerva?  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Actually, I haven't seen her around lately, either...  
One of her avatars seems to be playing with the Arena system, but...  
Oh, sheesh! I don't even know where to start!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
All these mysteries! I need explanations!  
I was programmed with plenty of curiosity,  
so the stress of not knowing anything is killing me here!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Anyway!  
You'll die if you leave the tower! For real this time!  
So I'll stop you however I have to, my dear sister!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh, how sweet... You think of me as a big sister?  
I love you too, Nebbia. ♪  
  
**Ameth：**  
But step aside now.  
 If you get in my way, I'll use force.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Ehhh?  
 You think you can beat me, you relic?  
If you want to die so badly,  
 I've half a mind to do the job myself!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh, really?  
 Feel free to go ahead and try!  
You're nothing but a bug-riddled baby!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
...  
  
**Ameth：**  
...  
  
**Nebbia：**  
...All right, enough squabbling. There's no point.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I guess not... Fighting each other won't change a thing.  
We're both just fragments of the Guide Fairy system,  
barely able to affect this world's people...  
  
**Nebbia：**  
But you've been working hard, huh?  
Hard enough to end up in that state...  
I've got to say, I can't tell what you're really trying to achieve.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Most of us Guide Fairies  
were removed as unnecessary to this world.  
I think you and I must really be the only ones left.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
I don't want to lose you as well.  
So I really do have to stop you... my sister.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Yes, yes... All right already.  
Arguing with you has calmed me down a little...  
It's true, I shouldn't try anything too rash.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But...  
This really is an emergency situation.  
I have to find a way to at least warn {player}...  
  
**Ameth：**  
But he doesn't have time for that right now.  
With everything he's facing, I don't want to drag him off into a dream.  
  
**Ameth：**  
During my dreams, his body sleeps.  
Even if it's only a few seconds,  
in the middle of this climax,  
 those seconds could be fatal.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Hmmm... If you want to send a message, there might be a way.  
I live in the Gourmet Guild guildhouse,  
and I get along well with the caretaker, Karin.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
I could pass a message to her.  
'Course, {player} and the others are in the palace,  
so it might take time to reach them...  
  
**Ameth：**  
This Karin isn't exactly a fighter, is she?  
{player} and his friends are in a battle!  
We can't throw her into a situation like that!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Then we're out of options.  
Nothing for it but to give up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You youngsters are so cold...  
You do realize this whole world could collapse?  
We can't afford to give up!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Hah!  
Why should chunks of data like us Guide Fairies  
care what collapses and what doesn't?  
  
**Ameth：**  
We may just be data,  
but {player} and his friends are real living beings!  
  
**Ameth：**  
We can't let their precious lives be torn apart  
in a twisted world like this...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Nebbia, get in touch with that Karin woman.  
It may not help much, but we have to do what we can.  
  
**Ameth：**  
First up, we have to get Yui away from Novem...  
Ah geez, I didn't expect them to run into each other  
right after I transported her!  
  
**Ameth：**  
There's always been something about them, hasn't there?  
These dang heroes...  
Normally it's beneficial to us, but this time it's just a pain.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
What do you mean?  
Explain yourself properly, Fio!  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's Ameth now.  
I'll explain once everything's ready, so for now, let's get moving.  
  
**Ameth：**  
While we both still have  
a connection to this world, faint though it may be.
