**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm...  
It would seem Miss Jun is pursuing us no longer.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Why could that be?  
She seemed to be acting in a most unusual manner...  
Well, it is certainly lucky for us, at any rate.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So, what next?  
With no pursuers, we have escaped the immediate threat.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm... I guess we really should drop by the vault.  
It's just around the corner, after all...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The door is pretty tightly sealed,  
 but I know the way to unlock it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And our enemy,  
 the one they call \"Her Majesty,\"  
never seemed all that interested in fancy treasure.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I doubt there'll be any new seals in place,  
so the technique I know should work just fine.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm...  
I never considered this at much length before,  
but what could it be that this \"Majesty\" truly does want?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If she cares not for treasure,  
why would she go to the trouble of posing as royalty?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And aside from her attacks upon us,  
she has not made any clear attempts to achieve anything...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Her motives are opaque.  
Somehow that seems rather unnerving to me.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmmm.  
The few times we spoke, she seemed interested in power...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But at the same time, I don't think it's about power for its own sake...  
 I don't really know.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Perhaps this world's secrets  
and Her Majesty's goal are quite closely intertwined.  
It does seem that she is another of the Seven Crowns, after all.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm?  
What do you mean by that?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well, perhaps that can wait. It would take some explanation.  
More to the point, Miss Pecorine, which way is this vault?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh,  
 it's at the end of this corridor!  
That's where you'll find the throne room,  
and in the water on the floor is...  
 Whoa?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh?!  
 What is all this?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
S-something exploded, right?  
In fact, I think I recognize that magic!  
Could it be...?  
  
**Rino：**  
W-wahh! That's not good at all!  
We've gotta stop her!  
  
**Masaki：**  
Indeed! To forfeit one's own life is the gravest of errors!  
And if that maiden's mind is not her own, so much the worse!  
  
**Masaki：**  
What knight could turn a blind eye?!  
Both of you, lend me your backup!  
I shall dive in at the first opening and restrain her!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
That's crazy talk!  
Can't you see how many blasts she's firing off?!  
One step too close and you'll be blown to pieces!  
  
**Masaki：**  
And yet approach her I must!  
Were I to leave a young girl to her tragic fate,  
even if I saved my mistress, she would surely berate me!  
  
**Masaki：**  
Mistress Neneka is a gracious soul with a just heart!  
Indeed, this is why I love and respect her so!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Wow, that's some passion! ♪  
I'd love to cheer you on,  
but isn't it kind of impossible?  
Forget getting close, you'd have your hands full just dodging!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Aha... ahahahahahah!  
Die, die, die!  
  
**Karyl：**  
All of you, perish forever!  
Every last fool who dares to oppose me and Her Majesty...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
K-Karyl!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And Labyrinth, too!  
How did you find yourselves in this situation?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, wow.  
{player}... What're you guys doing here?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well, one thing led to another...  
We were in the area, so to speak.  
How did all of you find yourselves here as well?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Well...  
 The brainwashing apparatus we came to destroy  
is here in the throne room.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm...  
I guess that means it must be stored in the vault as well, huh?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
See down there?  
The entrance to the vault is hidden  
in the water on the throne room's floor.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's magically isolated in a totally separate dimension,  
so I guess it would be the safest place to hide something like that.  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, looks like you managed to rescue Pecorine, huh?  
Nice going! I knew you had it in you, Big Bro! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Pecorine...?  
Foul pretender to Her Majesty's name! How did you escape your cell?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Our friends came to rescue me, Karyl.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And we'll rescue you too, just you wait.  
Once we do, let's all go back to the happy life we had before!
