## Subtitle: Don'tcha Give Up!
  
**Mahiru：**  
Heeeey! Elizabeth!  
Where've you gone an' run off to now?!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Waaahhhh!  
Didja get tired of listenin' to my jokes all the time?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I get it! It's all my fault!  
I won't force ya to listen to my bit anymore!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Come back, Elizabeth!  
I ain't a kid anymore. I shoulda known better!  
It ain't right to force comedy onto others!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But I was sure you an' I could take  
the comedy world by storm!  
I believed in us! That's why—  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Aaaaghh!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Whoa, that gave me a fright!  
That was some unprecedented slapstick comedy, right there.  
Can't believe I took a full-on pratfall like that!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I-I gotta hold on to that sensation!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wait, hold on.  
If it ain't {player}!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Whatcha doin' hidin' in the bushes?  
You wanted to pay a visit to Elizabeth Park?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
What's that?  
This path is some kind of... shortcut?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Well sure, it's shorter.  
But it's also littered with traps meant to ward off  
the monsters comin' after our livestock.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
If you don't take the regular mountain trail,  
you'll end up gettin' hurt.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You almost gave me a heart attack back there,  
jumpin' outta the bushes like that...  
I thought you were a monster. What a fright!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Well, not that the monsters 'round here  
are actually all that dangerous for the most part.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh? You came to deliver the mail again?  
Thank you kindly.  
I'll handle the paperwork now. Mind steppin' into my office?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hm?  
Oh nothin', jus' that there's no news from the detective.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I've been searchin' for my runaway gal.  
There hasn't been a peep of news, so I've just about given up.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Nah, it's a cow, not a person.  
Her name's Elizabeth.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Yessiree,  
we named our guild after her.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
She's like a sister to me, and we get along real well.  
Such a good-natured ol' gal...  
The best comedy partner I've ever had.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But one day,  
she disappeared outta the blue.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I haven't gotta clue where she is or what she's doin'...  
I've been wringin' my hands try'na find her,  
but without much success.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
It's like she vanished  
in a puff of smoke.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Jus' now, y'know—  
I was out there callin' her name, searchin' for her  
around where she'd last been seen.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But there ain't no sign of her.  
And no matter who I ask,  
they don't remember good ol' Elizabeth.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
It's an odd affair.  
Maybe it's just like that detective, Miss Kasumi, said,  
and Elizabeth's wound up \"Lost.\"  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...Oh, it's nothin' really.  
Jus' been a lotta strange things occurin' 'round these parts.  
Wish things would get more peaceful an' calm.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Can't really do my acts when people are down or cryin', can I?  
They'd jus' tell me off for bein' insensitive.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh gosh!  
{player}, why'd you start glowin' like that?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You oughtta warn me before ya do these things!  
I ain't much good at playin' off the cuff!

**Mahiru：**  
Wooooooow! ☆  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Amazin'! I've never seen half of these animals before!  
Can't wait to tell everyone back home!  
Tee hee!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Thanks a million, {player},  
for takin' me to the zoo.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I was feelin' down in the dumps after failin' the qualifying  
round for that comedy contest.  
You've really lifted my mood!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Accordin' to my plan, I was supposed to win my way up  
that contest...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I even paid pretty far in advance for my hotel room.  
Woulda been here a month if I'd made the finals.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
It'd be a waste to head back so early.  
I think I'll stay in this town for a while.  
The other employees are lookin' after the farm while I'm gone.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
And if any of the chosen participants decide to opt outta  
the contest, it looks like those of us who dropped out  
could still get another chance!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
So I'm workin' on a buncha new material  
in case that happens!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You oughtta come up with some stuff as well,  
{player}.  
As the other half of my comedy duo!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...I'm sorry for forcin' you into this.  
If you don't wanna do it, you can tell me.  
I'll try'n manage on my own.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wouldn't be the first time  
my comedy partner bailed on me.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Not everyone out there  
gets to reach my age  
an' still bang on about comedy an' all that jazz.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm lucky enough to still have the time  
to be doin' this stuff, even after turnin' twenty.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Most regular folk have gotta make ends meet.  
An' there's a reason \"starvin' artist\" is a common phrase.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
In my case, I ain't no professional.  
Jus' another comedy-lovin' amateur.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I doubt it'll ever go beyond bein' a hobby,  
but still, it's a dream of mine!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Dreams are important.  
**Choice: (2)**  Cheer up.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mahiru：**  
Hm?  
Yeah...  
Yeah, sure they are.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Sorry, I ain't quite sure howta reply to that!  
Guess it's my fault for bringin' up the topic.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hmm...  
Looks like our banterin' still ain't as smooth as it should be.  
Dang, we oughtta work on that!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Mahiru：**  
Hm?  
Did I seem down to you?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Well, to be honest,  
I am feelin' a bit low after the disappointin' contest results.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Smile through your tears.  
That's what a world-class comedian oughtta do!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I shouldn't have worried you, {player}.  
I still got a lot more learnin' to do!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mahiru：**  
Tee hee!  
Things got a bit gloomy there for a second.  
Sorry 'bout that. I'll try'n lighten the mood with a joke!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hold on. I'm gonna come up with a pun  
usin' the animals in front of us!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Lemme see. The cat was cat-atonic!  
Whoopsie, that ain't no cat. That's a tiger!  
Tee hee! ☆  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...What's that?  
I don't gotta force myself  
to let out empty laughs?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You're a cheeky li'l thing, {player}.  
That ain't no way to speak to your elders... ♪

**Ameth：**  
Okay. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Think of what you just saw as a dream of sorts.  
You'll forget everything the second you wake up,  
so no need to brood over it now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Someday, I'll explain it in detail.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway... Why does Mahiru look so young for her age?  
  
**Ameth：**  
She totally looks like she's still in grade school.  
How old is she again? Twenty?  
  
**Ameth：**  
The human body truly is a mystery.  
Maybe all that laughing has knocked years off her age.  
  
**Ameth：**  
After all, they say laughter is the best medicine.  
Apparently, it makes your skin glow.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, I'm a fairy, so I've never really worried  
about my skin to begin with.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, never mind me.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You know, Mahiru... She laughs all the time,  
but sometimes she gets the loneliest look on her face.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She may be shouldering some heavy burden.  
Try and keep an eye out for her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That sweet girl is like an older sister to you.  
And she's always busy making everyone smile. ♪  
  

---  
  
**Mahiru：**  
{player}?  
What's the matter? You were totally spacing out there.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Maybe you stepped on a snake walkin' up this mountain path  
an' it bit you back.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I was bitten once by a snake when I jus' a young'un.  
Lay in bed burnin' with fever for three days an' three nights.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Sure you're okay?  
Well, as long as that's the case! ♪  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Gosh, I'm tired from walkin' the mountain path!  
You oughtta drop by the office an' get some rest.  
I'll make sure to look after ya.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Everyone else has gone out today.  
I was feelin' lonely with no one to talk to!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Animals don't tend to do too much laughin'.  
Without anyone here, my comic jokes were mostly fallin' flat.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
We've had a few freeloaders join us, so things've been  
a bit more lively recently.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
What's that?  
If I'm lonely, I could always move to the city?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Well, that's easier said than done...  
I jus' can't bring myself to abandon the farm  
I inherited from my parents.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
It ain't easy bein' a grown-up, is it?  
Tee hee! ♪
