**Mahiru：**  
Whew...  
Finally finished fixin' the fence.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh darn, the whole place is showin' wear an' tear.  
Well, it is a mighty old ranch, after all.  
My family's been raisin' cattle on these lands for generations.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
It ain't often I get builders comin' up to these parts.  
An' when they do, they're always overchargin'...  
So I don't have much choice but to do the repairs myself.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Thanks to that, I've become quite the carpenter.  
Oh darn, I'm covered in sweat an' mud...  
I ain't much in the way of wife material right now.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
That said, I'd hate to be the one to end the family legacy  
of good ol' Elizabeth Park.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Gotta find myself a partner,  
an' start workin' on raisin' a family.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
To be frank... I really ain't all that interested.  
I oughtta take a leaf outta Limalima's book an' act more girly.  
Do I gotta start dressin' up?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hmm?  
Oh, {player}!  
What can I do for ya?  
What brings you to Elizabeth Park?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Now, don't tell me  
you climbed up here jus' to see my comedy routine!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Gosh, I'm blushin'!  
Ya know you've made it when you've got your own groupie!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
What? That ain't it?  
Yeah, I know. I was just playin' dumb...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Right, I see. So you're workin' as a mailman.  
You've been climbin' the mountain, deliverin' letters  
to Elizabeth Park an' the elf village?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
My, I oughtta thank you!  
You're real hardworkin', aren't ya?  I'm impressed.  
You'd make a fine husband, {player}!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Me?  
I've been doin' repairs around Elizabeth Park.  
Our equipment was startin' to show plenty of wear an' tear.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Well, this place ain't gettin' any younger...  
It's practically fallin' apart at the seams.  
I really oughtta tear it all down an' rebuild it from scratch.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Need any help?  
**Choice: (2)**  You're keeping busy.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mahiru：**  
Nah. You've got your own work to handle, yeah?  
You oughtta take care of yourself before worryin' about others.  
But I do appreciate the gesture. Thank you kindly!

`Tag 2`  
**Mahiru：**  
Sure thing. You an' me both, {player}!  
It ain't as tough as it sounds, though.  
Lately, I've had Limalima an' the others helpin' out.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
That gal's got a lotta strength, 'nuff to make up for any man.  
But Limalima, Rinrin, an' Shioshio are really jus' freeloaders...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Strictly speakin', they ain't employees of Elizabeth Park.  
So I feel guilty about puttin' 'em to work.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Well, I'm jus' gonna do double the work an' everythin' oughtta  
work itself out!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Uwahhh!  
Wh-whadja pat me on the head for?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Huh? I'm \"mature for my age\"?  
How many times do I gotta tell ya, I'm older than you!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mahiru：**  
Tee hee hee.  
Wait here a second, {player}.  
I got somethin' I wanna give you!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Huh...? Whatcha applaudin' for? This ain't one of my skits.  
Not that I wouldn't mind showin' you one,  
but I haven't had much time to work on my material lately.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Puttin' that aside...  
I wanted to give ya some milk to drink.  
You must be thirsty from climbin' the mountain.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
It's real fresh an' darn delicious!  
Ain't sterilized like the commercial stuff. Real nutritious.  
Milk is the vitality of life! Hee hee!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
When I milk 'em too much, I gotta throw out any extra.  
Yessiree, that's what the law says.  
So go on an' drink all you like! Don't hesitate!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Whoa—!  
Wh-whyja come leapin' towards me for?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
None of that hanky-panky here. Want me to give ya a beatin'?  
Oh! I meant the cow's milk, not mine.  
I still ain't got any milk of my own.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Geez...  
{player}, you do the silliest things sometimes.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wait, were you playin' the comic to my straight man jus' now?  
Oh boy, I messed up big time with the reaction!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hmm... Looks like you were just bein' yourself.  
Still, that's a real talent.  
You can be the comic without even realizin'. I'm darn jealous!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Well now, if you like comedy, why not pair up with me?  
I was jus' lookin' to start a comedy duo.  
Yeah, give it some thought!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Who knows? Once we hit it off as a double act,  
we might end up hittin' it off in other ways, too...  
I-I'm kiddin'!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I-I was jus' playin' the comic, you know?  
You gotta work with me if we're doin' a double act!  
Don't leave me hangin'.  
  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hee hee! I'm gettin' all excited jus' thinkin' 'bout the future!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
*umph, umph...*  
There, squeezed you some fresh milk.  
Drink up! Gulp it down!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Tee hee!  
You can be real clueless an' innocent sometimes...  
And you're so curious an' interested in everythin'.  
Jus' like a li'l baby!
