**Knight：**  
Damn it, how many times do I have to tell you?  
You are not allowed to enter the royal palace grounds!  
  
**Knight：**  
Even among the ranks of Nightmare, only those of noble  
blood are permitted to set foot inside the royal palace.  
Naturally, a commoner like you would never be given entry!  
  
**Knight：**  
Do you have a problem with that?  
Quit pestering me, or I'll place you under arrest!  
  
**Commander：**  
Hey, what's going on here?  
What's all this commotion?  
  
**Knight：**  
Ah, Squad Commander!  
  
**Knight：**  
It's nothing... Do you recall the king commanding us  
to round up the city's street performers?  
An acquaintance of one of them is demanding her release!  
  
**Commander：**  
I see. Listen, young man. I am sympathetic, but please be  
patient. It's not as if we enjoy enforcing such outlandish  
orders. But we cannot go against our monarch's will.  
  
**Commander：**  
I don't get it...  
What has become of the throne of late?  
Don't you find our recent orders to be bizarre?  
  
**Knight：**  
Hmm. But the individual who was seized earlier  
is the proprietor of Elizabeth Park. Although she's human,  
it's rumored she shelters beastfolk...  
  
**Knight：**  
Isn't that why she is being punished?  
I had thought that was the reason behind it.  
  
**Commander：**  
Very little biologically distinguishes beastfolk from humans.  
And no law forbids humans from befriending beastfolk.  
Although, recently, I do feel the racial divides deepening.  
  
**Commander：**  
In any case, we of Nightmare are responsible for protecting  
innocent people from harm. It is not our duty to capture  
the innocent and torment them.  
  
**Commander：**  
Our captain has told us to treat the performers with respect.  
We won't harm them, as long as they're not violent.  
So please, wait here until your friend returns.  
  
**Commander：**  
The proprietor of Elizabeth Park would be...  
Miss Mahiru, yes?  
My wife loves the dairy goods she comes to sell.  
  
**Commander：**  
She produces not only food, but cosmetics and clothing, too.  
I wouldn't want her to close shop because of all this.  
My wife would kill me.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...  
  
**Commander：**  
Ah, there she is.  
Miss Mahiru, are you okay?  
Did they mistreat you?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...{player}.  
You were waitin' for me outside the royal palace?  
Sorry for makin' you worry.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Um, Nightmare fellas,  
wouldja mind lettin' go  
of {player}'s arm?  
He ain't done nothin' wrong at all.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Neither did you, Mahiru.  
**Choice: (2)**  Are you okay?  
`Tag 1`  
**Mahiru：**  
Tee hee! Sure, that's true enough. But even if you don't  
break the law, if the people in power find you annoyin',  
that's a \"sin,\" too.  
I'm startin' to grasp that.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Mahiru：**  
Yup.  
Don't worry. They didn't do nothin' terrible to me.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Thank you, {player}.  
Jus' seein' your face an' hearin' your voice...  
It's puttin' me a li'l more at ease.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mahiru：**  
Tee hee... If we hang aroun' the royal palace,  
we'll get in the way of these Nightmare fellas.  
Whaddya say we head home, then?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Whoopsie...  
Sorry, wouldja mind givin' me a piggyback ride?  
I ain't hurt or nothin', but I'm still in a bit of a shock.  
Don't think I can walk on my own.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Yup.  
Thanks.  
Don't look at me like that. I'm fine.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm one of the lucky ones. They didn't do nothin' bad to me.  
But the ones who really had been criticizing the royal family...  
The things they were doin' to them don't bear thinkin' about.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
They were threatenin' them... with cuttin' off their tongues  
unless they sing the praises of royalty from now on.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
It's disgustin'. That ain't how civilized folk oughtta behave.  
You know, {player}.  
I'm... kinda scared.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I wasn't try'na do anythin' outrageous, you know?  
I jus' wanted to do my comedy an' make people laugh...  
Nothin' more than that.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But that ruler of ours couldn't seem to understand.  
Jus' now in there, all of us arrested folk were made to perform  
one after the other in front of the throne.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
There were plenty of entertainers there  
who were far funnier'n I could ever be.  
But I never saw a hint of a smile on that royal face.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You'd think everyone was talkin' another language,  
for all the reaction they got.  
And when they were done,  
it was just \"What is the point of any of this nonsense?\"  
  
**Mahiru：**  
It was terrifyin'...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ain't it natural to wanna make others smile, to wanna  
make 'em even just a li'l happier? \"What's the point\"...?  
What kinda person asks a question like that?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
What kinda life do ya gotta live to end up like that?  
How can you be so detached from what makes you human?  
Is that what happens to all royalty?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
That ain't no way to live.  
A part of me wishes there was somethin' I could do  
to teach that poor soul how to smile even a little...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But I know I can't. I ain't got the skills nor the talent.  
I really am pathetic.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You know, {player}... In that moment,  
I was jus' scared of that face lookin' down on me.  
I could only think of gettin' outta there as soon as possible.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm real sorry.  
After all the work you put into brainstormin' with me.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I couldn't even tell a single funny story.  
Let alone get any laughs outta that stony face.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
My mind went blank, an' I couldn't recall a single pun...  
I was jus' scared silly the whole time.  
How am I supposed to become a real comedian like this?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
In fact...  
Why did I even wanna be a comedian in the first place...?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm not even sure anymore.  
I can't remember what there is to laugh about.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
*sniff, sniff*  
Waaahhh!
