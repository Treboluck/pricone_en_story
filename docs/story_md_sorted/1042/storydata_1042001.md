**Narration：**  
One day, Chika walks deep into the woods to avoid any prying eyes.  
  
**Chika：**  
This should be far enough. I doubt I'll run into anyone here.  
  
**Chika：**  
I can't believe I agreed to join Miss Nozomi's idol group.  
Still, idol or not, singing is singing...  
I should practice until I'm happy with my performance.  
  
**Chika：**  
What does it mean to sing like an idol?  
Hmm.  
I guess I won't know until I try.  
I'll sing a few songs to get a feel for it.  
  
**Chika：**  
Lah-lah. ♪  
  
**Chika：**  
All right. I think I've improved a lot.  
If I keep practicing at this rate—  
  
**Monster：**  
Grrrghhh!  
  
**Chika：**  
A monster?!  
Did I get too close to its lair?  
It's coming this way!  
  
**Monster：**  
Grrrghhh!  
  
**Chika：**  
I'm just going to have to fight it alone!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Step in to help.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chika：**  
Oh...!  
Thank you so much for helping me!  
  
**Chika：**  
You've got your hands full fending it off?  
Understood. Please focus on holding back its attacks.  
  
**Chika：**  
I'll fight... with you!  
  
**Chika：**  
Spirit of wind...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Is this really the time for singing?  
**Choice: (3)**  You have a beautiful voice.  
`Tag 2`  
**Chika：**  
I'm sorry, but I must sing if I am to fight.  
Please hold on a little longer.

**Chika：**  
I'll start again.  
  
**Chika：**  
Spirit of wind. I beseech you.  
Slay this foe that stands in our way!  
  
**Spirit：**

**Monster：**  
Graaarghhh!  
  
**Chika：**  
Whew.  
What a relief. Looks like we managed to defeat it.  
  
**Chika：**  
You look... startled.  
I'm actually a Song Summoner. I can summon spirits through singing.  
Since you kept the monster at bay, I was able to focus on my singing.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Compliment her singing.  
**Choice: (6)**  Compliment her Song Summoning.  
`Tag 5`  
**Chika：**  
Oh, th-thank you very much.  
  
**Chika：**  
Sorry, I'm not used to receiving compliments,  
so I don't really know how to respond.  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Chika：**  
Thank you.  
This power is what allows me to fight.  
  
**Chika：**  
Even so, Song Summoning requires me to sing,  
so I need someone to fight alongside me.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Chika：**  
You really helped me out just now.  
I was looking for somewhere with no one around,  
and it looks like I must have ventured too far into the forest.  
  
**Chika：**  
You see, I'm in an idol group with my guildmates.  
But... I'm just not confident I can sing like an idol.  
  
**Chika：**  
So I wanted to spend more time practicing.  
With no one around, I thought I'd be able to focus here.  
  
**Chika：**  
But in the end, it was pretty dangerous to come alone, wasn't it?  
I'll have to give up on practicing for now.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Offer to accompany her.  
`Tag 8`  
**Chika：**  
You would come with me?  
I mean, if there are two of us  
I'm sure we'd be fine even if monsters did show up...  
  
**Chika：**  
But... wouldn't it be too much trouble?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Don't worry about it.  
`Tag 9`  
**Chika：**  
You really are kind, aren't you?  
It's been an eventful day,  
but I'm glad I met you.  
  
**Chika：**  
Come to think of it, I still haven't introduced myself.  
My name is Chika. And you are?  
  
**Chika：**  
{player},  
I look forward to getting to know you.  
  
**Narration：**  
From that day onward,  
Chika and {player} began their secret practice sessions together.
