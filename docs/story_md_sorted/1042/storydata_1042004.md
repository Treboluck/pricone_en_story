**Narration：**  
As usual, {player} accompanies Chika while she practices.  
However...  
  
**Chika：**  
How did I do, {player}?  
I think I sang really well just now.  
  
**Chika：**  
{player}?  
...Have you fallen asleep?  
  
**Chika：**  
Heheh... He looks so peaceful when he's sleeping.  
I feel bad about waking him up. I'll just let him—  
  
**Chika：**  
Huh?! Wh-where is this light coming from?  
It's so bright...There's something almost nostalgic about it.

**Chika：**  
Um, excuse me.  
Did some papers come flying this way?  
My sheet music just got carried off by the wind...  
  
**Chika：**  
Yes, that's it! Did you gather them for me?  
Wow, they're all here.  
Thank you so much. You're a lifesaver!  
  
**Chika：**  
Is there anything I can do to thank you?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'd like to hear you sing.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chika：**  
You mean... the song from this sheet music?  
  
**Chika：**  
I still haven't finished learning it...  
In fact, I was in the middle of practicing just now.  
  
**Chika：**  
I also get really shy when singing in public...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Think of this as practice.  
`Tag 2`  
**Chika：**  
Public singing practice?  
True, I get nervous in front of a crowd,  
but if I can get used to performing for one person...  
  
**Chika：**  
That wouldn't be much of a thank you though.  
You'd be helping *me* practice.  
  
**Chika：**  
You don't mind?  
Hehe. You're a real gentleman.  
Okay then, thank you.  
  
**Chika：**  
...H-here goes.  
  
**Chika：**  
Uff...  
My nerves are acting up now that I'm actually doing this.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm excited.  
**Choice: (4)**  I'm a pumpkin.  
`Tag 3`  
**Chika：**  
D-don't expect too much, please.  
I'm already nervous enough as it is.  
  
**Chika：**  
But I guess this is part of practicing.  
I'll do my best.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Chika：**  
You are a pumpkin? ...  
Oh right.  
If I trick myself into thinking I'm alone,  
I might be able to sing.  
  
**Chika：**  
Okay! I'll give it a try.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Chika：**  
Wow. This is going so smoothly.  
He even seems to enjoy my singing...  
  
**Chika：**  
I wonder why? Usually, I get so nervous when singing in front  
of others,  
I always end up messing it up...  
  
**Chika：**  
How strange... Is it because it's him?  
  
**Chika：**  
...  
  
**Chika：**  
Um...  
H-how did I do?  
  
**Chika：**  
You were bored, weren't you?  
Did I make you sleepy?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  You sang beautifully.  
`Tag 6`  
**Chika：**  
Thank you!  
I'm so glad you liked my singing!  
  
**Chika：**  
I can always sing for you again another time.  
I'm Chika Misumi, by the way.  
What's your name?  
  
**Chika：**  
{player}...  
Thank you for today. Well, goodbye then.

**Ameth：**  
Okay. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Think of what you just saw as a dream of sorts.  
Chances are you'll forget everything the second you wake up,  
so no need to brood over it too much.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Seriously, though...  
How could you fall asleep  
while Chika was singing for you?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, it was a soothing song, I'll give you that.  
Her singing has a relaxing...  
hypnotic quality to it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
With a voice like that, she should hold her head higher.  
She's wasting her potential, letting stage fright  
get the better of her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
At least \"over here\" she's made more progress than \"back there.\"  
An idol soon to sing in front of large audiences...  
  
**Ameth：**  
As far as Chika's concerned,  
it could have a good influence on her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, no point in chattering on here.  
I think that's enough for today. Bye-bye for now! ♪  
  

---  
  
**Chika：**  
Mmm...  
Huh? Where am I...  
...Did I fall asleep?  
  
**Chika：**  
Good morning, {player}.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Thank you for singing for me.  
`Tag 7`  
**Chika：**  
Please, don't mention it.  
The song was my way of thanking *you*—  
  
**Chika：**  
Huh? Why do you know about my dream?  
Wait, were we dreaming the same thing?  
...  
What a strange coincidence.  
  
**Chika：**  
Even in the dream, I was glad you liked my singing.  
Thank you.  
  
**Chika：**  
I vividly remember the song I sang,  
so if you ever want to hear it again, just let me know.  
I'll sing it for you whenever you like.  
  
**Narration：**  
Chika smiled teasingly,  
even as her cheeks blushed slightly.
