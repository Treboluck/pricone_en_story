## Subtitle: I Want It to Be You
  
**Narration：**  
The day of Chika's solo concert arrives.  
{player} visits Chika to encourage her.  
  
**Chika：**  
{player}, thank you so much.  
Your help backstage has been a real lifesaver.  
  
**Chika：**  
I'm sorry. I invited you to the concert as a guest,  
but you've ended up helping out with everything.  
  
**Chika：**  
Thanks to your help, it looks like the concert  
will be starting on schedule!  
  
**Chika：**  
Don't worry about the rest.  
Why don't you take a seat in the audience?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You look a little pale.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chika：**  
...Can you tell?  
  
**Chika：**  
...Honestly.  
I can't hide anything from you, {player}.  
  
**Chika：**  
The truth is... I'm super nervous.  
I'm afraid that if I'm not careful, my knees will give out.  
  
**Chika：**  
It's the first time in my idol career performing on stage alone...  
A-and I didn't expect so many people to show up!  
  
**Guard Captain：**  
Chikaaa!  
  
**Guard：**  
It's about to start! Chika's first solo concert!  
Whooo! I just can't wait!  
  
**Guard Captain：**  
Calm yourself!  Use all your energy now,  
and you'll run out of steam during the concert!  
  
**Guard：**  
C'mon, Cap, speak for yourself!  
  
**Chika：**  
The truth is, I still get really nervous performing on stage!  
No matter how much I practice, I'm just not confident enough...  
  
**Chika：**  
I've managed until now because I had Nozomi and Tsumugi  
up there with me.  
  
**Chika：**  
During battle, I'm always protected behind others  
while summoning... I've never really sang face-to-face  
with anyone.  
  
**Chika：**  
So to sing directly facing the audience... It frightens me.  
In fact, just thinking about people listening to me sing  
makes me blush with embarrassment!  
  
**Chika：**  
The reason I could sing as a Song Summoner until now  
was because I was protecting others!  
  
**Chika：**  
But I'm not singing in this concert to protect *anyone*!  
And I'll be up there alone without my friends!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  In that case... why not quit?  
**Choice: (3)**  But you still want to sing, don't you?  
`Tag 2`  
**Chika：**  
Well...  
I think you already know the answer to that,  
{player}.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Chika：**  
...Somehow I knew  
you would understand.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Chika：**  
Even if I'm scared, I want to sing.  
I want my fans to hear my music.  
  
**Chika：**  
But that's just what *I* want.  
  
**Chika：**  
What I can't stop worrying about  
is whether I can convey my passion for music  
to all those people.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Sing.  
`Tag 5`  
**Chika：**  
{player}? Wh-what—  
why are you suddenly singing?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Chika! You've got this!  
`Tag 6`  
**Chika：**  
Is that... a fight song?  
It's for me...  
You're singing just for me.  
  
**Chika：**  
...{player}, I felt  
your emotions coming through your song.  
  
**Chika：**  
You're right. Even if I can't reach everyone,  
if I convey my feelings to just one person...  
then that song has meaning.  
  
**Chika：**  
In that case, I want that one person to be...  
  
**Chika：**  
...Thank you, {player}.  
I'll be okay now.  
  
**Chika：**  
Please, watch me from the audience.  
If you're watching,  
I'll be able to sing without being afraid.  
  
**Chika：**  
So  
keep your eyes on me, please!  
All the way until the end...!  
  
**Chika：**  
Okay. For my opening song,  
you just heard a solo version of one of Carmina's songs.  
  
**Chika：**  
...What did you think?  
  
**Guard Captain：**  
Amaaazing!  
  
**Guard：**  
Oh man! If that's just the first song, I... I—!  
*sob* I'm gonna stick it out 'til the end! Chikaaa!  
  
**Chika：**  
Thank goodness.  
I managed to pull off the first song.  
  
**Chika：**  
Everyone, thank you so much  
for coming to my first solo concert!  
With my sincere gratitude,  
I'd like to sing the next song.  
  
**Chika：**  
I can see {player}'s face from here.  
Everything is okay!  
I'm going to sing for him until the end!  
  
**Narration：**  
Chika's fans forever remembered that day  
as a legendary solo concert.
