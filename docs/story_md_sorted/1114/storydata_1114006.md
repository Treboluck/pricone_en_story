## Subtitle: Loneliness and a Promise
  
**Narration：**  
{player} travels deep into the forest,  
where he finds Luna in a somber mood.  
  
**Luna：**  
......  
  
**Luna：**  
...Oh.  
  
**Luna：**  
......  
...Did you know?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Know what?  
`Tag 1`  
**Luna：**  
......  
I overheard.  
The old lady killed Mother and Father.  
  
**Luna：**  
That's what she said... and I heard it.  
...Why?  
  
**Luna：**  
...Is it true?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It's not true.  
`Tag 2`  
**Luna：**  
......  
............  
  
**Luna：**  
Is the old lady a bad person?  
But her sandwiches are so delicious...  
  
**Luna：**  
...I just don't understand.  
  
**Narration：**  
Luna drops her gaze to the ground.  
No matter how many times {player} talks to her, she doesn't respond.  
  
**Narration：**  
Thinking it best that Luna and the old woman talk to each other directly,  
he leaves Luna in order to search for her.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
......  
...That look on your face... What's the matter?  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...! Don't tell me something happened to the little girl!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I want you to talk to Luna properly.  
`Tag 3`  
**Old Woman：**  
...All right.  
I'll do as you say.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
If I keep running away like this, nothing will ever change.  
I know that.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...But still, I've just never had the nerve.  
Never.  
All I'm capable of doing is baking bread.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...On my own it would have always been like this, I suppose.  
Constant pain...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...But because you're pushing me, I can move forward.  
So thank you ever so much.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
I don't know how it will go,  
but I'll try talking to the little girl.  
Properly, to her face...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...Could you do this old woman a favor and take me to her?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Of course!  
`Tag 4`  
**Old Woman：**  
Sorry for the trouble.  
Thank you...  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} makes his way to Luna's manor.  
He is greeted by the roar of a monster.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Luna：**  
...!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Wh—?!  
A monster...?!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Why...? Monsters aren't supposed to show up here...  
  
**Luna：**  
Stay back...! Go away!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRUOOGHH!  
  
**Narration：**  
The monster inches toward Luna.  
{player} grips the hilt of his sword.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH!  
  
**Narration：**  
However, the monster's movements are a split second faster.  
It makes a dash for Luna—  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Look out!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Hrk!  
  
**Luna：**  
Old lady!  
  
**Narration：**  
The old woman jumps out in front of the monster in order to protect Luna.  
{player} takes it down with his sword.  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Luna：**  
Old lady! Old lady!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...Good.  
You're all right.  
  
**Luna：**  
Are you okay?  
Are you hurt?!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
I'm fine.  
'Tis but a scratch.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...You saved me.  
Had you not been here, I would surely have been monster food by now.  
  
**Luna：**  
......  
I'm so sorry.  
I was in a daze...  
  
**Luna：**  
I couldn't use my powers...  
I'm really sorry...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
It's not your fault.  
...Listen.  
  
**Luna：**  
......  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...Please hear me out.  
Little miss...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
It was me.  
I... am the one who killed your parents.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
If only I had been stronger... I could have called for help.  
If I had, your parents could have been saved.  
It's all my fault...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...I won't ask for forgiveness—I can't.  
But...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...But I'm sorry.  
So sorry...  
  
**Luna：**  
......  
  
**Luna：**  
...I don't know why.  
I can't remember...  
when Mother and Father died.  
  
**Luna：**  
I... was scared...  
\"Stop it!\" I thought.  
But then...  
  
**Luna：**  
...I don't remember.  
At all...  
  
**Luna：**  
But...  
  
**Luna：**  
...I remember your sandwiches.  
They're delicious.  
  
**Luna：**  
And you saved me. I remember that...  
I always will.  
So...  
  
**Luna：**  
...So, I'm not sure why, but it's okay.  
I just...  
  
**Luna：**  
...I want to spend time with you.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
......  
  
**Luna：**  
...You're lonely too, aren't you?  
I can tell.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...I'm sorry.  
So sorry...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
I used to have a granddaughter.  
She was about your age...  
But...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
One day... she was attacked by a monster...  
I've been terrified of monsters ever since... Absolutely terrified...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...I'm sorry.  
So sorry...  
  
**Luna：**  
...It's okay.  
Father and Mother told me we're still together after we die.  
  
**Luna：**  
So it's okay.  
It's all okay...  
  
**Luna：**  
Thank you, mister.  
I was able to make up with the old lady.  
It's all thanks to you.  
  
**Luna：**  
...I'm sad that Mother and Father died.  
But it wasn't the old lady's fault.  
It was no one's fault.  
  
**Luna：**  
...Blaming people just makes it more sad.  
  
**Luna：**  
You know... I thought that since Mother and Father died,  
no one would ever talk to me.  
I was so lonely…  
  
**Luna：**  
But...  
The old lady was worried about me.  
She was looking out for me.  
  
**Luna：**  
You too. You held my hand.  
It was nice and warm...  
  
**Luna：**  
...Mother and Father aren't here,  
but I'm not alone, am I?  
I didn't realize.  
  
**Luna：**  
...I'm sorry.  
  
**Luna：**  
...Thank you.  
  
**Luna：**  
I'm a good kid... so I don't say anything selfish.  
But... can I be a little bad?  
  
**Luna：**  
I want to go out with you again.  
I want to become a bad kid and go out with you again.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Of course!  
`Tag 5`  
**Luna：**  
Hee hee.  
Thanks, mister!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Where do you want to go?  
`Tag 6`  
**Luna：**  
...Right.  
  
**Luna：**  
Mister.  
Let's go...  
  
**Luna：**  
Let's go to the beach.
