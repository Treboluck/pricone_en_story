Why?!  
Why won't you die for me?!

You're a liar...!  
Just like those monsters!  
  
**Luna：**  
...Hmph, whatever!  
  
**Luna：**  
I hate you!

**Narration：**  
Once done, he makes his way out of the forest,  
only to encounter an old woman nearby.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...Young fellow,

**Old Woman：**  
Did you see a girl in there perhaps?  
A young one?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  I did.  
`Tag 9`  
**Old Woman：**  
Ahhh, as I thought...  
She must have done something terrible to you.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
But please forgive her.  
She's still oblivious to the truth.  
Completely and utterly...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
No one's to blame but me.  
My actions in this forest were...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...Ah,pardon me.  
I'm sure this old fossil's story will only bore you to tears.  
Forget I said anything.

Either way, you should stay away from here.  
It's dangerous...

{player} watched the old woman walk away,  
then returned to Landosol himself.
