## Subtitle: With All Your Heart
  
**Narration：**  
{player} has come to the forest to meet Luna.  
  
**Luna：**  
Ah, hello, mister!  
  
**Luna：**  
You know, I was with the old lady until just now!  
We were playing with my dolls!  
  
**Luna：**  
Do you like dolls too?  
I love them!  
  
**Luna：**  
...Ah!  
Ummm... And um, um...  
  
**Luna：**  
......  
  
**Luna：**  
...Ummm.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's wrong?  
`Tag 1`  
**Luna：**  
......  
  
**Luna：**  
...F-forget about it!  
It wasn't that tasty...  
  
**Luna：**  
...I don't think I can be like Mother.  
  
**Luna：**  
Eek!  
It's so bright...!  
  
**Luna：**  
Aaaaaahhh!  
  

---  
  
**Luna：**  
...Brother!  
  
**Luna：**  
Big brother!  
  
**Luna：**  
Hey, big brother!  
How long are you going to sleep?!  
If you don't hurry, it'll get cold!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  What will?  
`Tag 2`  
**Luna：**  
\"What will?\"  
Come on!  
Wake up, sleepyhead!  
  
**Luna：**  
Breakfast!  
I made breakfast for us!  
  
**Luna：**  
So come on!  
Get out of bed!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Okay, okay.  
`Tag 3`  
**Luna：**  
One \"okay\" is enough!  
  
**Luna：**  
Look, big brother!  
You see? It's tasty, right?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I haven't had any yet.  
`Tag 4`  
**Luna：**  
I mean it looks tasty!  
Hee hee. Let's eat!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Let's eat.  
`Tag 5`  
**Luna：**  
...*munch, munch*  
How is it, big brother?  
Is it yummy?  
  
**Luna：**  
You know, the fish—I tried really hard to grill it.  
I also tried my best to cook the rice!  
  
**Luna：**  
Kitchen knives are still too dangerous for me...  
So there wasn't really much I could cook...  
  
**Luna：**  
But I think I did quite well!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  It tastes good.  
`Tag 6`  
**Luna：**  
Really?!  
Great!  
  
**Luna：**  
...To be honest, I messed up loads of times.  
Even the fish, I kept burning it.  
  
**Luna：**  
But I tried so hard just so I could hear you say  
\"It tastes good.\"  
  
**Luna：**  
Heheh...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  You'll make a great wife.  
**Choice: (8)**  You're a good girl.  
`Tag 7`  
**Luna：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Luna：**  
But only being able to cook isn't enough. You're a sleepyhead,  
so I have to learn to wake you up properly.  
  
**Luna：**  
Also, you're a forgetful boy,  
so I have to be able to take charge.  
That's why I can't be a good wife until I get bigger!  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Luna：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Luna：**  
Do you think I'll get even bigger if I become an even better girl?  
If that happens, I'll always be able to take care of you.  
  
**Luna：**  
Right now I'm still tiny...  
But when I get big, we'll always be together.  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Luna：**  
...When I'm bigger, right, big brother?  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
And that's a wrap.  
That was a nice dream, wasn't it?  
She's an admirable girl, that Luna.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's a big deal for a girl to cook.  
Especially having the person you like enjoy what you've labored to create.  
You would do well to be mindful of that feeling.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, you're the type to eat anything and say it's delicious,  
so you should be fine.  
But make sure to put your heart into it whenever you do.  
  
**Ameth：**  
...With that, it's time to wake up.  
Enough happy dreams for today.

**Luna：**  
......  
...Huh?  
Why am I...  
  
**Luna：**  
......  
  
**Luna：**  
...I cooked a meal for you?  
And then you said that... it was delicious...  
  
**Luna：**  
......  
  
**Luna：**  
...You know,  
I learned how to cook from the old lady.  
I thought I could learn to be more like Mother.  
  
**Luna：**  
So...  
I made sandwiches.  
But... I couldn't make them as well as the old lady does.  
  
**Luna：**  
Despite that...  
  
**Luna：**  
...Will you still try them?  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Sure, I'll eat them.  
`Tag 10`  
**Luna：**  
...!  
Hee hee! Really?  
  
**Luna：**  
In that case... Here!  
One of my sandwiches!  
Enjoy!  
  
**Choice: (11)**  Yum yum.  
`Tag 11`  
**Luna：**  
Yay!  
You like it, you like it!  
  
**Luna：**  
Know what, mister?  
I'm going to try even harder!  
At cooking, laundry... loads of things!  
  
**Luna：**  
So if I keep being a good kid, keep telling me how great I am!  
Promise me!
