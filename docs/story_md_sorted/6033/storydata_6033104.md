## Subtitle: The Essence of the Magical Girl
  
**Kasumi：**  
I somehow pulled it off this time, but I still can't get my head around  
the whole \"essence of the magical girl\" thing.  
Therefore, I was hoping  
you could explain to me what your interpretation of this "essence" is.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I guess it's all in the pose.  
**Choice: (2)**  To be cute when you fight.  
**Choice: (3)**  I'll answer after I make you transform.

**Kasumi：**  
You want me to strike an even more embarrassing pose?!  
A-anything  
more than this is out of the question!  
Eh, you'll demonstrate for me?  
...That proactive personality of your certainly is a virtue.

Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi is going to smack your tooshie! ♪

**Misty★Kasumi：**  
M-  
Misty, Theory, Etcetera! I'm on the case!  
...You know what? I get that I  
was the one who asked, but blithely making me transform like that is a  
little improper, no? Do you enjoy forcing me to do things against my will?
