I never thought I'd become a magical girl...  
Nor that I'd ever be able to help anybody looking like this.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're always helpful.  
**Choice: (2)**  It's because you're so full of love.  
**Choice: (3)**  You have my support.

Do you really think so...?  
Wah!  
You startled me, suddenly patting my head like that...  
But I feel quite a bit more confident now...  
Eheheh.

I am? ...  
You mean like the way I treat Nyatt?  
Huh?! You want me to talk to you like I talk to him?  
Um...  
You're a sweet widdle baby...?  
No... It's far too embarrassing.

Thank you very much.  
Having your support is quite... invigorating.  
I'm going to be the best magical girl I can be.
