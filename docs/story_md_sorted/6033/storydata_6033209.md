**Choice: (3)**  A very cute creature.

True... Neither Kasumi nor I are very talkative,  
so there are times when Mora is the only one speaking,  
sometimes for minutes on end.

Very. My eyes can't help but follow him when he hops around.

Ah! Please ignore that!  
I just wanted to see if your eyes would follow me... H-how awkward.
