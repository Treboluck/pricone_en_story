## Subtitle: My Sister?
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Shizuru is an intense person, isn't she...?  
Um, I hope you don't mind me asking again,  
but when she's not on a rampage, what's she like?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She's a kind big sister.  
**Choice: (2)**  A big sister among big sisters.  
**Choice: (3)**  When I wake up, I find her asleep next to me.

Heheh. Just from that, I can tell you two are really close.  
Then maybe I  
can try being the opposite of Shizuru—I can be your little sister.  
Big  
Brother. ♪ Like that...?  
No wait, forget that! Hey, f-forget it this instant!

Yes, nonsense, just as I thought! I mean, do you even know if you're  
blood relatives?  
Big Sister is your big sister because she's Big Sister?  
  
Hmmm. Have you heard yourself?

I see. She sleeps beside you...  
Wait just a minute! My dear assistant,  
d-d-don't tell me you're actually fine with that!  
Ugh... At least once,  
we need to have a serious talk about crisis awareness and aversion!
