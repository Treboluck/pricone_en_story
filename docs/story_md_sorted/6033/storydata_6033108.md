## Subtitle: A Meeting of Magical Girls?
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Now that I think about it, I wonder why only the two of us were chosen  
to be magical girls.  
There are plenty of others in Landosol with unique  
talents. I think that we could do with having a few more of us around.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  They don't have enough love to be magical girls?  
**Choice: (2)**  None of them are lovely enough?  
**Choice: (3)**  I think I would do a good job at it.

**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...But I still don't think I have quite enough of it either.  
Oh, but I'm not saying that I don't have any love to give.  
It's not that I don't... Right? Yes.

**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...Hold on, my dear assistant. Going by that logic, you're putting me in  
the \"lovely\" category, aren't you?!  
I'm a detective, so I'm more what you  
would consider \"cool\"...  
S-stop laughing!

...Y-your confidence in the matter is unnerving, my dear assistant!  
Well, don't knock it till you've tried it, I suppose. Maybe if I dress you  
up as a girl in this costume...  
Oh, wow. Y-you look...  
surprisingly good...
