**Rei：**  
Phew... I think that should be all the monsters around here.  
Good work, both of you.  
  
**Rei：**  
B-by the way...  
How did you get to know {player}  
in the first place, Tsumugi?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Huh?!  
 H-he just applied to work at my store!  
  
**Rei：**  
I... I see.  
Um, I don't mean anything by that,  
 by the way...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
W-well, of course!  
After all, I only have eyes for you, Rei!  
Wait—Mr. Knight! Look out!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Yaaahhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Perfect! I took it down!  
Ahhh—whoa-oa-oa...  
  
**Rei：**  
W-w-wait! Why are you nestling up to him?!  
S-step away at once!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Owieeee...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Wait, huh?  
Wh-why am I right up against Mr. Knight?!  
Nooooo!  
  
**Rei：**  
Whoa!  
  
**Rei：**  
Really, Tsumugi!  
Don't just shove him at me!  
H-hold on! Where did you just touch me exactly?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
S-stop that!  
Who gave you permission to cuddle with my Rei?!  
Get away from her!  
  
**Narration：**  
With both of his companions flustered and defensive,  
{player} found himself helplessly caught in the middle.
