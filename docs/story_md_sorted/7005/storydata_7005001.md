**Tsumugi：**  
Whew... That should be the last of the monsters around here!  
  
**Rei：**  
You're in top form, Tsumugi.  
I think you've improved since I last saw you fight.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ohhh?!  
 You mean that?!  
Words of praise from my beloved Rei...!  
  
**Rei：**  
Same to you, {player}.  
You're both making this climb so easy.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ahh! Mr. Knight!  
Have you been trying to catch Rei's attention again?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
You may be able to boost her abilities in battle,  
but I won't let you win her over!  
  
**Rei：**  
Tsumugi...  
There's no need to be quite so hostile, is there?  
  
**Rei：**  
Don't you see it's all in your head?  
He's not the kind of scoundrel you imagine.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Rei, no! You should be more careful!  
Men are all wolves, you know!  
You can't let your guard down for an instant!  
  
**Rei：**  
\"Wolves\" is going a bit far...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
But they are! They're werewolves!  
The second you turn your back, they'll gobble you up alive!  
  
**Rei：**  
That's quite the wild claim...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Now listen, Mr. Knight.  
I came here for one reason and one reason only—  
to keep an eye on you!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
So don't you dare step out of my line of sight  
for an instant, you hear?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Also...  
 If we get split up,  
you'd better find your way back to me!  
  
**Rei：**  
I really wish the two of them could get along...  
Are they going to be like this the whole time?
