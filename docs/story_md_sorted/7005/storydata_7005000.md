**Rei：**  
So this is the Tower of Luna... What a gigantic structure.  
If we climb its floors, it may help your memories return, right?  
  
**Rei：**  
By the way, I've been sensing somebody's eyes on us for a while.  
It may be an enemy, so stay on your guard.  
  
**Rei：**  
I know you're hiding there!  
Isn't it high time you came out and showed yourself?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ahh... I should've known you'd notice.  
  
**Rei：**  
Tsumugi?! Why in the world are you here?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Why do you think?!  
I saw Mr. Knight sneaking off with you, so I had to follow!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Honestly... Trying to make moves on Rei behind my back!  
You're just as shameless as they come, aren't you?  
  
**Rei：**  
M-making \"moves\"?!  
H-he's been doing nothing of the sort!  
  
**Rei：**  
We came here because it might hold the key to his lost memories.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Then shall I come along too?  
I'll be your personal bodyguard and protect you from all danger!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Mr. Knight,  
 I'll be watching for any hint of funny business from you.  
You've been warned!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
But I guess  
 if you *really* insist,  
I could also lend a hand with the search for your memories.  
  
**Rei：**  
With Tsumugi's help, I'm sure we'll make good progress.  
Let's all work together  
 and find those memories!
