**Kokkoro：**  
There it is again!  
Just like before, it descended from a cliff above.  
This must be its method of hunting beasts that pass by.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Save the analysis for after we beat it!  
That thing looks mad with hunger—and it's brought friends this time!  
Ugh, just look at it drool...  
 Reminds me of someone I know.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If you think you can hunt me, think again!  
I won't give up my title of Perpetually Peckish Pecorine to any monster!
