That seemed like a pretty hairy situation.  
You okay, Ayumi?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Y-yes, I'm fine... Thank you...  
Urgh. That was so scary!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
There, there. It sure was scary, wasn't it?  
I'll ask you about the particulars later, but first things first.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
We need information.  
A good detective loves their theories and deduction,  
but an even better one only dives in after stocking up on info.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ideally someone would just bring info to us  
like you did, but alas, life isn't that easy.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Err. What should we do, then?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ask around town, of course.  
Let's not waste any time.
