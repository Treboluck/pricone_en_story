# An Invaluable Discovery
Though the race is called off due to the Goddess of Woe's appearance, Makoto and co. are awarded the prize for dealing with her. More than willing to call Ayumi a friend now, they decide to hold a party to celebrate.
  
## Subtitle: An Invaluable Discovery
  
**Narration：**  
Peace has returned to Landosol  
following the Goddess of Woe's disappearance.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Phew! That was a tough case, but we cracked it.  
Right, Ayu—  
Ayumi?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
*sob* *sniff* *hic* *sob* *hic*  
I was so scaaaaaareeeeeed!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Waaahhh! I-I'm so glad I'm aliiiiiive!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I'm so glad you're all safe,  
toooooo!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ahaha. Yup, same here!  
We made it through and solved the case!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hahaha! You're crying way too much, girl!  
You oughtta be glad that you're alive!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
*sob* *hic* *sniff*  
I-I'm trying, but the tears just won't stop!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hehe. You're absolutely the MVP this time around,  
but I guess you were feeling the pressure.  
  
**Makoto：**  
It's all okay now, though.  
We were able to save {player}, just as we planned.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
We were! We really were!  
I-I'm so glad it all worked out okay!  
  
**Makoto：**  
That said, the race got cancelled.  
So much for a year's worth of good grub.  
  
**Owner：**  
Heeey!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh? It's the postal service manager.  
  
**Owner：**  
Man! You guys sure put on a show by defeating that monster, didn't you?  
Couldn't have asked for better advertisement! Thanks a bunch!  
  
**Owner：**  
Oh, right. You know the prize I mentioned?  
Turns out you guys are getting it for all your hard work.  
  
**Makoto：**  
For real?!  
Woooooo!  
What sort of grub are we get—  
Huh?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I-is this... hay?  
That, plus beans, apples and carrots...  
  
**Makoto：**  
O-oh, come on!  
The prize was *horse* food?!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm. Not quite the outcome I expected.  
I guess truth really is stranger than fiction, huh?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I-it does look delicious, though.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh, right! We can still use the apples and carrots!  
I just gotta whip up a delicious dish with them!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Throw dessert in there, too.  
**Choice: (2)**  Now that sounds good.  
`Tag 1`  
**Makoto：**  
S-sure! Leave it to me!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Makoto：**  
You bet it does!  
Keep those hopes up!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Makoto：**  
And hey!  
If we're making grub anyway, then let's hold a party to celebrate!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Agreed! What say we hold it at our guildhouse?  
Thoughts, Ayumi?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh? Y-you're asking me?!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Of course.  
You *are* coming, right?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
B-but,  
I mean...  
I'll just be a nuisance...  
  
**Makoto：**  
No way, girl!  
No need to be so reserved around comrades!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh? Y-you consider me a comrade?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm...  
I guess \"friend\" would be a better way to put it.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
A f-friend!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yup!  
We're friends! Buds!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And with that said,  
you'll definitely come. Right?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
O-of course!  
I-  
I can't wait!  
  
**Narration：**  
Invited by her newfound friends,  
Ayumi shyly accepts to go to the party.
