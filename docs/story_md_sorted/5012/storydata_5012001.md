# Never Forget the Background Checks
Makoto and {player} meet up with Kasumi, leading to an investigation into whether or not someone holds a grudge against {player}. The only thing they learn from doing so at first is that he's friends with all sorts of girls, but Kasumi notices a suspicious pair of eyes on him in the midst of it.
  
## Subtitle: Never Forget the Background Checks
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey, Kasumi!  
I know you're here! Come on out!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm?  
What's wrong, Makoto? You're awfully loud today.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh, if it isn't my faithful assistant.  
I don't recall asking you to come here today.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But wait.  
That being the case,  allow me to deduce your reason for coming!  
Hm... You're here with Makoto, so...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's definitely not a love-related issue.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Do me a favor and shut it, will you?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Witty remarks aside—we need your help, Kasumi!  
More specifically, there's a mystery that needs solving.  
Someone's trying to take {player} out for good.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Take him out, you say? Well that's an unpleasant thought.  
Very well. Tell me everything you know.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm... I think I've got the gist of it. Things started to seem off when a plate  
that you hadn't touched shattered while you were eating out. And now,  
a few days later, further events have you concerned for your own safety.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I think someone really might be out to get me.  
**Choice: (2)**  Maybe I'm just having a stroke of bad luck.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kasumi：**  
Based on what you've told me, that seems very likely.  
But still...  
You never noticed anything strange, right, Makoto?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yeah.  
Us beastfolk are pretty sensitive to that sort of stuff,  
but at the very least everything seemed normal.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kasumi：**  
You didn't happen to get yourself cursed or something, did you?  
Maybe an evil spirit's latched itself onto you...  
  
**Makoto：**  
But you've been feeling fine, right?  
Or that's how it's seemed to me, at least.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm. Not only are the motive and the method unclear,  
there's no solid evidence as to whether this is just a  
string of coincidences or a real case with a real culprit.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hehe... Hehehehehe!  
Which means we have a proper mystery on our hands, folks!  
And there's no one better equipped to deal with that than me!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Excellent work, oh assistant of mine!  
The opportunity to unravel a great mystery is now upon us!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Or so I'd like to say,  
but now isn't the time for celebration.  
If you feel like you're in danger,  
then we need to handle this as soon as possible.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
To do that, though, we need more information.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
All right!  
Makoto, {player},  
let's get going!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I figured we'd be heading into town, but I didn't expect this.  
Any particular reason that the two of us are tailing him, Kasumi?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
A certain possibility came to mind while he was  
explaining the situation to me, you see.  
  
**Makoto：**  
That being?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Someone—a lady, to be specific—may hold a grudge against him.  
That, or they've become dangerously attached to him.  
  
**Makoto：**  
A grudge?  
Against him?  
You know he ain't that sort of person.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Well, actually... Pretty much all the girls in town are flocking around him.  
It wouldn't be *that* surprising if at least one of them holds a grudge.  
But even still... Hm...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Haha. True enough. He's a pleasant guy, so not many people  
would hold a grudge against him. But that makes the  
idea of someone getting too attached all the more plausible.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
In simpler terms, he must have a stalker.  
That's my train of thought at the moment.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh. Makoto, look.  
He's already being approached by someone.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Stalkers don't usually just walk up to their target, right?  
Oh well, let's see what happens.  
We might just end up with some clues.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Well well, if isn't it {player}.  
Quite the coincidence.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Let me guess.  
My gorgeous good looks attracted you into town, didn't they?  
Hehe.  
Oh, it truly is a sin to be this beautiful.  
  
**Yuki：**  
*sigh* Can you see it?  
My stunning frame, reflected in all the windows around town?  
I just can't get enough of myself!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey, they're a bit too close for comfort, aren't they?  
Is he being seduced or something?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Dammit! You've already got Yui!  
  
**Makoto：**  
A-and me...  
Wait, no. Forget about me!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Calm down.  
It doesn't seem like he's being seduced.  
  
**Io：**  
Oh, hello there. How have you been?  
Are you here to buy some reference books, perhaps?  
  
**Io：**  
...*giggle*  
Look at you with your cowlick.  
Appearances are important, you know.  
Here, I'll fix it for yo—  
Wah!  
  
**Io：**  
S-sorry about that. I tripped over nothing...  
But thank you for catching me.  
  
**Io：**  
Oh... W-we're a bit too close, aren't we? Sorry.  
I really need to be more careful.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Doesn't seem like she's putting him in any danger.  
But I'm not fond of that atmosphere between them.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
No need to be envious. You've got your own special appeal.  
That said, there's something quite peculiar about the charm she exudes.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Men just can't resist a sexy lady, I guess...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Hoppety-hop, hoppety-hop~! ♪  
Oh! Mister!  
  
**Mimi：**  
I'm so happy to see you! Really! ♪  
Hey, can we play?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Well that's a stark difference from the last person.  
Didn't think a kid would approach him.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
They seem rather close.  
It's like I'm watching two siblings interact.  
  
**Kasumi & Makoto：**  
*sigh*  
  
**Makoto：**  
Well, so much for finding the stalker.  
Best we got was an eyeful of him chumming it up with a bunch of girls...  
Ahh, man. I gotta keep this a secret from Yui!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm, true... The only information we got was  
that he's friends with all sorts of girls. And it's hard picking out possible  
suspects when their races and ages are all over the place, too.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Man.  
Wouldn't be surprised if he was friends with every single girl in town.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You know what they say. Great heroes are fond of great pleasures.  
The very same might just apply to him.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Great heroes?  
You mean like the dude on that poster for the upcoming race?  
You're gonna compare him to a hero like that?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You'd be hard pressed to deny it, wouldn't you?  
These carriage races were quite the spectacle in olden times.  
In fact, people all over the continent were invested in them.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That person on the poster was the unquestioned king of said races.  
I'm sure he had all sorts of ladies pining for his attention.  
Much like {player} does right now.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Well, I get where you're coming from.  
But it's still hard to picture him as a hero.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
...*staaaaare*  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm?
