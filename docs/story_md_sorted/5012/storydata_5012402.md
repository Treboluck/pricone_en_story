**Kasumi：**  
The Goddess of Woe is fading away.  
We haven't gotten rid of her completely,  
but things should be good for the time being.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Thank you so much, Kasumi!  
I have no idea how to repay you!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'm the one that should be thanking you, Ayumi. This case would  
have turned into a tragedy if any one of us weren't involved. I'm  
incredibly glad to have met you. To have met a new, dear comrade.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Kasumi...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Now then!  
As I said, we haven't gotten rid of her completely.  
Let's stay on our toes until the very end!
