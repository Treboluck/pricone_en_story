Urgh... I'm beat!  
I really ain't cut out for this sort of slow work.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You don't seem fazed, Ayumi.  
I take it this might be a specialty of yours?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Apparently.  
I guess it makes sense,  
considering I've spent whole days silently watching {player}.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm? Whole *days*, you say?  
I think you're beyond the realm of watching at that point, my friend.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I-I'm pretty sure I shouldn't let that slide, but oh well.  
At least we know who the culprit is now.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Indeed. All thanks to Ayumi.  
Now then! Let's continue our investigation!  
  
**Explanation：**  
The correct answer is \"3. The members of Twilight Caravan chatting.\"  
Based on a scene from Twilight Breakers, where our protagonist is  
heading towards a hot spring with the Twilight Caravan crew.
