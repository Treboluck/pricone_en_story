**Ayumi：**  
U-um, Kasumi. I hear that you're a detective.  
Do you mind if I ask how you go about your work?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
How I go about my work?  
Hm... That's a bit of a tricky question.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Tailing people is a part of it. Take this case, for example.  
We tailed {player}, then used the information  
gathered from that to deduce who was behind it all.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Wait. Was Ayumi even there at that point?  
And what're you staring at?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Waugh?!  
I-I'm not shtaring at anything! I'm clueless!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm...  
Either way, I take it you have an interest in detective work?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
In that case, follow me.  
I'll give you the full experience!
