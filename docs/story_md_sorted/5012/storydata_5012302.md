Sh-she's somehow gotten even stronger.  
I talked the talk to Ayumi, but now I'm shivering in fear...  
I'm so patheti—

**Ayumi：**  
S-sorry!  
I shouldn't have grabbed your hand out of nowhere...  
But, um... I thought it might help you.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Dear me.

You're just as awkward as Makoto, you know that? ♪  
  
**Ayumi：**  
H-holding hands with {player}?!  
That's just too much! In more ways than one!  
I can't even imagine what'd happen to me once our hands made contact!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hehe. Thanks, though.  
I've settled down now.  
Let's clear these mooks out nice and quick!
