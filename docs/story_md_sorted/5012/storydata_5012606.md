**Kasumi：**  
Now then, friends.  
We have all the info we need,  
so let the theories flow. ♪  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Theorizing...!  
Th-that sounds very detective-like!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hm...  
I ain't one for racking my brain.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Don't worry, Makoto.  
There's more to theorizing than that.  
Even the most sudden of  
realizations can close the curtain on seemingly unsolvable cases.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Take how you pointed out the Goddess of Woe's tendency  
to target {player} in busy areas, for example.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ohh. That makes sense.  
Guess I'm down, then!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Atta girl.  
Don't forget. The three of us are working together.  
We've got Ayumi's information, Makoto's intuition, and my brains.  
There's no mystery we can't solve!
