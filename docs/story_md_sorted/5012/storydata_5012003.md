## Subtitle: The Fool
  
**Narration：**  
Ayumi, having fled from Kasumi after witnessing the carriage incident,  
is pondering to herself as she makes her way through town.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
*sigh*  
It's pitch black now.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I'm glad {player} made it through another day, at least.  
All thanks to that beastgirl, Makoto.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
The attacks on him are getting more and more aggressive, though...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Even worse, Kasumi and Makoto still think they're coincidences...  
But that's not the case. I'm always watching him, so I know the truth.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Someone's definitely trying to take his life!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I can't let this go on. Otherwise, he'll...  
But I don't know who the culprit is.  
I can't make a proper case right now...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh?  
What's... what's this odd sensation?  
Something just feels off all of a sudden...  
  
**???：**  
Wow.  
You actually noticed? That's impressive.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Eeek?! Wh-who's there?  
  
**???：**  
Who? Hee hee.  
Good question. What say you take a little guess?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
U-ughhh! Ahhh!  
  
**???：**  
Poor thing. Scared speechless, are we?  
But that's how I like it. You're so innocent and naive,  
like a freshly picked fruit.  
  
**???：**  
As for my name... You can call me the Goddess of Woe.  
Despair and sorrow are my greatest pleasure.  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
I've been watching over that boy for a while now. And what a  
specimen he is. The number of ladies with a vested interest in  
him is just remarkable. You seem to be one of them, too.  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
But what if tragedy him struck out of nowhere?  
Landosol would become a city of utter despair.  
Hee hee. Just the thought of it is exhilarating!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I-I won't... Won't l-let you...  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
Fret not, dear.  
There's not a single thing you can do to stop it.  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
Trust me, I know.  
You remind me of myself, after all.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh?  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
Nothing but a fool that convinced herself she was powerless.  
A being so engulfed in her own self-loathing that she would  
go on to curse herself. That's what you remind me of.  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
So please, do go on being a coward.  
Watch idly as someone dear to you meets their demise.  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
You've got great things in your future.  
Great, terrible things.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
U-urgh... D-don't...!  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
Oh, lovely. That's exactly the expression I was hoping for.  
The face of someone fighting in vain against their own fears.  
It's simply delectable. I can't wait to see even more of it.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Ah... W-wait...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Th-that has to be it... W-without a doubt.  
That's the monster trying to t-take his life!  
I knew something was behind all this!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Th-this is really bad, though.  
I-I need to do something... Anything!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
E-excuse me!  
Makoto, Kasumi! There's something we need to talk about!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey! You're that person from earlier!  
What brings you here so late?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Came to turn yourself in, perhaps?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
M-my name is Ayumi!  
Um, um! Let me tell you about everything that's happening to him!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Him? You mean {player}?  
What's going on with him?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Well, you see...
