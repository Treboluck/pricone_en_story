**Kasumi：**  
Well, that's about everything I have to teach you.  
Good job to both of you!  
How did it feel to experience the life of a detective?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I-I'm exhausted!  
It's not just about the brains. You need lots of stamina, too...  
I never expected it to be this difficult.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Pretty much.  
All that thinking's got me beat.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
It was fun, but I realize more than ever now  
that it's the sort of work only someone like you can do, Kasumi.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hehe. Thanks.  
That's a nice compliment.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Now then. With this newfound knowledge at your disposal,  
let's turn our attention to the final mystery.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sounds good to me.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Yes! Let's do it!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
This is no easy case, but we can solve it together!  
Let's save the Goddess of Woe once and for all!  
  
**Ayumi & Makoto：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Explanation：**  
The correct answer is \"4. Shizuru.\"  
The guild's goal being \"secret\" points towards Labyrinth,  
a secret society formed to uncover the mysteries of the world.
