**Goddess of Woe：**  
Heh. Wonderful work dispatching them.  
Now then. What sort of despair should I inflict upon you ne—  
  
**Ayumi：**  
...Can we stop this?  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
Excuse me?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
You said that you could see the weakness, the darkness in my heart.  
But don't forget. The two of us resemble one another.  
I can say the same for you as well.  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
Silence.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
This isn't what you want, is it?  
It's not despair that you're seeking. It's hope—  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
SHUT UP!  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
You think you can see the darkness in my heart?!  
Then feast your eyes on the full scope of it!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Wh-what incredible power...  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
This is the despair I sought! Darkness that envelops all for eternity!  
If you have the guts to face it, then just go ahead and try!
