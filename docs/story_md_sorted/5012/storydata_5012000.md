## Subtitle: Of Races, Misfortune, and Pursuits
  
**Narration：**  
One fateful day in Landosol,  
{player} finds himself accompanying  
Makoto on one of her patrols of the city.  
  
**Makoto：**  
No problems around here.  
Notice anything fishy on your en—  
Wait, huh?  
  
**Makoto：**  
{player}?!  
Where'd you go?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey! {player}!  
Lemme know where you are!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh! There he is!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Gotcha!{player}  
Sheesh. You're worse than a kid when it comes to getting lost.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Not that I'm angry or anything, but try not to make me worry too much.  
That aside, did you notice something strange?  
  
**Makoto：**  
There's someone you know from work over there?  
Huh. He runs one of the postal services,  
and even builds the carriages used for deliveries himself?  
  
**Makoto：**  
He looks pretty down, though.  
Let's go ask him what's up.  
  
**Owner：**  
Oh. Hey there.  
Been a while since I last saw you...  
  
**Owner：**  
Hm? You want to know what's wrong?  
Well, I'm kind of in a pickle here.  
  
**Owner：**  
The annual carriage race is coming up, you see.  
And I put my heart and soul into making the best carriage I could.  
But then my jockey went and got injured...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Man, that sure does suck...  
  
**Owner：**  
*sigh* The winner gets the title of \"fastest delivery  
carriage in Landosol,\" but so much for that.  
  
**Makoto：**  
That's a pretty, uh, basic title.  
You sure you want to compete for that?  
  
**Owner：**  
Of course I do. It'd work wonders for my image.  
Not just as someone who builds carriages,  
but also as a postal service manager!  
  
**Owner：**  
*sigh* But I don't have a jockey now...  
I want one. I *need* one...!  
  
**Owner：**  
Oh! {player}!  
How about you? You can become my replacement jockey!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh?  
Hey now. That's a bit too out of nowhere, don't you think?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Listen.  
I get that you're in a tough spot here,  
but he's got his own business and stuff to take care of.  
  
**Makoto：**  
What? You don't?!  
Does that mean you're gonna help him out?  
  
**Owner：**  
I'm begging you here, {player}!  
Oh! There's also an bonus prize!  
You can have that if you win!  
  
**Owner：**  
The prize varies every year,  
but I've heard talk about what they've got planned this time around.  
Apparently you'll get enough food to last you a whole year!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Whoa, now that sounds good!  
How about you give it a shot, then, {player}?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Don't worry.  
I'll be right there for ya, just in case anything happens.  
Like I always am.  
  
**Owner：**  
You'll do it? Really?  
Woo! Thanks so much! I'm counting on you!  
  
**Owner：**  
Oh yeah. You need both a main and partner jockey for the race,  
but you two should manage no problem.  
Can't wait to see how you both perform!  
  
**Makoto：**  
A partner jockey?  
Wait. Am I being roped into this as well?  
  
**Owner：**  
You sure are!  
Two lovebirds racing along in a carriage sounds great, doesn't it?  
  
**Makoto：**  
L-lovebirds?!  
N-no way, man!  
He's already got Yui...  
Well, err, she isn't his girlfriend yet either, but still...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Anyway, I'm on security duty during the race!  
No way I can do both at the same time.  
Sorry about that, {player}.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hm....  
Can't really think of a replacement.  
I'd say Yui, but she's been real busy these days...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh?  
Whoa! Incoming from above!  
Watch out, {player}!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Holy...! Where'd that vase come from?!  
  
**Man：**  
Sorry about that! It came from the second floor.  
The wind must have blown it off the ledge, I guess.  
You two okay?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yeah, we're fine.  
{player} almost had his skull cracked open, though.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hm? What's up, {player}?  
You look pretty out of it.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Stuff like this has been happening pretty frequently.  
**Choice: (2)**  That was even closer than last time.  
`Tag 1`  
**Makoto：**  
Stuff like this?  
Are vases falling onto you regularly or something?  
  
**Makoto：**  
That's definitely not normal, y'know.  
Most people don't even experience that once in a lifetime,  
much less multiple times.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Makoto：**  
Last time?  
What happened then?  
Huh. You were trying out a sword at a weapon shop,  
but then it slipped out of its sheathe and almost hit you?  
  
**Makoto：**  
That's probably just a coincidence...  
Except, well, the same could be said about that vase just now.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Makoto：**  
Man.  
I knew I hadn't seen you recently,  
but I had no idea things were so bad.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Why didn't you tell any of us sooner?!  
If anything were to happen to you, I...  
Err. I-I mean, Yui would be devastated!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Either way, no way I'm leaving you alone after hearing that.  
Got any clue about what's going on?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh?  
No idea?  
U-uhh... That makes things complicated.  
I'm no good with these mystery-like scenari—  
  
**Makoto：**  
Mystery-like, huh?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Aight. I've got a great idea.  
If we're talking mysteries, then who better to call  
than Caon's very own ace detective!  
  
**Makoto：**  
{player}. Let's head over to Caon's guildhouse.  
She'll blow this mystery wide open the second she gets involved.  
No doubt about it.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
...*staaaaare*
