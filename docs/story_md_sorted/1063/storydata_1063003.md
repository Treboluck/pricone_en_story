## Subtitle: Harvest Festival
  
**Narration：**  
Arisa and {player} have planned to meet on the outskirts of Landosol.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Good morning, {player}!  
What's the plan for today?  
  
**Arisa：**  
Ideally we'll finally find Losa—  
Wait, {player}?!  
Wh-why're you grabbing my hand out of the blue?!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Wh-whoa!  
No need to drag me along!  
  
**Arisa：**  
*huff, huff*  
That sure was a surprise...  
My heart's still racing.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Hm?  
The atmosphere around here seems a bit... different?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  They're holding a harvest festival.  
`Tag 1`  
**Arisa：**  
Really?!  
Wow. This is the biggest harvest festival I've ever seen.  
Anything goes in Landosol, huh?  
  
**Arisa：**  
Hey, wait!  
Is *this* why you arranged for us to meet today?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You've been working hard, so yeah.  
**Choice: (3)**  I was hoping we could make the most of it together.  
`Tag 2`  
**Arisa：**  
Y-you think?  
I haven't been doing anything that special...  
But, well. Hearing it from you makes me happy.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Arisa：**  
H-huh?!  
Together?!  
W-Wow... That *does* make me happy, but...  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Arisa：**  
Well. Thanks, {player}.  
Truth is, not being able to find any leads  
on Losaria has left me feeling pretty down lately.  
  
**Arisa：**  
And I kept blaming myself for it, too.  
Which made me feel even worse.  
But the fact that you brought me here's cheered me up a bit!  
  
**Arisa：**  
I'm sure she'd be upset if she saw me being all sad, too.  
She's super kind like that.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Right!  
No point in being all depressed while I'm here.  
I'm gonna make the most of it!  
  
**Arisa：**  
And hey. I might even find a lead or two  
on Losaria while we're here!  
So yeah, let's get going!  
  
**Arisa：**  
{player}!  
I got us some drinks!  
I'll be right o—Whoa!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Ahaha. Sorry about that.  
I should settle down a bit.  
That said, let's—  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Hey hey. How about joining us for some drinks?  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Yeah! It'll be a load of fun!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Ahaha.  
Look at Mr. Popular over here.  
I get it, though, considering how kind you are.  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Wew! ♪ Make room for the lovebirds, ladies.  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Sorry. We didn't mean to interrupt you two. ♪  
  
**Arisa：**  
L-lovebirds?!  
No, no! You've got it all wrong!  
  
**Arisa：**  
And off they go...  
Th-that got a bit weird, didn't it?  
  
**Arisa：**  
S-sorry.  
They made the effort to come speak to you,  
but I kind of ruined the mood...  
  
**Arisa：**  
If anything, you'd be better off  
spending time with pretty girls like tha—  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Let's toast.  
`Tag 5`  
**Arisa：**  
Oh...  
You're really too kind for your own good.  
Sometimes it kinda catches me off guard.  
  
**Arisa：**  
A-anyway!  
Let's toast!  
One, two, three! Cheers!  
  
**MC：**  
Gather up, everyone!  
The beauty pageant's about to start!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Hm?  
Hey, {player}.  
What's a beauty pageant?  
  
**Arisa：**  
Ohhh. So they determine who's the prettiest?  
Honestly, there's probably a ton  
of pretty people here considering how big Landosol is.

**Arisa：**

Doo-bee-doo...  
  
**MC：**  
It's just plain old humming!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Because I plain can't sing!  
  
**MC：**  
Now then! It's time to strut your stuff!  
Show us one of your specialties!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Urgh, this just keeps getting worse...  
Why did he have to pick me?!

Shut yer trap, will ya?!  
Or maybe we'll shut it for ya!  
  
**Arisa：**

I told you to quit it already!  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Grugh! The heck?! She ain't no pushover!  
  
**Arisa：**  
If you two want to be selfish and ruin things for everyone else,  
then I'll make sure you regret it!  
  
**MC：**  
S-simply incredible, folks!  
She's practically running circles around them!  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Amazing! Keep it up, Arisa!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
You're so cool! Knock 'em out!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Down you go!  
  
**Ruffians：**  
Waaaggghhh!  
  
**MC：**  
Well, folks! There we have it!  
Give it up for Arisa, winner of this year's annual beauty pageant!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Huh?  
I-I won?!  
*Me*?!  
  
**Woman 1：**  
That was awesome! You were so cool!  
  
**Arisa：**  
N-not at all!  
The two of you were much more impressive!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
We couldn't dream of pulling off what you did!  
Cute and strong. You're basically perfect!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Th-that's not true at all...  
I'm not that strong, and I'm definitely not cute...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Congrats.  
`Tag 6`  
**Arisa：**  
Thanks!  
Ehehe.  
I'm still a bit flustered, but also really happy.  
  
**Arisa：**  
It's all thanks to you.  
I never would have found the courage  
if I didn't know you were watching.  
  
**Arisa：**  
So thank you, {player}.  
That said, the festival's still going on.  
And there's plenty I wanna see, too!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus the festival went on,  
becoming a night that Arisa would never forget.
