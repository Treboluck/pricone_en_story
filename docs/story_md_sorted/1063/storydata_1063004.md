**Narration：**  
{player} bumps into Arisa  
on his way home from Lucent Academy.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Oh, hey, {player}!  
What were you up to?  
  
**Arisa：**  
You were at school?  
Oh, that's cool.  
Was it fun?  
  
**Arisa：**  
It was? Nice!  
Truth is, I've never been to school.  
But it seems like a pretty fun place!  
  
**Arisa：**  
School, huh...  
  
**Arisa：**  
Oh. Sorry about that!  
Got kind of wrapped up in my thoughts there.  
Mainly about the idea of going to school with you.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Seems like it'd be fun.Really fun, even!  
...  
Then again, though.  
Don't you need to spend the whooole day there?  
  
**Arisa：**  
I don't really have the time for that.  
Not when I need to find Losaria.  
So yeah. Kind of a shame, but oh we—  
  
**Arisa：**  
Hey...  
Wh-what's with this light?!  
It's so bright!

**???：**  
Outta the way, outta the way!  
I'm running late here!  
  
**???：**  
H-hey, you! Watch out!  
I'm gonna bump into— Eeek!  
  
**???：**  
Owww... Sorry. I couldn't stop myself in time.  
You're not hurt or anything, are you?  
  
**???：**  
Hm? What've you got your eyes on?  
  
**???：**  
Wait a minute! You're checking out my underwear, aren't you?!  
Keep your eyes up here, you pervo!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm innocent.  
**Choice: (2)**  Beary nice choice.  
`Tag 1`  
**???：**  
Urgh...  
I-I mean, I *am* to blame for running  
full speed right into you...

`Tag 2`  
**???：**  
I-I knew it!  
And you've got the nerve to judge me, too!  
Sorry for thinking the bear design is cute!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**???：**  
Wait, forget that!  
I gotta get going!  
I'll never hear the end of it if I'm late on my first day!  
  
**Io：**  
Good morning, everyone.  
Today we have a little surprise  
in the form of a transfer student.  
  
**Io：**  
Come on in, Arisa.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Good to meet you all!  
My name's Arisa.  
I'm looking forward to getting to kn—  
  
**Arisa：**  
Hey, it's you! The guy I just had a run-in with!  
  
**Io：**  
Oh, you know {player}?  
Let's have you sit beside him, then.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Huh?! W-we're not really acquainted!  
If anything, we just met today.  
And then he saw my underwear...  
  
**Io：**  
Y-your underwear?!  
Explain yourself, {player}!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Oh, he didn't do anything wrong!  
If anything, it's my fault that  
he got a big, long look up my skirt...  
  
**Io：**  
E-excuse me?  
Okay, you two. To the teachers' lounge. Right now!  
  
**Io：**  
Be careful from here on out, you hear?  
And no more rushing to school.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Y-yes. I'm sorry.  
It won't happen again...  
  
**Arisa：**  
*sigh* My first day and I've already gotten a scolding...  
And it's all your fault, too!  
Well. Half of it is mine, I guess.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Wait. We gotta hurry back!  
Let's see... Next up is gym class.  
Let's get going!

**Arisa：**  
Owww! That one hurt.  
Why'd you have to rush over at the same time?  
  
**Arisa：**  
Hm...? H-  
hey! Hands off!  
I-I don't want any guys touching me around there...!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'm innocent.  
**Choice: (5)**  You can't touch what isn't there.  
`Tag 4`  
**Arisa：**  
Urgh...  
Y-you definitely didn't do it on purpose, at least...  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Arisa：**  
E-ex*cuse* me?  
There's absolutely, positively, most certainly something there!  
It's just fleeting and subtle, a small bud full of dreams...  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Arisa：**  
Well, that sure was a day. But it was fun!  
And it might all be thanks to you... Heh!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Sorry for all the trouble.  
But honestly? School seems like it'll be enjoyable with you around.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Hey. How does the two of us becoming friends sound?  
Can't guarantee I won't cause more trouble for you, though.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I'd love to!  
`Tag 7`  
**Arisa：**  
Really?! Whew!  
Here's to a bright friendship, then!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Zzz... Mmm...  
  
**Io：**  
Dozing off on her first day, I see.  
Wake her up for me, will you, {player}?  
  
**Arisa：**  
Mmm...  
What's the matter, {player}?  
Gimme five more... minutes...  
  
**Arisa：**  
Ah!  
When did I fall asleep?  
  
**Arisa：**  
I'm still super tired, though...  
Feels like I'm gonna... fall asleep any second...  
Zzz...

**Ameth：**  
And there we have it. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Think of what you just saw as a dream of sorts.  
Chances are you'll forget everything the second you wake up,  
so no need to brood over it too much.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Or well.  
It'd be more accurate to call it a dream of events that never were.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Normally I weave together fragments of both yours and  
someone else's memories, recreating events  
in the form of a dream.  
  
**Ameth：**  
This one, though? I made it from scratch. ☆  
  
**Ameth：**  
Might have been worth spicing it up a bit, though.  
Like, what if there was suddenly a maid robot at your house?  
Or a saucy alien? Something along those lines.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'll come up with something cool next time.  
As for now, though. Catch you later. ♪

**Arisa：**  
...  
Huh? When did I fall asleep?  
I-I'm so sorry! That's the first time  
this has ever happened! I swear!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Something tells me I was having a nice dream, though.  
  
**Arisa：**  
I've forgotten most of it at this point,  
but I think the two of us  
were at the same school in it...  
  
**Arisa：**  
Hehe. Weird how a dream can feel so fun.  
Hopefully I'll have another one like it again.  
  
**Narration：**  
The smile on Arisa's face got {player}  
thinking about how fun school life would be together with her.
