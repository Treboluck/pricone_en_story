**Narration：**  
{player}, seeking sustenance,  
enters a restaurant, only to be greeted by none other than Arisa.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Welcome!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Oh, hey, {player}!  
Didn't expect to see you here!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Hm? Me?  
I'm working!  
Ehehe. This is a happy coincidence.  
  
**Arisa：**  
This is actually my first day here,  
so I was a bit nervous.  
But if you're here, then—  
  
**Arisa：**  
...?!  
I-I know this light!  
It's the same as last time!  
  

---  
  
**Arisa：**  
Ahh, man.  
I always get nervous right before work...  
  
**Arisa：**  
I chose this job because the outfit's super cute,  
but working as a waitress might not be for me...  
Moreso when it's not a standard cafe, either.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Wait. That's {player} over there!  
Th-this is bad. I don't want him finding out,  
but I can't just outright ignore him...  
  
**Arisa：**  
Okay. I'll say hi, then scuttle off quick!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Hey, {player}! This sure is a coincidence!  
I guess you're doing some shopping?  
  
**Arisa：**  
You're on a stroll?  
Really now. You should be hitting the books  
after how badly you said you did on those last tests.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Me? I, err...  
I'm on my way to work.  
I started working as a waitress at a cafe not that long ago.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Wh-where is it?  
It's, uh, by the station... That's all you need to know!  
  
**???：**  
Oh. Hey there, Arisa!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Oh! H-Hi!  
Let me introduce you, {player}.  
She works at the same cafe as me—  
  
**Waitress：**  
Hey there!  
Let me guess.  
You're Arisa's boyfriend, aren't you?  
  
**Arisa：**  
B-boyfriend?!  
Absolutely not!  
  
**Waitress：**  
Well then.  
Is he your special Master?  
  
**Arisa：**  
That's even worse!  
He's, uhh... J-just a friend!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's this about masters?  
**Choice: (2)**  Please refer to me as \"my lord.\"  
`Tag 1`  
**Arisa：**  
Huh?  
E-err, uhh...  
Nothing! Just forget about it!

`Tag 2`  
**Arisa：**  
My... lord? What's the deal with that?  
Don't tell me you actually enjoy being referred to like that.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Waitress：**  
Oh, you didn't know?  
Heehee. You know that cafe we both work at?  
  
**Waitress：**  
It's actually a maid cafe. ♪  
  
**Arisa：**  
Hey!  
I was trying to keep that a secret...!  
  
**Waitress：**  
No need to be shy, my girl!  
If anything, you're super cute in your uniform.  
  
**Waitress：**  
Speaking of which!  
How does bringing him along  
to help with your training sound?  
  
**Arisa：**  
What?!  
  
**Waitress：**  
I respect your hustle, but that shy side of yours  
has been kind of making it a struggle for you to improve.  
  
**Arisa：**  
O-oh, what a shame!  
{player}'s just so, so busy right now!  
Right?!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Nope.  
**Choice: (5)**  Sure am.  
`Tag 4`  
**Arisa：**  
Oh...  
Honestly. You *really* don't know how to lie, do you?  
Least you could do is read the mood, though!

**Waitress：**  
Oh, really?  
What're you busy with?  
  
**Waitress：**  
Busy wasting time?  
Hehe! ♪  
Sounds like it'll be worth wasting some on Arisa, to me.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Waitress：**  
That's that!  
Let's make our merry way, you two!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Wh-what'd I do to deserve this?!

Oh, come on! Don't give me that look!

Y-you mean it?!  
Not that I care if you praise me or not!

And there we have it.  
Did you enjoy that? I bet you did!  
How could you not enjoy Arisa in a maid uniform?!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Just the idea of it makes me all tingly. ♪  
  
**Ameth：**  
Little sister maid Arisa. Tsundere maid Arisa.  
Both good, but also consider: refined maid Arisa.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Which one suits your tastes?  
Go ahead and give her a little request when you wake up.  
Who knows? She might just agree to it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hehe. Jokes aside, I should let you wake up soon.  
Catch you later. ♪

I had another one of those weird dreams, too.  
I was working in something called a maid cafe...
