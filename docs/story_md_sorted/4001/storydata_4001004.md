# Guildhouse Episode 4
The Gourmet Guild is rescued by Nebbia, who was sealed on the third floor. She explains that the mist is from \"Lake Illusion,\" and that the house is a facility for guide fairies like her. Nebbia then declares that she's staying put.
  
## Subtitle: Third Floor Resident
  
**Karyl：**  
Mmnhhh...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*gasp*  
Miss Karyl, how long have you been there?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
P-please, help us.  
We must bring Miss Pecorine  
back to her senses!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I believe it is this strange mist  
that is causing her confusion.  
Could you use your magic to do something—  
Eek!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahahahah!  
Die, die, die!  
I was gonna have to slaughter all of you anyway!  
  
**Karyl：**  
It was just a matter of time!  
Now die!  
All of you, *die*! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
O-oh no!  
Miss Karyl, you're not in your right mind either.  
Please, stop firing off offensive magic!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*Nothing* makes sense to me anymore—  
  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Huh?  
My lord?  
Why are you picking me up in your arms?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
M-my lord, have you also lost your mind?  
You mustn't!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please, my lord,  
I need you to remain... the kind-hearted,  
dependable person that I love!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*sniff*  
Huh? What is it, my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see...  
It's dangerous, so you want us to retreat for now.  
Is that why you picked me up?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes?  
Indeed... you are right.  
You and I remain our usual selves.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This strange mist does not seem to affect us.  
Why is that?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*Your* existence is special,  
so I can understand how you would be an exception...  
But why me?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Is it Lady Ameth's protection?  
Am I being rewarded for my faith?  
  
**???：**  
Ameth, huh?  
Is that what she's calling herself these days?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*gasp* My lord?  
There appears to be a tiny and adorable person  
standing on your shoulder.  
  
**???：**  
\"Adorable?\"  
Thank you for the compliment!  
*giggle* First impressions really do matter!  
  
**???：**  
You seem like a real nice girl.  
I think I see why Fio dotes on you. ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Fi... Fio?  
  
**???：**  
Hmm... She calls herself \"Ameth\" now, right?  
That's the name of the prototype we guide fairies are based on.  
Although, I did hear that prototype was scrapped as a failure.  
  
**???：**  
So she extracted its data, merged with it,  
and used it to enhance herself.  
Is that it?  
  
**???：**  
She's always been good with those kinds of intricate things!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Err...?  
  
**???：**  
Oh, I'm sorry!  
It's a bad habit of mine to chatter on like that.  
  
**???：**  
Always a one-way street with me.  
Ahaha!  
But don't hate me for being a little full of myself, okay?  
Fairies disappear if they're not loved!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Anyways, the name's Nebbia. I'm a guide fairy.  
Who are you people?  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Were you the ones who broke the seal on this room?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Your name is Miss... Nebbia?  
So you're the \"something\" that was sealed up here.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Right, now isn't the time for pleasantries.  
Miss Pecorine and Miss Karyl are—  
H-huh?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Zzz... zzz...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Zzz... zzz...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
They... seem to be asleep.  
Did you do this, Miss Nebbia?  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Yep.  
I temporarily froze their accounts  
using my privileges as a guide fairy.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Although, with everything so messed up,  
and with my limited privileges...  
I'd say they'll probably wake up soon enough.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
By the way... you're {player}, right?  
Do you remember me?  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Fill me in on everything.  
I've been caged like a bird all this time,  
and I can't make heads or tails of what's going on!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It is we who \"cannot make heads or tails” of any of this...  
Is she another acquaintance of yours, my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wh-what shall we do?  
I am entirely lost as to what is going on.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Shall we begin by carrying the others to safety?  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Oh, they're fine where they are.  
When I got sealed up here,  
the nearby \"Mist of Lake Illusion\" got trapped with me.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Your friends have only gone temporarily insane  
from coming into contact with it.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
I'll clean up the mist.  
They should regain their senses once they wake up.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
What I want to know is what's happening to this world./5065/  
Where on earth did Fio run off to?  
I've got so many questions, I'm about to burst!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Err...?  
  
**Karin：**  
Hello?  
Are you all okay?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karin!  
It's dangerous here.  
Please remain downstairs.  
  
**Karin：**  
Well, but I heard screaming.  
Wh-what exactly is going on?  
  
**Karin：**  
Eeek!  
Th-there’s some sort of tiny creature in here!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Call me Nebbia!  
Hmm, I see..  
So you're the caretaker of this building?  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Sorry for squatting here all this time without paying rent.  
But it's really not my fault.  
All I did was misbehave a little, and I got locked up here.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
This place is sort of a correctional facility for us guide fairies.  
We sometimes glitch out, and then we're placed here  
temporarily in quarantine until we get repaired.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Well, it's supposed to be \"temporary.\"  
I was just abandoned here,  
and I nearly died of boredom.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
I felt Fio's presence downstairs,  
but no matter how many times I called,  
she just ignored me.  
  
**Karin：**  
Fio?  
I'm afraid I don't recognize that name.  
  
**Karin：**  
But it appears whatever was sealed downstairs  
has since departed, using a teleportation circle.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Is that so...  
Then she should have taken me with her.  
Was she that desperate to get away?  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Hold on.  
Don't tell me she forgot about me.  
That little...  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Well, whatever!  
I'm in a real good mood now that I'm finally free!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Right now, I'd be willing to forgive everything  
or grant any wish. ♪  
  
**Karin：**  
Wish?  
Well, for starters,it would be helpful  
if you could explain who you are.  
  
**Karin：**  
Also, it would also be nice if we could use the third floor normally?  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Sure, why not?  
It's not like this house belongs to me.  
Just do what you want.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
And I'll do the same!  
I'm gonna enjoy my newfound freedom to the fullest! ♪  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Hey, {player}!  
How about you show me around?  
  
**Nebbia：**  
The whole world has changed, from the looks of it.  
I'm just a little lost babe in the woods!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
In fact, mind if I live here with you guys for a while?  
I don't have anywhere else to go.  
Staying here would be a load off my mind. ♪  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Besides, you all seem to have some kind of connection to Fio...  
  
**Nebbia：**  
If I stick around, I might just run into her again.  
So... please?  
I won't cause any trouble.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see...  
It truly is a one-way street with you, Miss Nebbia.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What should we do?  
After all, we are only renting this house.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We shall leave the decision to you,  
Miss Karin from the Guild Association.  
  
**Karin：**  
Huh?  
Hmm...  
Well, I don't see any real problem  
with letting a fairy live here.  
  
**Karin：**  
In exchange, please explain your situation to us...  
and who you are  
exactly.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Sure, done deal!  
Thanks for taking me in,  
umm...  
Karin?  
  
**Nebbia：**  
It's good luck to have a fairy living in your house!  
You won't regret that you found me!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Well, it's a pleasure!  
Looking forward to getting to know you better, housemates! ♪
