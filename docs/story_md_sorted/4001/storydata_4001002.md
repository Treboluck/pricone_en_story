# Guildhouse Episode 2
Kokkoro hears odd sounds coming from the second floor. The group investigates, but whatever was sealed there is long gone. The sounds appear to be from the third floor, but for now, a new floor has been reclaimed.
  
## Subtitle: Sealed Second Floor
  
**Narration：**  
A while has passed since {player} and his companions  
moved into the guildhouse.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It still bothers me.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? What does?  
I-I'm not plotting anything!  
I'm just one of your guild pals, right, Koro?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*sigh*  
I'm sorry, Miss Karyl. I know I've said this many times before,  
but can you stop calling me \"Koro?\"  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
These days, my lord has started copying you  
and is calling me \"Koro\" as well.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I want him to refer to me as \"Kokkoro,\"  
his voice gentle and full of love. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aren't we getting a bit off-topic?  
What's bothering you, Kokkoro?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well, we elvenfolk are gifted with exceptional hearing.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And I seem to hear a disturbing sound coming from upstairs.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Like that of a growling beast...  
Am I imagining things?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm...  
If it's bothering you, wanna go check?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What? Karyl, you shouldn't!  
Didn't Karin from the Guild Association  
say that the upper floors are off limits?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm...  
That lady also seems to be hiding something  
and I gotta say it's bothering me.  
  
**Karyl：**  
She's more than happy to accommodate us with everything else,  
but, for some reason, she's totally against us going upstairs.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Something's definitely going on.  
Let's go upstairs  
and investigate.  
  
**Karyl：**  
If nothing's wrong up there,  
we could use the second floor as a hangout area too.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Since the first floor is starting to get crowded,  
wouldn't it be convenient to use the second floor as well?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Of course it would.  
But we've got to get permission from Karin first.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If we break the rules,  
we could get kicked out of this guildhouse.  
  
**Karyl：**  
We're just gonna check it out.  
I'm sure she'll forgive us if we apologize later.  
Karin seems like a nice lady, after all.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's why we *shouldn’t* make trouble for her.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's fine!  
I'll take responsibility.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Karin just so happens to be out on a shopping run right now.  
Let's use this opportunity to clear up any suspicions.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Truth is, I can sense some disturbing magic coming from upstairs...  
It's making me restless and uneasy.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I just can't stand not knowing every nook and cranny  
of my territory.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm?  
There's a pretty powerful seal on the stairs  
leading to the second floor.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But, you know, breaking a seal of this level  
is just a walk in the park for me!  
Hmhmhmmm... ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, Karyl!  
I told you, you shouldn't do that!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Personally, I think we should let her.  
After all, there seems to be  
some terrifying conspiracy surrounding my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Nay.  
Perhaps I should call it  
the fate he is destined to carry.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That is why we must nip any potential threat in the bud.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It will be too late for regrets  
once fate has already taken him from me.  
That is what I believe.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl, I will assist you in breaking the seal.  
Despite my appearance, I am very dexterous.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, *you too*, Kokkoro?  
Mmm...  
Would it be heartless of me  
to be the only one not getting their hands dirty?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
After all, we're all guildmates. We're in this together.  
Wh-what do you think, {player}?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
To be honest, I *am* curious about the upper floors.  
Should we help Karyl and—  
Eep!  
  
**Karin：**  
Hello, everyone!  
And what might you be up to?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Eeek, Karin?  
You're back!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I-it's not what it looks like!  
We just heard a strange sound coming from upstairs,  
and we got curious!  
  
**Karin：**  
Hehe.  
Well, it's natural to be curious, but try to avoid acting on your own.  
  
**Karin：**  
At the very least, please consult me first.  
It's not like I'm going to be upset...  
because I understand how you feel.  
  
**Karin：**  
I was under pressure from my boss,  
so I couldn't give you a detailed explanation...  
but the upper floors are a little dangerous.  
  
**Karin：**  
For starters, this building didn’t even have an owner  
and it was an abandoned property.  
  
**Karin：**  
That's why, fortunately, the government requisitioned it  
and gifted it to the Guild Association.  
  
**Karin：**  
By the way,  
the seal on the stairs leading to the upper floors  
was already there when we took over as management.  
  
**Karin：**  
To be honest, we're not even sure what the seal is for,  
or what's hidden on the upper floors.  
  
**Karin：**  
As long as you don't touch the seal, though,  
there shouldn't be any problem.  
  
**Karin：**  
Hehe.  
And actually, since it was a somewhat suspicious property,  
we decided to lend it to a dubious guild like your own.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Right, I thought the place seemed a little too grand...  
So it *was* one of those houses with a shady history.  
If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is, right?  
  
**Karin：**  
Hehe.  
I'm sorry I kept quiet about this.  
I should've explained properly from the start.  
  
**Karin：**  
It's just that I wasn't sure if you could be trusted.  
  
**Karin：**  
I was planning to tell you when the timing was right.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's not your fault! You're a civil servant, after all.  
You can't go against your boss and the government.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm more than grateful that you gave us  
a proper explanation just now.  
  
**Karin：**  
Thank you for your understanding!  
So, umm... Sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you  
not to touch the seal.  
  
**Karin：**  
After all, there's a chance that a vicious monster  
is sealed within.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, sorry. Too late.  
I already  
popped off the seal a while ago.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wha—? That was fast!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Be careful, Karyl!  
A dangerous monster might jump out at you!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm?  
No monster from the looks of it.  
  
**Karyl：**  
In fact, there's nothing of note here on the second floor.  
It's totally empty.  
  
**Karin：**  
What? That can't be...  
Please, let me take a look!  
  
**Karin：**  
You're right...  
It's dirty and worn with age,  
but otherwise it's just a vacant room.  
  
**Karin：**  
Of course, there's no vicious monster  
sealed up here either.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh?  
Then why was it sealed off?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hm...  
Look at this.  
There's a magic circle drawn on this wall.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm?  
This is a teleportation circle.  
It instantly transports you somewhere far away.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It was banned by international treaty  
after it was deemed too dangerous if militarized.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm...  
It's not working. Looks like it was meant for a single use.  
It's been used already, so the circuit's fried.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It won't activate, even if I pour magic into it.  
And who knows where it connects to...  
It's basically graffiti now.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see.  
The monster, or whatever was sealed here,  
used this teleportation magic to escape... or so I can deduce.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This place shows signs of being lived in.  
We can be certain \"something\" was here,  
but it probably left long ago.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm. Well, that was disappointing.  
Poor ol' Guild Association.  
All this time, they were trembling in fear over an empty box.  
  
**Karin：**  
Hehe.  
Well, as long as there's no dangerous monster,  
then that's fine by me.  
  
**Karin：**  
From the looks of it, if we do some repairs here and there,  
we'll be able to use it as a regular room.  
  
**Karin：**  
I'll have a contractor come by and work on it.  
We'll make this floor just as usable as downstairs.  
  
**Karin：**  
As an apology for the worry we caused you,  
the Guild Association will cover all construction costs.  
  
**Karyl：**  
My, how generous!  
Yup, bye-bye worries, and hello second floor!  
All's well that ends well, as they say. Happily ever after! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You know, I've been wondering...  
If the second floor was empty,  
then why did we hear strange sounds coming from upstairs?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...The third floor, huh.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Look, there's a seal on the stairs to the third floor as well.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This, along with the noise we heard,  
means that the third floor is unlikely to be empty.  
  
**Karyl：**  
In other words, there's a good chance *something* like  
what was sealed here, is still living on the third floor.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm. Whatever's sealed on the third floor  
is similar to or worse  
than what was here...  
  
**Karyl：**  
This could be bad.  
Teleportation is a highly advanced and forbidden magic.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Being able to draw a magic circle  
means that it may be an intelligent and powerful monster.  
  
**Karyl：**  
One that, if provoked,  
could easily destroy a small village.  
  
**Karyl：**  
We'd better not carelessly tamper  
with the seal to the third floor.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It bothers me though...  
What on earth is sealed away in this guildhouse?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I can't go back to business as usual  
now that I know some unknown creature is lurking above us.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, I'd like to properly investigate the third floor one day.  
Of course, we'll ask Karin for permission when we do.  
  
**Karyl：**  
This guildhouse is starting to feel pretty cozy,  
so it's not like I wanna break the rules and get us evicted.
