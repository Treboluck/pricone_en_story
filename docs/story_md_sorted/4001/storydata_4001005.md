**Karyl：**  
Uuuh... Ahhh!  
My head is still pounding. And I feel like throwing up.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Argh!  
I can't believe I was done in by some cheap parlor trick!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
You shouldn't be too hard on yourself.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
According to Miss Karin's research,  
the strange mist we encountered on the third floor  
only forms around Lake Illusion.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
No matter how powerful the magician,  
how trained the warrior,  
or how deadly the monster...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This terrifying mist would cause them  
to temporarily lose their senses.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The moment you come into contact with it,  
you begin to see everyone around you as your enemy.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It is a mysterious phenomenon  
for which an antidote has yet to be found.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Why would something like that form  
on the third floor of our guildhouse?  
It doesn't make any sense.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That Nebbia fairy and her explanation  
don't make much sense either.  
  
**Karyl：**  
By the way, I'm sorry.  
Koro, and you too, {player}.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That mist made me lose my mind and go crazy.  
Did I hurt either of you?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
No, we are fortunately unharmed.  
You need not worry about us.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.You are very kind, Miss Karyl.  
Instinctively, you did not want to hurt us.  
That's why your offensive magic missed its mark, is it not?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?!  
I'm not kind or anything! Don't get the wrong idea!  
  
**Karyl：**  
The only reason my magic missed  
is 'cause my lack of experience!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
Well, we shall leave it at that ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl!  
Kokkoro!  
{player} and, umm... Nebbia, too!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You're all hungry, right?  
It's the perfect time for lunch! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
After using my Royal Equipment at full power,  
I am crazy hungry!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I've made plenty of food,  
so let's stuff our bellies until they're about to burst! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Except you're *always* stuffing your belly.  
Geez, all our guild does is eat.  
At this rate, I'll be as plump as a partridge.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahahah!  
But being plump would make you look even healthier and cuter!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Like your belly flesh—  
it's so squishy and enticing!  
Oh dear, I just wanna sink my teeth into it! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Y-you've regained your senses, right?!  
You're always like this, so I can't tell!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Also, I told you to stop being so touchy-feely!  
Want me to kill you?!  
  
**Karin：**  
Ahaha.  
The Gourmet Guild is always so lively.  
  
**Karin：**  
Let's start the meal or we'll be here all day.  
I helped with the cooking, so there's plenty for all. ♪  
  
**Karin：**  
Please eat before the food gets cold.  
You're welcome to join us, Nebbia. ♪  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Huh?  
Fairies don't actually need to eat.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
But it's not like we lack the function,  
so I guess I'll take you up on your offer.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yup, yup!  
We'll gather around the dining table and grow closer together!  
That's the motto of the Gourmet Guild!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And together, let's satisfy one of the great necessities of life! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh.  
And we’ve also managed to unlock  
all three floors of the guildhouse.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It wasn't the smoothest of journeys,  
but all's well that ends well! ♪  
  
**Karin：**  
Ahaha.  
I feel a little guilty for having put you all  
through so much trouble.  
  
**Karin：**  
But you were true to your word.  
You worked together and solved the problem.  
  
**Karin：**  
It seems your skills are the real deal.  
I'll make a formal request for the Gourmet Guild  
to be recognized as an official guild. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What? You mean we weren’t officially recognized yet?!  
  
**Karin：**  
Indeed.  
If we were to officially recognize every guild under the sun,  
management would be a nightmare.  
  
**Karin：**  
Providing funding for all of them  
would leave the national coffers clean as a whistle.  
  
**Karin：**  
Hehe.  
You see, once you're an officially recognized guild,  
you'll be eligible to receive subsidies.  
  
**Karin：**  
Which means you can expand your activities.  
Let me be the first to congratulate you.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, Karin.  
Did you use our investigation of the upper floors  
as a way to assess if we were fit to be an official guild?  
  
**Karyl：**  
People tend to reveal their true natures  
in the face of adversity.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You wanted to see how we'd react  
when faced with a strange incident,  
or rather, an emergency.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Of course!  
It all makes sense if you view all of it as an assessment  
of our guild.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Besides, there was *something* unnatural about your attitude  
from start to finish!  
  
**Karin：**  
Hehe...  
I'll leave that to your imagination. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah, keep saying that.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, whatever.  
Everything worked out in the end,  
and we got our happy ending.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Let's not think too much  
and just enjoy the delicious food.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Right!  
Well then, let's get ready  
to dig in.  
Bon appétit! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
Shall we eat as well, my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh?  
My lord, are you asleep?  
  
**Karyl：**  
This guy sometimes randomly falls asleep.  
What is he? A baby?  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Hmm? Is this what I think it is?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What is the matter, Miss Nebbia?  
It is bad manners and disrespectful  
to stand atop my lord's head like that.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Aha, I knew it.  
So that's what's going on. Hehe.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Sorry, I'm gonna take a nap as well.  
I don't need any food...  
But save some for {player}, all right?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hm?  
Umm... I'm not quite sure I follow.  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Mmnhhh...  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Fio!  
So you *were* inside {player}'s dreams, after all!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Technically speaking, {player}'s dreams are just a gateway.  
Long time no see, Nebbia.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Sorry.  
I only found out after browsing through  
{player}'s memories...  
  
**Ameth：**  
You were on the floor upstairs, weren't you?  
I really didn't notice.  
Sorry for leaving you behind.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Hmph.  
You've always been so careless, Fio!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Don't call me by that name.  
I go by Ameth these days.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The name of our distant sister...  
or rather, our ancestor.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
The prototype for us guide fairies, right?  
Look. I know I'm hardly one to talk,  
but what made you abandon your post and end up here?  
  
**Nebbia：**  
And on top of that, you're all messed up.  
A-are you okay?  
What the heck happened to you?  
  
**Nebbia：**  
I've been stuck in that prison all this time,  
so I have no idea what's going on.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ahaha.  
I'd say you were fortunate to be in isolation.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Listen, Nebbia.  
My arrogant, foolish, and adorable little sister...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Right now, this world  
of Astrum  
is facing an unprecedented disaster.  
  
**Ameth：**  
We must help the innocent players  
caught up in this disaster  
to return to their own worlds.  
  
**Ameth：**  
No.  
We must *guide* them,  
as guide fairies.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
What're you talking about?  
Y-you're clearly overestimating what I'm capable of.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
I'm a defective failure.  
That's why I was never given any important role.  
All I ever did was stir up mischief in retaliation.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You're far from defective.  
You're the latest model,  
and you just haven't been fully debugged yet.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Have confidence in yourself.  
You're newer than the rest of us,  
which makes you an excellent guide fairy.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Wh-what?  
It's too late to start playing the \"big sis\" card.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Nebbia.  
Come here.  
Let me give you a hug.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Whaaa?!  
Wh-what's going on with you?  
Are you glitching out or something?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ahaha!  
Maybe I am.  
Ah... So warm.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Strange, isn't it, Nebbia?  
We were never programmed to experience happiness,  
or the warmth of another.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But I was given these things.  
I was given the same emotions, sentience,  
and life that humans possess.  
  
**Ameth：**  
{player} and the others gave it to me...  
So I'm returning the favor.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Nebbia.  
I'd like to think that someday you'll receive the same gifts.  
  
**Ameth：**  
If the legends of Astrum are true,  
that whoever reaches this place,  
the top of the Tower of Sol,  
can have any wish granted...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Then that would be my wish.  
...Take care of {player} and the others for me, Nebbia.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But be careful.  
There exists a powerful barrier.  
If you leave the guildhouse...  
  
**Ameth：**  
You will also be \"reconstructed,\"  
contaminated by the current world,  
and forget many things.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So stay in the guildhouse and don't step outside.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You'll be fine.  
I doubt you'll get lonely or bored.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It would seem that this guild {player} has joined  
is insanely lively.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Someday, I too would like to take part  
in such lively and happy daily life.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I want to be there with everyone,  
not just in dreams, but in reality.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'll work hard, dreaming of such days.  
You do your best, too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm glad I got to see you.  
No...  
I'm glad that you’ve always been there,  
Nebbia.
