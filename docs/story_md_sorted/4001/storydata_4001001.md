# Guildhouse Episode 1
The Gourmet Guild is welcomed to their very own guildhouse by Karin of the Guild Association, who informs them that she will remain on site. They learn that the upper floors are \"under investigation\" and thus off-limits.
  
## Subtitle: Welcome to Your New Guildhouse
  
**Pecorine：**  
We're here! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*This* is the Gourmet Guild's guildhouse!  
How crazy is that?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
H-hold on a second!  
Quit dragging us around and explain things properly!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're always like this!  
Geez!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha. ♪  
I love that we're close enough  
  
to use endearing terms like \"always.\" ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It makes me so happy,  
Karyl! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, cut it out! Let go of me!  
And quit grabbing my tail for no reason!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Seriously,  
what the heck is wrong with you?  
Want me to kill you?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You two certainly get along well.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, yes. When establishing a guild,  
you are given a guildhouse to use as your base...  
or so I've heard.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This property is excellently located only a few minutes walk  
from Landosol's shopping district.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It also appears to be quite an impressive building.  
I feel as if it's somewhat too grand  
to be given to us as a base...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Especially considering that our guild is, frankly, still quite unknown.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Plus, land's supposed to be  
ridiculously expensive in Landosol.  
As rotten as it is, it's still the capital.  
  
**Karyl：**  
There's *something* shady about all of this.  
Oh well, guess it's got nothing to do with me!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But of course it does!  
You're part of our Gourmet Guild!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Look, I don't recall ever signing up  
for your stupid guild!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You can't just suddenly decide to start a guild  
and write me down as a member without my permission!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well...  
You know, here in Landosol,  
it's more convenient to be part of a guild.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Like, there are guild-exclusive fine dining restaurants.  
Generally, you're limited in what you can do alone.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So let's help, support, and love each other!  
That's what our guild is for!  
We're gonna be the best of friends! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
I told you to quit grabbing my tail!  
You're making me weak in the knees!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
How heartwarming.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, you and I have no connections here in Landosol,  
so belonging to a guild is more than we could hope for.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Besides, the Gourmet Guild's objective  
is \"food tasting.\"  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
These days, we spend every evening eating together as a group.  
That is our sole guild activity is it not?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Exactly!  
Nothing complicated!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Everyone can go on doing  
whatever it is they want to do!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Today, I asked you to come here  
to meet the guildhouse caretaker.  
And to fill in all the necessary paperwork.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I've been told the guildhouse caretaker  
will usually handle all the housework.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
In fact, we don’t even have to come here  
if we don’t want to.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Is it okay to be so hands-off?  
Well, if there's no inconvenience to us,  
then I have no reason to complain.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Will that be all right with you, my lord?  
I shall abide by your decision. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh yeah, forgot you were here.  
You're always such a wallflower, {player}.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hehe.  
Me, Karyl,  
Kokkoro, and {player}...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
For now, I've registered the four of us  
as members of the Gourmet Guild.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It seems like we're free to invite friends  
from other guilds over as well.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let's use this place as a hangout where we can have fun,  
mess around, and come and go as we please. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Of course, you're welcome to use this guildhouse  
for anything you like!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Personally, I want to renovate this place  
into a functioning restaurant ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Once I get it licensed,  
  
I can use it to collect gourmet food from all around the world!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Every day will be filled lavish feasts!  
How crazy is that! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
All you think about is food. Not that it matters to me...  
Hmm?  
  
**???：**  
Hello!  
Umm, are you the members of the Gourmet Guild?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Excuse me?  
Did we give you permission to speak to us?  
Who the hell are you?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl!  
You shouldn't pick fights with people right off the bat.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Umm.  
Might you be the caretaker of this guildhouse?  
  
**Karin：**  
That's right.  
I'm Karin from the Guild Association.  
  
**Karin：**  
I've been assigned as caretaker of the Gourmet Guild.  
I look forward to working with all of you. ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The pleasure is ours.  
But might I ask... What is this \"Guild Association?\"  
  
**Karin：**  
Oh, allow me to explain.  
In Landosol, most residents are required  
to register themselves with a guild.  
  
**Karin：**  
Of course, there are some exceptions,  
such as travelers from other countries.  
  
**Karin：**  
By joining a guild, you are technically added to our census.  
  
**Karin：**  
This gives you access to many benefits,  
such as a variety of public services.  
  
**Karin：**  
Here in Landosol, guilds are an important part  
of the social structure.  
  
**Karin：**  
The Guild Association was established to oversee these guilds...  
kind of like a government.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh,  
Karin, you're a civil servant!  
Must be nice having a stable job ☆  
  
**Karin：**  
Hehe.  
Well, it may be stable,  
but given how short-staffed we are, it's a lot of work.  
  
**Karin：**  
Besides, the number of guilds is ever growing...  
And not all of them are on their best behavior.  
  
**Karin：**  
I hope you won't be one of these cases.  
If you cause too much trouble, I'll have to step in.  
  
**Karin：**  
In the worst-case scenario, your guild could be disbanded.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Fine, fine...  
We won't disobey the authorities.  
We'll behave ourselves.  
  
**Karin：**  
I'd really appreciate that.  
In the meantime, please consult me  
if you run into any problems.  
  
**Karin：**  
I'll be staying here at this guildhouse,  
so whenever you need anything, just feel free to ask.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Huh?  
Do you mean  
you live here, Miss Karin?  
  
**Karin：**  
Oh, no, I live elsewhere.  
But during the day, I'll be working here  
doing paperwork and such.  
  
**Karin：**  
That's the rule, you see.  
I hope it won't be a problem.  
  
**Karin：**  
After a guildhouse is established,  
the assigned caretaker must temporarily remain on site.  
  
**Karin：**  
My presence might get annoying,  
but please try to understand.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No, it won't annoy us at all.  
But you said \"temporarily\"...  
So does that mean you'll eventually leave?  
  
**Karin：**  
Hehe.  
As per the rules,  
once I deem you  
a trustworthy guild—  
  
**Karin：**  
—and the Guild Association approves my decision,  
I'll no longer need to stay here.  
  
**Karin：**  
Of course, I'll still  
drop by occasionally  
to manage the building.  
That's my job, after all.  
  
**Karin：**  
Hehe.  
You're conveniently close to the other guildhouses I manage,  
as well as to the shopping district.  
  
**Karin：**  
To be honest,  
I wouldn't mind working here permanently.  
  
**Karin：**  
I'll handle all the housekeeping,  
and I can arrange for furniture and other necessities,  
so just let me know.  
  
**Karin：**  
Your guildhouse is unfurnished at the moment,  
but feel free to arrange the interior however you like.  
  
**Karin：**  
Oh, and you won't need to pay any rent,  
but please be aware that furniture may cost you.  
Of course, I'll try to procure it as cheaply as possible.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Okay!  
Anyway, rent-free is a pretty sweet deal.  
I mean, it really looks like an impressive place.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wait, is this one of those houses with a dubious history?  
  
**Karin：**  
Hehe...  
I'll leave that to your imagination. ♪  
  
**Karin：**  
Oh, and another thing...  
As you can see, this is a three-story guildhouse.  
  
**Karin：**  
However, you're not allowed on the second and third floors.  
Please make use of the ground floor only.  
  
**Karin：**  
The second and third floors  
are still under investiga—  
Err, I mean,  
they still need to be cleaned!  
So currently, we've sealed off the staircase leading upstairs.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm?  
Something sounds  
a little off...  
Maybe even shady...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh well.  
Let sleeping dogs lie, as they say.  
  
**Karin：**  
Hehe. Well then.  
  
No point in standing out here talking forever.  
  
**Karin：**  
I'll show you around inside.  
Although, just so you know, it's really quite empty.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No worries!  
Come on, guys!  
Let's check it out! ☆  
  
**Karin：**  
Hehe.  
I sincerely hope you transform  
this guildhouse into a cozy place...  
  
**Karin：**  
One where all of you can feel  
very much at home.  
  
**Karin：**  
Once again,  
welcome to your new guildhouse. ♪
