**Octo：**  
Dear me...  
We have been wagging our tongues a lot, haven't we?  
Looks like it's practically sundown already.  
  
**Octo：**  
Don't tell me...  
You were just buying time until you got yourself healed up?  
Well, I'll be. Taking advantage of my affable personality...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah, you always were laid-back.  
It made you a great partner for a hothead like me...  
  
**Octo：**  
Oh, please... Can we not do this?  
I think I've made it nice and clear that I've never met you before.  
You ought to see a doctor about those fantasies of yours.  
  
**Octo：**  
I did a little digging on you, actually.  
Since you were being such a nuisance and all.  
  
**Octo：**  
You didn't seem old enough to be out unsupervised,  
so I thought I'd ask your parents to get you out of my sight.  
  
**Octo：**  
But it seems officially,  
 you're the daughter of a researcher  
at some kind of experimental laboratory, aren't you?  
And as it so happens, that lab wants you back.  
  
**Octo：**  
Now, investigating is one thing I'm good at.  
So I figured out a thing or two.  
  
**Octo：**  
Seems like you're what they'd call a guinea pig of sorts?  
And I guess you couldn't take it anymore, so you ran away?  
  
**Muimi：**  
...  
  
**Octo：**  
Now, don't get me wrong. I don't care about any of that.  
  
**Octo：**  
It's just, you know...  
I couldn't have you snooping around my mansion forever.  
So I offered my services to aid in your retrieval.  
  
**Octo：**  
Common interests, I guess you'd call it!  
By the way, my client did mention...  
They don't mind whether I bring you in dead or alive.  
  
**Octo：**  
So if you make this too difficult... I can always finish you off,  
take your body to my client,  
 and call it  
 a job well done.  
  
**Octo：**  
So how's about  
 you stop resisting, give yourself up,  
and come along with me already?  
What do you say, little Muimi?  
  
**Muimi：**  
...I'm not Muimi.  
  
**Muimi：**  
\"Muimi\" means \"meaningless.\" And that's not me.  
In this world, I found a meaning to my life.  
No... You're the one who gave my life meaning. Octo.  
  
**Muimi：**  
You may be a slacker, and not the nicest of guys...  
But you were still a precious partner to me!  
  
**Muimi：**  
My one and only partner!  
Since it seems you've forgotten, I'll introduce myself again!  
I'll say it as many times as I have to!  
  
**Muimi：**  
So listen up, and don't forget it again!  
My name is Novem!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Novem of Eternal Society...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Of Kaleidoscope...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Of the Round Table...  
  
**Muimi：**  
No... Just your partner, Novem!  
So don't you call me Muimi again!  
  
**Octo：**  
\"Novem\"?  
Novem... Novem... Novem...  
Hmm...  
Sorry, I'm afraid that's not ringing any bells.  
  
**Octo：**  
I guess you really have got fantasy and reality all mixed up.  
Poor little you!  
 I guess you are  
 at that age!  
  
**Octo：**  
But I must say, listening to you *is* starting to irritate me.  
So could you shut that little mouth of yours?  
  
**Octo：**  
Done talking now, are we?  
Then come over here, I'll deliver you safely to my client,  
and you can get out of my life, yes?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Ugh...  
Hey, you guys, get ready to run!  
I'll buy you a little time. Least I can do for mixing you up in this!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Now come and get me, Octo!  
I've been hoping to give you a good sock in the face!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wahhh! Don't do anything rash!  
You'll open your injuries right back up!  
Ohhh, what am I going to do...?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm.  
The young lady did instruct us to run, and I would very much  
appreciate the opportunity to escape this situation...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But leaving her behind seems wrong, somehow.  
What should we do, my lord?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  We can't just leave her here.  
**Choice: (2)**  Let me think about it.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed.  
I quite agree, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
According to the wisdom Lady Ameth revealed to me...  
You are not the kind of man who would flee to safety,  
leaving a girl in trouble, just to save yourself.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Um, my lord? This situation requires decisive action...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It is just as Lady Ameth's wisdom revealed to me...  
You can be something of an indecisive individual.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Makoto：**  
Hey! {player}!  
Is that really you, {player}?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, another young lady has appeared...  
Is this one also an acquaintance of yours, my lord?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Yep, that's Makoto. I know her.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord...  
Just how many girls have you managed to \"befriend\"  
in the space of a single month?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  About forty, I think?  
`Tag 5`  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see...  
It would appear Lady Ameth's words were true...  
You are quite the philanderer... *mutter mutter*  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey, c'mon!  
What the heck is going on here?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
You're telling me it was you on board that carriage, {player}?  
It's not safe here! Get moving!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ehm... Surely if your company had not suddenly attacked us...  
We would still have been enjoying a peaceful journey  
in that wreckage that used to be a carriage.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Urkkk...  
I can't help that, can I?! It was a job!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I really am sorry we got you caught up in this total mess  
of an incident...  
But it wasn't my call! It was all that dummy Octo's fault!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
\"Dummy\"...?  
  
**Makoto：**  
At any rate, I'll make sure you get out of here safely!  
So please, get up and move!  
Follow me! We can save the introductions for later!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Whoaaa?!  
The heck was that?!  
Look out, you lot, we’re under attack!  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahhh...!  
That slippery little goose just dodged my perfect shot!  
I was sure I had the elephant of surprise!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Well... It's a fact that beastfolk have rather keen senses.  
Though to react to a sniper's arrow from this distance,  
that dog girl is impressive even by those standards.

**Shizuru：**  
Eheh!  
Here's your daily Big Sister Advice! ☆  
  
**Shizuru：**  
A single arrow is rarely enough to finish off a target,  
so always fire two shots or more, aiming for a critical zone!  
If possible, keep firing constantly until they go down!  
  
**Rino：**  
Good points, well made!  
I guess I'll take those words too hard...  
 and attack some more!

**Makoto：**  
Whoa whoa whoa!  
What's with that girl?! The arrows just keep coming!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Let's see now...  
Since these new arrivals have taken aim at us,  
I suppose I can assume they are not friends of yours?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Heck no, they aren't!  
They don't look like beastfolk, and they're no allies of mine!  
Yeesh, our princess wasn't kidding about this being my unlucky day!
