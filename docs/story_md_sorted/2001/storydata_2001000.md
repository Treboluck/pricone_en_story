## Subtitle: Interlude 1
  
**Ameth：**  
So, your tale has finally begun.  
Whether it will end in tragedy or happily ever after,  
only the heavens can say for sure.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Though to be honest, there's so much going on right now,  
I doubt you'll be able to keep up with it all,  
so I'll give you a hand with filling in the blanks.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's what these little interludes between the two of us are for.  
As far as you're concerned, they're no different from dreams,  
so you probably won't remember much that happens here.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But I'll just cross my fingers that you retain some of this knowledge,  
in some deep corner of your mind.  
At any rate, let's start with the basics.  
  
**Ameth：**  
After the events in the forest, you and your loyal retainer Kokkoro  
wound up living for a month or so in Landosol,  
staying at a hotel and getting by one day at a time.  
  
**Ameth：**  
By the way, those other girls you met—Pecorine and the rest—  
already went their own ways before you found a place to stay.  
Though, living in the same city, you do see each other from time to time.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, in the last month, you ran into a whole lot of other girls.  
I'd say you must have met at least forty or so in total.  
You talked to them, got to know them, and grew rather close.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hmm? You don't remember any of this?  
Are you sure about that?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Try a little harder to cast your mind back.  
If you put in the effort to dredge up those memories,  
I'm sure you'll find them rattling about somewhere in your brain.  
  
**Ameth：**  
If you ever find people mentioning words you don't recognize...  
It's quite possible they've told you about these things before,  
and it's just slipped your mind for the moment.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You'll just have to piece together what information you have  
if you want to work out what exactly is going on with this world,  
and of course, with your own little self.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's your task at hand: to find yourself.  
And ultimately, to fix the distortions that are twisting this world.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, I shouldn't blather on and on too much.  
Let's put this little conversation of ours aside for now,  
so you can get on with the story that's waiting out there.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The story of your life.  
Don't worry,  
 I'll step in to help if you get too lost.
