**???：**  
Oopsie daisy!  
I guess my power calculations were a little off.  
Looks like we sent the whole carriage flying!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Don't you \"oopsie daisy\"  
 me, you lunatic!  
There were innocent bystanders in that carriage, you know?!  
  
`image display end`  
**???：**  
Bystanders, you say? What makes you so sure about that?  
  
**???：**  
From what I heard through our eavesdropping charm,  
it sounded like little Muimi was rather acquainted  
with the other passengers on board.  
  
**???：**  
Don't you think it's possible they were working together?  
Providing a convenient carriage to aid her escape?  
So it's easier if we just render them all immobile at once.  
  
**Makoto：**  
That's only one possibility!  
Besides, even if she knew them,  
it sounded like the others didn't know Muimi at all!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Surely the chances are much higher  
that they've got nothing to do with any of this!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I've had it up to here with your excuses, Octo!  
I'm starting to think I shouldn't have agreed to help at all!  
Ugh, this is the worst...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Now listen up, and I'll make this quite clear!  
I may be for hire, but I'm not some kind of assassin!  
  
**Octo：**  
Calm down, my dear doggie.  
No need to bark at me like that.  
  
**Octo：**  
Besides, take a look.  
It seems they managed to get out of the blast just in time.  
So our real work lies ahead of us. Let's focus, mm?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Y-you can count me out!  
I don't want anything more to do with your mess!  
  
**Octo：**  
Ohhh, I get that a lot, actually...  
Somehow I don't seem to be very good at making friends.  
I don't know why... I always put in the effort to be polite...  
  
**Makoto：**  
As if it's anyone's fault but your own!  
All Caon members, on me! We're heading down!  
Let's rescue anyone who made it out of there alive!  
  
**Octo：**  
Hold up, hold up!  
I'm coming too, you know!  
  
**Octo：**  
Not that I really care whether Muimi survived or not...  
But I do need to at least retrieve the treasure she stole.  
  
**Suzume：**  
*cough... cough...*  
I... I thought I was a goner!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I quite concur with the sentiment...  
That was a very close shave.  
My lord, you are not injured at all, are you?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm OK.  
**Choice: (2)**  Never mind me, are you OK?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
That is most reassuring to hear.  
I am glad you are safe, at the very least.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes.  
Thankfully, I have sustained little more than scratches.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheheh...  
To think you would place my safety before your own...  
You truly are a kind-hearted fellow, my lord.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Still, this is quite the situation...  
We were almost blown to smithereens, carriage and all.  
Whatever could have caused such a large explosion?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I-I don't know what caused it...  
But if anyone's hurt, I'll heal them right up!  
Milady gave me first-aid supplies for emergencies like this!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ehm, where did I put the healing seals...?  
Waah! These are the lightning seals for paralyzing enemies!  
  
**Suzume：**  
M-maybe it would be quicker to use my own healing magic!  
Uhhhh, what was the incantation again...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Shhh!  
Lower your voice, Miss Suzume.  
It would appear the danger is not past just yet.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh? Huh...?!  
Ahhhh! There are shadowy figures all around us!  
  
**Suzume：**  
B-bandits?  
Did some outlaws attack us in search of valuables?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Actually, they look like... beastfolk?  
Then... Are they from the Menagerie?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, this isn't good...  
The Menagerie doesn't get along at all  
with Princess Knight guilds like ours!  
  
**Suzume：**  
D-do you think they're here to start a guild war?  
That would be even worse than running into bandits!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh, Miss Suzume?  
I realize this may not be the best time,  
but could I ask you to heal this young lady?  
  
**???：**  
...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wahhh! Those wounds look bad!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed.  
It would appear she not only dragged us out of the carriage,but also guarded us from the blast as best she could.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As a result, she lost the opportunity to protect herself.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Th-then we owe her our lives!  
How awful!  
What a brave little girl she must be!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Don't die on us, little girl!  
 Hang in there!  
Take this!  
 Healing magic! ☆  
  
**???：**  
Ur...ghhh...?  
Y-you guys...  
 Hurry up and get outta here!  
  
**???：**  
I'm sorry I got you mixed up in this...  
It's me they're after... Nothing to do with any of you.  
If you hang around healing me, they'll think we're together...  
  
**???：**  
I don't... need help... I'm fine on my own.  
Don't worry, I'm used to it by now...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Y-you mustn't talk in that condition!  
Take another!  
 Healing magic! ☆  
Ohh... Please actually work without messing up for once!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You can do it, Suzume!  
`Tag 4`  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, are you cheering me on?  
Thank you so much!  
  
**Suzume：**  
For some reason, when you're supporting me...  
It feels like I'm filled with power like never before!  
  
**Octo：**  
Oh dear, oh dear... Could you please stop interfering?  
Just when by a stroke of luck, we managed to render  
our target Muimi immobile and leave the rest of you intact...  
  
**Octo：**  
If you heal her, you'll just make things more difficult.  
Now, nobody move! We've got you surrounded!  
  
**???：**  
Octo...!  
  
**Octo：**  
Don't address me so casually. What if people get the wrong idea?  
I'm from quite a respectable family, I'll have you know.  
Can't have anyone thinking I'm friends with a common thief.  
  
**Octo：**  
Now, you lot over there!  
I don't know who you are, but could you hand over the girl?  
  
**Octo：**  
I'd rather not waste any unnecessary energy.  
So let's make this nice and easy, shall we?  
  
**Octo：**  
That girl there—Muimi, she's called—  
stole a very valuable item from my mansion.  
Look, you see that brooch in the shape of a crown?  
  
**Octo：**  
That's mine. If I don't get it back, my father will be angry.  
It's pretty precious to me personally too, as it happens.  
It belonged my grandmother, the only one who ever loved me.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I-is that true, Octo?  
  
**Muimi：**  
You never did like to talk about that kind of thing...  
If it's that important to you, why did you give it to me?  
  
**Octo：**  
Excuse me?  
Nobody \"gave\" you anything! You stole it!  
  
**Octo：**  
I saw you snooping around outside my mansion.  
\"Suspicious little brat,\" I thought, and I couldn't have been more right!  
  
**Muimi：**  
I didn't steal this. You gave it to me.  
Though I suppose I can't expect you to remember...

**Muimi：**  
I grew up on the streets and didn't know my own birthday...  
But when you saw how jealous I was of the other kids,  
you said, \"Then let's make today your birthday.\"  
  
**Muimi：**  
\"I suppose you are a girl, so you must like this kind of thing,\" you said.  
But why would you just hand it over like that?  
It's a precious memento of someone you loved, right?

**Octo：**  
Ohhh, off in our fantasyland now, are we?  
How very sweet.  
  
**Octo：**  
But I would never give a present to the likes of you.  
To be frank, I can't stand your type.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Please, Octo... Do you really not remember at all?
