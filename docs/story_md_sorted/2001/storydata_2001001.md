### Place: Landosol
  
**Narration：**  
Around a month has passed since {player} began his new life  
in the city of Landosol.  
  
**Narration：**  
Our story begins on an ordinary day like any other.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, this is a little difficult to say, but...  
We don't have any money left.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The village elder did give me some funds when I left my hometown,  
but I'm afraid those funds have run dry.  
Landosol is a big city, after all. It's not a cheap place to live.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Now, I know we have managed to make it this far,  
by settling for the cheapest accommodation,  
gathering our own ingredients for food, and so forth...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But saving money can only take us so far.  
At this point, my purse is as good as empty.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So, my lord, if I may be so bold...  
Might I ask for permission to find a job?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Though it pains me to leave your side for any length of time,  
I feel it will be best for both of us if I find some honest work,  
earn a healthy income, and use it to support our life here.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You need not trouble yourself, of course.  
Please feel free to idle away the day, doing as you please,  
and eating whatever delicious morsels catch your eye.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Here is your allowance for today.  
Enjoy!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Now if you don't mind, I must excuse myself.  
I will return to our lodgings around nightfall.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Is something the matter, my lord?  
Your face looks somehow paler than usual.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Perhaps your health has suffered in this unfamiliar environment...  
How awful... Oh, or are you worried that your allowance will not suffice?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I must apologize.  
The coins I just gave you, you see,  
were the very last handful I had managed to save.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmmm... I suppose I have no choice.  
I will go and sell some of my accessories to supplement your funds.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Wait!  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Mmmh?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord...  
Please do not put your arms around me so suddenly in public...  
Whatever is the matter? Does my absence concern you so greatly?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see...  
You want to find work for yourself, as well?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I would prefer to avoid troubling you with such drudgery if possible...  
But perhaps it would weigh on your mind to do nothing while another works for your sake?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If that is truly what you wish, I will respect your desires.  
*chuckle* You are such a kind-hearted fellow.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It is certainly more efficient if we earn our income together.  
Very well, so be it.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Let's see now...  
It seems that there should be a noticeboard in this plaza  
where job vacancies are frequently posted.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My intentions were to visit this noticeboard  
and pick out a job that seems best suited for my skills.  
Does this plan seem suitable to you, my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well then, let us see...  
Ah yes, there we are!  
That must be the noticeboard I had heard about.

**Kokkoro：**  
Are... Are you all right down there?  
It looked like you took quite the spectacular tumble...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Owieeee...  
Ohh, I'm so sorry!  
I'm all right, really!  
 Don't worry about me!  
  
`image display end`  
**Suzume：**  
Eheheh... I was trying to reach high enough to stick this poster up,  
but I guess I totally lost my balance!  
Oh, Suzume, you can be such a klutz sometimes!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
…\"Suzume\"?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ahh?!  
Why, if it isn't {player}!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I haven't seen you around lately!  
Looks like I went and embarrassed myself again, huh?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...My lord?  
Are you already acquainted with this young lady?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, absolutely!  
I met {player} a little while ago.  
He helped me out when I was in a bit of trouble!  
  
**Suzume：**  
So wait, this girl...  
Um... Could she be your little sister, {player}?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Awwww, she's such a cutie!  
How old are you, little miss?  
Are you on a little date with your big brother today?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Um, my lord and I are not related...  
I am but his humble attendant. My name is Kokkoro.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, I see!  
So you're sort of the same as me, then!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The same... as you?  
Ah... Do you mean to say you are also in service to my lord?  
  
**Suzume：**  
No, no, not like that!  
Sorry, I'm awful at explaining things...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ehm, as you can probably tell, I'm just your average maid...  
But I'm in service to a certain most noble individual!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Actually, it was milady—the lady I work for—  
who sent me here to see about hiring some professional help.  
See, take a look at this vacancy poster! I made it myself!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm... Seeking assistance with a change of residence?  
Organizing luggage and providing a transportation escort...  
This sounds like a simple job, but the reward is quite the sum!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Eheh!  
Milady is very... particular...  
 about avoiding unnecessary expenses...  
But when she does spend, she tends to go a little overboard!  
  
**Suzume：**  
The two of you were coming to look at this noticeboard, right?  
If you're looking for work...  
 Perhaps I could interest you in  
taking up this little job of ours?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Only if it's not too much trouble, of course.  
But it would be quite reassuring if I could hire someone  
I already know and trust, instead of a total stranger!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmmm... This does sound like just what we were looking for,  
and the conditions are difficult to complain about, too.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But I cannot make this decision of my own accord.  
What do you think, my lord?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Help... Being crushed by... maid...  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm? Whatever do you mean?  
Oh, I see... When Miss Suzume lost her balance and fell over,  
she seems to have landed squarely on top of you.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wahhh?!  
I-I-I-I'm sorry! So sorry!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Honestly, I really am such a terrible klutz sometimes!  
I can’t believe I just held an entire conversation  
while straddled right across your body!  
  
**Suzume：**  
P-p-p-please forgive me!  
I'll get off right away!  
 ...Uh, uwhoa, uwahhhhh?!  
  
![200100102.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/200100102.webp)  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah... In your hurry to arise, you seem to have fallen yet again.  
At this point, rather than merely straddling,  
you appear almost to be locked in a passionate embrace.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ehm.........  
Y-you certainly are a rather clumsy young lady.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I can see how you might have trouble transporting goods,  
so perhaps we really should offer our services.
