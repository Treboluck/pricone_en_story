# Chapter 1 Episode 2
Having accepted Suzume's job offer, {player} sets off to the mansion where she works, but a mysterious young girl has stowed away in the carriage. She refers to the amnesiac {player} as a \"Princess Knight.\"
  
## Subtitle: An Uninvited Passenger
  
### Place: Inside the Carriage
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I will gladly partake.  
  
**Suzume：**  
That's right, go ahead and eat up!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Eheheh... Sorry we ended up eating lunch in the carriage.  
It took longer than I expected to find a carriage to hire...  
So things ended up a little bit rushed.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I guess since it's not safe around these parts lately,  
people from other towns have been keeping their distance,  
so there are less carriages available than usual.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm sorry, I should've been better prepared...  
Milady's always scolding me for this kind of thing.  
\"Prepare for all eventualities before you begin a task!\" she says.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well, a carriage will certainly be necessary for the job ahead.  
It's not as though we're in any big hurry,  
so we really don't mind if you take time to do things right.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ahaha... Well, to make up for the inconvenience,  
we can guarantee you room and board until this job is over!  
So please do eat as much as you like!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Go on, dig right in!  
I got up early to make all this! Sandwiches and everything!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, much obliged.  
We are truly grateful for your consideration.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As it happens, our funds had run almost completely dry...  
So we may have been in trouble without a source of food.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, right!  
That must be why you were out looking for work!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Honestly, though, {player}...  
A big brother like you should be more careful!  
  
**Suzume：**  
It's every big brother's responsibility to make sure  
his little sister is well provided for, you know?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ehm, if I may...  
I believe I already explained that we are not siblings.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Mm... Mmmm?  
I must say, this sandwich's flavor is a little unique...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, I'm so sorry!  
  
Even though I'm a maid, I'm not that great at cooking...  
I must have disappointed you so horribly...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I would not go that far.  
Most likely, I am simply not yet used to this region's seasonings.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*munch... munch...*  
My lord seems to be devouring them most voraciously.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Y-you really don't have to eat it if it doesn't agree with you!  
Although, it'll take about half a day to reach our destination,  
so it probably is better if you eat at least a little...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, I know!  
I have a special charm for making food more tasty!  
  
**Suzume：**  
You just make a heart with your fingers and say...  
Food, food,  
 become delicious! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Ehm, is that some manner of magical incantation?  
  
**Suzume：**  
No, it's just a little superstition of mine!  
I find it seems to help a little, at least!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A... A little, you say...

**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm? The sandwich I was in the middle of eating is gone.  
My lord, did you finish it off?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Now now, {player}!  
There's plenty of sandwiches to go around,  
so you shouldn't go snatching!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I didn't snatch anything...  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzume：**  
Huh? You didn't eat it after all?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Does that mean...  
 My deliciousness charm unleashed a deadly beam  
and vaporized the sandwich completely?  
  
**???：**  
*munch... munch...*  
  
**Suzume：**  
...Hmm?  
What's this?  
  
**Suzume：**  
There seems to be a little girl down here  
 among the empty boxes we brought for the job...  
It looks like she reached out and snatched the sandwich...?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ummm...  
Hello down there? Whoever might you be?  
  
`image display end`  
**???：**  
Mrghhh?!  
*cough cough*  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What's all this now?  
There was some kind of stowaway? Lurking in an empty box?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I think that's pretty much the long and short of it...  
So, umm... What do we do now?  
  
**Suzume：**  
This isn't great... When I signed the contract for the carriage,  
they said we mustn't exceed the stated number of passengers!  
At this rate, I'll have to pay an extra fee...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Still, such a little girl out here all alone...  
I don't know if we can really just throw her out...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Um... Young lady?  
What exactly are you doing down there?  
  
**???：**  
I... I'm not little!  
Who do you think you're calling little?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
You are quite little...  
Anyway... It's not nice to freeload, you know!  
Could you at least explain to us how you ended up here?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I wonder if she's a runaway, like Ayane...  
A little girl like this shouldn't normally be out unsupervised...  
Hmmm... What to do, what to do?  
  
**???：**  
Hey, stop that!  
Quit calling me little already!  
  
**???：**  
...Hmm?  
Ahh! You!  
I know you! I met you before!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh? You mean me?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Let's see now...  
I'm pretty sure you're not one of the Sarendia Orphanage kids...  
Um, are you sure you aren't getting me mixed up with someone?  
  
**???：**  
Suzume! That's right!  
Your name's Suzume!  
This might just be the perfect opportunity!  
  
**???：**  
Hey, you!  
Do you remember anything about me?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Uh?! Ummmm...?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Waaaahhhh! Don't shake me like that!  
If you make too much of a ruckus, the carriage will topple over!  
  
**???：**  
Hmmm?  
Whoa?! Whoa, whoa, whoa!  
  
**???：**  
You've gotta be kidding me!  
You there, big guy! What are *you* doing here?!  
I was wondering why I hadn't seen you around!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Are you talking to me?  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm?  
Is this young lady an acquaintance of yours too, my lord?  
You certainly seem to have a lot of female friends lately...  
  
**???：**  
Move it! I don't know you!  
You're in the way!  
  
**???：**  
You're the one I'm talking to!  
Where have you been this whole time?!  
You're just the face I needed to see, Princess Knight!  
  
**Suzume：**  
\"Princess Knight\"?  
Are you related to Princess Knight in some way?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm actually a member of the Sarendia Orphanage guild,  
which is affiliated with Princess Knight...  
Could that be why you seem to know who I am?
