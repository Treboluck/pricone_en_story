**Narration：**  
A few days before Valentine's Day,  
the city is beginning to come alive with whispers of romance.  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is walking through the streets  
when Eriko suddenly approaches him.  
  
**Eriko：**  
My love!  
Oh, my love!  
  
**Eriko：**  
My love...  
Ahhh, finally you noticed my voice calling for you!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Whatever are you doing in a place like this?  
Oh? You were out for a walk?  
  
**Eriko：**  
What? This outfit I'm wearing?  
I do hope it appeals to your sensibilities... Teeheehee.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Actually, I was in the middle of brewing a new concoction,  
when suddenly...  
  
**Eriko：**  
I saw you right outside my window,  
and I simply could not restrain myself.  
I rushed out to greet you, still wearing my apron!  
  
**Eriko：**  
After all, for you to pass through here  
just when I found myself in need of help...  
This can only be... fate!  
 Teeheehee.  
  
**Eriko：**  
What was troubling me, you ask?  
Ah, my love! So you are taking a healthy interest in me!  
  
**Eriko：**  
It's about the concoction I'm creating.  
I'm missing a certain item that I require to complete it.  
  
**Eriko：**  
It may be terribly rude of me  
to impose upon you like this...  
But could you possibly help me find the item I need?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sure.  
**Choice: (2)**  Maybe not right now.  
`Tag 1`  
**Eriko：**  
Thank you ever so much, my love!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ah, when trouble befalls me,  
you appear as my gallant rescuer...  
  
**Eriko：**  
You truly are my one and only destined soulmate!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Eriko：**  
Oh dear, my love.  
I see what you are doing.  
You're turning me down so that you can search  
for the item by yourself!  
  
**Eriko：**  
However, it would pain me to make you go to all that trouble alone.  
I will gladly accompany you.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Eriko：**  
Well then, shall we set off at once?  
 Teeheehee.  
  
**Eriko：**  
The item I require  
grows at the very top of a special tree in these highlands.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Legends say that it is a sacred tree  
which sprouted at the very dawn of Astrum.  
  
**Eriko：**  
The fresh buds growing at its peak  
are the ingredient I need...  
  
**Eriko：**  
But due to the tree's great height,  
they're considered most difficult to retrieve.  
  
**Eriko：**  
I have pored over many volumes of literature,  
but was unable to find any mention  
of a reliable way to reach them.  
  
**Eriko：**  
But I thought that with your help,  
I may be able to hit upon a new idea.  
That's why I brought you here.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh... I think it is coming into view.  
Surely that must be the tree.  
It's even larger than I had imagined...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Now, my love...  
How shall we proceed?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Let me try climbing it.  
`Tag 4`  
**Eriko：**  
Oh... You mean to ascend that imposing trunk?  
To think you would go to such lengths for me...  
  
**Eriko：**  
I beg you, please be careful...  
Don't push yourself any harder than you must.  
  
**Eriko：**  
It's been some time since he began his ascent...  
Has he reached the peak yet, I wonder?  
  
**Eriko：**  
He has long since climbed far out of sight,  
so I can't help but worry...  
  
**Eriko：**  
What's this? Is that him now?  
It looks like reaching the peak was too great a task even for him.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh my!  
 \"Sorry I couldn't get your ingredient\"?  
Please do not apologize!  
  
**Eriko：**  
There is nothing whatsoever that you need to be sorry for.  
  
**Eriko：**  
In fact, making you apologize like this is a crime beyond measure!  
  
**Eriko：**  
This accursed tree... Forcing my love to apologize...  
  
**Eriko：**  
...Oh, I know!  
If we cannot reach the buds, we should bring them down to us!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Just like this!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Curse you! Curse you! Fall, accursed tree!  
  
**Eriko：**  
You truly... are tall... and sturdy!  
But I... am stronger... than you... will ever be!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Wait—my love?!  
Why are you scrambling back up the trunk?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Please, come down!  
The tree is about to fall—  
  
**Eriko：**  
My love! Are you all right?!  
Climbing a tree as it toppled over...  
What possessed you to do such a thing?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Huh? Wh-what's that you're holding? A bird's nest?  
Oh! There are newborn chicks inside it!  
  
**Eriko：**  
You are so attentive, my love.  
I never would have noticed...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ah, how cute they are...  
I'm glad these sweet little creatures didn't lose their lives...  
  
**Eriko：**  
...Huh? Am I feeling...  
relieved that the baby birds didn't have to die?  
  
**Eriko：**  
When I was feared as the \"Destroyer,\"  
I never used to feel anything like this...  
  
**Eriko：**  
I must be changing somehow...  
And it can only be  
 thanks to you, my love...  
  
**Narration：**  
Though taken aback by her newfound emotions,  
Eriko found a strange satisfaction in the growth she was experiencing.
