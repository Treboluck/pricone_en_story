## Subtitle: Atop My Love's Back
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is enjoying a pleasant day with Eriko,  
savoring the taste of her special chocolates.  
  
**Eriko：**  
My love, there are still plenty of chocolates.  
Please enjoy them to your heart's content...  
 Teehee.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Each one is thoroughly infused with my love for you.  
The more you consume, the deeper our passion will surely grow...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teeheehee...  
 Hmm?  
Is something shining in the cabinet?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Whatever could this light be?  
Ohhh... It's terribly bright! Aaaahhh!  
  

---  
  
**Eriko：**  
My love, let us go on a special date today!  
There's somewhere I simply must visit, you see.  
  
**Eriko：**  
It's almost Valentine's Day, and I need all sorts of ingredients,  
so shall we go and purchase them together?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Does that count as a date, you ask?  
Well, I consider it one myself, so yes, it's a date.  
Now, off we go!  
  
**Eriko：**  
I know a wonderful shop  
right down this back alley.  
  
**Eriko：**  
My love?  
Is there something in the shop  
that has particularly caught your eye?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh, that is a herb called ginseng.  
It has many health benefits,  
and can even be used to maintain one's beauty.  
  
**Eriko：**  
And these are pit vipers...  
Like the ginseng, their skin has vital properties.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh, are you not familiar with Chinese medicines?  
They also use powdered worms and hedgehog hides to great effect.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Could it be... you're actually interested  
in the ways of medicine, my love?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh, I see... You were simply wondering  
what kind of ingredients I might want.  
Teehee... Well, that's a maiden's secret.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Let's try this shop first, shall we?  
  
**Eriko：**  
...Hee hee. This must all be quite new to you.  
This shop stocks a wide variety of exotic spices.  
  
**Eriko：**  
It doesn't exactly look like a spice shop to you?  
Teehee... Truly precious treasures are always lurking  
where you least expect them.  
  
**Eriko：**  
My love, do you prefer these alluring scents?  
Or something a little more potent?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  The alluring scents sound safer.  
**Choice: (2)**  The potent ones sound more effective.  
`Tag 1`  
**Eriko：**  
Ah, so you prefer this bewitching quality...  
By \"safer,\" do you mean the expiry date?  
Please don't worry about that.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Well then, let's take a few of these, shall we?  
I'm sure they'll leave you speechless... Teehee...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Eriko：**  
Oh, I see. You prefer things a little spicier...  
It's true, there's a unique appeal to strong odors.  
  
**Eriko：**  
These ingredients will dance a merry jig on your tongue for sure.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee... I've learned a little more about you today, my love...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Eriko：**  
Now, let's go to the next store!  
  
**Eriko：**  
My love, for our next step, let's...  
 Unhh...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh, I'm sorry for stopping so suddenly in my tracks.  
It's nothing, really.  
 Come, let's keep going...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Huh? You think I'm walking strangely?  
  
**Eriko：**  
You can be observant sometimes.  
Actually, my shoes have been chafing a little.  
  
**Eriko：**  
But really, it's no problem at all.  
No need to worry yourself...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Huh? Y-you want to carry me on your back?  
W-well, I appreciate the offer, but that seems rather...

**Eriko：**  
Aaahh! Wh-what are you doing?!  
Don't... don't just pick me up!  
Not out in public like this!  
  
**Eriko：**  
While it fills me with joy to have you hold me,  
this position makes me look like a child...  
It is very embarrassing...  
  
**Eriko：**  
A-at any rate...  
I-I think it's time we headed home for the day!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Huh? Not until we've bought everything I need?!  
B-but, um...!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ahh, wait a moment, my love!  
I'm not... I'm not mentally prepared!

`image display end`  
**Eriko：**  
To think you would actually carry me  
around all the stores on your back...  
  
**Eriko：**  
And worse, that you would go to so much trouble on the day  
that I swore I would spend making you happy!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Huh?! You claim you had a wonderful time...?  
  
**Eriko：**  
In fact, you would like to do this again sometime?  
  
**Eriko：**  
My love... I enjoyed our time together, too.  
But next time, rather than being carried...  
  
**Eriko：**  
I would like to stand by your side, hand in hand...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ahhh...  
 No, I didn't say anything.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Anyway, would you meet me  
at the same time and place tomorrow?  
  
**Eriko：**  
There's something I'd like to give you.  
I absolutely insist that you come.  
  
**Eriko：**  
It's almost our meeting time now...  
Will my love like them, I wonder?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh, I hope he arrives soon to receive these chocolates...  
Chocolates filled with my love and passion!  
  
**Eriko：**  
I can't wait to see his face as he savors them...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ahhh, my love...!  
How I have longed to see you!  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
And that's a wrap.  
Everything you just saw was a sort of dream.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You'll forget it all when you wake up,  
so no need to think too hard about it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hold on, though—what's wrong with Eriko today?!  
I never expected her to make chocolates  
that *aren't* laced with anything!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Perhaps this just means  
she was extra serious about being your Valentine?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, I suppose only she knows the truth for sure.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I hope you'll keep doing your best to accept her sheer passion.  
Even if it might be overwhelming at times!  
  

---  
  
**Eriko：**  
Mmnhh...  
 Ahh, my love?!  
I'm so sorry to embarrass myself like this...  
  
**Eriko：**  
I think I was dreaming just now...  
I was with you, shopping for Valentine's Day ingredients...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Huh? You had the same dream?  
Teehee...  
 The bonds of fate between us are so very strong...  
Well then, let's continue where we left off.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Go ahead and savor the fruits of my love for you.  
There's still plenty of chocolate left to taste...  
  
**Eriko：**  
As your future wife, I must make sure you eat heartily.  
I would never make too much for you to stomach.  
At most, you'll have no appetite for a few days afterwards...  
  
**Eriko：**  
If you eat so much that your nose begins to bleed,  
I'll take the blood as a sample...  
 Teeheehee.  
  
**Narration：**  
In the end, {player} conquered the mountain of chocolate  
while taking the utmost care not to get a nosebleed.
