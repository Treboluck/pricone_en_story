## Subtitle: Where's Mr. Kitty's Owner?
  
**Narration：**  
Mimi and {player} are on the hunt  
for the owner of the lost kitten.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Hey, mister!  
I'm sure we'll have more luck finding Mr. Kitty's owner today, right?  
  
**Kitten：**  
Meow!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Anyone!  
Does anyone know the owner of this kitty?  
Does this little kitty look familiar to anyone?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahhhh...  
There wasn't any sign of the owner today, either...  
Oh, mister... What are we gonna do?  
  
**Kitten：**  
Mreowww...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's put up posters.  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's broaden our search.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mimi：**  
Posters...?  
Oh, right! That way, lots more people  
will be able to see that we're searching!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Okay, I'll draw lots and lots of posters!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Mimi：**  
R-right! Good plan!  
Even if we didn't find anyone here...  
We've gotta keep trying, for Mr. Kitty's sake!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mimi：**  
C'mon, mister! C'mon, Mr. Kitty!  
We're gonna find your owner no matter what!  
  
**Kitten：**  
Meowr!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Aahhhh...  
It's no use... The owner isn't turning up anywhere...  
  
**Mimi：**  
I'm sorry, Mr. Kitty...  
I really wanted to find your owner for you...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Hey, mister...  
If we never manage to find his owner...  
Mr. Kitty will be really lonely, won't he?  
  
**Mimi：**  
If it was me... If I couldn't see my mommy or daddy,  
or you, mister, ever again... I know I'd be really sad...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ah... Aaahhh...  
Waaaaaahhhh!  
I'm sorry, Mr. Kitty!

**Mimi：**  
W... Waaahh?!  
M-mister? What're you doing?  
Putting me on your shoulders...?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahhhh! Wowwww! I'm so high up!  
Look, I'm even taller than a grown-up now!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Eheheh... Thanks, mister!  
This is more fun than I thought!  
I won't cry anymore, OK?  
  
**Kitten：**  
Meowww!  
  
**Mimi：**  
I think Mr. Kitty likes being high up, too!  
Do you feel less lonely now?  
Even if we still didn't manage to find your owner...  
  
**Woman：**  
My little Chovy!  
  
**Mimi：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Woman：**  
I've been looking everywhere for you, Chovy!  
I was so worried! Thank goodness you're safe!  
  
**Kitten：**  
Meowww!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahhhh!  
Could you be this little kitty's owner, then?  
  
**Woman：**  
Yes.  
I was over in the plaza when I saw you on this man's shoulders...  
And I realized the kitten you were holding was my little Chovy!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Oh, I get it!  
That's why you picked me up, mister!  
So we could show Mr. Kitty off to everyone!  
  
**Kitten：**  
Meow!  
  
**Woman：**  
I'm so glad to find him safe and sound!  
Thank you so much, little miss, for taking care of him.

**Mimi：**  
Thank goodness we found Mr. Kitty's owner in the end!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Though...  
It's a bit sad we can't see Mr. Kitty anymore...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahhh...  
  
**Mimi：**  
It's a little bit lonely...  
But I've got you, mister, so I'm okay!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Hey mister, hey mister!  
Will you give me another shoulder ride on the way back?  
  
**Mimi：**  
You really will?!  
 Yayyy!  
Hey, mister, you'll stay with me  
forever and ever, won't you?  
  
**Narration：**  
Happy to have reunited the kitten with its family,  
Mimi headed home with a big smile.
