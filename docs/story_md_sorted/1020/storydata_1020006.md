That's all the nuisances taken care of.  
Well then, shall we take possession of the prize?

Flying through the shiny sky~♪  
Flippety-flippety flap!  
Over the clouds and far away~!♪

and a few days later, thanks to a tip-off from {player},  
the royal knights arrested a notorious ring of poachers.
