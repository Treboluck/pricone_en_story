**Narration：**  
{player} runs into Mimi looking less cheerful than usual.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Aaahhh...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Oh, mister, it's you!  
 Um, listen... The thing is...  
Tomorrow I've got this test at school in gym class, but...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Wahh?!  
What's this? It's like that light we saw before!  
  
**Mimi：**  
M-Mister Nice Guy, where are you?!  
Don't leave me all alone...!  
 Waaaaaahhh!

**Mimi：**  
*sniff*...  
Oh no... What am I gonna do tomorrow? *sniff*  
  
**Mimi：**  
...Oh... Hi there, mister.  
Y-yeah... I guess today...  
I'm not feeling too good...  
  
**Mimi：**  
The thing is... Tomorrow at school,  
we have to do this vaulting test...  
  
**Mimi：**  
And you know, I'm not that good with gymnastics and stuff...  
So I'm probably going to really mess it up...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You'll be fine.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mimi：**  
You think so?  
When you say it like that,  
I want to believe you, but...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Every time I try vaulting, I always mess it up...  
I really don't think I can do it...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Aaahhh... I'm scared... What am I gonna do?!  
...*sniff*  
  
**Mimi：**  
Huh?!  
Why'd you stand up so suddenly, mister?  
You want to go somewhere together?  
  
**Mimi：**  
...Sure!  
I'll go with you!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahhhh! It's the zoo!  
Look, mister, there's so many bunnies!  
  
**Mimi：**  
So fluffy!  
I don't think I've ever played with so many bunnies before!  
This is like heaven!  
  
**Mimi：**  
What's that, mister? You come here a lot?  
I get it! The animals are so cute, right?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Fluffy bunnies... So soft and warm...  
Aahh! That tickles!  
Eheheh!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Hey mister, why don't you try cuddling  
one of the bunnies, too?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Here you go, mister!  
I picked the fluffiest, cuddliest one!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahhh!  
D-  
did the bunny just go and  
bite your finger?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Bad bunny!  
No being nasty and hurting Mr. Nice Guy! Say you're sorry!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahhhh?!  
Mr. Bunny ran away...  
I didn't know he could even hop that high!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Hey, mister...  
Don't get too angry with Mr. Bunny, okay?  
I think he was surprised, that's all.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Here you go, over here!  
Try giving some milk to this bunny, mister!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Bunnies... too scary...  
**Choice: (3)**  That sounds fun!  
`Tag 2`  
**Mimi：**  
I-it'll be fine!  
This bunny won't bite!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Mimi：**  
Right?!  
This bunny's such a cutie!  
It'll definitely be fun!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Mimi：**  
See?  
Feed it the milk like this!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahhh! It's drinking it all up!  
Isn't that the cutest?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Fluffy-fluffy, cutey-cutey, little bunny friend~♪  
Drink up your tasty milk and grow up big and strong~♪  
  
**Mimi：**  
Eheheh...  
Hey, mister? Thank you so much for bringing me here today!  
  
**Mimi：**  
I had so much fun! It was the best!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahh... But...  
I still don't know what to do... about the test tomorrow... *sniff*  
  
**Mimi：**  
...Huh?  
Super Bunny Power?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Oh, right! If I pretend like I'm that bunny just now,  
I can hoppity-hop higher than ever!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Okay, mister!  
I'll try using bunny power in the test tomorrow!  
  
**Mimi：**  
You're the best, mister!  
Thanks to you,  
I'm even kind of looking forward to the test!

**Ameth：**  
\"Super Bunny Power,\" huh?  
You say the cutest things sometimes!  
  
**Ameth：**  
That Mimi might be a bit of a crybaby,  
but she's always doing her best at everything,  
so I hope you'll give her the support she needs.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Not just in your dreams of \"that\" world,  
but in \"this\" world too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, I'll see you round!

**Mimi：**  
Unhhh... ...Huh...?  
What... What was I just doing?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahh! Mister, it's you!  
...That's right, we were shopping together, weren't we?  
I guess I must have fallen asleep...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Oh, but you know what?!  
I had the most fun dream ever just now!  
I played with bunnies! Soooo many of them!  
  
**Mimi：**  
...What?!  
You just had totally the same dream?  
Wowww! That's so nice!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Oh, but I just remembered. I was trying to tell you something, wasn't I?  
It's about tomorrow at school...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Wait, I know!  
It's just like in the dream! I should try using Super Bunny Power!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Eheheh... You know, I love bunnies best of all,  
so if I hoppity-hop like them, I feel like I can jump really high!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Okay! I'm gonna do my best!  
Hoppity-hop, hoppity-hop~♪  
  
**Narration：**  
It looks like Mimi has managed to get over her fear of gym class.
