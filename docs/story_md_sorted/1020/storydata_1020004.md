## Subtitle: A Present for Mommy
  
**Mimi：**  
Going for a walk, going for a walk, walking's so much fun~♪  
Hoppety-hop~♪  
  
**Mimi：**  
Oh, it's Mr. Nice Guy!  
Yayyy! C'mon, mister, let's play!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Wahhh!  
Wh-what's all this?  
It's so bright!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Waaaahhhhh!  
  

---  
  
**Mimi：**  
Hey mister,  
thanks for coming shopping with me!  
  
**Mimi：**  
The thing is, it's my mommy's birthday soon,  
and I want to buy her a present!  
  
**Mimi：**  
You know, I did lots of chores around the house  
and saved up all my money for this!  
  
**Mimi：**  
I hope I can find something  
that'll make my mommy really happy!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahhhh!  
This shop has so many cute things!  
Look at this bunny plushie! Isn't it the cutest?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Oh! There's another cute plushie over here...  
  
**Mimi：**  
...Huh? What about the present?  
R-right, of course... We need to find something for my mommy...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Hmmm... What sort of thing should I get?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ohhh!  
Look at this fluffy ribbon! It would look super cute on you, mister!  
Oh, and this hairband would really suit you too!  
  
**Mimi：**  
...Hm? Remember who we're buying for?  
 Oh, right, yes.  
We need something that would suit Mommy,  
not something that looks good on you.  
  
**Mimi：**  
But... Mommy's not here right now,  
so I don't really know what would suit her...  
Hey mister, what do you think I should do?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Try picturing your mommy's face.  
**Choice: (2)**  Try pretending that I'm your mommy.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mimi：**  
Oh, right!  
I should just try imagining her while I look!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Mimi：**  
Whaaa?!  
But mister, you don't look anything like my mommy!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Still, you always give me good advice,  
so I'll give it a try!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mimi：**  
Hmmm...  
Which one do you think my mommy would like the most?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Oh! I bet this necklace would look pretty on her!  
How much does it cost...?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ehhhh?! It's super expensive!  
All the money I saved up isn't enough...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ah! What about this cute ring?!  
I'm sure it'll be cheaper!  
Let's have a look at the price...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ohhhh... Even this little ring costs way more than I've got...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Wh-what should I do...?  
Everything that would be great for my mommy  
is too expensive for me to buy!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahhhh... I worked so hard to save up  
to buy something nice for Mommy, too...  
W-waaaahhh...!  
  
**Mimi：**  
...Wh-what's that, mister?  
What do you mean, it'll be fine?  
  
**Mimi：**  
You know a present that doesn't cost anything?  
Th-that can't be real, can it?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahh! Wait, mister! Where are you going?!  
Wait for meeee!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Um, mister? What are we doing in the park?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahhh! Look at all the pretty flowers!  
What are you going to do with all those flowers, though?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Oh, I know!  
We can give her flowers as a present!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Huh? Not quite?  
What do you mean, watch and see...?  
  
**Mimi：**  
M-mister? Are you tying the flowers in knots?  
What are you making?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahhhh! It's a necklace!  
A necklace of flowers!  
It looks just like the one in the shop, too!  
  
**Mimi：**  
I get it!  
We can make a flower necklace as a present for Mommy!  
Let me try too!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Thanks to you,  
I'm gonna make the perfect present!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Thank you so much, mister!  
You're the best! I really, really lov—

**Ameth：**  
Hello again. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just saw was a dream I made for you and Mimi  
based on both of your memories.  
Did it ring any bells? Well, I wouldn't expect you to remember just yet.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I have to say, though, that Mimi girl does seem to act  
rather young for her age.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Though trying to find a present for her mommy...  
Well, I can't deny that's very sweet of her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Although, if she got that money by doing chores  
and saving up her allowance...  
Wouldn't that make it her mother's money in the first place, anyway?!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ah, well... From the mother's perspective,  
I'm sure the sentiment is more than worthwhile.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I can't claim to know how a real parent feels...  
But I've watched plenty of people doing their best to help others,  
so I can understand that it's a nice feeling.  
  
**Ameth：**  
At any rate, Mimi can be a bit of a ditzy kid,  
so if you're taking care of her, try to keep a close eye on the girl, okay?  
  
**Ameth：**  
On the \"other side,\" getting lost might not be such a big deal,  
but over \"here,\" there's no telling what danger she might stumble into.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, with that warning,  
I think I'll let you go for the moment. See you around!

**Mimi：**  
Unhhhh...  
Huh? Where am I...?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Oh... I guess I fell asleep...  
What's that, mister? You were sleeping too?  
  
**Mimi：**  
*yawn*...  
You know, mister, I just had a weird sort of dream!  
You were there, and we were buying a present for my mommy!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Huh?! You just dreamed about the same thing too?  
Wowww! That's almost like magic!  
  
**Mimi：**  
But you know, it makes me sort of happy to share a dream with you!  
Eheheh...  
  
**Mimi：**  
...Huh?  
What was I about to say at the end of the dream?  
Ah... That was... Ummmm...  
  
**Mimi：**  
I-it was nothing!  
You probably just heard wrong, that's all!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Hey mister, hey mister!  
We had lots of fun in the dream, but let's play together here too!  
  
**Narration：**  
So {player} and Mimi went to the park together  
and made some lovely necklaces of flowers.
