## Subtitle: Hide-and-Seeker
  
**Narration：**  
Kyoka is playing hide-and-seek with her friends.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...48... 49... 50!  
Everyone ready?  
  
**Mimi：**  
All ready!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Not just yet!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Mimi, try not to hide anywhere too easy, all right?  
And Misogi, try not to hide anywhere too ridiculous...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...48... 49... 50!  
Everyone ready?  
  
**Mimi & Misogi：**  
All ready!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Okay, I'm coming!  
You wait and see, I'll...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Aahh! {player}?!  
How long have you been here?!  
Don't surprise me like that!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...What am I doing?  
I'm playing hide-and-seek with Mimi and Misogi.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
You've never heard of hide-and-seek?  
You really are a strange sort of grown-up, aren't you?  
I'm the seeker, so I have to find where my friends are hiding.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Ohhhh...  
Don't tell me you want to try playing too?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Yes, please!  
**Choice: (2)**  Not particularly.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kyoka：**  
*sigh* A grown-up like you wanting to play hide-and-seek...?  
Still, I can't fault you for your honesty.

`Tag 2`  
**Kyoka：**  
Yes, yes...  
There's no point trying to pretend with me.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kyoka：**  
It would be cruel of me to leave you all alone  
with no friends to play with.  
Since you're so keen on it, I'll let you join in.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Well then, I'll count to 50 one more time,  
so find a hiding place while I do.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
1... 2... 3... 4... 5...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...48... 49... 50!  
Everyone ready?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  All ready!  
**Choice: (5)**  Not just yet!  
`Tag 4`  
**Kyoka：**  
All right, then! Time to get searching!  
You just wait, and I'll...

`Tag 5`  
**Kyoka：**  
H-huh...?  
Why do I feel like your voice just now  
came from somewhere very close by...?  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Kyoka：**  
...Wait, why are you just standing here out in the open?!  
You said you wanted to play hide-and-seek, didn't you?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Huh? You want to help me search?  
Th-that's no good!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I'll protect you!  
**Choice: (8)**  I don't want to leave you all on your own.  
`Tag 7`  
**Kyoka：**  
Wh-what are you talking about?!  
Hide-and-seek isn't some kind of battle...  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Kyoka：**  
All on my own...?  
I'm playing with Mimi and Misogi, so I'm not really alone...  
Why is your kindness always so oddly misguided?  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Kyoka：**  
Listen, okay?  
Hide-and-seek is a game with *one* seeker.  
It's not fair for the seeker to ask for help.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...But there are two people hiding? So it's basically even?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Th-that's not really the issue...  
Hide-and-seek is supposed to be a game of one against many...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Whether there are two people hiding, or three, or even a hundred,  
it's the job of the single seeker to find them all...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I... I suppose that does seem a little cruel.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh? Maybe it's fine to have more than one seeker?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Of course it's not fine!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Kyoka! Stop trying to keep Mr. Nice Guy all to yourself!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Mimi! Misogi!  
Were you listening this whole time?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hey, mister!  
There's a hiding spot over here that nobody'll ever find!  
I'll show you in secret! C'mon, follow me!  
  
**Mimi：**  
That's not fair!  
You're gonna hide with me, aren't you, mister?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Y-you two... Why did you show yourselves?!  
You're spoiling the whole game!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
This is all your fault, {player}! Honestly!  
  
**Narration：**  
With a sigh, Kyoka wondered to herself why it was that  
{player} always seemed to make her life so difficult.
