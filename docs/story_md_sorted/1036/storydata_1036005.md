## Subtitle: My Very First...
  
**Narration：**  
Today, {player} and Kyoka are going out for a picnic.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
{player}, you're late.  
We were supposed to meet ten minutes ago.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Honestly! Pull yourself together!  
You agreed to go somewhere with me, so at least show up on time...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I've had enough of dealing with you, {player}.  
I'll go on this picnic on my own!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Chase after her.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kyoka：**  
Please don't follow me.  
I've decided I'm going on a solo picnic.  
Your role today is over.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...There might be monsters, you say?  
I don't think so.  
This is a safe area, free from almost all danger.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I'd have to be incredibly unlucky to run into a monster here.  
Now if you're satisfied, please leave me al—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRRAAAAGGHHH!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahhh!  
Th-there really is a monster?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I-it's coming this way?!  
Somebody, help...!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Leap in front of her.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kyoka：**  
{player}...! You're hurt?!  
All so you could protect me...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Huh? I should attack now, while it's stunned?  
B-but... my magic isn't enough to...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahh...! Your sword... It's shining like before,  
and I can feel my magic growing stronger...  
I-I might actually be able to do this!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Cosmo Blue Flash!!!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Th-that was a close one...  
  

---  
  
**Kyoka：**  
{player}, are you all right?  
...It's just a scratch, you say?  
Thank goodness...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Huh? What about me?  
O-oh... Well, I'm not hurt.  
All because you stopped the monster...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
But, um...  
Th-this is a little embarrassing, but I've gone weak in the knees.  
I don't think I can stand up right now...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wh-why are you holding out your hand?  
...You want to help me up?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
But... ahhh...  
Th-thanks, but no thank you.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Because... my mom told me...  
 I should only hold hands with a boy once I find someone respectable...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm pretty respectable... right?  
**Choice: (4)**  Definitely not me, then.  
`Tag 3`  
**Kyoka：**  
...Yes, I suppose.  
You do seem like a perfectly good person to me.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh?!  
Th-that's not true at all!  
You're a perfectly respectable person!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Kyoka：**  
To start with, I thought you were suspicious, and a total creep...  
But you've done nothing but help me...  
Today, you even shielded me from that monster.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Actually... I thought you were kind of cool back there.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
N-no!  
I didn't say anything!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Anyway!  
For the moment, I suppose you're respectable,  
so... please lend me your hand.  
  

---  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I... I think I can stand now...  
Thank you for helping.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Your hand feels... so warm to the touch.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh? M-my face is going red?!  
N-no, this isn't... Um... Ahhh...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Urghh... It's nothing to worry about!  
Anyway, come on! We should go!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Huh? \"Go where?\"  
Well, where do you think? To our picnic!  
I brought lunch for you and everything, you know!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh, but... I wouldn't want to run into more monsters...  
So maybe we should go back to Landosol.  
  
**Narration：**  
In the end, the two of them ate their picnic lunch  
in Landosol's main plaza.
