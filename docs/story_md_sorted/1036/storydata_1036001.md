## Subtitle: A Very Suspicious Creep
  
**???：**  
O-oh no, what now...?  
The city center is over that way, so... Ummm...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's up?  
`Tag 1`  
**???：**  
And who are you, exactly?  
We learned at school that we should never talk to strangers.  
Something about \"suspicious individuals\"...  
  
**???：**  
You seem very suspicious!  
  
**???：**  
In particular, men who approach you when you're alone  
are all creeps. That's what my friends said.  
  
**???：**  
So you must be... a creep, as well.  
  
**???：**  
Please don't talk to me.  
I'll report you to my teacher.  
  
**???：**  
You're very persistent...  
Stay away from me.  
I'll sound my Siren Amulet!  
  
**???：**  
You're just worried about me, you say?  
I don't need any creeps worrying about me, thank you.  
  
**???：**  
If you really want to speak to me,  
show me some proof that you aren't suspicious.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Throw aside your weapons and armor.  
**Choice: (3)**  I don't have any real proof...  
`Tag 2`  
**???：**  
Wh-why are you taking off your armor?!  
Stripping off your clothes in public... You really are a creep!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**???：**  
If you have no proof, that makes you suspicious.  
You're definitely a suspicious, creepy guy.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**???：**  
To think I'd run into a creep like this...  
Landosol certainly is a scary place.  
  
**???：**  
I really should head home...  
The station for carriages to the Elven Forest is...  
Um... I came from this direction, so...  
  
**???：**  
...Wh-what are you looking at?  
What's it to you if I'm having trouble with directions?  
This is my first time leaving the Elven Forest in quite a while...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Shall I take you home?  
**Choice: (6)**  Shall I show you to a guard station?  
`Tag 5`  
**???：**  
I'm not fool enough to tell a creep my home address.  
So that's a no.  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**???：**  
D-don't treat me like some lost child!  
I can find my own way home!  
  
`Tag 7`  
**???：**  
...You'll give me a map?  
 Well, I suppose...  
As long as I have a map, I should be able to reorient myself.  
  
**???：**  
Maybe you're not *quite* as bad as I thought.  
Thank you very much, Mr. Suspicious Creepy Guy.  
  
**???：**  
Well then, I should get going. Goodbye.  
I'm sure we will never meet again.  
  
**???：**  
Thank goodness!  
I found my way out of the city.  
  
**???：**  
Just to make sure, I should check the map again  
for the carriage station's location.  
Let's see... I just need to head straight down this path...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRRAAAAGGHHH!  
  
**???：**  
Huh? A-a monster?!  
Oh no, what now?  
I can't fight a monster all on my own...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Step in to save her.  
`Tag 8`  
**???：**  
Y-you again?!  
What are you doing here?  
  
**???：**  
...You followed me because you were worried?  
I... suppose that makes sense.  
  
**???：**  
Still, can the two of us really defeat this thing?  
  
**???：**  
...What? I should try attacking?  
But... I don't think my magic would be strong enough...  
  
**???：**  
Huh? This is strange, though.  
For some reason my body feels full of energy!  
Did you do something to me?  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRRAAAAGGHHH!  
  
**???：**  
R-right, of course!  
Explanations can wait—I have to attack! T-take this!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**???：**  
I-I did it! I beat the monster!  
  
**???：**  
I couldn't have done it without your help.  
I'm sorry for calling you some kind of creep.  
You're a surprisingly good person.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
My name is Kyoka. What's yours?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Mr. {player}... Thank you very much.  
If you hadn't come to help me, I...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Wait. Hold on a minute.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Now that I think about it, sneaking around and following me...  
That's very suspicious.  
Maybe you're actually a secret creep after all?!  
  
**Narration：**  
In the end, {player}'s innocence remained in question...
