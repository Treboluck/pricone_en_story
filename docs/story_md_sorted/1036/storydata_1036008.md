# Kyoka Episode 8
In a dream of another world shown to them by Ameth, Kyoka loses her purse while out shopping, and {player} offers her a helping hand. Some passers-by mistake them for newlyweds or siblings, leaving Kyoka with rather mixed feelings.
  
## Subtitle: Shopping Calamity
  
**Kyoka：**  
This is a surprise. We both came to buy groceries at the same time.  
Well then, shall we walk to the grocer's together?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Potatoes... onions... carrots...  
Carrots... Ahhh...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahhh!  
 Th-this light... It's just like before...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Aaaaahhhh!

**Kyoka：**  
Oh, are you shopping here too?  
What a coincidence.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I'm on an errand for my mom to buy ingredients for today's dinner.  
We're going to be having curry.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Doesn't curry usually have carrots in it?  
W-well, yes, but... um... they were sold out today, so...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...There are lots of them right here?  
W-wow, you're right... I... I didn't notice...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I was trying so hard not to look that way...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahh! Why are you putting peppers in my basket too?!  
Stop that!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Honestly...  
 Anyway, I should head home.  
See you later, {player}!

**Kyoka：**  
H-huh...? That's weird...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
M-my purse is missing?! D-did I drop it somewhere?!  
  
**Staff：**  
Hey, are you OK?  
Don't panic. Take all the time you need to look for it.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I-I'm very sorry!  
Ahhh... I'm making all the people behind me wait...  
And my mom will be mad if I can't buy the ingredients...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let me pay for you.  
**Choice: (2)**  Let me help you look.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kyoka：**  
O-oh, no! I couldn't possibly let you!  
I'll put the items back and go home to fetch some money!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...There's no need for all that?  
B-but... it would be wrong of me to...

`Tag 2`  
**Kyoka：**  
O-oh, no! You don't have to!  
I can find it myself!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Aahh! Wh-why are you touching me there?!  
Y-you really are a creep after all, aren't you?!  
You suspicious, creepy guy!

**Kyoka：**  
...Huh? You think my purse is inside my skirt?  
Are you sure?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Thank you... I remember what happened now.  
I tucked my purse in my pocket so I wouldn't lose it...  
I'm such an idiot...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Come to think of it, it looks like you were buying  
ingredients for dinner too, huh?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Meat, potatoes... onions... carrots...  
Looks like curry.  
Please stop copying me!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Why don't you make it for me?  
**Choice: (5)**  I'll make some for you.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kyoka：**  
I don't think so.  
If I make it, you'll end up with carrot-free curry.  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Kyoka：**  
Are you good at cooking, then, {player}?  
Somehow you don't exactly strike me as the type...  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Kyoka：**  
Still... Tell you what.  
If you'd like, I could cook something for you sometime.  
As thanks for today.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I can't make anything as complicated as curry,  
but I could try... baking cookies, maybe.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I can't wait!  
`Tag 7`  
**Kyoka：**  
Haha.  
I'll make a nice big batch, so you can have as many as you like!  
  
**Woman：**  
Oh...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh?  
Um... Did you want something?  
  
**Woman：**  
S-sorry for staring!  
When I heard you talking, it sounded like a newlywed couple.  
So I felt a little silly when I turned to look.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
N-newlyweds?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
M-me and {player}? Newlyweds?!  
Wh-wh-wh-what are... what are you...  
  
**Woman：**  
I know—silly me! You're just brother and sister.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Brother and sister?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Aaahhhh...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...I look upset?  
You must be imagining things. I'm perfectly fine!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Honestly... what a rude lady. Brother and sister...  
As if {player} could be my big brother...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
{player}... My... big brother...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Aaahhhh...!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Th-this time I look happy? I've gone bright red?  
Y-y-y-you're definitely imagining things!  
I-I'm... going home now!

**Ameth：**  
Aww, doesn't Kyoka have the sweetest troubles?  
She's got some tricky feelings for such a little kid!  
  
**Ameth：**  
So how'd you like that little dream I made?  
Was it lots of fun?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I hope you'll keep collecting lots of fragments of Kyoka's memories.  
Well then, see you around!

**Kyoka：**  
Unhhh... ...Huh...?  
Did I... fall asleep again?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
You were asleep just now, too?  
It's just like before... How very strange.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh! More to the point, we should finish our shopping  
before it gets late!  
 Let's hurry, Big Bro!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ah... B-\"Big Bro\"...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
F-forget I said that!  
That was a mistake!  
I-I definitely didn't say it on purpose, or mean anything by it...!  
  
**Narration：**  
Kyoka couldn't help but think how nice it would be  
if {player} was her real big brother...
