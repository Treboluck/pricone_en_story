**Narration：**  
One day, when {player} and Kyoka are out on a walk...  
  
**Waitress：**  
Hey there! How's it going, big guy?  
This little cafe over here just opened a few days ago.  
Why don't you come check it out?  
  
**Waitress：**  
You're pretty good-looking, so I'll give you a discount!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
{player}!  
Please don't get so excited by women flirting with you!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
And you, too! What's the big idea?  
Can't you see he's got company?  
  
**Waitress：**  
Oh, you're a cute little thing.  
Of course I wouldn't ignore you.  
  
**Waitress：**  
Let's see...  
 Why don't you bring your little sister along too?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
No, thank you. I'm not exactly hungry.  
Besides which, I'm not his little sister!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
{player}, I'm going home now. Goodbye!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
*sigh*...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Why... Why did I get so upset with them just now?  
It's not like {player} did anything wrong...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
It was pretty rude of me to suddenly leave like that...  
I'll have to apologize next time I see him...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Still... That lady was quite pretty...  
She's probably about the same age as {player}, huh...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Lucky her...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wh-what am I even saying?!  
It's getting late... I should sleep...

**Kyoka：**  
...H-huh...? Where am I?  
What... was I doing...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
This is... a memo from my mom.  
Did she send me to do some shopping in Landosol?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh... {player}, hello there.  
Are you out shopping, too?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
{player}...? Did you get shorter somehow?  
It's as though we're almost the same height...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh? What do you mean, of course we are?  
Come to think of it, I feel like I'm higher up than usual...

**Kyoka：**  
...!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
C-could it be... I'm all grown up?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
How did I grow up so suddenly?  
Could it be thanks to that milk I drank yesterday?  
No... that's ridiculous...  
  
**Man：**  
Hey there, missy! You're real cute.  
Whaddaya say we go have some fun?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wh-whaaaa?!  
C-could this man be... \"hitting on\" me?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
My friends told me men who \"hit on\" girls are all creeps...  
I have to turn him down...  
But... he looks pretty scary...

**Kyoka：**  
...Huh? {player}?  
\"Don't worry, stay behind me\"...?  
  
**Man：**  
Who the hell are you?! Tryin' ta get in my way?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Huh?!  
{player}, wh—what did you just say?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
It's only natural to protect your... girlfriend...?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wh-whaaaaaa?!

`image display end`  
**Kyoka：**  
G-girlfriend? Me? What are you talking about?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
You and me aren't anywhere near that close yet, and there's  
our age gap, and we're different races, and I don't know anything  
about romance, or marriage... B-but... I... I...!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Wait... Huh? Where am I?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
W-was all that just now...  
 a dream?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wh-why would I have such an embarrassing dream?!  
I have to forget it, have to forget it, have to forget it...  
Aaaahhhh...  
  
**Narration：**  
A few days later...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I can't believe my mom sent me shopping in Landosol,  
just like in that dream...  
What if I run into {player} again...?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hi there.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh?!  
H-hello there.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I can't believe he's really here...  
Wh-what now?  
When I remember that dream, I get all nervous...  
  
**Man：**  
Hey! You there, girl!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh?! A-a guy's talking to me?!  
This is just like the dream... D-don't tell me...?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
{player}...! You're moving forward to protect me?  
Th-this really is just the same as...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm sorry.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kyoka：**  
...Huh?  
Um... Why are you apologizing to that man?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Because I bumped into him?  
Ehhh?! D-did I really do that?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I was so spaced out, I didn't even notice...  
I-I'm very sorry.  
  
**Man：**  
Oh—no, I'm not mad at you or anything.  
I just wanted to make sure I didn't hurt you.  
Good to see you're all right. See ya, then.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
*sigh*... I really thought the dream might be coming true...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...H-huh?!  
Why am I feeling disappointed about that?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I wouldn't want that dream to actually happen!  
I-it's not like I really feel that way about...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  What's this about a dream?  
**Choice: (4)**  You're going kind of red. Are you OK?  
`Tag 3`  
**Kyoka：**  
Th-that's a secret!  
You're the last person I could possibly tell!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Kyoka：**  
I'm not blushing!  
And no, I'm not getting excited or anything!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Kyoka：**  
Really, it's nothing at all!  
Nothing you need to know about!  
  
**Narration：**  
Though Kyoka turned away from {player} in a huff,  
her cheeks remained bright red for quite a while afterwards.
