**Narration：**  
{player} has promised to play with Kyoka today,  
but he finds himself somewhat delayed.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahh! {player}, you're late!  
 Hurry up, won't you?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Honestly, a grown-up like you showing up this late...  
Be a little more responsible!  
 Wait... huh?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
{player}... What's this light?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
It feels like it's getting brighter and brighter...  
{player}...?!

**Kyoka：**  
Honestly...  
What possessed you to let all this homework build up?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Really... This was always going to happen  
if you kept putting it off, you know!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Have you forgotten what day it is today?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
You promised you'd take me out to play today, didn't you?  
But with all this homework, you can't leave the house!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
*sigh*... Well, getting mad at you now  
isn't going to make the homework go away.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
We still have the rest of the day to fix this.  
Let's get through your homework quickly, and then go out to play!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I'll monitor your progress, so let's see some effort!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
How's it going?  
You think you'll be finished soon?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  There's no end in sight. Help me...  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm totally beat. Do the rest for me...  
`Tag 1`  
**Kyoka：**  
...Are you being serious right now?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
How is a kid like me supposed to solve high-school-level problems?!  
Honestly. Try to think a little before you speak!

`Tag 2`  
**Kyoka：**  
What are you talking about?! Honestly...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
The point of homework is to put in the effort yourself!  
You can't cheat your way out of it!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kyoka：**  
Still... Hold on a moment.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I can't help with the homework, but I could do other things...  
Perhaps I'll see what I can do to help you concentrate.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
For starters, let's see now...  
Oh, I'll fetch you something to drink.  
Here, let me borrow your glass.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Thank you for waiting.  
I've brought a nice glass of water.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Is there anything else you'd like me to do?  
If it'll help get your homework finished, I'll help however I can.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You could tidy my room.  
**Choice: (5)**  You could pat me on the head.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kyoka：**  
Tidy your room, you say?  
I suppose a messy room can be distracting  
when you're trying to concentrate.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
All right, then.  
You can leave it to me.

`Tag 5`  
**Kyoka：**  
Y-you want headpats for encouragement?  
You really are like a little child...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
S-still... If it will really help you concentrate,  
I suppose I can't say no.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
There you go.  
Do your best with your studies, all right?  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Kyoka：**  
How's that?  
Do you think you can concentrate now?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Yes, you seem to be making good progress.  
Thank goodness.  
Let me know if there's anything else I can—  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ah... D-don't get me wrong, now!  
It's not like I'm helping out for your sake or anything!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I just need you to finish so I can go out and play!  
That's really the only reason, so...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
So come on! If you have time to waste thanking me,  
use it to get that homework done already!  
You're still only about halfway through!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Honestly...  
Sometimes I think you're completely hopeless without me to help you.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Whew... It looks like all your homework is finally done.  
You really worked hard.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
B-but...  
It's getting dark outside, so I should head home...  
We didn't get to play together at all...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Honestly! This is all your fault, {player}!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
What's that...?  
As thanks for today, next time you have a day off,  
you'll spend the whole day with me?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
You mean that? You'll really play with me for the whole day?  
I'll be really mad if you mess it up like you did today.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Still, a whole day together, huh...  
I suppose that's enough for me to forgive you.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Heheh.  
I'll be looking forward to your next day off.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Well then, {player}.  
I'll see you another time.

**Ameth：**  
*sigh*... You need a grade schooler's help to do your homework?  
That's kind of pathetic, you know!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh, what you just saw was a little dream I created for you  
using fragments of your and Kyoka's memories.  
  
**Ameth：**  
How was it? Ring any bells?  
Well, I doubt you'd recall much just yet.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Maybe if you collect more memories for me,  
I'll be able to show you more dreams.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Dreaming of the moments you spent with all sorts of girls...  
That's how you'll reach the truth of this world.  
So good luck!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, I'll see you around!

**Kyoka：**  
Unhh... Huh...? Where am I?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh, right...  
I was supposed to be meeting up with {player},  
but then there was a strange light...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
{player}, are you all right?  
I'm... fine, though I had an odd sort of dream...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...You dreamed of studying hard in a room you didn't recognize?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
That sounds like the same dream I had.  
What a strange turn of events.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Were we both asleep standing up?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Wait, this isn't the time for that!  
{player}, why did you show up so late?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Honestly... Just like in that dream, it looks like you're  
pretty hopeless without me to keep an eye on you.
