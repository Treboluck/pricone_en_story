## Subtitle: A Delicious Reunion
  
**Pecorine：**  
Welcome to our humble restaurant!  
How many seats do you need?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A table for one?  
Will that be smoking or non-smoking?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Non-smoking it is!  
Then let me show you to your place!  
It's right this way! Follow me!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Hmm?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hang on...  
I feel like...  
I've seen you somewhere before...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhhh?!  
You're that lovely young man who treated me  
to a delicious bowl of rice!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
In other words,  
my Ricebowl Prince! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm?  
You're not a prince, you're {player}?  
I don't think I remember that name. Hmmmm...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So sorry!  
I think the rice blew everything else clean out of my mind!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
But you know,  
that rice really was crazy delicious!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I won't forget what you did for me as long as I live!  
I'm so thankful I could fall in love!  
I'll remember your name this time, too, don't you worry! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yayyy!  
It's so nice to suddenly see you again like this!  
It's got to be destiny, don't you think?! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, by the way,  
I started working here  
as a part-time waitress just recently!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I've spent a long time travelling for various reasons,  
so I'm usually pretty strapped for cash!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So occasionally I come back home to Landosol,  
and work at cafes and restaurants to fund my travels!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
'Cause at places like this,  
I get to eat the delicious food they serve to their staff!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oopsie-daisy...  
I was so thrilled to see you,  
I kind of stood around chatting, didn't I?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You're not much for reactions, are you, {player}?  
Such a blank face!  
Umm... you *do* remember me, don't you?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm? \"Pecorine\"...?  
Oh, yes! You guys gave me a nickname, didn't you?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
It sounds pretty cute, actually, \"Pecorine\"!  
I think I might have taken a liking to it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
By the way, is, um... that little girl...  
You know, the lovely girl who served me all that steaming rice  
without a single complaint!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
In other words,  
my Ricebowl Princess! Is she not with you?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm?  
She's not a princess,  
she's Kokkoro?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, right...  
I'm really sorry.  
When my stomach gets empty, I'm terrible at remembering things!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I think the blood doesn't reach my head,  
so I kind of space out a bit!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Still, forgetting my saviors' names,  
that's like the rudest thing ever!  
I'm so sorry!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Ahhh...  
All this talk of food has set my stomach a-rumbling!  
I'm dying for a bite!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I need calories, ASAP!  
Anything that'll fit in my belly!  
As long as it's not poison, I'll take it!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You sure do get hungry a lot.  
**Choice: (2)**  Can I sit down yet?  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheh!  
They don't call me  
the perpetually peckish Pecorine for nothing!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahah, I think this name fits me better than my real one!  
It's the best nickname I've ever heard!  
How crazy is that?! ☆  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhhh right, I was showing you to your seat!  
I'm so sorry!  
Our little chat was so much fun, I got carried away!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhhhh, I'm going to get my pay docked at this rate!  
How crazy is that?!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Come along, right this way!  
Take a seat and make yourself comfy!  
Here's the menu for you to browse!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Just so you know, this place serves some crazy seafood!  
It's out of this world!  
You've gotta try it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
Apparently they use a high-speed carriage service  
to bring the fish from a distant gulf, keeping it fresh with magic!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The sea urchins are totally to die for!  
I could sure go for some...  
Oops, I think I'm drooling...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What's the matter?  
{player}?  
You look kind of... concerned.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh?  
You don't know what you're supposed to do?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Could it be...  
this is your first time coming to a restaurant?  
Are you not sure how to place an order?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, I get that!  
I had a hard time too  
when it was my first time!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I remember thinking  
if I just sat there, the food would arrive automatically!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm?  
Could it be  
you can't actually read the menu?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I thought our country  
was supposed to have almost a 100% literacy rate...  
But I guess you can never account for everyone!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
All right, then!  
How about I help you place your order?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It can be my way of thanking you for filling my stomach  
when I was about to die alone in the woods!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Though a little thing like this  
might not really be enough to thank you...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
Let me sit down next to you.  
Excusey-me!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wow, I can see how you'd have trouble—  
there's nothing but text on this menu!  
They ought to add pictures and stuff!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Is there anything specific you're after?  
Or shall I quickly go over everything?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh!  
The tuna in this dish has the most succulent fatty bits!  
It's like dessert in fish form!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
By the way,  
how much are you looking to spend?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This restaurant's actually pretty upscale,  
so if you order too much, you'll empty your wallet in no time!  
How crazy is that?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? You don't have any money?  
Then... why did you come in here to begin with?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm, I see...  
You were following the delicious smell?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You're just like a stray animal!  
That's so cute!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
All righty, then!  
Then just this once,  
I'll treat you to a meal myself!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Today's my payday anyway,  
so I have a bit of cash to spare!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And I do need to repay you for what you did for me!  
So let's make it a real feast!  
I'll order all my favorites!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh~!  
What should I go for first?! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Actually, my waitressing shift is just about over now.  
So we can dig in together!  
Let's have ourselves a friendly little dinner!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Of course...  
That's only if you wouldn't mind...  
 of course.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh!  
Food always tastes better  
when you have someone to share it with, don't you think?
