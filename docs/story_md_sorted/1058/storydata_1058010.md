**Narration：**  
Pecorine and {player} have begun their trek together,  
making their way into the forests outside of Landosol.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The sun'll go down soon,  
 so let's rest up here for today.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll be getting the tent ready,  
so {player}, can you start the campfire for me?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? Won't it be tough to set up the whole tent on my own?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh.  
 You just love to worry about me, don't you,  
you kindhearted little charmer!  
I appreciate it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But I'll be just fine!  
I mean, I've been on all kinds of travels on my own.  
I can whip up a tent like this in no time at all!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Honestly, I'm more worried about you.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't forget to watch out for nasty monsters lurking nearby  
while you're gathering the firewood!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well then, let's get to work, shall we?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
There—the tent's all ready to use! ♪  
Looks like the fire's coming along nicely, too!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhh?! Suddenly I feel super hungry!  
Eheheh... ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
All right, let's cook something up with those ingredients we bought!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I think we should start with a salad.  
I'll cut these veggies...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let me help.  
**Choice: (2)**  Leave it to me.  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh,  
 thank you very much!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But when I taught you to use a knife before,  
you seemed pretty unsure of yourself...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Will you be OK this time?  
Let me watch and judge your technique!

`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh! You're such a go-getter!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But last time I saw you use a knife,  
I don't think you'd exactly mastered it...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhhhh!  
You're doing really well there!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh yes,  
 my worries are melting away!  
Let me guess—you've been practicing?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You must've worked hard, my Ricebowl Prince! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well then, I'll leave the salad in your capable hands  
and start work on the main dish: monster curry!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? When did I get my hands on monster meat, you ask?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, of course, I'm going to hunt one right now!  
Food always tastes best when you use the freshest ingredients!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
All right then, I'll be back in a jiffy!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm baaaack!  
And I caught a real meaty-looking monster!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  That was fast!  
`Tag 4`  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, naturally! I can hardly wait to dig in, after all!  
Now then, let's get down to some cooking!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If I stew this monster up till it's nice and juicy,  
all the natural flavor will seep out to make the perfect curry sauce!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ta-daaaa! ♪  
One Pecorine Special Monster Curry, ready to eat! ☆

**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh~! ♪ My stomach's stuffed!  
I knew the food you eat with friends  
 is always the tastiest!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let's hold on to this satisfied feeling  
and get a good night's sleep, shall we?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wait, huh? What's the matter?  
Why are you staring at my face?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
U-ummm,  
 when you stare so hard,  
even I'm gonna get embarrassed... You'll make me blush!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Aren't you going to train?  
**Choice: (6)**  I feel like we're forgetting something...  
`Tag 5`  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? Training...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
O-ohhh,

Silly old me—I almost forgot all about it!  
 Ahahaha...

`Tag 6`  
**Pecorine：**  
Forgetting something? Something like what?  
We already had seconds...  
Some light exercise for digestion, maybe...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh! This is a training journey, isn't it?!  
Of course we have to train!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll just ready my sword...  
 No, wait, that's my knife!  
Oh, I'm such a klutz today!  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Pecorine：**  
Okay then, sword in hand... Time for practice swings!  
Hahh! Yahh... Hyahh!

Next, I think I'll try some speedy strikes!  
There! Gotcha! Hiyahhh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh? Are you joining in too, {player}?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm...  
 You're still only a beginner.  
Wild swings like that won't get you far in a real battle!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Lower your weight, and try to steady your stance!  
Then, muster all your strength, and...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hyaaah! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's the basic strike!  
Go on, try it for yourself!

**Pecorine：**  
Yep, yep!  
 That's a lot better already! ♪  
Remember those motions,  
 and practice them once in a while!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? You want me to teach you more?  
You've got to get strong enough to protect everyone, huh?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Don't you worry, {player}.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
As long as you hold on to that feeling,  
I'm quite certain you'll be as strong as a real knight in no time!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
 You're such a gallant guy!  
Do you even realize how cool you sound when you say this stuff?  
Whew-ee! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
{player}, defending someone as a knight, huh?  
If only that someone could be me...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wait... no, no, no!  
Why am I even thinking stuff like this?!  
 Out, bad thoughts!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
N-now then, {player}!  
 Let's get back to training! ♪  
I'm feeling ready to swing this sword till I drop from exhaustion!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
First up, let's get you strong enough to keep yourself safe!  
I'll give you plenty of practice, so come at me!

So {player} and Pecorine sparred together  
until the sun sank all the way down below the horizon.
