**Pecorine：**  
*munch munch munch*  
*munch munch munch munch*  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*glug glug glug*...  
Whewwww! My throat is in heaven right now!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
At times like this, I realize that taste sensations  
aren't just about what happens on your tongue!  
How crazy is that?! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hey, excuse me!  
Could I put in an additional order?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Give me one of everything on the menu!  
And I'm talking extra-large portions!  
Eheheh! You bet I'm sure!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Mmmmhhh...  
Ahhhh... I can feel the food starting to digest...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
My stomach is working like a well-oiled machine!  
The nutrients are spreading through all my body's cells!  
Ahhhh, I'm so happy to have been born! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm?  
Oh, {player}! Over here, over here!  
  
![300100103.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/300100103.webp)  
**Pecorine：**  
I guess you couldn't see me behind that mountain of food, huh?  
Sorry about that!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
Sorry, when I get stressed I eat to blow off steam...

**Pecorine：**  
Huh?  
You think I'm eating... too much?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Nah, I'm fine!  
The human stomach can hold a whole lot more than this!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If I digest it fast enough, I can keep eating forever!  
Humanity's potential knows no limits!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well... I guess under normal circumstances,  
I would have enough restraint  
to avoid clearing out the whole restaurant...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But today,  
I really just wanted to eat and eat  
and forget everything.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Because, like... Well, you know...  
Lately, those officials have been chasing after me constantly.  
It's kind of been stressing me out.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Th-they have the nerve to call me a wanted criminal!  
Even though I did nothing wrong!  
Did you ever hear anything so ridiculous?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? No, no, no!  
I really didn't commit any crimes!  
Not that anybody believes me when I tell them!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
{player}, do you...  
think I must be the bad guy here, as well?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh... If you keep hanging around me,  
you and Kokkoro, and Karyl too,  
will all get mixed up in this ugly business...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So maybe...  
I really should set off soon  
for somewhere far away...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wahhh?!  
Ahh... Wh-why are you suddenly hugging me so tightly?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Are you actually begging me not to leave?  
Aww, you're like a little baby!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahh... Careful there!  
I loosened up my clothes a bit to make sure all the food would fit,  
so they might come off if you tug them too much...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhhh! Stop! Stop!  
This really could go crazy bad!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh... But knowing that you still believe in me...  
That you still care about me...  
That makes me so happy!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Thank you.  
I guess you really are my savior,  
{player}!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Just being with you like this  
makes my stomach feel full and satisfied!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wahh...?  
{player}, you're doing that glowing thing again!  
  

---  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"{player}~!  
Heyas! ☆\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"It's been a while, huh?!  
You weren't busy or anything, were you?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"You really helped me out that one time,  
so I dropped by to thank you properly!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Here you go! A token of my appreciation!  
It's a specialty from my homeland, you know!  
You can share it with your family!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"It's not super perishable or anything,  
but try to eat it up while it's nice and fresh!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"...Hmm?  
Umm...? My translator is working properly, right?  
You *can* tell... what I'm saying, right?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Uh-oh...!  
Don't tell me you've forgotten all about me?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"That would be so sad...  
I really thought we were going to be friends...\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Hmm?  
Hang on,  
what's with that reaction?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Ahh! Ahhhh!  
You can't just say my name like that!  
You never know who might be listening!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Umm... I guess this means...  
You've gone and found out...  
who I really am, huh?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Well, they have been covering it on the news and stuff,  
so I guess it was bound to happen.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"But if you act all distant like that,  
it makes me kind of sad...\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"I'd be much happier if you could just talk to me normally,  
like an ordinary friend your own age.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Huh? You want me to come... inside?  
Ahaha! I wasn't planning to stick around that long...\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"But it would be a shame to turn down  
an invitation into your home,  
so I guess I'll pop inside!\"

**Pecorine：**  
\"Ooh, it's all so different!  
So this is what your place looks like inside...  
How crazy is that?!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Huh? Oh, hahah...  
Well, it's true that I'm technically a princess...\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"But the country I come from isn't exactly wealthy,  
so it's not like my home is very fancy.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"I wasn't being all like,  
'Wow, commoners' houses are so small!' or anything!  
I was interested by the style of architecture, that's all!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"And your electronics are way cooler than the ones back home.  
The air conditioner and TV and stuff!\"  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Care for some tea, Your Highness?  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
\"No no no,  
please don't call me that!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Ooh?  
Ahhh, this is barley tea, isn't it?!  
I was so thirsty—you're a total lifesaver!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Let me take a swig!  
*gulp* *gulp*  
Ahhhh, such a new and unfamiliar taste!\"  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Yup!  
I've been a big fan of travelling since I was little...\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Nothing gets me more excited  
than exploring new cultures and new experiences!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"That's why I begged my father  
to let me come along on his diplomatic trip around the world!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Japan is a particular favorite of mine!  
The food is so delectable...!\"  
  
`Tag 3`

**Pecorine：**  
\"...Whew...  
Anyway, I think I've made myself comfortable now.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"We're indoors, and it looks like nobody else is around...  
So, since we're friends, I should introduce myself properly.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"My name...  
My real name... is Eustiana.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Eustiana von Astraea.  
It's a bit long and over-the-top, isn't it?  
Please feel free to just call me Tiana for short!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Or if you'd prefer,  
you can stick with Pecorine!  
I've got nothing against cute nicknames!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Yes, that's right!  
The continent of Astraea  
in Legend of Astrum...\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"...is actually named after  
my very own family!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"My homeland, or rather its royal family,  
is the main sponsor of Legend of Astrum, you see.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"So I guess the developers wanted to pay their respects.  
Sneaking our name in there like that!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"It's not just funding, either.  
We support the game pretty proactively,  
providing manpower and server space and stuff.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"The thing about my homeland is,  
we're a bit behind the curve when it comes to tech stuff,  
so this is a rare opportunity for us!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Of course, as a rule, Astrum,  
or rather Minerva, is overseen by a UN council...  
So officially, we're just one of its many sponsors.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"But for our nation,  
it's an important project, both politically and economically.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"So you can imagine the panic we went through  
thanks to that whole incident with Minerva's awakening!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Officially, this visit to Japan is a normal diplomatic affair,  
but my parents have been pretty busy  
with investigations and meetings about the incident.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Myself, I'm staying out of politics  
until the day I come of age,  
so I haven't really been busy at all...\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Which is why that day I first met you,  
I was just exploring the town incognito.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"...Eheheh.  
You do still seem a bit nervous, don't you?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"I'm just another human being like yourself, you know!  
There's no need to give me special treatment!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Come on now, {player}!  
Over in the Legend of Astrum world,  
everyone's goal is to become a princess, right?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Maybe one of your own party members  
will become a princess someday, just like me!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"So this could be a good opportunity  
to get used to hanging out with royalty!\"

**Ameth：**  
Guahh! She actually said it!  
Her real name!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ahhhh... Eusti... what was it, again?  
Aw man, I should have written it down!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Actually though,  
I feel like I've heard it somewhere before...  
 Hmmm...?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Since Pecorine's a proper VIP,  
her data's trickier to access than most...  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm sorry, {player}.  
I want to look into something,  
so I'm going to end your dream here for now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I didn't expect a bombshell like that!  
It sure is a good thing you made friends with that girl.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She might just be  
exactly the stepping stone we need  
to close in on this world's mysteries...  
  
**Ameth：**  
From here on out,  
we'll have to proceed with extra caution.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, until next time, {player}.  
Do take good care of Pecorine, OK?  
  
**Ameth：**  
It looks like she's a real live princess, after all.  
We don't want to cause any international incidents,  
so be careful how you treat her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hmmm...  
I guess Pecorine herself was asking you to treat her  
like any other girl, though...  
  
**Ameth：**  
So, well, perhaps it's best  
if you keep just hanging out together and having friendly meals.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's a tricky one to judge, but I'm sure it'll be fine.  
You seem to have quite the knack  
for making yourself popular with girls, after all!  
  

---  
  
**Pecorine：**  
{player}...?  
The extra food I ordered has arrived!  
Let's dig in together!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Are you all right?  
I feel like you're looking a bit paler than usual...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? \"Tiana\"?!  
Wh-wha?! Where did you hear that name?  
Ummmm...?! I don't think I ever said it...?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, but I guess...  
It might have slipped out  
back at the submission counter...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhhh... I really don't want to get  
you and the others mixed up in my problems...  
So could you forget you heard anything? For now, at least.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I mean, we know each other pretty well now...  
So maybe it's silly of me to keep saying this...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But this really is my problem.  
And I want to try to handle it myself.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
More to the point, let's get started on the food!  
Whether you're a princess or a commoner,  
everyone needs to eat to live!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And of course,  
eating tasty food is a surefire way  
to fill your life with at least a little happiness.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It was you—you and your friends—  
who taught me that important lesson  
when I felt like I'd lost everything!
