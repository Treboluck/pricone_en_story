Pecorine asks {player} to help her out with something—namely, creating a guild of her own! Due to personal circumstances, she can't file the application herself, so she wants {player} to submit it in her place.

**Pecorine：**  
*munch munch munch*  
Mmmm, this is goooood! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhh boy!  
I've been eating nothing but fish lately,  
so some hearty meat really hits the spot!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm going to melt from happiness!  
These little fatty bits are like pure edible endorphins!  
How crazy is that?! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*chomp* *snarf* Mmmhhh!  
Awawahhhh!  
The juices are dancing a rondo on my tongue! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Thank you so much,  
{player}!  
You sure picked a great place for us to eat!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This barbecue restaurant is so tucked out of the way,  
I'd never have found it without someone to tip me off!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I never knew you had  
such a nose for good food, {player}!  
Heheheh... I like a boy who's loyal to his stomach!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Maybe we're actually pretty similar, you and me!  
We might be the perfect match!  
Shall we get married?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What do you mean, joking? I'm totally serious~!  
You seem to enjoy everything you eat so much,  
I love sharing a table with you at mealtimes! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But ah well, you do seem very popular around here.  
It would be a bit rude to try and keep you  
all for myself,  
 wouldn't it?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh, what's this?  
You seem to have stopped eating!  
Don't tell me you're full already?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Come on, I know it's fun grilling the meat slices,  
but you mustn't forget to actually eat them!  
Tasty meat is the spice of life!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oopsie...  
I guess we're out of meat to grill.  
Mind if I order us another batch?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't worry, don't worry!  
I'll make sure to foot the bill  
for everything that goes in my belly!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
I've been working a lot at that waitressing job lately,  
so I've saved up quite a bit of cash!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
In theory, it should mostly be going towards  
funding my training journey...  
But look! My purse is practically bursting right now!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I think for now,  
these savings should probably be enough to work with,  
so I'm thinking I'll set off again pretty soon.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Of course, when I run out of funds,  
I'll come running straight back.  
Here to lovely old Landosol!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So try not to forget me,  
even if I'm not always around...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll make sure to tell you  
lots of fun stories about all my travels!  
So when I get back, let's have plenty of meals together!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You and me, and Kokkoro and Karyl...  
All of us together...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
I'm sorry.  
I guess I'm getting a bit emotional, aren't I...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Right! I'm gonna order a mountain of meat!  
I hope you'll join me, {player}!  
Let's eat till our stomachs explode! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Look at this one—it says they've got \"premium ribs\"!  
Doesn't that sound incredible...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Praise be to whatever god gave us delicious cows!  
And to my parents, for letting me eat them!  
I'm so happy to have been born into this world!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
C'mon, {player}!  
Let me share my happiness with you!  
Big hugs~!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Um, that's a little awkward...  
**Choice: (2)**  Bright and cheerful, that's our Peco!  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhhh~?  
Are you getting all embarrassed, {player}?  
Well, you are a boy, after all...! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I guess I am a bit more touchy-feely than most people.  
Maybe when I'm around boys like you,  
I should be a bit more careful with boundaries!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
Wouldn't want people thinking I'm some kind of floozy!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Peco\"?!  
My nickname got nicknamed!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
One nickname was already thrilling enough,  
but to have it shortened even further?!  
It's like we're the bestest of besties! I love it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Isn't having friends  
just the craziest thing?! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Yes, I do feel like  
my life is full of happiness.  
Especially recently.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Sometimes I even think...  
If I could go on living as plain old Pecorine forever,  
nothing could make me happier!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, look.  
I think they're ready to take our order,  
so let's make it a nice big one!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Bring us everything from here...  
right down to the bottom of the page!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't you worry about money,  
I've got plenty of it right here!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh!  
I think I'm just about ready  
to gobble up a whole cow! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Oh!  
I was so enamored by the meat that I almost forgot—  
there was a favor I wanted to ask of you!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Honestly, I can be such a ditz!  
When there's food in front of me,  
I might even forget my own name sometimes!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This is all your fault, {player}...  
Of all the places we could come,  
you had to pick out this scrumptious meaty heaven!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I was originally planning  
to just sit down for a chat at a cafe or something!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, there's no need to get all nervous, you know!  
When I say a favor, it's not like I mean anything too serious.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
You're a pretty responsible guy, aren't you?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Um, so let's see.  
The thing is,  
I've been thinking about starting a guild of my own!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But there's one problem.  
Thanks to certain circumstances,  
I can't really show my face in government facilities.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So I was wondering if it would be okay  
if I asked you to handle the actual application for me.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't worry, I'll provide all the necessary funds  
and prepare the paperwork!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I just need you to give me a hand  
with actually submitting it for inspection.  
...Would that be too much trouble?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, it's not like I'm in a huge hurry,  
so by all means feel free to go home and think it over!  
For now, let's just enjoy the meal in front of us!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Viva... meaty goodness! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
There really isn't anything else in the world like good food!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No matter what worries you have,  
it just blows them all clean out of your mind!
