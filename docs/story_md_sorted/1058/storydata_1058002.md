# Pecorine Episode 2
{player} has some ingredients to spare, so he brings them to the restaurant where Pecorine works. She offers to make a meal out of them, and is entertained by his clumsy but earnest efforts to learn how to cook.
  
## Subtitle: Now Accepting Ingredients!
  
**???：**  
Welcome to our humble restaurant! ☆  
  
**???：**  
Oh, but I'm sorry!  
I'm afraid we already took the last orders for today,  
so there's not much point coming inside right now!  
  
**???：**  
I'll give you a coupon for a discount,  
so please do come back some other day!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Wait, huh?  
{player}, it's you!  
Heyas!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You seem to come here a lot lately!  
Did you get addicted to our fishy treats?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I totally get that!  
When you get a hankering for seafood, nothing else will do!  
The aroma of the soy-based sauce, the funny taste of the little organs!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Mmmm!  
It's enough to drive a girl crazy!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If you appreciate flavors like this,  
you must have the taste of a king!  
You're a real gourmet!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm?  
You're not here to eat dinner today?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But why else would you come to a restaurant?  
Are you lost?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I was just about to clean up and head home,  
so I could show you the way if you like!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm, I see.  
So Kokkoro accidentally bought too much fish?  
And you weren't sure what to do with it, so you brought it here?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You thought it would be better  
to give it to some real chefs rather than let it go to waste?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, that makes sense!  
A fine attitude if I ever heard one!  
Nobody likes a food-waster!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I always had the impression  
Kokkoro was more of the careful sort...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But I guess even she can make mistakes!  
I'm a little surprised!  
Isn't that just the cutest?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But you know,  
like I was just saying before,  
we were just about to close up the restaurant.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And actually,  
we have a policy against accepting just any old ingredients.  
So we can't really serve these here...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh! No need for such a sorrowful face!  
Don't you worry!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm the last person in the whole world  
who would let valuable ingredients go to waste!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmmm...  
Let me go talk to the manager  
and see if he'll let us use the kitchen.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We can pickle and smoke some of them for preservation,  
and I'll cook up the rest to eat right here and now!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
How does that sound to you?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, and don't worry,  
I'll pay a pretty penny for everything that goes in my belly!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...You don't need payment?  
It was only going to go in the trash  
if you couldn't use it anyway?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, we can't have that!  
When I eat a good meal, I pay for it!  
No need for charity with me!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well then,  
you just wait here a minute!  
I'll see what I can cook up in a jiffy!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If you aren't totally full,  
do feel free to have some yourself once it's ready!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Now let's see  
the fish we're working with!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh! What a fishy aroma!  
Smells like the ocean's blessings! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This is the stuff!  
Scents like this are what gets my stomach rumbling!  
How crazy is that?! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Right then! Time to get cooking!  
{player}, you take a seat over there  
and wait for me to get back!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hey, manager!  
I'm going to borrow the kitchen for a bit, all right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...What's this?  
Are you following me into the kitchen?  
Couldn't bear to be apart from me for a second, huh?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh?  
You'd like it if I could teach you  
how to cook for yourself?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You feel kind of bad letting Kokkoro do all the cooking,  
so you want to learn how to do it too?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, sure thing!  
You know it!  
Cooking food is almost as fun as eating it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And everyone loves a man who can cook these days!  
The girls will be all over you!  
A regular Romeo!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well then, go wash your hands  
and put a little disinfectant on them.  
You know how to do that?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I've got a spare apron you can borrow,  
so let me just adjust it to fit you!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh, don't move about so much!  
Does that tickle?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Resist Pecorine's roving hands.  
**Choice: (2)**  Submit to the tickles.  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, so it's going to be like that, is it?  
What a cheeky boy!  
But being a rascal just makes you cuter!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
How d'you like this spot, then?!  
Bet that one tickles, doesn't it?!  
Coochie-coochie-coo!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
S-sorry!  
I think I might have gotten a bit carried away!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That was a bit rude of me!  
I'll be nicer in future!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhh?  
You're just going to take it, huh?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You're a very accepting person,  
aren't you, {player}?  
I like that in a guy!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Here, how'd you like this?!  
Coochie-coochie-coo!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Somehow I'm starting to feel like  
I'm tormenting an innocent child...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm really sorry!  
That's enough messing around!  
Let's get back to cooking!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Cooking is war,  
and the kitchen is the battlefield!  
So we'd better take it nice and seriously!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Right, are you all ready to cook?  
Yep, just dry yourself off on the towel over there!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm...  
It'd be quicker if I cooked everything myself,  
but I'll settle for giving you instructions, okay?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Allow me to educate you  
in the ABC's of making delicious food!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
When we're cooking side by side like this,  
we almost look like newlyweds, don't we?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wahhh!  
Stop right there, {player}!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's not how you hold the knife at all!  
You'll hurt yourself doing that!  
Careful, careful!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Look, you want to... hold it this way! See?  
Do you get it?  
Yep, that's how you do it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahahah...  
Actually, rather than newlyweds,  
I feel almost like a mother teaching her kid!
