**Pecorine：**  
Ooh, {player}!  
Heyas!  
We seem to be running into each other a lot lately! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What are you up to in a place like this?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The sea's a dangerous place at night, you know?  
There are some pretty crazy monsters lurking out there!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And the water itself goes pitch-black, too,  
so if you fall under the surface, you're in trouble!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Unless you're a real swimming champ,  
you'll drown before you can figure out which way is up!  
Ahahah! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm?  
What are you doing down there?  
Just sitting all alone on the empty sand...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Are you feeling depressed about something?  
You poor thing!  
If you need someone to talk to, I'm always willing!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Listening to the worries of the populace  
is supposed to be one of our duties, after all!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm, I see... So to sum things up...  
You wanted to cook up that dish I taught you how to make,  
so you came here to fish up the main ingredient?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, I can understand that.  
Fishing it up yourself is way cheaper than buying it at a store!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But you didn't manage to catch a single fish,  
so you're in a bit of a pickle?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Mm, yes... Because of the monsters 'round these parts,  
the fish around here are wary of everything.  
They can't let their guard down, else they'd get gobbled right up!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Anyway, it's no good trying to catch them with your hands!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You should at least bring some kind of rod or net.  
Do you want me to show you how it's done?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheh!  
Actually, I came here to fish up some ingredients myself,  
for the restaurant I've been working at!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I brought some fishing gear with me,  
so you can borrow it if you like!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Wow, thanks!  
**Choice: (2)**  Oh no, I couldn't...  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha!  
No need to thank me, really!  
Friends help friends in trouble!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And besides... The desire to eat tasty things!  
To cook delicious dishes! To catch the finest ingredients!  
Those feelings are what I'm all about!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eating is living, that's what I always say!  
And when I see someone trying to live life to the fullest,  
I can't help but want to cheer them on!

`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Really?  
You don't need to hold anything back with me!  
We're friends, aren't we?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, are you thinking I'll need the rod for myself?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't you worry about that!  
I'm a proper veteran at this!  
If it comes down to it, I can even catch fish with my bare hands!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I've been travelling all across the land,  
and when I get hungry on the road,  
I tend to grab a bite to eat from the nearest mountain or river!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So gathering ingredients like this  
is like second nature to me!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Here, take my rod!  
Don't be shy!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll even show you a secret fishing spot I found!  
There's a little bay not that far from here!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's packed to the brim with all sorts of nutritious fishies,  
so you can take your pick!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, hang on.  
Wait here a moment, would you?  
I need to find us some bait.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Here we go...  
If I just flip over a big rock or two...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We can catch the creepy-crawlies that come out,  
mince them up and make a baity ball!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Here, let's stick this on the end of the line!  
Of course, it's even better if you use live bait...  
But sticking the hook through a live bug is tricky in the dark.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
There! I think that should do it!  
I added a few little flairs of my own  
to make it look appetizing!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Now you want to take the rod,  
grip it tightly so it won't fly out of your hands...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Then give it a great big flick,  
and hurl the line out as far as you can manage!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, you're good at this!  
Right! Now all we need to do is wait for a bite!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If you don't feel anything for a while,  
they might have gobbled the bait clean off the hook,  
so it's good to reel it in and check.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And if you still can't catch anything,  
it's a good idea to move to a different spot.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Now I'm going to set up my net trap,  
so I'll be right back!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
When tomorrow morning comes around,  
this thing's going to be totally full of little tasty fishies!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm?  
What's wrong, {player}?  
You gave a weird sort of grunt just now...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whoa! There's something on your line!  
How crazy is that?!  
It looks like someone already took the bait!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Reel it in, reel it in!  
You've gotta be quick!

**Pecorine：**  
Ohhhh heck,  
I'd better give you a hand with this one!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Here, I'm gonna reach around you from behind!  
If it bothers you,  
let me know, okay?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whoaaa! This one's a real fighter!  
I think we're in for a big catch!  
You might just be a natural at this, {player}!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhhh, don't pull too suddenly!  
Slowly but surely... That's right!  
You mustn't let the line snap!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes, that's the way!  
You're doing great!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Judging from this strength,  
we might be dealing with a monster rather than a regular fish!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whoa-oa-oa?!  
We're both pulling together,  
but it's still almost yanking us into the ocean!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Forget snapping the line,  
we might snap the whole rod if we're not careful!  
How crazy is that?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Dig your feet in hard, {player}!  
For the sake of delicious food!  
Hrngggghhhh...!  
  
`image display end`  
**Pecorine：**  
Fish incoming!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oohhhhh! This really is a fish and a half!  
I've never seen one like it!  
I wonder what it tastes like?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Congratulations, {player}!  
Cooking up and eating a fish that you caught yourself  
is the best feeling in the world!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Honestly, I'm jealous!  
What I would give for a catch like this!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? You'll share it with me?!  
Because you couldn't have caught it without my help...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wowwww!  
{player}, you are the world's nicest guy!  
Can I fall in love with you?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Right then,  
I'll chop this fella up and make him into a perfect meal!  
I won't hold anything back for this one!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You'd better be ready for a feast,  
{player}!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And then we can put those calories to work  
fishing up a whole bunch more!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Tonight's fishing bonanza is just getting started!  
With your luck on our side, we'll have the greatest haul!  
Ahahah! ☆
