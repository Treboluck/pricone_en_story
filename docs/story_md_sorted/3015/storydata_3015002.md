{player} enrolls at Lucent Academy, where it's decided he'll sit next to whoever knows him best. Sparks fly between the three who have already met him, but in the end, the entire class has to shuffle their seats around.
  
## Subtitle: New Student Shuffle!
  
**Narration：**  
Several days have passed since Io came to Lucent Academy.  
  
**Narration：**  
She's just about to start homeroom for Misaki and Suzuna's  
class.  
  
**Io：**  
I've got exciting news, everybody.  
We'll be welcoming a new student to our class today!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
So like, a transfer student?  
  
**Misaki：**  
They transferred here knowing it's gonna be shut down?  
What a weirdo.  
  
**Io：**  
Our new student is an acquaintance of mine.  
He said he wanted to attend school, so I invited him  
to enroll. Everyone be nice to him, okay?  
  
**Io：**  
Come on in, {player}.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Wait... {player}?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh, it's whiz-boy!  
I already know the transfer student! Lol!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I didn't think it was possible, but somehow I knew it'd  
be you!  
Wait, Suzuna, you know him too?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
For sure! We're totes BFFs.  
We just like, gel, y'know?  
  
**Io：**  
Oh, {player}, that's so nice that you already have friends!  
I'm sure you'll adjust to your new school in no time.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
With you around, studying might actually be fun.  
Oh, whiz-boy, you can sit next to me. That way you can help me  
with the stuff I don't know!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hey, who put you in charge?  
{player}, you sit next to me!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I get you're like a blank slate, Suzuna, but I doubt  
{player} can help you.  
I'll teach him how to do  
his classwork!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Misaki, your grades are just as bad as mine!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
If anything, mine are even a teeny bit better. So if either  
of us is gonna tutor this wise guy, I'm like, the better pick.  
Whiz-boy, you sit next to me. Case closed!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Case not closed! Why do you get to decide?  
  
**Io：**  
She doesn't.  
This is making things difficult for {player}.  
  
**Io：**  
Let's avoid any conflict. We'll sit you right up front  
in the seat closest to me.

**Misaki：**  
Wait, that's not fair at all!  
I object!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Me too!  
Whiz-boy is gonna sit next to me!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Stop talking like you're in charge.  
  
**Io：**  
*sigh* This is starting to be a problem.  
We need to assign you a seat before you can  
sit down.  
  
**Misaki：**  
How about this? Whoever knows {player} the best  
gets the seat closest to him.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Since you're new to the school, it'll be easier to focus on  
your studies if you sit close to someone who knows you  
really well.  
  
**Io：**  
I see. Wonderful idea!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
That's totally brilliant!  
Misaki, you're a genius.  
I'll go first!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Let's see, whiz-boy is like, a total whiz!  
He can even do percent math and stuff. He's way better  
at math than me,  
even though he doesn't do any homework!  
  
**Misaki：**  
{player}'s madly in love with me.  
 I don't blame him for  
falling for my mature, adult charms, but regardless,  
 he's  
totally head over heels!  
  
**Io：**  
{player} came to my rescue when I was totally stuck  
and needed help to get moving again.  
I'm so grateful to him!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Wow!  
Not bad, Io.  
  
**Misaki：**  
You had a good answer too, Suzuna.  
  
**Io：**  
I'm impressed, Misaki.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Looks like we have a three-way tie.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  No one said anything substantial.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll sit wherever, it's fine.  
`Tag 1`  
**Io：**  
You keep out of it!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzuna：**  
Zip it, whiz-boy!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Io：**  
Anyways, you're sitting in front of the podium.  
Understand?

**Suzuna：**  
Then I'm taking the desk  
to his left!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Fine, then I get the one to your right, {player}!  
Any objections?  
  
**Io：**  
Hmm. I'm fine with that.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Yeah, that's cool.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Good. So we all agree.  
Problem solved!  
  
**Io：**  
Yay!  
Okay, {player}, take the seat in front of my  
podium, please.  
  
**Io：**  
All right. That settles that! ♪  
  
**Schoolgirl：**  
Excuse me... The seat in front of the podium was mine.  
Where do I sit now?  
  
**Schoolboy：**  
Yeah, and we had the ones on either side of her...  
  
**Io, Suzuna & Misaki：**  
Oops.  
  
**Narration：**  
In the end, the entire class got new seats.
