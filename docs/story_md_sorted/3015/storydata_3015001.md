Upon learning that Lucent Academy is being shut down due to low student academic performance, Io decides to save the school by raising Misaki's and Suzuna's abysmal grades through extra special tutoring sessions.

**???：**  
WHAAAAT?!  
  
**???：**  
Whew, class is finally over! Hey Misaki, you wanna go  
somewhere and hang out?  
  
**Misaki：**  
This isn't the time to play around, Suzuna!  
Look at this!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
What's up? Something on the bulletin board?  
Oh, a new notice!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Umm... \"Notice of closure.  
Lucent Academy will be shut down  
in one year's time.\"  
  
**Suzuna：**  
For real? Lol! They actually close down schools?  
Huh? Wait a sec,  
isn't Lucent Academy...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Here!  
That's our school!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
What?! They're gonna axe our school?!  
That's like, so not cool!  
Devil emoji!  
  
**Misaki：**  
*sigh* Shut down...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Wait wait wait, you think we can maybe swoop in  
and get them to shut down the shutdown?  
  
**Misaki：**  
No way.  
We're just students.  
What could we even do?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hmm...  
Maybe like, clubs and stuff?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
If we're hella awesome in our clubs,  
and we help make  
the school super famous, then they can't shut it down,  
don'tcha think?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hmm. It's not the worst idea.  
But are you even in any clubs, or on any teams?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh right,  
I'm basically captain of the \"go home after class\"  
club.  
What about you, Misaki?  
  
**Misaki：**  
I'm not in any, either.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Shoot.  
Well, I'm kinda famous as a model.  
  
**Misaki：**  
That's got nothing to do with the school.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Uhh...  
Oh!  
What if we recruit some new students?  
If we get a whole buncha fresh faces,  
they won't be able to close the school!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Maybe,  
but how're we gonna do that?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Y'know like,  
we tell everyone if they come to Lucent  
Academy, they can beef their brain up or whatever!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Suzuna.  
Sevens row of the times table. Go.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Pssh, easy-peasy! ♪  
Seven times one equals...  
  
Uhh, what was it again?  
  
**Misaki：**  
You don't even know the first one.  
Nobody's gonna buy it if  
*you* go around telling  
people  
\"Lucent Academy will make you super smart!\"  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Aw, man.  
Like you're one to talk, Misaki. Your grades  
aren't any better than mine.  
  
**Misaki：**  
I-I'm different.  
I'm an lady—I just need to study  
the proper customs and etiquette of adults!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Lady? Adults?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
All right, Miss \"Adult Lady\" Misaki, how would you save  
the school from bein' shut down?  
If you're such a grown-up,  
you should know what to do.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Huh?  
I mean, yes.  
O-of course I do!  
  
**Misaki：**  
We just, uhh...  
Oh, right. Money! They're probably shutting the school down  
because they can't afford to keep it running.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
You think?  
So if we just give 'em our allowance,  
that'll fix everything?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Our allowance isn't enough to operate an entire  
school.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Aww.  
Then what're we gonna do?  
  
**Misaki：**  
We, umm, yeah.  
 What can we do?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
If they shutter the school, what's gonna happen to us?  
  
**Misaki：**  
They'll have to place us in a new school, won't they?  
We might even end up going to different schools.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Say what?  
Triple angry emoji!  
I wanna go to the same school as you, Misaki!  
  
**Misaki：**  
So do I!  
So do I... but, there's nothing...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
...  
  
**Misaki：**  
...  
  
**???：**  
Hi!  
Are you two students here?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Huh? Yes,  
who're you?  
  
**Io：**  
Nice to meet you. My name is Io. Starting tomorrow,  
I'll be subbing for a teacher who's on maternity leave.  
  
**Io：**  
I was hoping to introduce myself to everyone, but I got  
lost on the way here, and now classes are over.  
  
**Io：**  
Can you please, um,  
tell me your names?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I'm Suzuna.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Misaki.  
  
**Io：**  
Suzuna and Misaki.  
I hope we have lots of fun together!  
You can just call me Io, by the way.  
  
**Io：**  
I may not be around until graduation,  
but I'll do my best  
to be a good teacher for you.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Why bother?  
They've already decided to close the school.  
  
**Io：**  
Oh, is that so.  
  
**Io：**  
Wait, what? Close the school?!  
No one told me anything!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
No? Maybe they didn't tell you yet  
because you're a sub.  
  
**Io：**  
Closing schools is terrible!  
I'm going to speak directly to the chairwoman!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
No way! That sounds awesome.  
I'm coming along, too!  
  
**Misaki：**  
So am I.  
You need more backup than just Suzuna!  
  
**Io：**  
Chairwoman!  
What are you thinking, closing down this school?!  
  
**Principle：**  
W-well...  
  
**???：**  
Allow me to explain.  
  
**Io：**  
Sorry,  
but you are?  
  
**Karin：**  
I'm from the Guild Association.  
My name's Karin.  
  
**Karin：**  
As the administrators of Lucent Academy, the Guild  
Association has sent me here to explain our reason  
for closing the school.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
How come you're shuttin' us down?!  
Whatever your reason is, it's getting a devil emoji from me!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Yeah. Yeah! How can you do this to us?  
Is it because enrollment is low? Or money? Or...  
  
**Karin：**  
We've decided to close Lucent Academy for just one reason.  
Terrible student academic performance.  
  
**Suzuna & Misaki：**  
Huh?  
  
**Karin：**  
The grades of the students here are far below average. It's  
become a problem for us at the Association.  
We thought if  
students are learning so little here, we should shut it down.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Urgh... Grades? We can't argue with that.  
Especially the two of us.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
We're probably the two dumbest at this school, huh?  
  
**Io：**  
You are?  
  
**Io：**  
Then I'll tutor you!  
  
**Suzuna & Misaki：**  
Huh?  
  
**Io：**  
If low grades are why the academy's being closed,  
then I just need to turn the students here into Landosol's  
best and brightest, right?  
  
**Io：**  
I'll mold this pair into the top two students  
in all of Landosol!  
  
**Suzuna & Misaki：**  
Whaaaat?!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Us? The top? In all of Landosol?!  
Th-that's impossible!  
  
**Karin：**  
Understood.  
Accomplish that,  
and I'll cancel the shutdown.  
  
**Io：**  
Yay! Excellent!  
There's still hope for Lucent Academy.  
  
**Io：**  
We'll start immediately with after-school tutoring.  
And pre-class morning sessions, too!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Seriously? That's waaay too much studying time!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Yeah, I like to take it easy in the mornings.  
My sister says lack of sleep's bad for your skin.  
  
**Io：**  
This is to save your school.  
You've got to study as hard as you can!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Aww...  
I mean, I don't want Lucent Academy to close down, but...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Guess we're stuck now.  
Still, though...  
  
**Narration：**  
Thus Suzuna and Misaki unwillingly became Io's  
personal projects.
