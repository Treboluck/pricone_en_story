# Yori Episode 5
To help her thank {player} properly, Yori ropes him into a search for the \"Apple of Truth\" which prevents whoever eats it from telling lies. But in the middle of their search, she learns that it was just a made-up rumor. She needs {player}'s help to get back home, but as usual, she fails to thank him.

**Passerby：**  
Excuse me.  
Do you know if there's a weapon shop around here?  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh?! A-are you talking to me?  
I... Uhhh... Well...  
  
**Passerby：**  
Oh, if you don't know, that's all right.  
I'll try asking someone else.  
  
**Yori：**  
Ohhh, come on! Of course I know where the weapon shop is!  
Why can't I say it like a normal person?!  
  
**Yori：**  
Why can't I ever talk to people properly?  
Especially when it's a guy, I'm useless...  
The only guy I can talk to is, well, *him*...  
  
**Yori：**  
...Hmm? Hang on!  
Come to think of it, can I really even talk to him properly?  
I still haven't managed to thank him even once...  
  
**Yori：**  
Aaghhhh...!  
I really am completely hopeless...  
  
**Yori：**  
Whoa! Wh-what's this?!  
Something flew into my face?!  
  
**Yori：**  
Bueghh!  
...Oh, it's just a piece of paper.  
I guess it got caught by the wind or something.  
  
**Yori：**  
Looks like a flyer for a quest... Let's see now...  
\"Seek out the mysterious Apple of Truth\"?  
 Huh?!  
\"Whoever eats this rare fruit will be unable to lie for one hour?!\"  
  
**Yori：**  
Does this thing really exist?!  
Whoa! The quest reward is super high, too!  
  
**Yori：**  
...But no, forget the reward—it's the apple I need!  
If I eat one of those, I might be able to  
honestly thank {player}!  
  
**Yori：**  
The flyer lists where it's supposed to grow,  
so I'll head straight...  
  
**Yori：**  
Ahhh, it's a bit scary to go alone, though...  
But it's not like I have anyone I can ask to help...  
  
**Yori：**  
...Wait! I know!  
  
**Yori：**  
S-sorry to call you out here like this.  
See, I found this quest with a really good reward.  
All we have to do is find an apple.  
 See? Sounds easy, right?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's get searching!  
`Tag 1`  
**Yori：**  
It feels a bit weird getting the guy I'm trying to thank  
to help me find the apple...  
But I didn't know who else to ask, so oh well!  
  
**Yori：**  
Find anything yet?  
 I haven't had any luck over here.  
  
**Yori：**  
Hmmm... That's so weird...  
I'm sure the flyer said it should be somewhere around here...  
Hang on a minute. Let me check the details again.  
  
**Yori：**  
...Yep, the map definitely points to this spot.  
The apple ought to be right around...  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh? What's that?  
You want to take a look at this flyer?  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh?!  
This is one of the fake flyers that have been going around?!  
  
**Yori：**  
You mean, the whole thing is made up?!  
Then is there no such thing as the Apple of Truth!?  
N-no way...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Did you want the apple that much?  
**Choice: (3)**  Did you really need the money?  
`Tag 2`  
**Yori：**  
...Yeah. You got me.  
It was the apple I really wanted, not the reward.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Yori：**  
Of course not!  
It's the Apple of Truth I really wanted!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Yori：**  
It was the perfect solution  
to the problem I've been having...  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh? What did I want to do with the apple?  
Well, of course, I was going to eat it  
so I could thank...  
  
**Yori：**  
Wait, what am I saying?!  
Why should I tell you what I want it for?!  
  
**Yori：**  
Don't ask such weird questions!  
Hmph, I'm going home!  
  
**Yori：**  
H-honestly, some people!  
Has he never heard of privacy?!  
Or is he just dense...?  
  
**Yori：**  
...Ahhh... I-it's so dark in here, I can hardly see...  
  
**Yori：**  
Why are you just standing there?!  
This forest is super dark, so I can't go home alone, can I?!  
Come on,  
 let's get moving already!  
  
**Narration：**  
Thanks to {player}, Yori made it home safely,  
but she still couldn't seem to thank him for it...
