# Yori Episode 4
In a dream of Ameth's creation, Yori and {player} go shopping together. She suggests that they stay up all night playing games together, but immediately gets embarrassed by her own suggestion. When they wake up, Yori is still a little embarrassed, but picks up their gaming session where they left off.
  
## Subtitle: A Questionable Suggestion
  
**Narration：**  
Today, {player} and Yori have gotten together  
to play a variety of games.  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh?! A counterspell?! No way?!  
Urghhhh... Y-you beat me...!  
  
**Yori：**  
You know, for someone with no memories,  
you're surprisingly good at games.  
Board games, card games, the lot...  
  
**Yori：**  
Though, that did make this whole session a lot of fun.  
...Wait, n-no! I take that back!  
It's not like I love playing with you or anything! Maybe just a little bit!  
  
**Yori：**  
B-besides, I've still got more wins than you overall!  
What game should we play next?  
  
**Yori：**  
...Huh?  
Wh-what the heck is this light?!  
Did you pull something funny?!  
  
**Yori：**  
Wait... Aaaaaahhh!

**Yori：**  
This new gaming store sure knows how to hold an opening sale!  
  
**Yori：**  
Video games, computer accessories, strategy guides...  
Heheh!  
It was exhausting, but I picked up such a great haul!  
  
**Yori：**  
I'm sorry I ended up making you carry  
so many bags, though...  
  
**Yori：**  
With so many cool things to buy,  
there was no way I could carry it all myself...  
I was lucky you were willing to help out!  
  
**Yori：**  
So, um... I guess, you know...  
W-well, I suppose I should be grateful! In theory!  
  
**Yori：**  
Anyway, how about you?  
Did you have a good time in there?  
  
**Yori：**  
I mean, uh...  
We were basically just buying things that I wanted,  
so I thought you might be bored...  
  
**Yori：**  
...You found something you wanted too?  
Oh, great!  
What was it that caught your eye?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  A dating sim.  
**Choice: (2)**  The Ultimate Guide to Astrum.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yori：**  
...A... A dating sim?!  
Since when are you into that sort of game?!  
  
**Yori：**  
L-let me see that! Ummm...  
\"A maid, a nurse, a shrine maiden and a little witch—  
meet your new harem\"?!  
  
**Yori：**  
H...huh... So these are the kind of girls you like, are they?  
  
**Yori：**  
...You just bought it because it was cheap for such a big box?  
  
**Yori：**  
O-oh, so that's all! Well, good then...  
N-not that I really care what you're into or anything!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Yori：**  
That book... I own that book!  
I could've lent it to you if you'd asked...  
  
**Yori：**  
Actually, didn't I get you to lend me the money  
to buy that book in the first place...?  
Urgh... The embarrassing memories are flooding back...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Yori：**  
Anyway, I managed to get everything  
I was after today, so I guess this was a success!  
Time to head home and try these games out!  
  
**Yori：**  
Ohhhh, I can't wait!  
I'm gonna stay up all night and play them to death!  
  
**Yori：**  
...Actually, though, most of the games I bought  
weren't single-player RPGs—  
they were multiplayer fighting games and stuff...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I could come play them with you?  
`Tag 4`  
**Yori：**  
Oh, nice idea! You helped me buy them, after all,  
so you should come over and...  
  
**Yori：**  
...Hmm...?  
Ahh! W-wait!  
H-hang on a second!  
  
**Yori：**  
You know, I spoke without thinking there,  
but wasn't that a pretty outrageous suggestion...?  
  
**Yori：**  
A guy and a girl, staying up all night... together...?!  
Aaahhh...!  
  
**Yori：**  
I-I take it back! This gaming session is cancelled!  
  
**Yori：**  
R-right then! I'm heading home now!  
  
**Yori：**  
But, um... I guess...  
I... I should at least say this first.  
  
**Yori：**  
You know... Since you helped me out so much...  
Th-thank... Thank y...

**Ameth：**  
How was that, hmm? A little present from me!  
Did you have a nice \"dream\"?  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just saw was a \"dream\" I created for you and Yori  
using fragments of your memories.  
Did it ring any bells? Well, I suppose you wouldn't know.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But if you manage to collect even more memories,  
I'll show you more dreams like this one.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Dreaming of your memories with all sorts of different girls...  
That's your shortcut to the truth of this world.  
So good luck!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, until next time!

**Yori：**  
Unhh... Ah...  
Don't tell me... I was asleep just now?  
  
**Yori：**  
I can't believe I fell asleep in the middle of a card game...  
And I had such a weird dream, too...  
  
**Yori：**  
Actually, even my dream was about games...  
But... what kind of games were those, actually?  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh...? You had a dream just like mine?  
Talk about weird coincidences...  
  
**Yori：**  
But wait, this is no time to be dreaming  
or dozing off like a fool!  
  
**Yori：**  
Look, we've still got all these cool games to get through,  
so you'd better be ready to stay up till morning!  
  
**Yori：**  
...Hmm?  
Why do I feel like I said something similar  
in my dream just now, too...?  
  
**Yori：**  
D-  
d-d-don't get me wrong!  
Wh-when I said we're staying up all night, I didn't mean anything weird!  
Don't get any funny ideas, you got that?!  
  
**Yori：**  
...C-come on!  
Back to the game already! Let's get playing!  
  
**Narration：**  
Though Yori's face had turned bright red,  
the two of them happily resumed their play session.
