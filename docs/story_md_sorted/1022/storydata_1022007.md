# Yori Episode 7
Determined to finally thank him properly, Yori meets up with {player}, but she struggles terribly to get the words out. She almost gives up, but forges ahead, and somehow ends up almost confessing some quite different feelings. More embarrassed than ever, she flees the scene.

**Narration：**  
Today, Yori has invited {player} out  
to talk about something.  
  
**Yori：**  
Ahh... I'm so nervous...  
B-but this is the day I'm going to thank him properly!  
I can't keep failing after all the times he's helped me!  
  
**Yori：**  
It's not that hard! Just say it! Nice and casual!  
Two words, \"thank you!\"  
Then I can say \"bye now\" and go home!  
  
**Yori：**  
Yep! Easy as pie! I can do this!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Morning, Yori!  
`Tag 1`  
**Yori：**  
Waaaaaaghhh!  
  
**Yori：**  
G-g-g-good morning!  
F-f-f-fancy running into you all the way out here!  
  
**Yori：**  
...I asked you to meet me here?  
O-oh. Yes. That's right.  
S-sorry to make you come all this way!  
  
**Yori：**  
L-listen, uh... I-I wanted to tell you something...  
Um... Listen... Th-th-th-the thing is... Well... Th-tha...  
  
**Yori：**  
Tha... Tha... Thank...  
  
**Yori：**  
Thank goodness for my sister, right?!  
  
**Yori：**  
Gaaaaaahhhhhh! Nooo! Yori, you idiot! Idiot! Idioooot!  
  
**Yori：**  
Y-you and Akari are pretty close, right?  
As her sister, I just thought  
I should check in and see... how you get along.  
  
**Yori：**  
...You're just normal friends?  
Don't be ridiculous. I've seen the way you two always flirt...  
Honestly, it's a little creepy. You men are all the same...  
  
**Yori：**  
...You've never flirted with her?  
She just does all that on her own?  
Huh... Is that right.  
  
**Yori：**  
I thought you might be looking at her funny, that's all.  
I even thought maybe I should try some of her tricks...  
...Wait, forget that! Forget I said that!  
  
**Yori：**  
So, what? You *don't* like the way she's always teasing you?  
Should I tell her to cut it out?  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh? You think it's cute? She's like a cheeky little sister?  
  
**Yori：**  
H-huh... I see...  
She's like a... a sister, huh...  
  
**Yori：**  
Ahhhhh... This is such a weird feeling...  
When he says Akari's like a sister to him,  
I feel kind of mad...  
 But also kind of relieved...  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh? Was that all I wanted?  
O-of course not! What I really wanted to say was...  
Um... Um... Th... Th...  
  
**Yori：**  
There's this new game that just came out!  
  
**Yori：**  
Aaaaghhh! I-I messed it up again!  
  
**Yori：**  
All right! That can be our next contest, then!  
Oh! And you know, the other day...  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh? It's getting late, so we should go home?  
W-whoa, you're right!  
I didn't even notice the time...  
  
**Yori：**  
D-did you say goodbye...?  
W-wait, stop! Th-there's... still something I need to...  
  
**Yori：**  
S-something I need to...  
  
**Yori：**  
Ahhh... I can't say it...  
Today was just another failure...  
  
**Yori：**  
Today... just like yesterday...  
And every other day... Forever...  
  
**Yori：**  
F-forever...?  
N... No, I can't... I can't... let that happen!  
  
**Yori：**  
W-wait!  
  
**Yori：**  
Th-there's something I've always  
been meaning to say to you!  
Something I have to say, no matter what!  
  
**Yori：**  
U-um... L-listen...  
You're always so great to me, and...  
  
**Yori：**  
When I... When I first met you, I tried to run away, but...  
You were such a weird guy, and you chased after me,  
and I was so surprised, but also... really happy...  
  
**Yori：**  
And afterwards... you saved me a bunch of times...  
And played games with me...  
  
**Yori：**  
I feel like if I keep on trying new things with you,  
maybe someday I might even be able to get over  
my shyness issues...  
  
**Yori：**  
Right now I can still only talk properly with you, but...  
Oh! But actually, sometimes I think that might be enough!  
  
**Yori：**  
T-till I met you, I never dreamed I'd feel anything like this,  
and it's all so weird, but... I don't think it's a bad weird...  
  
**Yori：**  
Oh, but... I feel like I'm always being kind of rude to you, so...  
I sort of wanted to... say sorry for that, and...  
  
**Yori：**  
I-I mean, um... I...  
  
**Yori：**  
I...!  
I think I l... lov...  
  
**Yori：**  
H... Huh?  
Wasn't I trying to tell him \"thank you\"...?!  
  
**Yori：**  
Wh-what am I... What am I even saying?!  
  
**Yori：**  
...Aaaahhhh...!  
  
**Yori：**  
A-actually, we should head home! S-see you round!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  What did you want to say, though?  
`Tag 2`  
**Yori：**  
Aaaahhh! Th-that's, um! I mean! Uhhhh...!  
  
**Yori：**  
Sh-shut up! Shut up! Shut uuuuup!  
You're the absolute worst!!!
