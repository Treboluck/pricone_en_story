## Subtitle: A Sort-Of Success
  
**Narration：**  
{player} stumbles across Yori  
staring at something in a shop window.  
  
**Yori：**  
*staaaare*...  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh? What am I doing?  
Oh, um, I was just thinking  
this shop has some pretty cute plushies...  
  
**Yori：**  
Aahh! Too bright!  
Wh-what the? What's this light?!  
  
**Yori：**  
This is just like that other time?!  
A-aaaaahhhh!

**Yori：**  
*staaare*...  
 This plushie is... so cute...  
  
**Yori：**  
Waahh?! O-oh, it's just you...  
Don't talk to me so suddenly!  
You scared the life out of me!  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh? What was I doing there?  
Y-you've got it wrong!  
It's not like I wanted to buy this plushie!  
  
**Yori：**  
I just... You know. I thought if I had one of these,  
I might seem a bit more girlish...  
  
**Yori：**  
Wh-what's that look for?!  
Something wrong with me being girlish?!  
  
**Yori：**  
Hmph! Fine, I get it!  
I know you all think  
I'm the most uncute girl in the whole world!  
  
**Yori：**  
So what if my room is stuffed  
with nothing but strategy guides?!  
Is that a problem?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I don't have plushies in my room either...  
**Choice: (2)**  Strategy guides are awesome!  
`Tag 1`  
**Yori：**  
So what if you don't?!  
Your room isn't exactly  
a helpful point of comparison here!

`Tag 2`  
**Yori：**  
I- I know, right?!  
My precious strategy guide collection is my pride and...  
  
**Yori：**  
Wait, we're talking about girlish stuff here!  
What do my strategy guides have to do with anything?!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Yori：**  
Huh? If I really want it, I should buy it?  
L-like I said, it's not like I actually...  
  
**Yori：**  
Besides, this teddy bear...  
comes with quite the price tag.  
It's way out of my league...  
  
**Yori：**  
What? Wait right here? Huh?  
Wha...? Wait! Wh-where are you going?!  
  
**Yori：**  
Aw, sheesh... He ran off...  
What was all that?  
Telling me to wait... He's so pushy sometimes.  
  
**Yori：**  
W-well...  
I guess his pushiness isn't always a bad thing...  
I should probably thank him for all the stuff he...  
  
**Yori：**  
N-no... That would just be awkward.  
I don't want to sound too serious...  
Then how about...  
  
**Yori：**  
Wait, waaagh?! Y-you're back already?!  
That was actually pretty quick.  
So, what were you up to?

**Yori：**  
Huh?!  
A-a plushie?!  
Is this for me...?  
  
**Yori：**  
Where did you get this?  
...You just won it at the arcade?!  
H-huh... Pretty impressive.  
  
**Yori：**  
...Like I've been telling you,  
it's not like I actually like plushies or anything...  
  
**Yori：**  
B-but... If you insist, I guess I'll take it!  
Um...  
Th... Tha... Thank...  
  
**Yori：**  
Plank you for the thushie!!!  
  
**Yori：**  
Y-you don't get it?  
See, it's a pun! I swapped the sounds!  
It means \"thank you\"!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You should get into stand-up.  
**Choice: (5)**  Wow, that's so... not lame...  
`Tag 4`  
**Yori：**  
Sh-shut up!  
I know it wasn't even funny!

`Tag 5`  
**Yori：**  
Oh, who even says that?!  
At least try to sound convincing!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Yori：**  
A-after I went to the trouble of thanking you, too...  
Fine! Forget I said anything!  
  
**Yori：**  
Oh, but... Well, um...  
I guess I'll take good care of the plushie!

**Ameth：**  
Boy, was that entertaining!  
Poor Yori, I guess she'll never be a comedian.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Like I told you before, this dream  
was a little gift of mine based on your past memories with Yori.  
Look forward to the next one, okay?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, catch you later!

**Yori：**  
Plushie... so cute...  
...Hmm?  
Huh? Where am I...?  
  
**Yori：**  
D-don't tell me the two of us ended up  
spacing out again?  
Out in the street? We must look so stupid...  
  
**Yori：**  
Um, yeah... That's right. There was a plushie, and...  
Wait, you had the same dream as me?!  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh? You'll buy me a plushie right now...?  
H-haven't I told you enough?!  
I'm not interested in that stuff!  
  
**Yori：**  
But, um...  
 I-I guess if it's a gift... I can't turn it down!  
Come on, let's go pick one out!  
  
**Narration：**  
So {player} and Yori hurried along  
to find the cutest of all the plushies.
