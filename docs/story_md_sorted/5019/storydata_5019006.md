**Narration：**  
The day of the event.  
All sorts of tourists are gathered at the beach,  
eagerly anticipating the moment Suzuna comes on stage.  
  
**Female Tourist：**  
I can't beieve we get to see Suzuna at such a pretty beach!  
  
**Male Tourist：**  
For real, for real!  
Sure hope things kick off soon!  
  
**Female Tourist：**  
There's something so lovely about kicking summer off with Suzuna!  
Ahhh! I hope she turns up soon!  
  
**Io：**  
Looks like Suzuna's fans have all gathered up.  
And their love's making it all the way to this waiting area.  
  
**Elder：**  
With this many people, the Great Shine God is sure to awaken!  
This can't fail!  
  
**Misaki：**  
It's practically a sea of people!  
  
**Misaki：**  
You okay, Suzuna? Are you nervous?  
Don't worry. Just relax and be yourself.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
No need to tell me!  
If anything, you're more nervous than me.  
LOL!  
  
**Misaki：**  
C-can you blame me?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
It hasn't started raining, so this'll be a cinch.  
I'm gonna wake Shiny up rapid!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
It's always good having the fans there,  
but the islanders are cheering me on as well.  
Makes me feel even hype than normal!  
  
**Io：**  
All we need to do now is  
hope that the weather stays like this until the event begins—  
  
**Female Tourist：**  
Huh? Where'd this rain come from!  
It was super sunny a minute ago!  
  
**Male Tourist：**  
Hey, look!  
What's that over there?  
  
**Female Tourist：**  
So adorbs!  
Is it one of the beach's mascots?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Ahhh! We were *this* close, too!  
How about we push forward and get the event started?  
Let's get it done and dusted and bring the sun back!  
  
**Elder：**  
Good idea! Let's begin immediately!  
Suzuna, please get—  
  
**Tourists：**  
Eeeeeek!  
  
**Misaki：**  
A scream?!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Wait a minute...  
Lemme go check!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I knew it! It's Rainy!  
C-calm down!  
  
**Rainy：**  
It's you humans' fault!  
You're keeping me away from my friend!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Are you even listening?  
  
**Rainy：**  
It's not fair!  
Why don't I get to see Shiny?!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh man.  
It can't even hear me in that state.  
What am I gonna do?!  
  
**Elder：**  
Great Rain God!  
Please settle down!  
You'll be reunited soon!  
  
**Elder：**  
We'll begin our prayers now!  
Many people from beyond the island have  
gathered for the Great Shine God's sake, too!  
  
**Rainy：**  
...!  
From beyond the island?  
  
**Elder：**  
That's correct!  
  
**Rainy：**  
I heard all about those people!  
They ruined Suzuna's friendship as well!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh?!  
  
**Rainy：**  
You keep ruining everyone's friendship!  
I can't trust anyone on this island anymore!  
I'll never forgive you!  
  
**Rainy：**  
This island shouldn't exist if I can't get to see Shiny!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Rainy, hold up!  
We've already made up!  
Look! This is Misaki, the friend I was talking about!  
  
**Misaki：**  
S-sure am! I'm Misaki, in the flesh.  
I'm Suzuna's friend, so let's get along.  
Don't be mad. Let's talk like proper ladies.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
See?  
Come on, please calm down.  
  
**Rainy：**  
I want to see Shiny!  
I want to see Shiny!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Argh. The wind's getting even stronger, too!  
Sheesh. It's like I'm watching a child throw a tantrum.  
As a proper lady, it's my job to handle this!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Wait. Ahhhhhh!  
It's gonna blow the stage away!  
But I won't let that happen!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Rainy! I understand how you feel here!  
The anxiety of not being able to see your friends really is horrible.  
  
**Misaki：**  
But please hear me out.  
This stage means a lot to my dear friend!  
I can't let you destroy it!  
  
**Rainy：**  
Stay out of this!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Eeeeeek!

**Suzuna：**  
Ehehe.  
Now that was a good catch.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Huh? S-Suzuna?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hearing you say all that made me hella happy.  
In fact, it made you sound like my biggest fan!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Th-that's not true!  
What I said was, uh...  
Just a lie. Yeah! I got caught in the moment.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Ahaha!  
So you're not my fan? Aww. That sucks.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Argh!  
Could you choose a worse time to pick on me?!  
  
**Elder：**  
A-ahhh!  
Just watching the two of them interact like that  
reminds me of the Great Shine God and Great Shine God's relationship!  
  
**Elder：**  
It's enough to make one smile through proxy.  
Enough to cleanse one's spirit!  
  
**Io：**  
Are you two okay?  
You're not hurt, are you?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Suzuna helped me out, so I'm fine!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Phew!  
Now we just need to help Rainy out!  
It looks like it's in pain!  
  
**Io：**  
Hehe. You get along even more than before.  
That's lovely.  
  
**Io：**  
Rainy and Shiny must share a similar relationship.  
Which means we need to reunite them as quickly as possible!  
  
`image display end`  
**Elder：**  
Ah! I see! Now I finally understand!  
  
**Elder：**  
There came a point where we focused solely on the events themselves.  
We forgot what was truly important.  
  
**Elder：**  
We forgot the most important wish of all.  
For this to be an island where the Great Rain God  
and Great Shine God could enjoy themselves to their hearts' content!  
  
**Elder：**  
I need to inform Suzuna about this!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
You're like, totally sure about this?  
Roger! Leave it to me!  
  
**Elder：**  
Thank you very much!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Everyone! Hear me out!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
—That's the gist of it! I need you to think of  
all your precious friends. Pray with me!  
So that Rainy and Shiny can have fun together again!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Help a gal out!  
  
**Female Tourist：**  
I'll do whatever you say, Suzuna!  
  
**Male Tourist：**  
Can't say I get what's going on,  
but I'll help out!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Thanks so much, everyone!  
Summer'll definitely roll around,  
so let's all do this together!  
  
**Io：**  
Please evacuate away from the beach while you're praying!  
The island residents will guide you!  
  
**Rainy：**  
I want to see Shiny. I want see Shiny...  
I just want to see Shiny, so why can't I?!  
  
**Rainy：**  
GGGRRRUOOHHHHH!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I think Rainy's at its limit...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's stop it. Together.  
`Tag 1`  
**Io：**  
Right!  
We need to hold it back while everyone's praying.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Yeah!  
Everyone's here for you and Shiny's sake,  
so quit throwing a tantrum!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
We'll save you, Rainy!  
There's nothing we can't do right now!  
  
  
**Misaki：**  
Leave it to me!  
Stay put!  
  
**Io：**  
Misaki's offense had no effect?!  
It looks like it's using the rain as a barrier!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Argh!  
Quit fighting back!
