**Misaki：**  
Right! That's the barrier dealt with!  
It's time you finally set—  
Huh?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
What's that?  
There's like, a crystal beside it now?  
A-and it's starting to glow!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Wait. The rain's changed color, too.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Holy smokes, that's cold!  
It's like the rain just changed into ice out of nowhere!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Th-that, plus touching it feels kind of depressing...  
Hm? But this feeling... It's kind of familiar.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
You're right. I'm losing my mojo, too.  
M-Misaki! Letting this rain touch you is way too dangerous!  
  
**Misaki：**  
...Are these Rainy's tears?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
For real?  
What makes you think that?  
  
**Misaki：**  
The sadness this rain makes me feel.  
It's the same as when we had that argument.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
It does feel like same, now that you mention it.  
  
**Misaki：**  
That crystal has to be Rainy's sadness, Rainy's pain given form.  
...  
Those feelings have turned the rain into its tears.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Suzuna! Let's destroy it!  
We need to save it from its own feelings!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Roger! Just gotta do what we gotta do, I guess!  
...  
Wait. Does that means you felt  
the same way after we had that argument?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Th-that's irrelevant right now!  
Quit thinking and get to destroying!
