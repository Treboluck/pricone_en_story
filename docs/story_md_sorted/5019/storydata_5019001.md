# Tropical Island, Here We Come
As the party arrive on the island, they're welcomed by the villagers who live there. A sudden downpour takes them by surprise, which in turn leads them to learn that the rain is being caused by the Great Rain God.
  
## Subtitle: Tropical Island, Here We Come
  
**Narration：**  
The first day of summer holidays finally comes around.  
The part arrive on the island where Suzuna's event is set to take place.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
We're here, baby!  
  
**Io：**  
What a lovely beach.  
I'm so glad I've got an opportunity to come here.  
  
**Io：**  
Oh? There's a stage over there.  
Is that where your event's being held tomorrow, Suzuna?  
That's incredible if so.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Sure seems like it!  
Totally hyped!  
  
**Io：**  
There's going to be all sorts of fans and tourists watching, right?  
I'll have to pour my heart into cheering you on.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Thanks a bunch!  
No way I can mess up when you're all watching.  
I'mma knock this out the park!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I'll be cheeri— Urgh....  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's wrong?  
`Tag 1`  
**Misaki：**  
N-nothing!  
I just got, uh,  
entranced with how beautiful the beach is.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Did you get seasick?  
  
**Misaki：**  
N-no I di—  
Urgh...  
  
**Io：**  
Oh no. Are you okay?  
Don't worry. It's perfectly normal to feel seasick after a ride that long.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let me rub your back.  
`Tag 2`  
**Misaki：**  
Hey!  
Don't touch me there!  
And don't treat me like a kid!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Also, you realize I'm wearing a swimsuit right now, don't you?!  
Don't think you've got a free pass to touch a lady's skin!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Listen up. The only time you're allowed to touch a lady in a swimsuit  
is when you're helping them put sunscreen on!  
And it's far too early for that!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Ahaha.  
Guess you're feeling better than I thought!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I've been perfectly fine all this time!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I meant to say.  
That swimsuit is totally the bomb.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Of course it is. Would you expect any less?  
That said, you're looking good as well.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
And I know it!  
My purse was pretty much open the second I saw it.  
I'm gonna wear it for tomorrow's event, too!  
  
**Io：**  
The two of you are looking spectacular.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Io's, well...  
  
**Io：**  
Hm? What is it?  
  
**Suzuna & Misaki：**  
A-as blessed as always...  
  
**Io：**  
Come on, you two.  
Don't go silent on me all of a sudden.  
  
**Io：**  
Oh, right!  
Having fun is all well and good.  
but make sure you don't get yourselves hurt.  
Understood?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Rodge!  
  
**Misaki：**  
That goes without saying!  
  
**Elder：**  
Oh? Are you Suzuna, perchance?  
Greetings. I'm the elder of this island's village.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Whattup!  
Let's have a blast tomorrow!  
  
**Elder：**  
Thank you very much for coming all this way.  
You even brought friends, I see. That's splendid.  
  
**Assistant：**  
Hello.  
I can speak for everyone in the village when I say that  
we've all been eagerly anticipating your arrival.  
  
**Io：**  
Not at all. Thank you very much for the invite.  
We're as excited to see Suzuna on stage as you are.  
  
**Misaki：**  
That, plus the weather here is fantastic.  
It's not something you get to experience much back in Landosol.  
  
**Assistant：**  
...!  
The weather...  
  
**Io：**  
Is something bothing you?  
Like Misaki said, the weather's lovely.  
  
**Assistant：**  
Oh, um...  
  
**Elder：**  
*cough* Please disregard that.  
More importantly, I'm looking forward to tomorrow's event, Suzuna.  
  
**Elder：**  
We see a number of visitors here every year.  
And we want them to experience a summer they'll never forget.  
That was what spurred this idea on in the first place.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Got it! Leave it to me!  
I'm ready for the best vacation of my life!  
  
**Elder：**  
Please share that desire and passion with tomorrow's guests.  
The stronger the link betwen everyone's feelings,  
the higher they will reach into the sky.  
  
**Elder：**  
And if they reach high enough—  
  
**Resident 1：**  
Hey! It's Suzuna!  
  
**Resident 2：**  
No way! She got here so quick!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hm?

**Suzuna：**  
Whoa! Is that some fangirls I see?  
  
**Resident 1：**  
You bet!  
Thanks so much for coming, Suzuna!  
  
**Elder：**  
Come now, she's only just arrived.  
Don't bother her right off the bat.  
  
**Resident 1：**  
Can you blame us?!  
It's Suzuna, in the flesh!  
She's even cuter in person than she is in magazines!  
  
**Resident 2：**  
We've been waiting here all this time to meet her!  
Suzuna! Please shake my hand!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
That's how you make a gal happy!  
Thanks for all the support!  
  
**Resident 1：**  
We work at the beachside sweets stall,  
so it'd be great if you could drop by tomorrow!  
We can guarantee that they're delicious!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
For real?  
I'm definitely swinging by, then!  
  
**Resident 1：**  
Now that's a promise!  
We'll give you extra special treatment, too!  
  
**Elder：**  
That's enough, now. I'm sure Suzuna is exhausted.  
And she'll need all the rest she can get before tomorrow.  
Especially considering how important this event is to us.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Don't worry.  
I'm fine!  
  
**Elder：**  
B-but—  
  
**Io：**  
Your consideration is much appreciated.  
Knowing Suzuna, though, she really means it.  
  
**Io：**  
She usually doesn't look so overjoyed during class.  
If anything,  
I now realize just how much  
she enjoys her time working as a model.

**Elder：**  
During class?  
  
**Io：**  
Yes, that's right.  
Appearances aside, I'm her teacher.  
  
**Io：**  
That said, I'm still new to the job.  
But she and Misaki are my students.  
  
**Elder：**  
Y-you're... a teacher?  
  
**Io：**  
Indeed.  
  
**Resident 1：**  
Hey, Suzuna!  
Is that your sister you've brought along?  
  
**Resident 2：**  
You what?!  
I never knew Suzuna had a sister!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I am *not* her sister!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Ahahaha!  
Misaki being my sister is totes LOL material!  
But nah. She's my bud, and my classmate.  
  
**Resident 1：**  
Oh. Sorry about that.  
You're so cute and trendy that it just made sense.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Heh!  
I do take care to carry myself as a proper lady, yes.  
  
**Resident 1：**  
Actually, I'm so jelly that you're classmates!  
I wish I could go to the same school as Suzuna!  
  
**Resident 2：**  
Hey, hey. What's Suzuna like when she's off work?  
Where do you hang out after school?  
Give us the scoop!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Urgh.  
Really putting the pressure on me, aren't you?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Is this how celebrities feel when they're surrounded by the press?  
Not that it makes me a celebrity,  
but it sure feels nice!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Ask, and ye shall receive!  
I'll tell you everything you need to know!  
What's your first question?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Misaki! Hold the phone!  
  
**Io：**  
Oh! Silly me.  
I forgot something terribly important!  
  
**Io：**  
Hey. Can you rub some sunscreen on me?  
I planned on doing it after switching into my swimsuit  
on the boat,  
but completely forgot.  
  
**Elder：**  
Graaaagh!  
  
**Io：**  
?  
Is something the matter?  
  
**Elder：**  
Oh. No, nothing at all.  
  
**Io：**  
Here you go.  
Do my back first, will you?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Sure thing.  
`Tag 3`  
**Io：**  
Ah! That's so cold!  
Be a bit more gentle for me, okay?  
  
**Io：**  
Mmm...  
Yeah, right there. That's the spot.  
  
**Io：**  
You're more skilled than I thougyht.  
Let's go a bit lower now...  
  
**Elder & Assistant：**  
*gulp*  
  
**Io：**  
Oh. What's this?  
  
**Io：**  
It started raining all of a sudden.  
Surprising, considering how sunny it was.  
The weather can be funny sometimes, can't it?  
  
**Elder：**  
...!  
I-it definitely can.  
  
**Elder：**  
It would be terrible if you caught a cold due to the rain.  
We've prepared a guildhouse for you to stay at,  
so please feel free to use that.  
  
**Elder：**  
I'll be on my way, now.  
Please let me know if there's anything you need.  
I look forward to seeing you all again tomorrow.  
  
**Assistant：**  
Please follow me.  
I'll take you to the guildhouse.  
  
**Io：**  
Thank you very much.  
Let's get going, everyone!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Got it!  
Catch you later, troops!  
Gimme all you've got tomorrow!  
  
**Residents：**  
Bye-bye!  
  
**Io：**  
That sudden change in weather sure did surprise me,  
though.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Here's hoping that it won't continue into tomorrow  
and have any effect on the event.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Yikes! Anything but that!  
I really wanna take part!  
  
**Assistant：**  
Well...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hm...?  
What's up?  
  
**Assistant：**  
Err...  
I was told not to bring this up,  
so as to not cause any concern, but...  
  
**Assistant：**  
The event being called off might be entirely possible.  
All due to the Great Rain God.  
  
**Suzuna & Misaki & Io：**  
The Great Rain God?  
  
**Narration：**  
Unfamiliar with the term they've just heard,  
the party scratch their heads as they make their way  
towards the guildhouse.
