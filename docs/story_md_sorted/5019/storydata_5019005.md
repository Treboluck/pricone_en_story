Suzuna informs the party about what she learned from the Great Rain God after making up with Misaki. Seeing the truth from the village elder, they learn this year's event was designed to wake up the Great Shine God.
  
## Subtitle: Clear Skies, Clear Minds
  
**Narration：**  
Misaki flies through the guildhouse door upon returning to the village.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Misaki!  
  
**Misaki：**  
S-Suzuna?!  
Urgh!  
  
**Io：**  
Hehe.  
Welcome back, Suzuna.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I'm so sorry about earlier!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Come on! Don't squeeze me so tight!  
Ladies need to be treated with proper care!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
It's cool, it's cool!  
Um. I was a bit too harsh on you!  
Sorry!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Truth is, I've been worrying about what'll happen  
if our school closes down since before the summer holidays.  
I'm not the only one, right?  
  
**Misaki：**  
I mean, sure, but...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Knew it!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Yeah. You're right.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Woo!  
I'm glad you get me!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Huh? That's it?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Wait, what?  
I mean, we might not be able to hang out next year.  
That'd totally suck, right?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Me, you, Io and whiz-boy. What if we all couldn't meet again?  
If that ends up happening, then this year's our last year to make some awesome memories.  
  
**Io：**  
Suzuna...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
That's kinda what got me all stressed out and in a panic.  
And I couldn't even tell that you were trying to cheer me up.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
So I'll say it again!  
I'm so sorry, Misaki!  
  
**Misaki：**  
...!  
I-I wasn't trying to cheer you up or anything!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That's not what I recall hearing.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misaki：**  
Don't butt in, you!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Besides! Let's assume the school does close down.  
That won't stop us from being friends, right?  
  
**Misaki：**  
I mean.  
We're friends forever.  
No matter where we are, or how much time passes.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Misaki!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Plus, the more time passes,  
the more beautiful and elegant I'll become.  
Get ready to see a proper lady in all her glory!  
  
**Misaki：**  
All that said, though.  
I'm partly to blame for not realizing just how  
much was riding on this event and vacation for you.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Which means I'm still far from the ideal lady I want to be.  
But experience is everything, and now I have that.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Suzuna.  
I'm sorry for my attitude, too.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Also, um...  
Would you like to eat this?

**Suzuna：**  
What's with this parfait?  
It's loaded with fruit!  
  
**Misaki：**  
It's our way of thanking you  
for bringing us here in the first place.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Those fans of yours we met at the beach helped out.  
They said you'd definitely cheer up if you tried this.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Thanks so much, Misaki!  
I love you to bits!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Okay, okay!  
Eat up already!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Ahaha, sorry.  
  
**Io：**  
I'm so glad I ended up being your teacher.  
You couldn't ask for more than two students as lovely as you.  
  
**Io：**  
Of course, I feel the same way  
about {player}and the other students.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Okay! I'mma dig in!

**Suzuna：**  
*munch, munch*  
Mmm! Delish! This is the stuff!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I made it, so of course it is!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Real talk, though. This is hella good.  
Rainy would defos cheer up if it got a taste of this.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Rainy?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Yeah. The Great Rain God.  
That's the nickname I gave it.  
  
**Io：**  
You met the Great Rain God?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I did!  
But it seemed real down.  
  
**Misaki：**  
What?!  
Why didn't you say so sooner?!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Ahaha, sorry.  
That parfait you made kinda blew my brain cells away.  
  
**Misaki：**  
And thus, I forgive you!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Anyway.  
According to Rainy, there's another spirit just like it.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
But none of the people here mentioned anything like that, right?  
It's kind of a blur for me.  
How about you, Io?  
  
**Io：**  
I remember it rather clearly.  
No one mentioned anything other than the Great Rain God.  
  
**Io：**  
But if this is true, then there's another spirit as well.  
We should call on the village elder and question him about it.  
  
**Io：**  
In the meantime, Suzuna,  
could you tell us more about what you heard?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Roger!  
  
**Elder：**  
Did you need me for something?  
  
**Io：**  
Hello. Thank you for coming all the way here.  
I'll get right to the point.  
Could you tell us more about the Great Shine God?  
  
**Elder：**  
W-where did you learn about that?!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Now that's a suspicious reaction if there ever was one.  
  
**Elder：**  
E-err...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Suzuna happened to meet Rainy, who mentioned its name to her.  
Oh. Rainy is Suzuna's nickname for the Great Rain God.  
Seems like the Great Shine God's being called Shiny, too.  
  
**Misaki：**  
You've got one chance to come clean!  
Spill the beans!  
  
**Elder：**  
Goodness...  
I never expected you to meet the Great Rain God,  
let alone hear about the Great Shine God from it.  
  
**Elder：**  
This is no longer a secret that can be kept, then.  
But I feel now, more than ever,  
that relying on Suzuna was the correct choice.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
What's that supposed to mean?  
  
**Elder：**  
Allow me to explain everything.  
But first, could you tell me how much you know so far?  
  
**Io：**  
We heard about how the ritual works,  
and that Rainy was the only one that woke up this year.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Pretty much!  
  
**Elder：**  
I see.  
As for how that came to be, I believe that not enough  
prayers were gathered to awaken both of them.  
  
**Elder：**  
That in itself is the mystery, however. Our approach remains  
the same as previous years. We put our hearts and souls  
into wishing for another bountiful summer.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Rainy's been all alone ever since.  
It looked so sad, too.  
I felt so bad for it.  
  
**Io：**  
The fact that they were so close doesn't help, I assume.  
Being alone under circumstances like that must feel terrible.  
  
**Elder：**  
Indeed.  
It's also worth mentioning that the constant rain  
we're facing is due to only one of them awaking.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
What's the deal there?  
  
**Elder：**  
The two of them have the ability to control the weather.  
However, that only applies when they're together.  
  
**Elder：**  
Their power falls out of balance when they're alone,  
which is what leads to the poor weather.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Which means it'll be raining for a while, I guess.  
But Rainy'll go back to sleep once summer ends, right?  
  
**Elder：**  
That won't do.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Huh? Is there more to all this?  
  
**Elder：**  
Legends say that, in this situation, said power will consume them,  
causing them to lose their minds and go on a rampage.  
The Great Rain God is already on the brink of reaching that point.  
  
**Elder：**  
Should that happen, terribly fierce weather will  
render the island nigh uninhabitable.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Holy smokes! That's not good!  
  
**Elder：**  
Indeed.  
Hence why the island's future all rides on tomorrow's event.  
  
**Elder：**  
We're blessed with many visitors during this period every year.  
That alone should be enough,  
but one can't be too careful.  
  
**Elder：**  
The more prayers we could gather, the better.  
Hence why I thought to invite a celebrity from Landosol.  
And when I questioned the young folks here—  
  
**Misaki：**  
You settled on inviting Suzuna!  
  
**Elder：**  
Indeed. Every single one of them suggested her.  
But I'm amazed such a celebrity would  
even come to such a remote island in the first place.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hm?  
Hold up. How come you didn't tell us about this right off the bat?  
That'd have been way more helpful.  
  
**Elder：**  
Well...  
I didn't want to force extra pressure on you  
by dumping all of our problems on you.  
Hence, I chose to stay quiet.  
  
**Elder：**  
The fact is that I tried to use you, however.  
If you can find it in your heart,  
please forgive me for my actions.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Not a problem!  
I'll gladly go wherever my fans are!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I mean, waking spirits up  
and dealing with the weather and stuff  
technically isn't part of a model's job.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
But our job is to make people smile,  
so if helping out gets that done, I'm down!  
  
**Elder：**  
Suzuna...  
  
**Elder：**  
Very well. Allow me to make a formal request, then.  
Please call out to the audience during tomorrow's event  
and help awaken the Great Shine God for us!  
  
**Elder：**  
The Great Rain God is already at its breaking point.  
Summer may never return to the island at this rate!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Roger. Leave it to me!  
I'm gonna turn Rainy's frown upside down!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
And hey. I'm not the only one here.  
Right?  
  
**Misaki：**  
That goes without saying!  
My stunning good looks will wake  
Shiny up in a flash!  
  
**Io：**  
Leave it to us!  
It's my duty as a teacher to protect my students.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  We'll make this event a success, no matter what.  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzuna：**  
Cheers, whiz-boy!  
That's real motivating!  
  
**Narration：**  
Having come to understand the true scope of this event,  
the party prepared themselves for the next day.
