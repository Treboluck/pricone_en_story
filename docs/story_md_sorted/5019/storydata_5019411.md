## Subtitle: This Vacation Won’t End
  
**Suzuna：**  
The event was a huge success, plus I made up with Misaki.  
A lot happened,  
but this was totally fun!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I wish we didn't have to leave so soon, though.  
I wanted to have some more fun.  
And we'll need to say goodbye to Rainy, Shiny and everyone else.  
  
**Io：**  
Let's come back again.  
Together, of course.  
As for now, we should get ready to leave.  
Fun as it was,  
you have plenty of homework left to do.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh, shoot!  
I totally forgot that we even had homework!  
Whiz-boy! You're gonna help me out, right?  
...  
Hellaaa!  
That means we can have some more fun! ♪  
  
**Misaki：**  
You won't be giving Suzuna special treatment, will you?  
E-even a lady enjoys  
some help now and then!  
Got it? Then let's chase after Suzuna!
