**Suzuna：**  
Whoa?! I can't even see in front of me now!  
You're getting way too hype, Rainy!  
  
**Io：**  
Keep yourselves warm, okay?  
The last thing you want is to catch a  
cold during the summer holidays.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Io, this is absolutely not the time to worry about colds.  
But now that it's come to this, it's up to top lady Misaki  
to teach Rainy a little lesson in humbleness!
