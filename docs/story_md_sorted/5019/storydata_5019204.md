Wh-what's the deal here?!  
The rain and wind are insane!  
  
**Misaki：**  
The beach is going to get devastated at this rate!  
That, plus my hair's all over the place.  
Urgh... I spent so much time getting it to look good!  
  
**Io：**  
Calm down, you two.  
Teamwork is key to dealing with this.  
And I know we can pull it off,  
so let's give it our all!
