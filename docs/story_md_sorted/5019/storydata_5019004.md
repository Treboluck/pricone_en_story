# A Lonely Spirit
Suzuna comes a sobbing Great Rain God at the beach. There she learns that its friend, the Great Shine God, has yet to wake up, meaning they can't meet.
  
## Subtitle: A Lonely Spirit
  
**Narration：**  
Suzuna comes across a mysterious entity  
while sitting alone at the beach.  
  
**???：**  
...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Th-this isn't a monster,  
is it?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Whattup.  
M-mind if I ask who—or what—you are?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh!  
Are you the Great Rain God?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
A-as if...  
  
**???：**  
*nod*  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh? Right on the money?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
But why's the Great Rain God here of all places?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Ideally I could get it to  
help out with the weather for tomorrow's event.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Something seems kinda off, though...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hey.  
  
**The Great Rain God：**  
...?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
You look pretty upset.  
Are you going through a rough spot?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Wait. It can't understand me, right?  
And here I am trying to speak to it.  
Big lol.  
  
**The Great Rain God：**  
I want to see my friend...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh?  
  
**The Great Rain God：**  
I want to see my friend, but I can't.  
That's why I'm sad.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Holy smokes!  
It spoke!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I'm totally, like, doing a communication!  
You're not human, but you get what I'm saying, so...  
Does that make you one of those bilingual geniuses?!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh man.  
This is some encounter with the unknown material right here!  
I'm wilding out!  
It's insane!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hey, hey. Mind if we have a little talk?  
Is that friend of yours one of the people that live here?  
  
**The Great Rain God：**  
No.  
It's a spirit, just like me.  
The people here refer to it as the Great Shine God.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
The Great Rain God and the Great Shine God, huh?  
But it's just the people here who call it that, right?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
What's its real name?  
What do you two call each other?  
  
**The Great Rain God：**  
...We don't call each other anything.  
We're always together, so we don't need to use names.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Well then.  
But hey. If you're buds, then how about using nicknames?  
I'll think up some good ones for you!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hm...  
Something memorable and catchy...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh, I've got it!  
  
**The Great Rain God：**  
?!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
You can be Rainy!  
And your friend can be Shiny!  
  
**The Great Rain God：**  
Rainy and Shiny...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Sound good?  
  
**The Great Rain God：**  
Rainy and Shiny...  
  
**The Great Rain God：**  
Yeah... I like it.  
Rainy and Shiny... ♪  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I'm Suzuna, by the way!  
Pleasure to meet ya, Rainy!  
  
**Rainy：**  
Thanks, Suzuna. ♪  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Glad you're into it.  
So what's you and Shiny's deal, anyway?  
  
**Rainy：**  
We'd always wake up together,  
then fight over menial things.  
But we'd also play lots and spend the whole summer together.  
  
**Rainy：**  
After that, we'd go back to sleep together until our next meeting.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Wow! Must be rad to have that much fun!  
Wish I could live a life without classes and homework!  
  
**Rainy：**  
Classes...?  
I don't know what that is.  
But I was always with Shiny.  
  
**Rainy：**  
The people here would always care for us, too.  
That made me happy.  
  
**Rainy：**  
But then... When I woke up this spring, Shiny wasn't there.  
We had an argument and never made up before going back to sleep.  
Was that the reason? Will Shiny ever play with me again?  
  
**Rainy：**  
I want to see Shiny...  
I don't want to be hated...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Rainy, my dude.  
I know that feel all too well.  
  
**Rainy：**  
How come?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I'm actually here for work.  
The people here asked me to come, in fact!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
But, well.  
I kind of got into an argument with one of the friends I brought.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Which sucks, since I was looking forward  
to hanging out once tomorrow's event is over.  
  
**Rainy：**  
You've been split up from your friend as well?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hm.  
Kind of, I guess?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
We both go to the same school.  
And they're talking about shutting it down. Wild, right?  
Oh. Shutting it down means, like, it'll stop existing.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
And if that happens, then we won't be able to hang out!  
So that's why this might be the last time we  
get to spend our summer holidays together.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Maybe it'd have been better if we never came here?  
  
**Rainy：**  
...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
But I'm a model.  
No way I could turn this offer down.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
*siiigh*  
How'd it all end up like this?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Suzuna! There you are!  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh! Whiz-boy!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Did I make you worry?  
Sorry about that.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I'm fine. I just came here to calm down a bit.  
I feel pretty bad about what I said.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hey, hey!  
You gotta see this!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Ta-da!  
This is the Great Rain God they talked about?  
Wicked cute, right?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  What're you talking about?  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzuna：**  
You joshing me, whiz-boy?  
But I'm being serious here!  
Look, over here!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Wait, huh?  
It really isn't there anymore.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
That's weird.  
I swear, Rainy was right here.  
And it was all sad and crying, too.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
They call it the Great Rain God, but that's not its real name.  
In fact, it doesn't even have a name!  
Wild, right?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
That's why I stepped in and gave it a nickname! Rainy!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh yeah! It's a spirit,  
but it could understand what I was saying!  
We even spoke for a little bit!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
What did we talk about?  
Well...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
—That's the gist of it!  
Kind of a love-hate relationship, I guess?  
Sure hit me right in the feels.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
How do you feel about friendships like that, whiz-boy?  
They get me all emotional.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Reminds me of you and Misaki.  
`Tag 3`  
**Suzuna：**  
For real?!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hm... But it kinda makes sense?  
We do argue a lot.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
But I mean, most of the time it turns out  
that we were just trying to praise or cheer each other up.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Wait.  
Does that mean...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Misaki said all of that 'cause I was down  
about the idea of the event being cancelled?  
She was trying to cheer me up the whole time?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Of course.  
`Tag 4`  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh man!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I was so focused on work and let my brain juices run wild!  
Normally I'd notice a lot quicker,  
but I was totally on edge this time.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Thanks for remind me, whiz-boy!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh?!  
Misaki was crying over me getting angry?!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Whiz-boy, let's boost!  
I gotta get back to the village and apologize to her!  
  
**Narration：**  
Suzuna dashed off, leaving {player} behind.  
Her destination was clear: the guildhouse, where Misaki awaited.
