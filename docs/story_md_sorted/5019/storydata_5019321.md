**Suzuna：**  
Calm down, Rainy!  
You'll be able to see Shiny soon!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Be a proper lady and settle down!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Wh-what's with this noise?!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Misaki, look!  
There's something surrounding Rainy!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Is that a barrier?  
Argh! You really are desperate to shut us out!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Really, though. What is that noise?!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
It... kind of sounds like a voice?  
Does Rainy have something it wants to tell us?  
  
**Misaki：**  
You're saying it's Rainy's voice?  
Assuming that is the case,  
it sounds like it's in real pain!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
That's it, Misaki!  
Rainy has to be in pain!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I felt the same when I was alone after we argued.  
I worried about what I said, if we could ever make up.  
It was painful. Depressing.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Suzuna...  
You went through that?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Rainy's going through that exact same experience.  
I'm sure Rainy made that barrier to try and be alone.  
To shut its heart off from everyone!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Rainy cheered me up when I was alone.  
So now it's my turn to return that favor!
