**Narration：**  
Pursuing the Omniscient Kaiser,  
Pecorine swings her blade with all her might.  
And yet...

**Pecorine：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
Omniscient... Kaiser...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
What's this? Care to explain, Your Highness?  
Up to now, you seemed so full of energy.  
Are you all out of breath already?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
The equipment you wear... It's most remarkable,  
but it come with a price, I recall?  
Hahaha... Are you all right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ngh...!  
If you really care, why don't you stand and face me?!

**Pecorine：**  
Yahhhhh!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Oops, so sorry! ♪  
You won't hit me with a strike like that in a hundred years.  
My dear princess.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Nghhh...!  
How can you possibly dodge with such perfect timing?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
She looks like she's full of openings!  
I'm attacking again and again with my Royal Equipment's full power!  
But none of my attacks are finding their mark!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This is the Kaiser's precognition...!  
It's terrible! Worse than I imagined! How crazy is this?!  
 But...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No matter what price I have to pay...  
I swear I will make sure this blade reaches you!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...*sigh*  
What a foolish princess.  
Foolish beyond measure.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Prattling off sickly ideals. Chasing dreams that can never be.  
And yet you fail to comprehend anything of your own situation.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Honestly, it disgusts me.  
It's no wonder you lost everything you ever had at my hands.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What are you talking about...?  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Monsters?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm surrounded?! In front... behind...!  
And somehow I've been separated from everyone else?!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
There. Checkmate.  
 We've reached the point  
where I can dispose of you with the minimum of effort.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Oh, and all of your friends should be similarly cornered  
and isolated by my monster horde.  
With so many rebels to crush, I really must conserve energy.  
 You see?  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aaaaahhhh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Urghhh...  
I'd just decided to make sure I work together with everyone!  
Why am I already repeating my mistakes?!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I really do pity you.  
Led by a ruler such as you, blind and reckless as a charging boar,  
this land would have perished even if I hadn't lifted a finger!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Omniscient Kaiser...!  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Now, this is goodbye!  
Brains, power, strength of character...  
You lacked it all from the start, hopeless princess!  
  

---  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A-aaahhh...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I hate it... I hate this...!  
In the end, I couldn't save anyone...  
...I couldn't do a thing...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If this is the end...  
I wish I'd asked him... for just a little more real affection...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I love him.  
I really do... love him so much.  
But…  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh...  
...Of course.  
I guess they do say first love never works out.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Pecorine!  
`Tag 1`  

---  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Get your head down, Pecorine!  
Hiyaaaahhh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
K-Karyl?!  
And you're here too, {player}?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
W... we made it...!  
I didn't think I'd be able to control this magic well enough!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...  
You're still alive, Karyl?  
And what's more, you're here to interrupt my perfect moment...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahh...! ...  
I wasn't...  
Of course I don't want to hurt you, Your Majesty!  
But I... I have to repay the debt I owe to this dummy here!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord! And Miss Karyl!  
If Miss Pecorine is safe from harm, let us retreat as agreed!  
This way!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Kokkoro!  
Okay, I'm coming!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
You think I'll allow that?  
It does seem your energy has grown somewhat...  
But if you think you can get the better of me, that's pure arrogance.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Go forth, my monsters!  
Block their escape, surround them, and crush them!  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
W-waaahhh...!  
The opening they created for me is closing up already!  
And the monsters are moving in!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...!  
Let us make a dash for that alleyway!  
Everyone, hurry!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Right...  
 Wait, huh?!  
Since when does this alley end in a solid wall?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Just hurry it up, Pecorine!  
We all need to get through!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
What are they doing?  
That route is quite clearly a dead end.  
They're cornering themselves like rats for me!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Worry not, Miss Pecorine!  
Simply take my lord's hand and mine...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
W-w-wahhh!  
Kokkoro, you're going to crash into the wall!  
  

---  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...!  
All of them were sucked into the wall?!  
This is... Queen Labyrinth's object manipulation?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
No... transformation!  
It's you lurking there, Metamorph Monarch!  
  
**Neneka：**  
...I suspected you would see through me.  
Opponents who know all my tricks can be so irritating.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Wouldn't you agree, Omniscient Kaiser... No, Mana?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Humility? From you? Are you feeling all right?  
Who else would be able to alter their magical signature  
down to the most microscopic of patterns?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
More pressingly,  
 step aside, Metamorph Monarch.  
If you do, I'll let you live. A little mercy for a fellow Crown.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Or what, do you really wish to be the first to die?  
With that body I drained of magic, I hardly expect you can resist.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Mercy, you say... Then why don't we talk?  
Let us find a new solution, more elegant than this wanton destruction.  
  
**Neneka：**  
For you and I... No, *only* you and I.  
If we worked together, could we not change this world?  
As fellow members of the Seven Crowns.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Hah!  
You may also be a Crown, but you're nowhere near my level.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Change the world, you say?  
Oh yes, I'll change it.  
 And I'll do it alone!  
  
**Neneka：**  
Mana... You poor fool. After all these years,  
you still can't envision a world with anyone but yourself.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Enough!  
I've become a god. Don't you dare pity me!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Besides... talk? At this point?  
I can see you're just trying to buy time!  
You conniving worm-tongued spy!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
We're done here.  
Begone, Metamorph Monarch!
