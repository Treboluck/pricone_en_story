# Chapter 14 Episode 6
Even with her secret weapon—the giant golem—lying defeated, the Kaiser still seems undaunted. Using her Astral Insight ability, which allows her to analyze huge volumes of data to predict the future, she corners Neneka. Just then, Christina appears before them both.

**Yukari：**  
Kablammy~! ♪  
  
**Tomo：**  
All right!  
The gigantic golem has collapsed into pieces!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Well,  the angle of descent, the golem's velocity,  
and the strength of the explosion were all calculated by yours truly...  
But still, good work, Mercurius Foundation!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ahhh... It's all over...  
Our budget's gone up in flames...  
How much work will we need to do for free to pay this off...?  
  
**Akino：**  
Ohohoho!  
 Everyone's lives are safe and sound,  
and that's worth any price in the world! ♪  
  
**Yukari：**  
Yep, yep! Gotta be alive to make profit~! ♪  
Now, I declare a toast! ♪  
...*hic* Eheheh... ♪  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh, for the... Haven't you downed enough already?  
Really, Yukari...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
But, well...  
If you consider what might have happened if the golem reached the city,  
I suppose you can say we paid the cheaper price...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Yes, quite right.  
Once this is over, I'll see that Nightmare  
requests full compensation from the palace for your losses.  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, that's wonderful of you, Tomo! ♪  
And of course, thank you too, Hatsune!  
This victory would have been impossible without your help! ♪  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Heheh! You're very welcome! ☆  
  
**Hatsune：**  
While I'm here, I think I'll help you all  
get the city evacuees to a safer location!  
...Though if it takes too long, I might doze off...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Thank you... We really appreciate it.  
With the monsters still at large, we can't let our guard down yet.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Still, that sure was quite the golem. I've never seen  
a monster with anywhere near that much magical energy.  
Can it really have been just a weapon to trample over Landosol?  
  
**Maho：**  
...H-huh?  
Hey... The magic energy from that golem...  
Instead of dissipatin', doesn't it seem to be flowin' somewhere?  
  
### Place: Landosol Plaza
  
**Narration：**  
Meanwhile, in Landosol...  
The Omniscient Kaiser stands triumphant  
after landing the finishing blow upon Neneka.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
The huge golem I summoned to the city has been destroyed?  
How irritating those Mercurius Foundation pests can be.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Still, no matter. That golem was little more than a shortcut  
to flatten Landosol without getting my own hands dirty.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
As for the magic supply it was transporting...  
It will take time, but I can still retrieve it from here.  
...Hm?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...!  
Metamorph Monarch... You're still alive?  
  
**Neneka：**  
...Disappointing. I had hoped to strike  
while you were lost in thought, but no such luck, I see.  
That ability of yours is such an irritation.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Oh, is it?  
 Still, that wasn't the worst plan.  
It's true that the unexpected loss of one of my trump cards  
had caught me off guard.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
More pressingly...  
I was sure I didn't see you dodge my last attack...  
Oh, of course. You must have transformed into my magical attack itself.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
When did you learn to pull such a fancy trick?  
So cruel not to share the fun with me.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Yes, this is a trump card of mine.  
Not one I can use too often, I admit...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Your transformation, and my foresight.  
Both are unfair advantages to say the least...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
But while I need only step out of your attacks' paths...  
Tell me, how many times can you still transform?  
My guess would be... Let's see.  
 About twice more at most!  
  
**Neneka：**  
...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Haha...  
That leaves just one more, then.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Very impressive, Mana... A fine analysis.  
They don't call you a genius for no reason.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Why, thank you! ♪  
I'm not usually one to bask in empty compliments...  
But when it comes from you, I'm actually a little flattered.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I'm not trying to butter you up.  
That genius you possess is just objective fact.  
The peerless intellect responsible for crafting this world's precursor...  
  
**Neneka：**  
Even now, not only do you control countless monsters in the city,  
but you harvest that input—each and every piece of data—  
and analyze it in full...  
  
**Neneka：**  
Until your mind can predict every event that lies ahead.  
To those with less knowledge,  
it must seem that you can peer into the future itself.  
  
**Neneka：**  
The feat ascribed to Laplace's Demon, master of physics itself...  
Though that demon was disproven by the advent of quantum mechanics,  
in this world, you made it reality. That takes genius, I assure you.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Are you calling my gift——my divine Astral Insight—a demon's trick?  
Such blasphemy.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Ah, yes. \"Astral Insight.\" That was the name you gave to it.  
To your... additional trump card.  
I'll be sure to remember it in the future.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Good. While you do, remember this.  
As long as I have this gift, I am nigh invulnerable.  
No one can hope to lay a single scratch upon me!  
  
**Neneka：**  
I wouldn't be so certain of that.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...?!  
  
**Neneka：**  
Oh?  
Instead of evading, did you block that with magic? ...Mana.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...  
  
**Neneka：**  
That look on your face says you miscalculated.  
Why don't you speak your mind?  
Let's hear a nice loud \"what the heck,\" shall we?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Why, you...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I missed?  
No... I misread her movements?  
What is this...?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Astral Insight... I knew of this bothersome ability far in advance,  
and that I would be forced to face it.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Yet you thought I would not come prepared?  
I fear you take me far too lightly.  
  
**Monster：**  
GGGRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Masaki：**  
Kaiser data terminal, identified!  
I must ready my ability as Mistress Neneka's Princess Knight...  
and unleash it!  
  
**Masaki：**  
Shine on high, my gleaming justice! Decadent Light!  
  
**Monster：**  
...GGHH?  
 GG... GGG... GGHH... GHO... OHHH...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Ah... That's your scheme.  
That Princess Knight of yours—Masaki, was that his name?  
You're using him to corrupt the composition of my monsters.  
  
**Neneka：**  
You catch on so quickly.  
Masaki's ability is to cause bugs in monsters...  
Any beast affected by it will become useless to you as a source of data.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Astral Insight...  
It would seem you held a great deal of faith in that technique.  
But even you could not fully predict your fellow Crowns' capabilities.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Hmph.  
For now, it only dulls my precision a little.  
You haven't won this battle yet.  
  
**Neneka：**  
True enough.  
 In my current state, I may not be able to defeat you.  
But without your Insight, how exactly do you plan to fend off  
the countless other enemies you have so freely made?  
  
**Neneka：**  
As a friend... here's one last warning, Mana.  
Give this up, surrender yourself to Nightmare, and enter their custody.  
If you do, I'll guarantee your safety.  
 So please... see sense...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Hah... Ahahaha...!  
  
**Neneka：**  
Mana...?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
It's you who take me lightly, Metamorph Monarch!  
I knew all along that my fellow Crowns would stand against me.  
This is well within my expectations!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Now, see if you can dodge this!  
  
**Neneka：**  
...?!  
Oh no...!  
  
**Neneka：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
And thus your supply of transformations runs dry.  
With no more tricks up your sleeve, this magic show is over.  
Wouldn't you agree?  
  
**Neneka：**  
His foresight... His Astral Insight  
has regained its full precision...!  
Mana Senri... I see. You never change a bit...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
This time, it's time to say goodbye!  
Metamorph Monarch!

**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...  
  
**Christina：**  
Phew.  
Just in the nick of time, I take it?  
Honestly... To think I, of all people, would play the gallant hero!  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Though you do seem rather drained,  
it's good to see you safe, Neneka.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Chris... And Rajraj...  
If you planned to rescue me, do so sooner.  
I was almost vaporized, and my soul reduced to a mere Shadow.  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh—so sorry.  
Even with Rajraj to transport me, it was hard to pinpoint your position.  
Still, can you complain? In the end, you still have your life.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...I'm impressed you found us at all, Christina.  
In a city this size, with every street in chaos...  
Even the flow of magic is thoroughly destabilized.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah, yes—about that.  
As it happens, we had a little help over the airwaves.  
A guide who told us...  
 Hahah! Oh, this part is hilarious.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...?  
  
**Christina：**  
Your Majesty's location—that was what our guide offered.  
And in return,  
 they demanded that we delay you and stall for time!  
  
**Christina：**  
\"Stall for time\"?!  
 A joke for the ages indeed!  
As if my facing you in battle  
could amount to any less than a grand final showdown!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Rabid mutt.  
Can you stop showering me in spittle?  
I've always detested  
 your loathsome beastliness.  
  
**Christina：**  
Have you now?  
Well, I have nothing but love for you!  
I adore you from the bottom of my heart!  
  
**Christina：**  
Your beauty! Your natural gifts!  
And above all, your impeccably twisted soul entrances me!  
  
**Christina：**  
That is why I showed you loyalty!  
Because you and you alone could sate my desires!  
Yes... I love you so much I could kill you,  
 Mana Senri!  
  
**Rajraj：**  
...Neneka, please stand back.  
I will provide Christina with backup.  
In your state, you should not stray too close.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Yes, I think I'll follow that advice.  
...Rajraj. Seeing you act like a gentleman makes me feel uneasy.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Hmph... You've bought yourself a few seconds of life.  
But you'll be a Shadow soon enough.  
You and your foolish saviors alike!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah, how glorious! Finally, you deign to face us in battle, Your Majesty!  
My Numbers Avalon and your Astral Insight!  
Let us see which is greater... Now! May the strongest prevail!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Finally I deign to face you?  
A battle to determine the strongest?  
It's time you abandoned such notions, Chris.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
The path of conquest belongs to me alone.  
And eliminating minor pests such as yourselves?  
That is no battle. It's nothing but a tedious chore!
