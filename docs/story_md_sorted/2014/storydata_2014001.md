# Chapter 14 Episode 1

## Subtitle: The Key to Victory
  
### Place: Landosol Plaza
  
**Narration：**  
Countless monsters and Shadows ravage the streets of Landosol,  
turning it into a battleground.  
As she charges into the fray, Pecorine spots a familiar figure...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You'll regret meeting me here, Omniscient Kaiser!  
Haaaahhh!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Haha... How scary.  
The princess, twisting her pretty face in angry desperation...  
Now isn't that a terrible shame.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Of course I'm desperate!  
For my people! For my family!  
If I defeat you here, I can save them all and more besides!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Oh, really?  
Then please do try your best to corner me.  
This way, my dear! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Nghh...!  
Will you stop being so evasive?!  
  
**Narration：**  
As Pecorine charges headlong towards the Kaiser,  
{player} does his best to follow,  
determined to give her all the strength he can, but...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, this way!  
Miss Nebbia has brought us a new strategy to prevail in this battle!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I can't just leave Pecorine!  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
I understand your concern.  
However... to be frank, we stand very little chance  
of defeating the Kaiser in our current state.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
To turn the tide and truly aid Miss Pecorine's efforts...  
This strategy may be our only chance, my lord!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Nebbia!  
As you instructed, I have brought my lord back!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Great! Thanks.  
I can see why Fio likes you.  
 What a good girl! ♪  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Now, I'll run you through the details!  
Listen close, because I'm only saying this once!  
That means you, {player}!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Right inside our very own Karyl's body, Akira—  
Labyrista—has hidden a key and some magic.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Yeah, apparently.  
No point trying to deny it, so I guess I'll admit that part.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
We need to transfer this key to {player}  
before the plan can begin.  
And as for how we achieve that...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey... Hold on, Nebbia!  
Is the method you just told me *really* the only way to do this?!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Sheesh, can you get over it already?  
It's not like I'm asking you for anything too difficult.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Of course it's difficult, idiot!  
Of all people, me and him...?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  ...?  
`Tag 2`  
**Nebbia：**  
Listen. Magical contracts, transfers, and all those kind of rituals  
have a few standard patterns they tend to follow.  
This is just one of them.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Well, in layman's terms... I'm talking about a kiss.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A-a kiss, you say?  
Miss Karyl must kiss my lord...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Aaaghhh...!  
N-no, I can't do it! I can't take that kind of humiliation!  
Besides, I haven't... I've never k-kissed any...  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Oh, come on!  
The world's in peril, so just do what you gotta do already!  
You *do* want to make yourself useful to these guys, don't you?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Urgh...  
...Aaghhhh... I mean, you're not wrong, but...  
B-but I...!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Heheh! ♪ And besides...  
You keep making out like this is awful,  
but you don't dislike him, do you?  
 This fine fella! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Sh... shut up, shut up, shut uuuup!  
I'm not doing it! I'll never do it!  
Not in a million years!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The chance to,  
 ah... touch lips... with my lord...  
Miss Karyl, how I envy you this role...  
...Ah, if only I were able to take your place...  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Um, guys. If you keep dawdling, Pecorine might bite the dust.  
She's putting her life on the line facing the Kaiser right now, remember?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
T-true enough. Miss Karyl, I fear there is no other way.  
Face my lord, and softly... briefly...  
momentarily brush your lips... against his...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This is painful for me to put into words as well.  
But if it is for but an instant...  
I suppose I can allow this of you, and you alone.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, I can't! In the middle of this madness,  
sh-sharing a...  
 k-kiss... with him?  
There's gotta be a better place for this, at least...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm... A better place, you say.  
Currently, the city is wholly overrun by monsters,  
so it will be most difficult to find a comfortable spot...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Nebbia.  
Am I to understand that in order to transfer this key,  
the contact of lips upon lips is absolutely necessary?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Could the location be changed...?  
For instance, a simple peck upon my lord's forehead  
would sadly not suffice, I presume...?  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Huh?  
Sure, that works.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It *works?!*  
Oh, for godssakes!  
When were you planning to mention that part?!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Well, you know?  
Nobody asked, so...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Nghhhh!  
You really tick me off!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Let's just try it out, shall we?  
`Tag 3`
