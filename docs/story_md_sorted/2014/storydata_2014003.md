# Chapter 14 Episode 3
The residents of the Sarendia Orphanage arrive at Elizabeth Park. As Mahiru and her guildmates struggle to deal with all the new arrivals, a gigantic golem appears and sends the children into a panic. Saren is deeply frustrated that she can do so little in this hour of need.
  
## Subtitle: A Terrible Shadow
  
### Place: Elizabeth Park
  
**Narration：**  
While {player} and his friends  
confront the Omniscient Kaiser in the city of Landosol...  
  
**Narration：**  
The Sarendia Orphanage girls have finally succeeded  
in leading the evacuees to Elizabeth Park.  
  
**Misogi：**  
We're here!  
Beat you all to it! ☆  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahhh... *pant*...  
Wh-what a journey...  
Urgh... Let me rest on this tree stump...  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm so sorry, Kyoka, but can you walk a little longer?  
This will hold up the line...  
 Look—can you see that farm building?  
If we make it there, we should be safe.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Eheheh.  
D'you need me to carry you, Kyoka?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Urgh... Don't treat me like a child!  
I'm all right.  
Seeing the goal is all I needed.  
 My energy's coming back!  
  
**Saren：**  
Good girls. You're both amazing.  
...  
Kurumi, Ayane, are you OK?  
If you're struggling, I can always carry one of you under each arm! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Th-that's okay, Mama Saren...  
Performing on stage takes stamina,  
so lately I've been doing some running and breathing exercises!  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'm totally pooped...  
Pukichi, you walk instead of me...  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Talk sense, girl.  
Look, there are much littler kids still doing their best here.  
Gotta set 'em a good example and soldier on. Less complaining!\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Fine, fine...  
Geez, I just wanna curl up in a nice warm bed.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hmm... I'm not sure there'll be beds.  
Do you see those tents set up all over the place, Ayane?  
I think we'll probably be curling up in sleeping bags there tonight.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Aghhh!  
Well, fine! I'm a big girl, so I'm not gonna complain!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hee hee. Don't worry, you're not letting anyone down.  
You'll share a tent with me, won't you?  
  
**Saren：**  
Whew...  
Looks like we've at least managed to escape from all those monsters.  
The farm seems nice and calm, so I think this was the right move.  
  
**Saren：**  
It was such a struggle, though!  
Fending off a whole pack of monsters till we could flee...  
It's a miracle that none of the little ones were too badly hurt.  
  
**Saren：**  
...What about back in the city?  
I just hope the guys there didn't get mixed up in all this...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Oh! Hey, look!  
I think someone just arrived!  
Let's go greet 'em together,  
 Mimi! ♪  
  
**Mimi：**  
Mmnhh... I'm too sleepy to go...  
Uwehhh?  
Misogi? Kyoka?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Mimi?  
Ah! Mimi's here!  
  
**Mimi：**  
You guys! I got split up from Mommy and Daddy...  
I was so lonely! Waaahhh!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Mimi!  
There, there. It's OK now!  
 Big hug~! ♪  
C'mon, Kyoka, you too!  
 Big huuuug! ♪  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Urgh.  
Please don't! It's so embarrassing in public...  
Actually, Mimi, how did you get here? Did you run all on your own?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Oh, no.  
So, um, back there, I was helping out at the festival...  
But then lots of monsters came along...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Matsuri was helping at the stalls too,  
and Mahiru was there... We all ran together.  
Before I knew it, we were here.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Why is all this happening to us today?  
It was supposed to be a fun festival...  
Daddy, Mommy...! Waaaaahhhh!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
A-aaghhhh!  
Can you try to stop crying, Mimi?!  
I swear I'll find your mom and dad, no matter where they are!  
  
**Saren：**  
You're... little Matsuri from Nightmare, aren't you?  
You look just like Jun described you once,  
when we were having tea together.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Uweh? You know me?  
Did you need something, umm... Who're you?  
  
**Saren：**  
Hmm...  
I suppose it's best if I put it this way.  
I'm Saren, the former vice-captain of Nightmare.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Whoa! You're *the* Saren?!  
The guys at Nightmare say great stuff about you!  
It's an honor to meetcha... ma'am!  
  
**Saren：**  
Yes, likewise. ♪  
By the way, do you know where I can find Mahiru?  
  
**Saren：**  
With all these evacuees arriving, she can't handle them alone...  
I'd like to offer some help.  
This kind of thing is a forte of mine.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Oh, thanks!  
I don't think Mahiru's really used to this stuff,  
so I really hope you can help her out!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
This way!  
 We set up a sort of HQ in the barn,  
so I think that's where she's working. I'll take you there!  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, thank you! ♪  
Suzume, can I ask you to keep an eye on the kids?  
I'll go and figure things out with the people here.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, of course!  
Understood, milady!  
  
**Shiori：**  
...Hmm?  
Mahiru, someone's coming this way.  
  
**Rin：**  
Shiorin... You're way too tense.  
If you keep your bow raised like that, you'll scare people.  
  
**Lima：**  
Rin's right!  
Everyone's so tired, I think we're all a bit on edge...  
Best to avoid causing any extra trouble.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ahh... I'm sorry.  
Hatsune still hasn't come back or gotten in touch, so I'm just worried...  
Is she OK...? I hope she didn't do anything crazy...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hm? What's all this?  
Oh... Well, I never!  
  
**Saren：**  
Hello there, Mahiru. It's always a pleasure to see you.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ahaha.  
 How's about we cut the formalities.  
Right now, we can't handle all these evacuees arrivin',  
so I could use a little help here.  
  
**Saren：**  
Of course. That's what I came to suggest.  
This situation isn't easy, but let's try to get through it together.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
All righty!  
Can't do a whole lot once the sun goes down,  
so let's clear up as much as we can before then!  
  
**Lima：**  
All right! ...But, um, is it OK for me to go out there?  
These people were chased here by monsters.  
Won't seeing me scare them?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hm. I'd like to say it'll be fine,  
but we oughtta avoid any possibility of a fuss, yeah.  
Sorry to say this, but can you take care of things indoors, Limalima?  
  
**Lima：**  
Yep, sure thing! I'll do everything I can within my own abilities!  
I mean, I can't let everyone down! ♪  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey. If you're shorthanded, can we help out with anything?  
  
**Inori：**  
I'll help too...  
 Achoo!  
 Hwaachoo!  
Bwaaachoo!  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey, um... Is that girl there feeling OK?  
She's sneezing like nobody's business. That a cold?  
Try not to give it to us, will ya?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh...  
If it's a cold, I have some medicine! ♪  
  
**Inori：**  
Urgh... That would help.  
I've been stuck like this all day...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh... I can relate.  
When your body's weak, it can feel  
so frustrating that you can't be of more use to everyone.  
  
**Inori：**  
Weak?  
 I-I'm not weak!  
It's just today that I seem to be sneezing a lot...  
 Hwaaachoo!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Scrambling up this mountain must've worn you out.  
Inori, why don't you bundle up in a sleeping bag and get some rest?  
  
**Inori：**  
Aurghh...  
 But you're gonna keep helping, right, Kaya-P?  
Then I'm coming with you!  
I don't wanna snooze while you're hard at work out here!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Well, I'll be! We really appreciate your offer!  
The world sure is full o' fine folk!  
  
**Children：**  
Waaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Suzume：**  
M-milady, milady, milady!  
I-i-i-it's terrible!  
  
**Saren：**  
Suzume!  
What's wrong? Is it more monsters?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
N-no, um, ahh... I mean, it is, but...  
Look over there!  
You really have to see this!

**Giant Golem：**  
GG GG GU UU UO OO GH HH !  
  
**Lima：**  
Wh-wh-what *is* that thing?!  
A golem?! At that size?!  
It's as big as an entire fortress!  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's just walking along in the distance,  
but every step it takes feels like an earthquake!  
  
**Inori：**  
Eughh!  
If that thing chased after us, we'd be done for in seconds!  
  
**Saren：**  
O-okay, let's calm down!  
True, that huge golem is an outrageous sight... But it's fine!  
It doesn't seem to be coming this way!  
  
**Suzume：**  
B-but milady...!  
All of the children are falling into a panic!  
And I'm not far from completely losing it myself!  
  
**Saren：**  
Ohhh, try to calm down, Suzume!  
I need your help with comforting the children!  
  
`image display end`  
**Saren：**  
It's true that the golem isn't coming towards us...  
But as for where it *is* heading... it has to be the capital!  
Which means it's part of this whole crisis too?!  
  
**Saren：**  
Urgh...!  
 This is frustrating beyond words!  
I want to deal with it, but there's no way I can right now!  
I'd need two, three... no, four or five of myself to handle this!  
  
**Saren：**  
Right now, the best I can do is keep the children safe...  
But Jun... Akino... everyone...  
 and you too, {player}!  
Please... just tell me you're all okay...!
