## Subtitle: Waltz of Worship and Warfare
  
**Narration：**  
In the midst of the city's chaos,  
the Omniscient Kaiser and \"Regina Geas\" Christina  
exchange fierce blows with no end in sight.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hahahah!  
Glorious! This is glorious!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...!  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh, such fun.  
Ahhhh...!  
Whyever did I not do this sooner?!  
  
**Christina：**  
I unleash deadly strikes that cannot miss!  
You read their paths, and defend with the minimum of energy!  
And the reverse is just the same!  
  
**Christina：**  
Souls entwined yet untouching!  
A gossamer eternity that will crumble at the slightest error!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah, such an elegant dance of death!  
I could savor it till the end of time!  
This waltz of courtship and carnage!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
So this is Christina's... Regina Geas's full strength.  
I knew, of course, but it's quite the irritation...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
{player} and his little friends  
seem to be moving strangely as well.  
I'd really prefer to dispose of Christina with haste...  
  
**Christina：**  
Does your mind drift elsewhere, Majesty?  
I'm frankly hurt!  
If you must muse, muse upon the savage foe before you!  
  
**Christina：**  
Yes... gaze upon me alone! Eye me with venom! Behold me with passion!  
Come for my life till the day it ends; cherish me till your breath expires!  
Doesn't that sound magnificent?! Well, Omniscient Kaiser?!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Yes.  
I suppose that would be a delightful existence.  
For someone like you who can only find pleasure in others.  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh...?  
Hahaha! To think you would respond to my desire in kind—  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
But you see, that's not who I am.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Christina. You just told me this.  
That you crave my beauty. My talent. The twisted soul I bear.  
That's why you're drawn to me.  
  
**Christina：**  
Indeed!  
You are truly exceptional in every sense of the word!  
No other in this dull existence can rival the qualities you possess!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Yes, true...  
But you see, in my peerlessness, I desire no equals.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I alone was raised to be a god.  
A god needs no friend or lover, no wife or husband.  
An absolute god stands forever peerless above all.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah, I see!  
It is your peerless divinity that draws me to you,  
yet that same peerless divinity drives you to reject me!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hahahah!  
Well, how vexing! Is this what they call a paradox?!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Perhaps so.  
 Now, will you finally leave me be?  
  
**Christina：**  
Nay. Ah, nay! If I am denied...  
I must tear the god from on high! Make her kiss my blade!  
And when I stand triumphant, I must extend my offer anew!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Ah... You really are insufferable.  
Each futile word from your lips offends me!  
  
**Rajraj：**  
An all-out blow from Christina...  
Yet still, it can't strike home...  
  
**Christina：**  
So it appears.  
But... is something wrong? Majesty.  
I fancy you're expending more energy on defense than before.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
My Astral Insight's precision is falling...?  
...It's not just the monsters.  
They're systematically eradicating my Shadows too.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
After Neneka saw through my methods,  
she must have informed the others.  
Honestly. How very aggravating...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Step aside now, Christina.  
  
**Christina：**  
Aside?  
 That's your dreariest joke yet.  
I have my orders to keep you fully occupied. And I mean to fulfill them.  
Besides which...  
  
**Christina：**  
Above all, what could possibly possess me  
to abandon this thrilling game?!  
  
**Rajraj：**  
We are all facing you with our own resolve firmly settled.  
I suggest you prepare to pay a fitting price, Omniscient Kaiser.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Honestly, every last one of you... You're all hopeless.  
Fine. Have it your way.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
If you insist, I'll adjust my own strategy.  
Even though  
 it truly does pain me.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Christina... Be careful.  
Her aura just shifted significantly.  
  
**Christina：**  
So it appears.  
 But it changes little.  
As long as she's willing to play!  
Now, shall we continue our merry dance, Majesty?!
