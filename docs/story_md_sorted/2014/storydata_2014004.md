**Narration：**  
Meanwhile, on one of the main roads near Landosol...  
  
**Yukari：**  
*hic*... Mnyrnyrhhh... Ahhh...  
Feels sho gooood... ♪  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hello, Yukari?! Yu-ka-ri!  
Can you wake up now?! Please stand by yourself!  
I need you to act urgently and efficiently!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Mrnnhh...  
 Uweh?  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Akino：**  
Yukari! Mifuyu!  
Look out behind you!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Waaahhh?!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Akino：**  
When a beast assaults my friends, I'm there to slice it in two!  
Perfect timing, if I do say so myself! ♪  
Ohohohoho! ♪  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yes...  
Better timing than I'd usually expect from you.  
Wait—Yukari?  
  
**Yukari：**  
I... it huuuurts!  
My head... It's gonna split in two...!  
  
**Akino：**  
Y-Yukari?! Whatever is the matter?  
Could it be that brute injured you?  
I thought I got it before it reached you...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ah... No, I don't think so. This must just be a hangover.  
  
**Yukari：**  
A-Akino's piercing laughter is still ringing in my ears...  
...Wait, h-huh...?  
Did I... Did I...?  
 Aaaaaghh!  
  
**Yukari：**  
It's over! I've really done it now!  
My darkest secret's out!  
I put in all that effort to seem like an ordinary, respectable woman!  
  
**Yukari：**  
L-look, guys! Don't get me wrong!  
I-I just happened to overdo it this time!  
That wasn't the real me at all! In fact, you imagined the whole thing!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Waahhh!  
Yukari! If you're going to flail, can you get away from me?!  
Don't swing that sword around wildly! It's dangerous!  
  
**Akino：**  
Heheh.  
No need to get so embarrassed, Yukari.  
  
**Akino：**  
In fact, learning that the stiff and formal Yukari  
has such a charming hidden side, too...  
It has been a most enchanting experience! ♪  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Um, hello?  
Why can you Mercurius Foundation ladies never seem to stay serious?  
  
**Tomo：**  
We're still severely short on fighters here,  
so you need to give this your all!  
  
**Yukari：**  
O-of course! I'm so sorry we're always like this!  
Wait... what's the situation?  
Why are we surrounded by monsters?!  
  
**Maho：**  
Of course...  
After all that nappin' away, you've got a bit of catchin' up to do.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Allow me to summarize!  
In order to escape this sudden terrible disaster,  
we began a full-scale evacuation to get the panicking people to safety!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But once we hit the road,  
 a new horde of monsters stood in our way!  
So we're struggling to take care of those, my dear!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Yahhh!  
  
**Tomo：**  
...Dear me.  
Hard to believe even the road is packed this full of dangerous beasts.  
It's still an improvement on the state inside the city...  
  
**Tomo：**  
But it's hard to fight while protecting the citizens.  
Even our royal knights are beginning to run out of stamina!  
  
**Maho：**  
We're all here now, and we can't abandon folk in need.  
Let me lend a li'l hand of my own.  
Kasumi, I'll need your help too!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Good grief.  
Don't you know I'm a thinker, not a fighter?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ahhh, Maho's relying on me!  
I love this!  
I need to do my very best and leave a good impression!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Thank you kindly, ladies of Caon.  
 Oh, and while I hate to impose,  
I hope we can count on concerted efforts from the Foundation too.  
  
**Yukari：**  
A-all right!  
 Thanks for the recap!  
My head is still aching a little...  
but I have to work hard, if only to make up for my behavior!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Good to hear!  
We'll be counting on you!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Absolutely!  
I'm actually rather skilled with the sword as well as magic!  
As a former holy knight,  
 I swear I'll protect everyone from any monst—  
  
**Yukari：**  
Wh-what's this shaking?  
It's not coming from the city, right?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
No, Yukari!  
I think it's actually coming  
 from further down this road...  
...  
Wait, what *is* that?!  
  
![201400401.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/201400401.webp)  
**Akino：**  
I-is that some kind of utterly titanic golem?!  
It must be at least half the size of my family estate!  
  
**Maho：**  
My, my.  
Your folks sure must have a big ol' house there, Akino.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
That's the part that bugs you?!  
Wait, this isn't the time for any of this!  
Wh-what now?! That colossus is coming this way!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's moving... let's see... a little faster than a carriage, I'd say.  
If it were just us, we could probably get out of its path easily enough...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But with these monsters still at large and citizens to protect,  
my calculations suggest this puts us in a tight spot.  
  
`image display end`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Umm, Yukari?  
 As a former holy knight,  
you're going to protect us from any monsters, right?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Wh... whaaaa?!  
I said that... I did say that...  
But there's just no way! How can I face that thing?!  
  
**Akino：**  
...Ahh!  
I've got it!  
I do believe the perfect idea just occurred to me! ♪  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ahhh...?!  
Here we go. One of Akino's wild spur-of-the-moment plans.  
I have a really bad feeling...  
  
**Tomo：**  
No, any kind of plan is welcome right now.  
If there's a chance it will resolve this, I'm interested to hear it.  
  
**Akino：**  
Ohohoho! ♪  
It's extremely simple, really! ♪  
  
**Akino：**  
Mifuyu, Yukari, have you both forgotten?  
We have  
 a fine airship in our possession! ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
An airship... Hmm.  
That's a flying vessel, yes?  
I suppose it would help us make our escape...  
  
**Yukari：**  
But didn't we send our airship  
to transport the children and elderly  
to a village nearby where they'll be safe?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yes. I expect they'll have arrived by this point.  
Tamaki was piloting, so if we can get in touch,  
we could certainly ask her to come this way, but...  
  
**Akino：**  
Excuse me?  
Whatever are the two of you saying?  
I never said a word about using it to escape.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Then are you saying we should use it to fight?  
Does the ship have some magical artillery  
that will work on that colossal golem?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Of course it has no such thing!  
In the first place, airships aren't built for combat.  
In order to fly, they need to be hollow and light...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Besides, the envelope—that balloon that keeps it afloat—  
is full of flammable gas and magical energy!  
A single fire blast from a monster, and it would surely explode!  
  
**Akino：**  
Yes!  
That's why  
 we'll set it on fire! ♪  
  
**Yukari：**  
Huh?  
  
**Akino：**  
We'll pack it extra full of explosives,  
send it towards the brute, and drop it from a height!  
The airship explodes, and boom! No more golem!  
 Isn't that simple? ♪  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
...What?  
  
**Maho：**  
Wow... I don't get the details,  
 but that's a mighty brave plan!  
Akino seems ever so confident, so isn't it worth a shot?  
  
**Yukari：**  
W-wait, wait, wait!  
Wait one minute!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Use the whole airship as a giant bomb?!  
Have you even considered how much that thing costs, Akino?!  
This time you really might ruin the whole Foundation!  
  
**Akino：**  
If that's the price of our shared survival, then money is no object!  
Now tell me, who here is skilled with communication magic?  
We must contact our pilot at once...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hold on just a second.  
As far as I know, airships aren't built to be controlled remotely.  
If you're planning to sacrifice the pilot, I really don't think I can agree.  
  
**Akino：**  
...I... I didn't think of that part!  
It's true, dear Tamaki's life would be in terrible peril!  
Whatever shall we do?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I knew it. I knew it! Lives come first! The plan's off!  
Thank you, Kasumi, for speaking sense!  
You're the savior of our entire guild!  
  
**Tomo：**  
However... at this point, what is the alternative?  
As I just said, we'd have to escape from the golem's path  
while fighting off monsters *and* protecting civilians...  
  
**Akino：**  
Heavens, no! If we leave that golem on its current course,  
who knows what it could do to the city?!  
There will be no home left for the evacuees to return to!  
  
**Maho：**  
That's true. My prince, Kaori and all the others  
must still be fightin' back in the city as well...  
We've gotta stop that golem for all their sakes!

**Hatsune：**  
Sha-shing! ☆  
I heard almost the whole discussion  
 from up above!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Huh?  
Wh-who are you?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Just a passing elf from Forestier,  
and a friend of Kokkoro and her lord! ♪  
Call me Hatsune! ☆  
  
**Hatsune：**  
It sounds like you want to crash an airship into that giant golem?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Well, I'm great at flying!  
I can grab the pilot and get out at the last second!  
I'll use my super...  
 um, magic...  
 to control the ship's descent too!  
  
`image display end`  
**Akino：**  
My, what an utterly perfect offer!  
And if you know that good sir, you can surely be trusted!  
Isn't that right, Mifuyu, Yukari? ♪  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
W... well...  
  
**Yukari：**  
I... I suppose...  
  
**Akino：**  
Well then!  
Since we're all agreed, that settles it! ♪  
Operation Airship Goes Boom is a go!  
  
**Maho：**  
Miracle Mahorin, twinkle twinkle hoy! ♪  
I've set up a connection to that pilot of yours! ♪  
  
**Tamaki：**  
\"Airship Goes Boom\"?!  
Huh? That name's news to me!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Wahhhhh?!  
Wait, Akino!  
When I said \"I suppose,\" I wasn't agreeing to the plan!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
We only agreed that a friend of his should be trustworthy!  
Can you stop and listen for once in your life?!
