**Narration：**  
Here in the city of Landosol,  
{player} has forged bonds with many girls.  
  
**Narration：**  
Each of those girls is fighting valiantly to overcome this crisis,  
but thanks to the monsters under the Omniscient Kaiser's command,  
they find themselves separated from their friends, in perilous isolation.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Rei：**  
Yah...!  
  
**Rei：**  
Ugh!  
The beasts have separated us completely!  
Yui! Hiyori! Where are you?!  
  
**Muimi：**  
*pant*... *pant*...!  
It's monsters everywhere I look...  
I can't even tell which way I'm running any more!  
  
**Rino：**  
Waaahhh!  
Big Sis Shizuru! Where are yoooou?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ahhhh... I saw a kid being chased by monsters,  
so I tried to save her, but it was just a Shadow!  
Where's everyone gone?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Some kind of intelligence is guiding these monsters' movements!  
At this rate, even a big sis can't do much to help...  
  
**Kaori：**  
But... what now?!  
I can't even make out Makoto's scent anymore!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
S-stay away from meee!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
*pant*... *pant*...! What now...?!  
On my own like this, I can't even cast spells unless I keep running  
through the whole incantation... I need to... catch my breath...!  
  
**???：**  
Keep running that way!  
Leap into that side alley just ahead!  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh? Wh-who's this?!  
 It's not Hiyori's voice, or Rei's either...  
Is it a magical broadcast—  
 Waaahhh!  
  
**Yui：**  
I tripped!  
 What awful timing...!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
A... ahhh...!  
Mr. Knight...!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Yui!  
**Choice: (2)**  Are you OK?!  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
M-Mr. Knight?!  
You really came for me...!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
Y-yes!  
Thank you!  
 But how did you find me...?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Yui：**  
...Wait, look out!  
Here comes another big one!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Don't worry!  
**Choice: (5)**  Karyl, you're up!  
`Tag 4`  
`Tag 5`  
**Karyl：**  
Hiyaaahhhh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I will disrupt its balance!  
The rest is up to you, Miss Pecorine!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Right!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Taaaaake this!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight, and the whole Gourmet Guild...  
Thank goodness! You're all OK!  
  
**Monsters：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I'm here too!  
Thanks for the directions, Carmina!  
  
**Yui：**  
You too, Makoto?  
And \"Carmina\"...? You mean, the pop idols?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yeah. They opened magical channels to us all  
and told us which way to go.  
 Although it's {player}  
who collected the info to begin with.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Heeeey!  
Yui~!  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh! Hiyori!  
A-and, um...?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hmmm~?  
I came like I was told to, but...  
There sure are a lot of girls here.  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahhh!  
Big Sis Shizuru~!  
I finally found you...!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Makoto~! ♪  
It's great to see you again!  
Good thing I trusted those directions! ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Kaori! You're safe!  
...  
Wait, just how many people are gathering in this one spot?!  
  
**Rei：**  
Yui!  
  
**Yui：**  
There's Rei too!  
Over here~!  
  
**Rei：**  
Sorry, I lost sight of you...  
I hope you're not hurt.  
  
**Yui：**  
No, no, I'm fine!  
Did the Carmina girls guide you here as well?  
  
**Rei：**  
Yes, they did. Hey, Tsumugi?  
Your instructions were a big help. Thank you.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Yaaaaay! I got a real compliment from Rei!  
Looks like everyone managed to find each other OK!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Normally I'd want Rei to come running straight to me...  
But sadly, we're up in the air right now,  
so I'll provide support from above instead!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh—an airship!  
I get it! That's where they've been guiding us from!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Thanks a bunch, Carmina girls~! ♪  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
No trouble at all!  
 Or so I'd love to say, but actually...  
it's Mr. Knight you should be thanking.  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh? Big Bro?  
  
**Chika：**  
We're incredibly grateful to {player}...  
And of course to the skilled mages  
who are working hard to keep us in touch.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Maintaining a channel while flying is tougher than I thought...  
But I can do this. I can do this. I'm a genius, aren't I?!  
Besides, I've got debts I need to repay!  
  
**Yui：**  
I see... That girl must have spotted us from all the way up there!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's right!  
And it's not just Karyl—the members of Diabolos  
have been flying around above the city to help as well!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I'm so glad everyone's OK!  
`Tag 6`  
**Shizuru：**  
I see...! So that Omniscient Kaiser split us up,  
but Li'l Bro brought us together again! ♪  
What a good boy! Let your big sis pat your head! ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh. ♪  
I don't really get it, but I'll give you a headpat too, Big Bro! ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So everyone assembled here, and those up above...  
All of them are friends of my lord....  
Honestly... Honestly, my lord, you really are so...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...No. This is no time to be shocked by such things.  
Excuse me, everyone.  
Would you be so kind as to listen to my lord for a moment?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I need you all to lend me your strength.  
`Tag 7`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Some among us may have found themselves in conflict in the past,  
but I beg you all to cast your differences aside  
and join forces with us at this crucial juncture.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  We have to stop the Kaiser's schemes.  
**Choice: (9)**  Help me out, guys!  
`Tag 8`  
`Tag 9`  
**Makoto：**  
Well... we can do that, sure.  
Last time, it was the Labyrinth guys  
who fired the first shots, right?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hmmm... That time, it was our only option  
to ensure little Novem's safety, as I remember it.  
So today, we don't plan on starting any fights.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
As for us, we've got no objections!  
Let's all work together!  
You scratch our backs and we'll scratch yours,  
 OK?  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Thanks, everyone.  
`Tag 10`  
**Yui：**  
No, I should thank you, Mr. Knight!  
Things may look bad right now...  
But I'm so happy that we can all join hands like this!  
  
**Rei：**  
Kokkoro... And you too, {player}.  
It seems you have a grasp of the situation.  
Tell us—what do you need us to do?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank you all kindly.  
Well then, first of all, can you focus on the Shadows?  
  
**Rei：**  
The Shadows?  
I suppose the city *is* flooded with Shadows  
as well as monsters right now...  
  
**Kaori：**  
But unlike the monsters,  
most of them are harmless, or running away on their own!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yes... Wouldn't it be a better idea if we joined forces to face their boss?  
Teamed up to take down that Omniscient Kaiser?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I understand your doubts.  
 However, as things stand,  
many of the monsters around us, and almost all of the Shadows,  
are acting as terminals to provide the Kaiser with vital information.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
While they remain, it seems that the Kaiser can predict  
and evade any attack.  
 This information reached us  
from Miss Neneka, the Metamorph Monarch, moments ago.  
  
**Makoto：**  
So, what? We've gotta dull her senses by taking out the small fry?  
Kind of a pain... But I guess in the end,  
we'd need to beat up the monsters and Shadows either way.  
  
**Rino：**  
Ah, of course!  
You're fairly prepared if you prepare a pail,  
 as they say!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
\"Failing to prepare is preparing to fail,\" you mean, Rino.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, but hang on!  
Is it even possible to take out all the Shadows?  
I mean, Landosol's a really big place!  
  
**Rei：**  
A good point... I wouldn't call it impossible,  
but it will certainly take time.  
And I doubt the Kaiser will just sit back and allow it...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Right now, Christina and her allies are keeping the Kaiser busy.  
Even the Kaiser won't be able to take care of her so easily.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Christina... Ugh, not her.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Well, she's not very nice...  
but I can't deny she makes a strong ally!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Finally... My lord has been granted not one  
but two weapons by Miss Labyrista.  
One is a sword to oppose the Seven Crowns.  
 And the other...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The other is the ability to power us up  
more effectively than ever before!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We will spread out within the area of effect  
and move in tandem with my lord to eliminate the enemy.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We'll need Karyl and the members of Carmina to guide us,  
and it'll be a bit of a mad-rush offensive...  
but let's trust in him and work together!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Now, my lord.  
It is time to lend your strength to all present!  
  
**Choice: (11)**  Let's do this, guys!  
`Tag 11`  
**All：**  
Yeah!
