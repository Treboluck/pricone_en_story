# Saren Episode 2
Saren is waylaid by bug monsters while transporting goods, and it turns out the reason they're swarming is a medicine {player} sprayed to lure insects. Saren suggests they team up to make short work of the bugs, and reminisces about a boy she used to go bug-catching with.

Then a bouncy little turn...  
And then right as you face each other, STRIKE!  
  
**Saren：**  
*sigh*  
Really, now! Could this place get any worse?  
  
**Saren：**  
Since I came here, I've been attacked by nothing but bug-type monsters.  
They aren't especially tough to beat,  
but there are just so many of them! It's such a pain!  
  
**Saren：**  
I beat them back, strike them down, and still, they keep coming in droves.  
I wish I could just cut through and ignore them, but monsters are  
monsters, no matter how small. I could get hurt if I don't stay sharp.  
  
**Saren：**  
What's worse is that since I'm transporting valuable goods,  
I can't attack recklessly...  
  
**Saren：**  
Plus, each time a monster shows up,  
I have to manually stop each of the wagons one-by-one.  
  
**Saren：**  
And worst of all, now the sun is setting.  
The really vicious monsters come out once it's dark,  
so I ought to hurry.  
  
**Saren：**  
I hate this, standing around in this eerie place.  
Maybe I should've splurged and hired an escort.  
  
**Saren：**  
Though... It's true we don't make enough profit to afford a guard.  
And I wouldn't want to put Suzume or the children through such dangerous work.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oof!  
For crying out loud! More bugs?!  
Heeere I come, hyah!  
  
**Saren：**  
They never stop coming... Wish I'd brought some bug spray.  
How come only bugs are attacking, anyway?  
Is it something in one of the wagons?  
  
**Saren：**  
Perhaps some of the goods are giving off a sweet smell that entices  
bugs?  
 Maybe I should have covered everything with cloth,  
so the smell wouldn't leak out.  
  
**Saren：**  
Right. I'll have to keep that in mind for next time.  
As for right now, I need to get out of this forest.  
The monsters can't trail me all the way back to town, right?  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm?  
Wait! That bush just moved!  
  
**Saren：**  
A bug...? No, couldn't be. Is a big animal hiding in there?  
It'd be very awkward if I attacked and it turned out to be a  
regular traveler. I'd better call out to them.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hello! Is anyone there?  
Answer me, or I'll have to assume you're a beast and attack!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Answer correctly.  
**Choice: (2)**  Give a monstrous bellow.  
`Tag 1`  
**Saren：**  
Hm, that sounded like a human.  
Phew!  
I'm glad I took the time to check.  
  
**Saren：**  
Sorry about that.  
I promise I won't attack, so could you come out of the bushes, please?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Saren：**  
Eek!  
So it WAS a monster?!  
  
**Saren：**  
No, you're human...  
 Aren't you?!  
Geez! Do you mind? Don't scare me on purpose!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Saren：**  
Wait. Aren't you...?  
You are!  
{player}, right?  
  
**Saren：**  
Don't frighten me like that, please!  
What are you even doing in this forest?  
I can't imagine  
you were having a nice stroll with this many monsters around.  
  
**Saren：**  
Ah. You're here doing a job to earn some spending money...  
You're hunting lots of a specific type of bug, so you can gather  
a liquid they possess to make cosmetics?  
  
**Saren：**  
You followed your employer's advice to do the job,  
and sprinkled a special tincture everywhere...  
Causing lots of those insects to swarm here?  
  
**Saren：**  
Hmmm.  
Then the reason why so many bugs are gathering here  
is you, isn't it?  
  
**Saren：**  
Well, you've caused me quite a headache.  
It's fine, though.  
It was just my rotten luck that I came through here  
while it was in this state.  
  
**Saren：**  
It's not becoming of a lady to blame others.  
No, really. This mess may be an opportunity in disguise.  
  
**Saren：**  
Listen, {player}...  
Why don't I help you out with your errand?  
You can pull these wagons for me in return.  
  
**Saren：**  
You take care of pulling my wagons, and I'll cut down any bugs  
that come near.  
 Then we can pack the dead bugs into bags.  
We can carry lots if we load them onto the wagons.  
  
**Saren：**  
That way we can do both our tasks at once.  
How does that sound?  
We both profit, right?  
  
**Saren：**  
You look kind of clumsy.  
It looks like you haven't caught a single bug yet.  
You'll never finish your errand at this rate.  
  
**Saren：**  
And that won't do at all.  
 Since you picked up my documents  
the other day, I'll lend you a hand here.  
Don't worry about it. Let's help each other out!  
  
**Saren：**  
Okay?  
Great! Let's talk logistics.  
  
**Saren：**  
I already killed a bunch of bugs on my way along this road.  
If they'll be useful to you, go ahead and pick up their bodies.  
  
**Saren：**  
While you're doing that,  
I'll take out any bugs that come close.  
  
**Saren：**  
With an un, deux, trois! ♪  
  
**Saren：**  
Ahahah. Way, way back, I remember...  
I went out bug hunting with a boy I knew, just like this.  
He was as bungling as you are. He couldn't catch a single bug.  
  
**Saren：**  
But, you know?  
I could really count on him where it mattered.  
I was kind of fond of him.  
  
**Saren：**  
Such lovely memories...  
I wonder where that boy is now? And what he's doing?
