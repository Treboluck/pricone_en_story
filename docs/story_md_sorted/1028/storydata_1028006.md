# Saren Episode 6
Saren is feeling gloomy due to her local bakery closing down, since she can no longer enjoy a tasty yakisoba bun. Instead, she orders some yakisoba crepes from {player}, who is tending a crepe stand. While waiting for her order, she tells him about her impoverished childhood and her memories of a certain boy.

**Saren：**  
W-wait.  
I thought the bakery was over on that street.  
  
**Saren：**  
The whole building's... gone.  
Did the bakery go bankrupt?  
  
**Saren：**  
This can't be happening.  
I was so excited about eating a yakisoba bun on my way home!  
Ugh, this stinks.  
  
**Saren：**  
Landosol has been going through a rough patch,  
but I didn't know the economy was in such poor shape.  
The royal family needs to wake up and get the government in order!  
  
**Saren：**  
There's nothing I could've done, I suppose...  
That bakery was a small, privately-owned business.  
  
**Saren：**  
It was tucked out of the way,  
so you'd never find it unless you knew where to look.  
  
**Saren：**  
They could've tried harder to advertise...  
They're located barely a stone's throw away from the shopping district, too.  
  
**Saren：**  
They put so much care into the goods they sold for the locals.  
It's hard to compete with a shopping district, though...  
  
**Saren：**  
Still, I feel like I could have kept them in the black  
if they'd let me handle their affairs...  
Ah, who am I kidding? That'd be far too pushy of me.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm just a kid with barely any skills or achievements under my belt.  
The Sarendia Orphanage isn't exactly thriving right now, either.  
I'm in no position to go meddling in other people's business.  
  
**Saren：**  
It's so sad, though, that something that stood here yesterday  
could vanish without a trace.  
There's something chilling about it.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm?  
Oh, it's {player}!  
You're popping up everywhere nowadays. What brings you here?  
  
**Saren：**  
I see. A random person asked you to tend their food stall,  
and you're doing it. Is it out of interest, boredom,  
or the kindness of your heart?  
  
**Saren：**  
Make sure whoever owns this cart pays you for your hard work, got it?  
Otherwise you're being taken advantage of.  
Mind if I haggle a little?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Go ahead, order something.  
**Choice: (2)**  What's wrong? You seem down.  
`Tag 1`  
**Saren：**  
Hm.  
I am feeling a bit hungry.  
All right, I'll order something.  
What are you selling?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Saren：**  
Ahahah. You'd never think it from looking at you,  
but you're quite perceptive, {player}.  
I guess I do feel down. More than even I realized.  
  
**Saren：**  
Don't worry.  
It's not like anyone died, or the world is on the brink of destruction...  
  
**Saren：**  
I just feel a bit downcast.  
I'll have forgotten all about it by tomorrow, I'm sure.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Saren：**  
I see. You're running a crepe stall.  
I'm more in the mood for yakisoba buns,  
something savory like that...  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh?  
You have the ingredients? You can make some yakisoba?  
  
**Saren：**  
All right, maybe I'll have you do that.  
If you tucked the noodles into a crepe,  
it would pass as a yakisoba bun substitute.  
  
**Saren：**  
Do you not know what those are?  
Yakisoba buns?  
You could call them comfort food.  
  
**Saren：**  
They're quite popular, even though  
they're just carbs on top of more carbs.  
I like them. Maybe a liiittle bit too much, even.  
  
**Saren：**  
Surprised?  
Do you not think they fit my glamorous image?  
  
**Saren：**  
A long, long time ago, my family was very poor.  
It was terribly hard to scrape by.  
  
**Saren：**  
I would mix a drop of yakisoba sauce into hot water and drink it down,  
all so I could keep the hunger away.  
  
**Saren：**  
You've noticed my ears are pointed, right?  
I'm an elf. Typically, elvenfolk live in the forest.  
They aren't too common in Landosol.  
  
**Saren：**  
I was often mocked, derided, and bullied by the other children.  
  
**Saren：**  
Every month, there would come one day when I could buy  
something I liked from the bakery.  
I pondered and pondered,  
and eventually picked a chocolate cornet.  
  
**Saren：**  
Then,  
before I could take a single bite,  
a bully snatched it away.  
  
**Saren：**  
I turned to try and grab it back,  
and the cornet fell onto the dirty road.  
Right as I burst into tears, a boy appeared... one I didn't recognize.

**Saren：**  
He bought a yakisoba bun,  
then offered to trade it for the chocolate cornet that fell in the road.  
  
**Saren：**  
He said he really wanted a chocolate cornet,  
but they were all sold out.  
  
**Saren：**  
Then he wolfed down the dirty chocolate cornet like it was the tastiest  
thing in the world.  
\"Thank you,\" he said, \"I owe you one.\"  
He thanked me for that dirty cornet! What an unusual boy.  
  
**Saren：**  
That day was when  
I fell in love.  
  
**Saren：**  
I fell in love with yakisoba buns.

**Saren：**  
Oh no! The noodles are burning, careful!  
Have you never cooked before?!  
Watch what you're doing!  
  
**Saren：**  
Here, shall I take over cooking duty?  
I'd rather this be as tasty as possible.  
  
**Saren：**  
No need to force anything like filthy chocolate cornets,  
or burned yakisoba into our mouths if we can avoid it.  
Let me take care of it!  
  
**Saren：**  
Thanks, {player}.  
I already feel so much better!
