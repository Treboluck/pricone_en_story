# Ninpo and the Sword
While Ruka is fighting a monster, Ninon intervenes with her ninjutsu, but it has no effect. Just when Ninon believes she is about to lose, Ruka defeats the enemy. Ninon then gets upset because she feels useless, but Ruka praises her for creating an opening with her ninja skill.
  
## Subtitle: Ninpo and the Sword
  
**Narration：**  
As the party advances through the tower,  
a formidable monster blocks their path.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Haaah!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Whew... This monster's pretty solid.  
If I'm too reckless with my attacks, my sword will become useless.  
Well, I need a new plan...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Nin-nin! Boss Lady, leave this to me!  
  
**Ruka：**  
H-hey! It's dangerous to jump out in front!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Shwababababa!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Wha—... She's weaving hand signs with such immense speed...  
Don't tell me she can actually use ninjutsu.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Take this! Ninpo: Citrus Splash no Jutsu!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That smells lovely.  
`Tag 1`  
**Ruka：**  
Oh, it smells like...  
oranges?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Heheheh, correct!  
  
Orange Juice Shower OF DEATH!  
It's an eye-closing technique!  
Now, while it's off-guard─  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Ninon：**  
What?! It had no effect at all!  
In fact, it made it angrier!  
  
**Ninon：**  
W-well, discretion is the better part of valor!  
Shogun, Boss Lady! We should make a hasty retreat!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Nooo! It's flanking us!  
Nowhere to go! It has us surrounded!  
  
**Ninon：**  
...I-I'll take it down from the rear while you two make your escape!  
  
**Ruka：**  
...Ninon, this is thanks to you!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Huh? B-Boss Lady!  
  
It's too dangerous!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Haaa!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Amazing! You dispatched the monster in one swing...!  
But earlier, you could not cut through it at all! What changed...?  
  
**Ruka：**  
When you made the monster angry, a small gap opened in its stiff body.  
All I did was slash it there.  
  
**Ninon：**  
M-miraculous!  
...But my technique was no use at all...  
I'm truly ashamed...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  We won because of you, Ninon.  
`Tag 2`  
**Ruka：**  
What he said. Your ninjutsu created a weakness.  
You were far from useless, so give yourself some credit.  
  
**Ninon：**  
R-really?  
I did it! Surprise victory!  
Let's raise a toast and have a victory parade!
