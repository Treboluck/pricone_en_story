## Subtitle: Too Much Togoku Talk
  
**Narration：**  
The group continues to search the tower but still fails to  
find any clues to {player}'s lost memories.  
  
**Ruka：**  
*sigh*...  
I knew they wouldn't be easy to find, but these clues sure are elusive.  
  
We should take a short break  
since we're starting to get a little tired.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm starving.  
`Tag 1`  
**Ruka：**  
Me too.  
That said, we don't have any food on us...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Leave it to me!  
You can't fight on an empty stomach!  
I have already prepared our provisions!  
Please help yourself.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Rice balls wrapped in bamboo sheaths,  
and bamboo canteens, huh?  
  
**Ninon：**  
There's plum, salmon, and bonito!  
And after you're done, I also have steamed buns!  
Please eat until your bellies are full!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hahah, you really love Togoku, don't you?  
  
**Ninon：**  
I do!  
From \"ohayou\" to \"oyasumi,\" I'm thinking about Togoku  
twenty-four seven!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Speaking of which, looking at your kimono, katana, and  
swordsmanship...  
I take it you were born in Togoku?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Well, I wonder.  
I've been all over the place, so I don't really remember.  
  
**Ninon：**  
A mysterious wandering swordswoman! How admirable!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ahhh, how I wish I could visit Togoku one day.  
I must see Mt. Fuji with my own two eyes!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Fuji is the most sacred mountain in Togoku!  
It's depicted in lots of woodblock prints!  
  
**Ninon：**  
I've only ever seen it in woodblock prints.  
But it's my dream to stand at its summit with Shogun  
and look  
down upon the peaceful world once we've conquered the lands!  
  
**Ruka：**  
O-ohhh... Is that so...?  
  
**Ninon：**  
And you cannot miss out on Togoku's food culture!  
Whatever the dish, their rice cuisine is delicious!  
  
**Ninon：**  
And the king of Togoku meals, sushi, is extraordinary!  
The craftmanship shines through so much so that it's edible art!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Furthermore, along with sushi, the repast most representative of Togoku  
cuisine is  
soba noodles!  
A taste of the common people that's easy on the  
wallet!  
  
**Ninon：**  
The best part  
is slurping it up without using manners!  
But once I did that with pasta and Monica got so mad...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Boss Lady, what kind of Togoku food do you like?  
  
**Ruka：**  
U-uhhh...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh, this feeling... I know it well.  
When she talks about the things she likes, her mouth goes  
into overdrive.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Although her interests are different, she's quite a lot like our Nanaka...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Boss Lady... Boss Lady?  
Is there anyone home?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Huh? Oh, sorry, I zoned out.  
So, what were you saying?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Right!  
I was talking about how you, me, and Shogun will tour Togoku  
together, defeating evil  
in every corner of the country,  
in an effort to  
reform the world!  
  
**Ruka：**  
C-cut that out, will you?!  
Don't go dragging me along on your bizarre quest, all right?!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Whaaat?! But we have just the right number of people!  
Oh!  
Although in that case, because I'm a female ninja,  
I'll be completely exposed every time there's a bathing scene!  
  
**Ruka：**  
What on earth is going on inside your head? Good grief...  
  
**Narration：**  
Since Ninon continued her incessant Togoku talk,  
the party found it difficult to progress through the tower.
