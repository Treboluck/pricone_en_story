# Fresh Finobi Fellowship
Believing Ruka is a Samurai Master, Ninon requests to become her apprentice but is instead coaxed into selling fish at Ruka's shop. Despite her messy customer service, Ninon does a good job, and because her efforts are acknowledged by Ruka, she declares that she will become a great fishmonger in the heat of the moment.
  
## Subtitle: Fresh Finobi Fellowship
  
**Narration：**  
Ruka and Ninon have strengthened their bond,  
and are already showing impressive coordination.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Rip and tear!  
Ninpo: Leaf Hurricane no Jutsu!  
  

---  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Ruka：**  
All you did was throw some leaves in its face, but it's a decent  
distraction!  
I'll end this quick! Hah!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Bravo!  
How enchanting!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Your ninpo was pretty great, too.  
Now then, it seems like that was the master of this floor.  
I wish we could find some clues already. Even just one would do.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Look at that, Shogun, Boss Lady!  
Something fell out of the dead monster!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Wow! What a beautiful stone.  
A treasure, no doubt!  
  
**Ruka：**  
H-hey,  
think before you touch strange objects!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ahhh! I-it's too bright!  
Don't look at it, no matter what happens!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Ugh. {player}! Ninon!  
  

---  
  
**Ruka：**  
All right, done!  
Can you put this on display too?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're pretty good with a knife.  
`Tag 1`  
**Ruka：**  
Flattery will get you nothing more than a fish head.  
You sure are a strange one.  
You finally have the day off,  
but here you are in the store helping me out.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I would walk five hundred miles for you.  
`Tag 2`  
**Ruka：**  
Hey, not you too!  
I don't need followers at a fishmonger's shop, got it?  
  
**Ruka：**  
...And that girl over there, the blonde one who's been spying on us,  
she wouldn't happen to be a friend of yours, would she?  
  
**Ruka：**  
I guess she's trying to hide behind that telephone pole,  
but she sticks out like a sore thumb...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  She's just a harmless weeb.  
**Choice: (4)**  She's a samurai-ninja who aims to conquer the lands.  
`Tag 3`  
**Ruka：**  
R-really?  
  
Despite that, she's giving off an unusually intense aura of tenacity...  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Ruka：**  
Calm yourself. You're not making any sense.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Ruka：**  
Anyway, if nothing else, I know now that she's a friend of yours.  
  
**Ruka：**  
I don't want to have anything to do with her,  
but it'd be troublesome if she did something weird by the shop.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hey, you over there, blondie! Do you need something?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Wh-what?! I can't believe you saw through my Camouflage no Jutsu!  
C-could it be the fabled Mind's Eye?!  
  
**Ninon：**  
I knew it!  
Someone who can earn the respect of Shogun is no ordinary person!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Ugh, this might end up being more trouble that it's worth.  
Just get over here already, would you?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Th-then here I come.  
De-de-den!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  You need something from me?  
`Tag 6`  
**Ninon：**  
No, on this day I request an audience  
with this esteemed gentlewoman,  
Lady Ruka Tachiarai!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Huh? How do you know my name?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Well, Shogun told me, of course!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hey, you, have you ever heard of \"personal information\"?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  My bad...  
`Tag 7`  
**Ruka：**  
Too late to fix now. Sheesh.  
Anyway, young lady, why are you here?  
If you've come to buy fish, I'll be happy to sell you some.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Lady Ruka—no, Samurai Master!  
I beg you, make me, Ninon, your disciple!  
  
**Ruka：**  
...What's she blabbering on about? Crazy girl.  
I'm just a fishmonger, not a samurai or anything of the sort.  
  
**Ninon：**  
No! Because my beloved Shogun admires you, Boss Lady,  
you're undoubtedly the most famous Samurai Master in the world!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Just where on earth did you get such a mind-bending delusion?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Oh! I heard it from Shogun!  
You help the weak, crush the aggressive, and have numerous retainers!  
You're definitely a modern samurai!  
  
**Ruka：**  
...Hey, you. I'd like to have a word later.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Um, Ninon, was it?  
Sorry to burst your bubble, but I'm afraid I don't  
know how to use a sword.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Please, no jokes!  
  
Shogun informed me that the sword you are currently wielding  
is the famous \"Marine Slayer\" that can cut through anything!  
  
**Ruka：**  
I see...  
  
Hey, you. I think we need to have a *serious* talk.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  I'm so sorry.  
`Tag 8`  
**Ninon：**  
I beg this favor! I'll get down on my knees! I'll do a traditional dance!  
It might be a little embarrassing, but I'll even do it all in nothing but an  
apron!  
Pleeease make me your disciple!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Whoa, this isn't that kind of store!  
Hey, can't you say something to shut her up?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Training's gonna be tough.  
`Tag 9`  
**Ruka：**  
Why, you little...! Argh, come on! I guess I have no choice, huh?  
  
**Ninon：**  
So you'll take me under your wing?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Before we get to that, I need to make sure you're fit for the job.  
Let's see how well you fare attracting customers to buy our produce.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Wh-whaaaat?!  
  
**Ninon：**  
*sigh* I came here to learn the way of the sword,  
so how did I end up working at a fish market...?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Samurai don't just go around showing off their sword skills to anyone  
who asks.  
Besides, don't you know that all samurai have a trade?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Y-you're right! I make paper umbrellas!  
Understood! I'll complete this mission with flying colors!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  That's Samurai Master for you.  
`Tag 10`  
**Ruka：**  
Right, Shogun?  
Now then, let's see what this pushy apprentice is made of.

**Ninon：**  
Hey! Step right up, step right up!  
Fishy, fishy, come get your fish!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Fast, cheap, tasty fishy fish!  
Boil them, grill them, any way you like!  
They're selling like hot fish cakes!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hello, madam! How about some fish for dinner tonight?  
Your children's school grades will improve, no doubt!  
Eating our fish will make you smarter!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Rich in omega-whatever, they will get full marks every time!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hmm? Recommendations? Let me see...  
  
How about this one?  
It's a lustrous vision of beauty!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Its name? I have no idea!  
More importantly, it's what's on the inside that counts—the heart!  
I ninja swear it's delicious!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Wow! Thank you for your custom!  
Here's an extra fish, on the house!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ah! Hello, sir! We have fish here!  
How about one to accompany your evening drink?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Thanking you very much!  
Me? Cute?  
Oh, stop it, sir! ♪  
Take some fermented sauce, you naughty love bandit!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hey, hey! Lovely lady! Eat some fish!  
Tapioca?  
No, no! We have something better!  
Salmon roe is what you want!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Sweet little boy, helping with errands!  
Here, fish so cheap, we're hemorrhaging money!

`image display end`  
**Choice: (11)**  She's quite... haphazard.  
`Tag 11`  
**Ruka：**  
Yeah, she's all over the place.  
But the fish are flying off the shelves.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Shogun! Boss Lady!  
There are too many customers! I'm going into shock!  
Medic! I need a medic!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh, she's calling for backup, Shogun.  
Maybe we should go provide support.  
  
**Ninon：**  
In, out...  
Mission complete!  
I have no will to go on...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Nicely done.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Boss Lady! H-how did I do? How was my work?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Let's see... Your lack of product knowledge can't be helped,  
but the random prices and unnecessary freebies are a definite no-no.  
  
**Ruka：**  
If I have to give you a score, I'd say...  
thirty-three points.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Thirty-three?! Your scoring system is harsh...  
Shogun, I'm sorry for being a useless retainer.  
My life is nothing but shame...  
  
**Ruka：**  
That said, all the customers left with a smile on their face.  
Everyone had a good shopping experience.  
That is the ultimate victory.  
  
**Ruka：**  
You were a top-tier fishmonger, Ninon.  
  
**Ninon：**  
B-Boss Lady!  
  
**Ruka：**  
I know you're a good kid,  
but you've still got a lot to learn.  
Therefore, I want you to start with this.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Th-this is... a samurai sword!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Uh, no, it's a kitchen knife. You better take good care of it.  
I used to use it a long time ago, you see.  
  
**Ninon：**  
B-but it's such a precious object...  
  
**Ruka：**  
I'm giving it to you because I believe you're worth passing it on to.  
So first, learn to handle it properly.  
Then we'll talk.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Th-thank you greatly!  
With this... I'll be the very best fishmonger, like no one ever was!  
  
**Ninon：**  
...  
What's that?  
  

---  
  
**Ninon：**  
...Hah!  
Uh... We're back in the tower...  
Was I dreaming just now?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Urgh... To fall asleep in the presence of one's master is the greatest of  
transgressions!  
Since it has come to this, I must commit seppuku...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hold it. If you disembowel  
yourself, then I'll have to as well.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Boss Lady... Did you perchance have a dream too?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Yeah. I dreamed that you were working at my shop.  
In fact, you were—heheh, hahahah...  
  
**Ninon：**  
I-is something the matter?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Nah, it's just that even in the dream, you were acting the same as usual.  
It was strange, but pretty funny. Heheh, hahahahah!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Oh, no...  
how embarrassing.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Now then, what's the plan?  
Are we continuing the search?  
  
**Choice: (12)**  I'm in the mood for fish.  
`Tag 12`  
**Ninon：**  
Ohhh! Shogun too?  
I'm totally craving sushi right now!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Good grief, does your appetite come before your memory?  
Well, I'm hungry too.I could eat a whale, if I'm honest.  
  
**Ruka：**  
I guess that's enough exploration for one day.  
Let's try again another time.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Shogun, Boss Lady, thank you very much for today!  
I will be much, much more diligent  
and become the ultimate retainer!  
  
**Narration：**  
Although they did not achieve their goal,  
all three left the tower with a satisfied look on their faces.
