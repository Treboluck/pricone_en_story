## Subtitle: Bonded by the Sword
  
**Narration：**  
As they are defeating numerous monsters trying to reach the top of the  
tower, they encounter a new, powerful enemy blocking their path.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hah,  
they just keep coming. I'll never be bored at this rate.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Boss Lady! Please let me take care of this!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Wait, that one's a bit tricky.  
It's a bad idea to provoke it with ninjutsu.  
  
**Ninon：**  
No, I won't use ninjutsu this time.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hey, that stance...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Yes!  
I've been learning your sword fighting style by observing you  
all this time.  
I shall smite this evil on your behalf!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hah! Ninon see, Ninon do.  
First Strike: Reticence!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Heh, have no fear, I used the back of my blade!  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ah! It had no effect!  
W-wahhh!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Oh, huh...?  
I-I'm still alive?  
  
**Ruka：**  
That was a splendid display, Ninon.  
Learning the technique so perfectly simply from observation  
  
sure is something.  
  
**Ninon：**  
B-Boss Lady...!  
  
**Ruka：**  
But I'm sorry to say, imitating my form alone won't allow you to slice  
through enemies.  
You see, a war fan isn't a cutting tool to begin with.  
  
Hyah!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Well, well, aren't you the tenacious one?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Boss Lady! Be careful!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Pay attention, Ninon. This is my ultimate technique.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Origin Strike: Severing Moon!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Th-that was... amazing...  
  
**Ruka：**  
*sigh* Good grief,  
you shouldn't be so reckless.  
If you were less lucky, you might've caught a bad case of death.  
  
**Ninon：**  
R-right... I'm really very sorry...  
It's just, I wanted to be like you.  
  
**Ninon：**  
I'm supposed to be protecting Shogun, but I always end up being saved  
instead. I'm so ashamed of myself...  
  
**Ruka：**  
...  
  
**Ninon：**  
I wish to become Shogun's best retainer and have him rely on me the  
way he relies on you.  
  
**Ninon：**  
That's why I tried really hard to study the sword by observing you,  
but it's no use... I've failed as a retainer.  
  
**Ruka：**  
I see.  
Now I understand how you feel.  
But I can't let you loose on the world with such half-baked  
swordsmanship.  
  
**Ruka：**  
If you get hurt imitating my style, it'll weigh heavily on my conscience.  
So I'm going to take you back to basics.  
  
**Ninon：**  
...Oh?  
  
**Ruka：**  
So, promise me.  
From now on, you won't recklessly imitate my fighting style like that.  
  
Got it?  
  
**Ninon：**  
B-Boss Laaaady!  
I'm an ignoramus,  
but I won't let you down!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Good grief, I never thought I'd end up teaching someone.  
But, well, I don't feel bad about it.
