**???：**  
Then the knight pins the helpless fairy down...  
Eheh... gueheheh... Until finally...  
His roving hands reach out towards me and... *drool*  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Um, excuse me?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kuka：**  
Ahh... H-hello! D-do you have  
some sort of business with me?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
C-c-c-could it be, you want to tie me up  
and do all kinds of unprintable things...?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
...A-at this rate, I will surely be captured  
and brainwashed into a willing slave...!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ahhh, but that sounds...  
so thrilling and naughty...  
 I almost can't wait!  
*drool*  
  
**Kuka：**  
...Eh? That's not it?  
...Wh-why not?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
If you're not going to enslave me...  
Wh-wh-wh-what could you possibly want?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
...You were just looking for someone  
to join your party for a monster-extermination quest?  
  
**Kuka：**  
P-party members...  
 Ahhh! C-could this be...?  
One of those \"pickup lines\" I've heard all about...?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
You say it's about monsters...  
But really that's just a clever excuse...!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Y-yes?! What is it this time?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Huh? Y-you thought I seemed  
nervous...?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Actually, this is the first time I've ever...  
gone out on a... monster exterminating quest...  
  
**Kuka：**  
The moment when a girl becomes a woman...  
always comes without warning...!  
  
**Kuka：**  
But I have to say, I'm not sure if I'm quite ready  
for any terribly rough action just yet...  
so if you could try to be gentle to begin with...  
  
**???：**  
Rrrghhh...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Aaahhh!  
 S-suddenly breathing down my neck  
with a beastly growl of passion...?! I should have  
expected no less...!  
 B-but... out here in the open...?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I didn't do anything.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kuka：**  
H-huh...?  
B-but then, what was that just...  
  
**Monster：**  
RRRAAAAARRRGHHHH!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Waaaaaghhhhh!  
A monsteeeeeer!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-I knew it! This was your plan  
from the very beginning...!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Watching from a safe vantage point as my body  
is assaulted from every angle...!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Only when I've run out of energy to resist  
will you drag me into a dark corner to heal me...!  
\"I'll turn your pain into pleasure, girl...\"  
 Aaahhh!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Waaaghhhh! Y-you sadist!  
Sick-minded degenerate...!

**Monster：**  
GGGRRAAAAGHHHH!  
  
**Kuka：**  
...A-and yet... This heat that races through my body...!  
C-could it be... love?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
A-am I about to submit my body and soul  
to a man I just met this morning?!  
I-I never knew I was such a floozy!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  No, your armor's on fire!  
`Tag 3`  
**Kuka：**  
W-waaaaaghhh?!

**Kuka：**  
I-I can see it now... You'll make me promise  
to meet you later in town... and when I show up...  
  
**Kuka：**  
\"I'll teach your body a lesson it will never forget.\"  
Oh, what horrors are in store...?!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  See you around, then.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kuka：**  
...Whaaa?! Y-you're just going to leave...?!  
S-s-s-something's not right,  
this isn't how I thought it would go...  
  
**Kuka：**  
...U... ummm... If you're just going to leave,  
wh-why did you ask me  
to come out here in the first place...?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  To help defeat the monster.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kuka：**  
B-but...! That monster extermination stuff...  
was all just an excuse... Y-y-you can't really mean...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  That's really the only reason.  
`Tag 6`  
**Kuka：**  
E-eeeehhhhhh?!  
You weren't hitting on me?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
A-aaaahhh... H-how could I make such an embarrassing...  
S-so you... Y-you were just toying with me...!  
You really are... a sick-minded sadist...!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-I-I-I'm going home!  
Aaaahhhh...!  
I'll never trust another adventurer again!  
  
**Narration：**  
Yet somehow it seemed like Kuka  
was enjoying herself more than ever...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Eheh... Gueheheh... *drool*
