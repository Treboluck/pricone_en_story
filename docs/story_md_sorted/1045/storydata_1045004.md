**Narration：**  
While wandering around town,  
{player} bumps into Kuka.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ah... Mr. Sadist...  
S-so this is where you've been waiting to ambush me...  
And now, you'll drag me into the shadows to... Gueheh...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Huh? What was I doing?  
I was just on my way to the cafe...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Y-you'll come along with me?!  
The two of us, in the cafe together?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
No, I don't mind at all...!  
Of course I don't mind!  
But... Ummm... The thing is...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Wahhh! That's so bright...  
Where is all this light coming from?!  
And my body feels warm and fuzzy...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Aaaaaahhhhh!

**Kuka：**  
Eheh... Gueheheh...  
Her soft and delicate form, coated with luscious cream,  
and topped with a great red succulent orb... *drool*

**Kuka：**  
W-waaahh?! Mr. Sadist?!  
H-h-h-how long have you been standing there?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
D-don't tell me you came to this cafe popular with women  
to find yourself another new slave?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
...You just came in for a snack?  
I-I see...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Whaaa?! You want to sit down here?!  
Y-y-y-you don't mean, like, sharing a table?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
N-not at all! Of course I don't mind...!  
Go ahead... Please, take a seat...  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-I've never shared a table with a boy before,  
never in my whole life...  
Th-this makes me so nervous!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-I have to get a grip on myself...  
Mr. Sadist, wh-what are you going to order?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll eat some cake.  
**Choice: (3)**  Just a drink will do.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kuka：**  
E-e-eat a \"cake\"?!  
If you eat me all up in a place like this,  
my poor fragile heart will be scarred for life!

`Tag 3`  
**Kuka：**  
A-a drink?!  
 You don't mean... you want to drink my...?!  
Are you crazy?! Such wild fetishism is beyond even...  
Y-your perversion knows no bounds!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Kuka：**  
Eheh... Gueheheh...  
\"I'll show you pleasure sweeter than any dessert...\"  
  
**Kuka：**  
So saying, the young man reaches out with his tongue  
as if to sample her spongy flesh... *drool*  
  
**Mysterious Man：**  
Fantabulous!  
Oh, bravo!  
Simply amazing!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Mysterious Man：**  
I've been watching you for a while now,  
and your natural talent for dreaming up fantasy after fantasy  
is exactly what we've been looking for!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Wh-who exactly might you be...?  
  
**Mysterious Man：**  
Ah, how rude of me.  
Here's my business card.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ummm...  
Tagiru Kannon... Editor...  
Harem Princess House...?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Y-you're from Harem Princess House?!  
The biggest publisher of erotic literature  
in the whole industry?!  
  
**Tagiru：**  
If you don't mind, I'd like to make you a serious offer.  
I want you to become one of our published authors!  
  
**Kuka：**  
O-of course!  
Absolutely!  
  
**Tagiru：**  
Hahaha... That's good to hear.  
When I first found you, I could hardly believe my eyes.  
You were the very picture of the ideal author I'd been seeking.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Th-thank you very much...  
  
**Tagiru：**  
Now, this is the important part.  
A great editor is like his protégée's personal shadow,  
in a marriage of talents intertwined.  
  
**Tagiru：**  
And though I may not look it,  
I am a master editor who has nurtured countless successful authors.  
As such, I have my own strict policy to follow.  
  
**Tagiru：**  
To fully crystallize the author's imagination,  
I personally act as the avatar of their fantasies,  
painting them on the canvas of reality!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Waaaaaahhhh?!  
Wh-wh-wh-why are you taking off your clothes?!  
  
**Tagiru：**  
Come! Let me become your fantasies incarnate!  
Show me the depths of your desire!  
  
**Kuka：**  
A-aaaaaghhh!!!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Pervert begone!  
`Tag 5`  
**Tagiru：**  
Buearghhhh!  
  
**Kuka：**  
M-Mr. Sadist?!  
U-uwauaahh!  
Wh-wh-why are you grabbing my hand?!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Let's run.  
`Tag 6`  
**Kuka：**  
Wawawawahhh!  
Wh-where are you taking me?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
Mr. Sadist... I guess you kind of saved me...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Th-that man certainly was remarkable, but...  
Ah... More to the point... H-how long are you  
going to keep holding my hand...?  
  
**Kuka：**  
A-ahh, no! Of course I don't mind!  
It's just, I, ah...  
I've never held hands with... a boy before...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ahhh... Awawahhh... I-I'm blushing so hard,  
I can't even seem to look you in the eyes properly...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Aaahhh!  
I-I can't see where I'm going! I'm going to take a tumble!  
Wh-wh-wh-where's something to grab onto?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
H-huh...? What's this?  
Such a strange texture...  
Mr. Sadist...? What is this I'm holding onto?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Mr. Sadist! Stop shrieking like a little girl  
and please answer my question...!

**Ameth：**  
Hi there. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just experienced was something like a dream.  
You'll probably forget most of it when you wake up,  
so don't worry about it too much.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I always did think that girl  
had quite the talent for coming up with fantasies,  
but to think she actually had professional potential...  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'd be interested to read some of her work.  
Though ah, somehow I doubt  
they'd be books you'd want to read in public...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Come to think of it, where *did* she grab you at the end there?  
That was quite the scream you let out.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, I never... You've gone red as a tomato!  
I see, I see... Somewhere you'd rather not mention, hmmm?  
  
**Ameth：**  
After being manhandled like that,  
perhaps it will be difficult for the two of you  
to keep your relationship in the realm of fantasy alone, hmm?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ahahah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding!  
Well, I suppose that's enough chitchat for now.  
See you around. Until next time!  
  

---  
  
**Kuka：**  
Whaaa?!  
Wh-where am I...?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Oh dear... Did I manage to nod off...?  
D-don't tell me you slipped me a sleeping pill?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Huh? You were asleep until just now, too?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Somehow I'm feeling oddly hot and bothered...  
It must be that embarrassing dream I just had...  
I was with you in a cafe, and...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Y-yes, that's right!  
You grabbed my hand and saved me from a crazy man!  
Did you have the same dream, then?  
  
**Kuka：**  
N-now you're following me into my dreams,  
where there's no telling what you might do to me?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Even in my dreams,  
there's nowhere I can run from you, huh...? Gueheheh...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Huh? Oh, right...  
We were on our way to the cafe, weren't we?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Um... The truth is...  
I've never actually been to a cafe with a boy before,  
so please be gentle with me...
