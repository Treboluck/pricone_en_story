## Subtitle: Kuka's Ultimate Reward
  
**Kuka：**  
A-a very good morning to you, Mr. Sadist!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That's a bit of a stiff greeting. What's up?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kuka：**  
S-stiff, did you say? Oh my...  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-I'm sure a little stiffness is perfectly natural  
for a healthy young man of your age at this hour of the morning!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Huh? You were talking about my speech?  
Oh, I see... I should listen more carefully...  
  
**Kuka：**  
U-um...  
I've actually never been invited out in the morning  
to meet a boy like this before...  
  
**Kuka：**  
We're just going shopping...? Oh, I think I see now!  
You want me to help you fetch supplies  
for your next monster extermination quest, do you?  
  
**Kuka：**  
But of course, this is Mr. Sadist I'm dealing with,  
so it can't possibly end there...  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-I'm sure... he's just biding his time  
until the perfect moment to bare his fangs...!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ah—wait—! Hold on!  
Don't leave me behiiind!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Excuse me, could I have three potions  
and this bottle of holy water?  
  
**Staff：**  
Comin' right up!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ah...  
 What's this...?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Something caught your eye?  
`Tag 2`  
**Kuka：**  
Oh, no! I just thought this hairpin  
looked kind of pretty, that's all...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Don't worry, it's nothing really!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Time for a little break.  
`Tag 3`  
**Kuka：**  
A-a-a break?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
You don't mean...  
You're going to lead me through an entrance concealed behind  
a dark curtain, into a den  
 of endless debauchery and pleasure...?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Oh? Y-you're not...?  
I see... Well, that's a shame.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I've got a present for you.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kuka：**  
Eh?!  
A-a present?  
  
**Kuka：**  
But I haven't done  
anything at all to deserve a present from you...  
  
**Kuka：**  
...Ahhh! C-could it be...?  
  
**Kuka：**  
\"What greater gift could you ask for than my body?\"  
  
So saying, the virile young man tears aside the cloth  
concealing his chiseled physique, and...!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Huh? Th-that's not it either?  
But then, why do you keep rummaging in your trousers...?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Surely, this has to be  
a sign that you're about to unleash the full force of your energies?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  This is for you.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kuka：**  
This is... It's the hairpin  
I thought was so pretty just now...  
  
**Kuka：**  
When in the world did you buy it?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
To thank me for everything...?  
B-but I haven't done anything  
that would deserve this kind of thanks!  
  
**Kuka：**  
You're the one who's always... um... helping me out  
with all sorts of things...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Huh? Just try putting it on?  
  
**Kuka：**  
A-all right...  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-it really is lovely...  
  
**Kuka：**  
And somehow, it makes my whole body feel tingly and warm...  
  
**Kuka：**  
But, but, it's not like the usual feeling...  
Somehow it makes me feel safe and happy...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Thank you very much...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Actually... This is just like what happened  
in the book I read to prepare for today...  
  
**Kuka：**  
...Which can only mean...  
It won't be long before the two of us  
are entangled in a cornucopia of carnal secrets!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-I'm not...  
I don't know if I'm quite prepared for that just yet, but...  
  
**Kuka：**  
The moment when a girl becomes a woman is always sudden...  
I-I'm ready and willing... Ravish me where I stand!  
  
**Man：**  
Huh? Y-young miss?  
Y-you are talking to me, right?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Huh? Wh-where'd Mr. Sadist go?  
  
**Staff：**  
If you're looking for your friend,  
he went over to pay the cashier.  
  
**Man：**  
L... Listen, uh...  
I've never... been with a pretty thing like you before, but...  
If you're sure...  
  
**Kuka：**  
W... Waaaaghhhhh!
