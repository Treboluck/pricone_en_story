## Subtitle: Garden of Secrets
  
**Narration：**  
{player} spots Kuka looking around in a panic,  
as if searching for something.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Oh, what should I do...?  
  
**Kuka：**  
A-at this rate, my garden of secrets  
will surely be exposed for the world to see!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ahh! M-Mr. Sadist...?!  
What incredibly perfect timing...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ah... B-but... Asking Mr. Sadist to help with this  
would be a double-edged sword...  
  
**Kuka：**  
At first, he'll offer to help out of kindness...  
But then he'll use the diary's contents to blackmail me...!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I'll be forced to submit to his every order for the rest of my life!  
...Ahhh, b-but... that might not be so bad...! *drool*  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What exactly is going on here?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kuka：**  
...Oh! I-I'm sorry.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Th-the thing is...  
I've been searching and searching for ages now...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Th-that's right... I lost my precious diary  
that I write all sorts of things in every day...  
  
**Kuka：**  
I... If I tell you what it looks like, you'll help me search?  
Are you sure?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ah! B-but...  
There's one thing I have to ask you...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ummm... Umm...  
P-please don't even glance at what's inside...!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  All right.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kuka：**  
Th-thank you very much.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Well then, I'll search over this way,  
so if you could try looking over there...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Urghhh... It's nowhere to be found...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Wahhh! A-are you all right, Mr. Sadist?  
You're absolutely covered in dirt!  
Where the heck have you been searching?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Don't worry about it? It's easy to say that...  
But of course I'm going to worry...  
  
I didn't think you'd go to such lengths to find my silly diary...  
  
**Kuka：**  
But, ah... If we've searched for this long  
and it still hasn't shown up,  
I guess there's not much point...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Don't give up.  
`Tag 3`  
**Kuka：**  
Why are you so determined  
to help me find it?  
  
**Kuka：**  
It's not like it's going to cause any trouble for you  
if I never—  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ahh! C-could it be...  
This \"cool and reliable guy\" act  
 is all a ruse  
so you'll be able to seduce me?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
\"Now you can see I'm the only man  
you can trust with your innermost secrets...\"  
  
**Kuka：**  
...Mmmmmm!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Huh? Wh-what was that?  
...You found it?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Just over there...?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Th-that's it!  
There's no doubt that's the diary I've been searching for!  
  
**Kuka：**  
How did it end up all the way up  
on such a high shelf...?  
  
**Kuka：**  
And look, there's a helpful stepladder  
right below it...  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-If I use this, even I  
should be able to reach...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Waaahhhh?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
A-ahhhh... You probably shouldn't  
look up right now, or you might see something very...  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-it's a bit embarrassing to explain,  
so please just try to look straight down at your feet!  
  
**Kuka：**  
A-and yet, a part of me is hoping you'll look up...  
Eheheh...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Wuehhh?! A-aaahhh... I'm losing my balance!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Owieeee...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You okay?  
`Tag 4`  
**Kuka：**  
I-I'm all right...  
  
**Kuka：**  
...Wahhhh?! M-M-M-M-Mr. Sadist,  
you're straddled right on top of me!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Can it be?! This must have been your plan  
from the very beginning...!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Your offer to help me search...  
The diary appearing on that high shelf...  
The convenient stepladder below...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ahhh... I knew it... You set this whole thing up  
just to toy with my fragile emotions...!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ah, such humiliation...  
And yet... It gives me such thrills...! *drool*  
  
**Kuka：**  
\"Don't try to resist. Play along like a good girl,  
and I'll make this nice and quick.\"  
 So saying, the sadist moves in  
to bare the young maiden's flesh...!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Eheh... Gueheheh...  
  
**Kuka：**  
...F-f-fine, have your way with me!  
But I've never done this before,  
so please try to be gentle...  
  
**Bartender：**  
Huh? Y-young miss?  
Are you talking to me?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Wuehh? Eeeehhhhh?!  
  
**Narration：**  
Lost in her fantasies, Kuka failed to even realize  
that {player} had already headed off home.
