**Narration：**  
One day, {player} spots Kuka plodding morosely  
through the streets of Landosol.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Wh... What am I going to do...?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ahh! M-Mr. Sadist! Such a strange coincidence  
to see you in a place like this.  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-I looked kind of down in the dumps?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Huh?! You could tell?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
C-could it be y-you've been hiding  
the secret ability to read people's minds at will...?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
...B-but if you use that power, everyone in the world  
will lie naked and helpless before your gaze!  
Eheh... gueheheh...  
  
**Kuka：**  
...Huh? I seem lively after all, so never mind?  
W-wait a minute!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I really was feeling pretty depressed just now...  
Talking to you just took my mind off it, that's all...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's the matter?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kuka：**  
A-are you saying you'll hear me out  
in exchange for some scandalous favors...?! *drool*  
  
**Kuka：**  
W-wait, where are you going? Mr. Sadist!  
I'll talk! I'll talk, okay?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
...The thing is... R-recently I have been  
sensually gyrating my body in front of a crowd  
in exchange for monetary payment...  
  
**Kuka：**  
To put it more simply...  
I have a job as a dancer  
at the tavern just over there...  
  
**Kuka：**  
But I'm very new to it...  
And to be brutally honest,  
I think I'm a total failure...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Huh? What's so bad about my dancing?  
  
**Kuka：**  
W-well, I don't have enough confidence in my abilities...  
And, um... Having so many people all staring at me  
is kind of embarrassing...  
  
**Kuka：**  
S-so you see, I was trying to improve at least a little,  
by getting in some daytime practice...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll help you out.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kuka：**  
Ehhhh?! Y-you'll do what?!  
Help me get out... of these clothes?  
Y-you really are a sadist... *drool*  
  
**Kuka：**  
I, um... I-I've never done anything like this before...  
But if you really insist...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Huh?  
That's not exactly what you meant?  
  
You just want... to help me practice?  
  
**Kuka：**  
...Ahh... Aaahhh!  
I... I... I... I went and made another  
horribly embarrassing mistake...!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I... I suppose this means I've...  
completely humiliated myself in front of you  
two whole times now...  
  
**Kuka：**  
...M-my dignity as a maiden may never recover...  
  
**Kuka：**  
That's it, I'm ruined for marriage!  
Your cruel tricks have tainted me forever!  
  
**Kuka：**  
...Y...You might as well... finish the job...  
and ruin my body too!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Eheh... Gueheheh... *drool*  
  
**Narration：**  
Somehow {player} felt like  
he was beginning to understand  
why Kuka's dance practice wasn't working out.
