**Ameth：**  
Hello again! How've you been holding up?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Today, I've brought you a little reward  
for all the hard work you've been doing.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm going to show you... a \"dream.\"  
A wonderful dream that I created myself, just for your benefit.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hmm...? Oh, come on, no need to look so worried.  
You can trust me, can't you?  
And the \"other world\" you're about to visit really is a wonderful place!  
  
**Ameth：**  
After all, it's the world you originally called home! ☆  
  
**Ameth：**  
In other words, I'm about to show you an event  
that you experienced yourself, quite some time ago!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, even though it's your home, I suppose that doesn't  
mean much to you without your memories...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Right now, \"that world\" must seem a mysterious place  
full of things you've never seen or heard of.  
But while you're there, none of it should seem strange at all.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You'll be able to accept it all as the natural way of things.  
So relax and try to enjoy it, OK?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, I'll see you around!
