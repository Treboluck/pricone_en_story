**Narration：**  
As the torrent of mysterious black sludge  
flows relentlessly across the city outside...  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} and his allies inside the palace  
are still struggling against the brainwashed Karyl.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Gahhhh! Didn't I tell you to stay back?!  
You all piss me off so much!  
Die, die, die, die! Get out of my sight, you idiots!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm not going anywhere!  
Even if you're right that I'm an idiot...  
No, it's *because* I'm an idiot that I can't let a friend die!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll save you no matter what, Karyl!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Nobody asked for your help!  
Why are you always like this, Pecorine?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
No matter how much I insult you and tell you I hate you,  
you just give that big, dumb smile!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Always hugging me and treating me nice!  
Telling me over and over how much you love me!  
And every time, I felt like I was being torn apart inside!  
  
**Karyl：**  
How could I even taste your food like that?!  
And yet, day after day after day, you invited me back for more!  
It makes no sense!  
 Were you trying to torture me?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Didn't I tell you I'd had enough?! That I couldn't deal with you?!  
So why...  
 why did you all keep at it...?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Aahhh?!  
You've got to calm down, Karyl! Stop attacking!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Fall back, Miss Pecorine! It is too dangerous!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But... I feel like I'm getting through to her more than last time!  
Is the magic wearing off and exposing the real Karyl underneath...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If I keep calling out to her like this, I'm sure...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
*cough*... *cough*...!  
*cough cough*...?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Karyl?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Stay back, please! She coughed up blood just now...  
Miss Karyl is at her limit!  
She must be consuming her own life force to use that magic!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We must try to avoid provoking her any more than necessary!  
If her attacks grow any wilder, her very life will be in jeopardy!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
S-so we don't have time to stand around convincing her?  
What now, then? This is too crazy!  
Ohhhh... Isn't there anything we can do?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Huh? {player}...  
Why are you standing still with your eyes closed?  
D-don't tell me you fell asleep in this situation?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wha...?  
It couldn't be... My lord is not an infant...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Hm? I just sensed a spiritual connection.  
A message from Lady Ameth!  
Is she trying to share some information with us?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hm... Hmm...? Lady Ameth says  
I must bring my sleeping lord as close to Miss Karyl  
 as I can.  
It seems this may solve our current predicament.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wh-what's all this about?  
I don't really get it...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But if it's really going to help us get out of this mess,  
I'll try anything!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We just have to get {player}  
as close as possible to Karyl, right?  
  
**Masaki：**  
Dear lady! Miss \"Pecorine,\" I believe?  
To aid a maiden in need is a knight's duty!  
Please allow me to carry young {player} to his goal!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Then... Rino and I will back you up!  
I'll block as many of that Karyl girl's attack spells as I can,  
so Rino, you draw her attention and try to keep her occupied!  
  
**Rino：**  
Roger that, Big Sis!  
That's called playing to our strengths!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Um, the phrase is actually—  
Wait... You got it right for once!  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheh! Even I can't stay hopeless forever!  
Are you impressed, Big Sis?!  
Like they say, all study and no play makes me a smart girl! ☆  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh? Come again?  
Is that a brand new takeon  
\"All work and no play  
 makes Jack a dull boy\"...?  
  
**Masaki：**  
Enough idle chatter! Miss Karyl can endure no longer.  
Each moment we waste here, her body is tearing itself apart!  
We must act with haste and purpose!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well said!  
Everyone, once we surpass this crisis,  
I will devote my life to repaying you all!  
  
**Rino：**  
Heheh~!  
No need for that! We're all in this to get her, right?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I think you mean \"together,\" Rino! ♪
