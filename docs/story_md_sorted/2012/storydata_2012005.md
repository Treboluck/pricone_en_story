## Subtitle: Festivities and Foreboding
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hmm...  
I gotta wonder, why *is* the festival so lively this time 'round?  
Feels to me  
 like there's twice as many folks here as most years.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Weren't some idols  
 doing a tour of the whole continent,  
spreading word of the festival as they went?  
You knyow, that popular group...  
 \"Carmina,\" was it?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I even heard they're performing at the festival itself.  
'Course, that'll be in the city center,  
so it doesn't have much to do with us in the beastfolk quarter.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Landosol's a big place, after all! Us Caon members just have to  
worry about guarding the beastfolk quarter,  
 but it must be tough  
for Nightmare, having to patrol the whole city!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
You're not wrong! It's a struggle!  
  
Seriously, I oughtta go help my guildmates with the job!  
This is no time to be leisurely frying up takoyaki!  
  
**Mimi：**  
You can't leave, Matsuri!  
We all promised to help out at the stalls today! ♪  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Lemme go, Mimi!  
There are times when a hero must rush to the field of battle!  
And I too, apprentice though I am,  
 count myself among those heroes!  
  
**Mimi：**  
You really like playing hero games, huh?  
It would be nice if you could play house  
or dress up dolls with us sometimes, too...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Urghhh~?  
Sorry, but I've never been a fan of all that girly stuff!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ahah! How sweet~! ♪  
The little kids are all helping out at the stalls together!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Oh,  
 hello there, nice lady from Caon! ♪  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Urgh... Caon's our enemy...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hm?  
 Why the nasty glare? You'd be cuter with a smile!  
C'mon, love and peace all around! ♪  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myahaha.  
 Most beastfolk are manning the stalls  
or doing volunteer work like picking up litter...  
I think the Menagerie set this up through the nyeighborhood council?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Yep, I think so!  
Since the recent kerfuffle, human-beastfolk relations haven't been great,  
so a show of goodwill is just the ticket to patch things up!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Roping even the kids into helping out  
feels a bit cruel, if you ask me...  
Didn't you want to enjoy the festival nyormally, Mimi?

**Mimi：**  
Uh-huh!  
 But it's just today we've got to help out!  
Tomorrow, me and Kyoka and Misogi  
are all gonna meet up and have fun at the festival together!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Matsuri, do you want to come with us too?  
I'll introduce you to my friends! ♪  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Uhhh...?  
 That sounds nice, but I've got guard work to do!  
I wanna protect the city from evil!  
  
**Mimi：**  
There's no evil here, silly!  
Everyone's super nice and friendly, see~? ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ahah!  
Well, festivals can get rowdy sometimes,  
so you can't be too careful!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Me and my Caon buddies will be on patrol too,  
so let us know if you see anything wrong!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Okay! Thanks for keeping us safe, nice lady!  
C'mon, Matsuri, thank the nice lady too!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Urghhh...  
 A hero of justice can't bow her head to an enemy!  
  
**Kaori：**  
We're not enemies!  
We're all one big family! Friends, forever! ♪  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myahaha...  
 You seem more responsible lately, Mimi.  
Weren't you always chasing butterflies, falling over on the street,  
and getting yourself purr-fectly lost?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Eheheh...  
I've been on lots of adventures, so I'm growing up fast! ♪

**Makoto：**  
Ahh! Kaori!  
 Finally, I found you!  
We're supposed to stick together, remember?  
You can't just go wandering off without telling me!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oh! Makoto!  
 Haitai~! ☆  
  
**Makoto：**  
Don't you \"Haitai\" me! Geez, this girl... There's no tying her down.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myahaha.  
 You can't tie a beastgirl down for long!  
We're always true to our instincts~! ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Uh, a little thinking wouldn't hurt too, Tama.  
We're beastfolk 'cause we're animal *and* human, right?  
Don't forget to let the human side shine!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Sure, sure.  
Heheh. This almost feels like a class reunion.  
 We were all born and  
raised in the beastfolk quarter,  
 so everyone knows everyone else! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oh, really?  
 Now I feel kind of left out!  
My homeland's a long way from Landosol,  
so I don't have many old friends around here.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ahahah.  
 There's plenty of time to make friends, Kaori.  
I mean, you always get along with everyone.  
I wouldn't be surprised if you had more friends than me already!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Umm...  
Miss Makoto, you know almost all the beastfolk, right?  
Do you know who those girls over there are?  
  
**Makoto：**  
\"Those girls\"?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hmmm...? Those faces don't look familiar.  
Who the heck are they...?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hmm?  
I don't remember seein' a stall over there.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ohhh...?  
When'd they set it up?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? You guys don't know who they are either?  
I figured they were just helping out at the stalls  
like the rest of us kids at the festival...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But I've never met them,  
so me and Mimi were just wondering who they might be.  
I don't know all that much about beastfolk from other neighborhoods.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But it looked like they were grilling up some weird food  
and coughing a whole bunch, so I was curious...  
But I don't know them, so I didn't want to butt in...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Eheheh~! ♪  
You can be pretty shy, huh, Matsuri?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'd say you're the one who's not shy enough...  
You just go up and chat with any old guy on the street, right?  
You gotta be more careful.  
 I worry about ya.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Huh~?  
But  
 they're all really nice people! ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hmm.  
Something's still bugging me about those girls.  
I think I'll go have a word with them. C'mon, Kaori!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Huh? I'm going too?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Well, of course you are.  
Didn't I say we're a team? Try to act like it, will ya?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Okaaay...  
They're only kids, though. There won't be any trouble,  
so wouldn't you be fine on your own?
