# Interlude 13
With Karyl left behind in the dream, Ameth urges her to awaken. Just then, Labyrista appears before the two of them, and entrusts {player}'s memories to Karyl. Though Karyl has misgivings, Ameth encourages her to follow her heart.
  
## Subtitle: Interlude 13
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-what the heck?  
Pecorine and the others just vanished!  
  
**Karyl：**  
There's still so much I need to apologize for!  
So many things I have to tell them!  
Dammit, what happened?! What do I do now?!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Karyl! I'm sorry, we ran into an unexpected snag!  
Looks like {player} woke up,  
and now the dream itself is ending! It's dangerous to stay here!  
  
**Ameth：**  
You really ought to wake up too!  
Or else when the dream ends... you might disappear along with it!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Arghhh... I knew it was a stretch,  
putting you to sleep in the middle of a battle!  
  
**Ameth：**  
But with that brainwashing magic in the way,  
this was the only way for us to reach the real you,  
deep inside your consciousness!  
  
**Karyl：**  
S-say what now?  
Actually, who even are you?  
  
**Ameth：**  
My name's Ameth. You've probably heard of me from Kokkoro, right?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? Ameth?  
Isn't that the goddess Koro's always praying to and stuff?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Arghhh, there's no time to explain!  
Come on, just come over here for a second!  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm going to force your body awake!  
The palace seems to be collapsing,  
so if you keep snoozing, you'll be crushed to death!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? Huh? The palace?  
What are you talking about?  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Oh, hold it there a sec.  
Before you go, there's something we need to talk about.  
  
**Ameth：**  
...Akira?! What are *you* doing here?  
I thought you were back in the real world!  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Ahaha.  
You can't go underestimating little old me.  
For all my faults,  
 I am still one  
 of the Seven Crowns.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Even from \"over there,\" I managed to rig up a line  
to temporarily connect me to you guys in here.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
It wasn't easy! You should see all the bugs... The whole system  
is just bugs all the way down at this point.  
 Looking from outside  
let me really see just how twisted this world has become.  
  
**Karyl：**  
And who's this lady?  
She acts all casual and chatty, but something about her isn't normal!  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Oh, so you're Karyl? Nice to meetcha!  
You've been taking care of my old pal Mana, right?  
Now that can't be an easy job. Not with that twisted personality!  
  
**Karyl：**  
M-Mana?  
Isn't that... Her Majesty's real name?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Um... Are you a friend of Her Majesty's, then?  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Yup. We go way back.  
'Course, even my memories got all jumbled in the reconstruction,  
so I didn't remember everything until...  
 well, pretty dang recently.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
But the truth matched up pretty neatly  
with the theories I'd crafted in my muddled state.  
Yeeep, the situation's a mess, that's for sure.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Uhhh...?  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Sorry, sorry.  
You're in a hurry to get out of here, aren't you?  
I'll try to keep this nice and short.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Karyl.  
Right now, I'm not in a position where I can do much directly.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Establishing a brief connection like this  
and exchanging data...  
 holding a conversation is all I can do.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
So I'll leave this to you.  
The gift I was hoping to give him myself.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-who's \"him\"?  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Young {player}.  
My very own brave little Princess Knight!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Akira. When you say a gift, you don't mean...?!  
His memories of the past that you've been holding onto?  
  
**Ameth：**  
You can't!  
If he remembers everything right now,  
it could destroy his mind!  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Yeah.  
That's why I'm only going to restore a little.  
Just the parts he needs to fight effectively.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
The result should be  
a massive boost to his Princess Knight abilities.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
In the final battle ahead, he'll need that, right?  
I'm sorry. I really wish I could lend a hand myself!  
  
**Labyrista：**  
If this was like the time with the mass-destruction spell,  
I could at least sacrifice myself to stop it.  
But sadly, this time, I can't make it fully back to that world.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Well, if worst comes to worst, I'll find a way regardless.  
But don't count on me. Ideally, I'd like you to seize your own futures.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
I'm rooting for ya, and I believe you can do this.  
I may not be able to predict the future like Mana,  
but my instincts are usually on the mark.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Well, that's all.  
I'll say goodbye for now.  
Next time we meet, I hope it'll be in reality.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Wait!  
Akira, there's something I have to tell you!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh, curses. She vanished.  
Every time, she lets other people do her work for her.  
It would be so much easier if she handled it herself.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I really wanted to ask her about Yui, too.  
But oh well, she did say she can at least talk,  
so hopefully there'll be another chance.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Umm...  
Listen... Ameth, what was that about?  
What am I supposed to do next?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hmmm...  
Right now, you just need to wake up fast.  
After that, it's up to you. You can do whatever feels right.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Nobody's giving you orders now.  
Just try to follow your heart.  
Only you can choose how best to live your own life, you know.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...
