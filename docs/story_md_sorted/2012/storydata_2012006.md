**???：**  
Atchoo! Atchoo! Atchoo!  
  
**???：**  
Uerghhh...  
Kaya-P, I think I caught a cold...  
  
**Kaya：**  
A cold? In this heat? I'm not buying it.  
Sure you're not sneezing 'cause someone's talking behind your back?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Actually, if you're gonna sneeze, can you turn around first?  
You're gonna get gunk all over the food.  
  
**Kaya：**  
We're running a stall here.  
Can't go giving customers food poisoning, can we?  
  
**Inori：**  
Uehh... I'm very sorr— Atchoo!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Ahhh! Your nose!  
 It's dripping everywhere!  
  
**Inori：**  
Uerghh... Forget dripping, I think it might start flaming...  
The more I hold it in, the more it tickles...  
Atchoo! Atchoo! Aaaatchoo!

**Kaya：**  
Ah, heck. That's another batch burned to a total crisp.  
The boss ain't gonna be pleased...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey! You got a moment?  
What the heck was that explosion?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Haitai! ☆ That's how we say hello back home!  
What guild are you girls from?  
D'you mind if we ask a few questions?  
  
**Inori：**  
Waahh! S-strange people!  
 I'm scared!  
K-Kaya-P...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Yeah, I know. You can hide behind my back, Inori.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Sure, I'll answer any...  
Hm...?  
 Hey, hang on. I've seen you guys before! Aren't you...  
that guild guarding the beastfolk quarter? ...Uhh...  
 What was the name?  
  
**Makoto：**  
We're from Caon.  
And we're not trying to accuse you of anything, so don't get all tense.  
Our job's to protect citizens, not to go around intimidating them.  
  
**Makoto：**  
...Hm?  
You two... Those tails and little wings...  
Could you be dragonfolk?  
  
**Inori：**  
Augh! I knew it!  
They saw right through us, Kaya-P!  
 What now?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Uh, it's not like we were trying to hide.  
Yeah, you got it. We're both dragonfolk. What about it?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hey, hey!  
Sorry to butt in and stuff, but could you fill me in a bit?  
What's a dragonfolk?  
 I've never heard of those!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Well, I don't know that much myself...  
My mom used to tell me wild stories about them, that's all.  
  
**Makoto：**  
A race spoken of in rumors but never truly confirmed.  
They're supposed to be a rare type of beastfolk.  
  
**Makoto：**  
So I guess, if you're beastfolk like us...  
Were you helping out at the stalls like Mimi and the other kids?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, we belong to this gang...  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Uh, I mean, a guild! We're grunts at a guild!  
Our boss sent us here to do some honest work, that's all!  
  
**Inori：**  
Aughh...  
 We can't keep living like this forever...  
That boss works us to the bone...!  
  
**Inori：**  
She bought me fair and square, so I can't help it,  
but Kaya-P, couldn't you find a better life?  
  
**Kaya：**  
And leave you on your own, Inori?  
Nah. I don't mind this life, anyway.  
We're a rare breed, so we've gotta stick together. Am I wrong?  
  
**Inori：**  
Aughhh... You're so weird, Kaya-P.  
You look and act like a dumb thug,  
 but you're such a nice girl...!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hmm? Did I hear the word \"gang\"?  
I don't really get it...  
But if you're in trouble, you can ask for help from Caon any time.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Yep, yep!  
 We're here to help any beastfolk in trouble!  
  
**Kaya：**  
I appreciate the offer, but don't mind us!  
The boss'd yell at us if we got in cahoots with Caon...  
It'd be great if you could just leave us alone!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hm? What's up?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Look out, everyone!  
Something nasty's headed this way!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Something nasty?  
  
**Makoto：**  
...Whoa, what *is* that?  
The buildings over that way are all crashing down!  
Did some moron start a brawl in the middle of the festival?!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Look, Makoto! Someone's flying this way!  
  
**Yui：**  
Aaaaaahhh!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yui...?!  
The heck? What's going on here?  
No, there's no time for asking questions! I gotta catch you first!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hnnngahh!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Just in time!  
You all right, Yui?  
  
**Makoto：**  
That was too close!  
If you'd gone hurtling into a wall or the ground at that speed,  
you'd be flat as a pancake!  
  
**Yui：**  
A-aahhh...  
H-huh? Makoto?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yeah, it's me, Makoto. Your ever-reliable best friend!  
What the heck happened, Yui? Did someone attack you?  
  
**Yui：**  
W-well...  
I'm not sure how to explain.  
I am being attacked, but I don't understand why...  
  
**Yui：**  
...!  
Look out, Makoto!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Whoaah?!  
What was that?! Felt like some kind of energy beam!  
Gahhh, a bunch of the beastfolk stalls got blasted clean away!  
  
**Makoto：**  
What's going on?  
Did some crazy monster find its way inside the city?!  
  
**Yui：**  
It's not a monster...  
It's a perfectly normal human girl,  
 but, um...For some reason, she seems to really hate me in particular.
