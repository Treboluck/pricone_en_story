## Subtitle: All That I Deserve
  
**Karyl：**  
...Ahaha. Hilarious, isn't it?  
This is the one happy memory I have with Her Majesty.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Eating rice balls together and making small talk...  
All my other memories are just of being ignored,  
or insulted, or punished for my failures...  
  
**Karyl：**  
That was all we shared.  
But for that moment, just that once, I actually felt real happiness.  
That was all I needed to justify my loyalty to Her Majesty.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Because...  
Nothing good had ever happened to me in my life.  
  
**Karyl：**  
My parents joined a weird cult  
and lashed out at me for ridiculous reasons...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I never had friends at school, or any hobbies.  
My life was just studying and working part-time jobs.  
It wore me down till I hated the whole world.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That was when I first heard about Her Majesty.  
About an amazing person who might be related to me...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Someone like me, but rich, powerful, respected by everyone...  
That thought made me feel proud.  
It gave me the strength, the hope to carry on.  
  
**Karyl：**  
And when finally I found the courage to meet her,  
well, she wasn't exactly nice to me,  
but she accepted me, and even gave me a special power.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I was so happy!  
\"Ahhh, so this is what I was born to do!\" I thought.  
So no matter how tough or hopeless it got,  
 I had to give it my all!  
  
**Karyl：**  
That person—Her Majesty—was all the happiness I had.  
And I honestly believed that we were two of a kind.  
That only we could give each other the love we needed.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Even if the whole world hated Her Majesty,  
declared her a villain, I would always be on her side.  
I swore that I would devote my love to her.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Tell me, was that wrong of me?  
And if it was,  
 what else was I supposed to do?  
  
**Karyl：**  
A hopeless, stupid girl like me...  
Should I just have let myself rot away like a piece of trash?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Tell me, please!  
What was the right thing for me to do?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl... Um, you *are* Karyl, aren't you?  
Not brainwashed, not a vision of the past,  
just the real Karyl we know?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah.  
I feel like I was dreaming all this time...  
But I do remember what I did to all of you.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Even if I was brainwashed, that's no excuse for what I did.  
In the end, it was still me who followed Her Majesty's orders.  
  
**Karyl：**  
No... I did all those things of my own free will.  
It was me who tried to kill you.  
From the start, I knew I was going to betray you someday.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You loved me, trusted me, and I was ready to take your life!  
I knew I didn't deserve your kindness!  
But still, I stuck around and took advantage of you!  
  
**Karyl：**  
And then look how I made you all suffer!  
I was your enemy this whole time!  
Sure, you all called me your friend, told me you cared about me!  
  
**Karyl：**  
But I was always a worthless scumbag!  
How could I be worth saving?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm so twisted I make myself sick!  
So curse me! Spit on me! Kill me and stamp on the corpse!  
  
**Karyl：**  
That's what I deserve! I should have died!  
Before I had the chance to hurt you!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please do not blame yourself so harshly.  
Everybody makes mistakes.  
None of us are gods who can make perfect choices.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We are only human.  
We doubt, worry, make mistakes—because we are imperfect beings.  
But that is why we can love one another. That is what I believe.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
No... it is what I was taught by my good friends.  
My foolish friends who cause no end of trouble each and every day.  
My wonderful friends in the Gourmet Guild.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, how I love each and every one of you.  
Each day, I could hardly wait to take my seat at the table we share.  
It delighted me to imagine what merry chaos the day might bring.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Such delectable feelings I could never have tasted  
in my peaceful yet unchanging home village.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, what a feast.  
 A banquet of heavenly moments.  
It was my friends... you, Miss Karyl, who gave me that gift.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You call yourself a villain worthy of nothing but our scorn.  
And yes, true enough, in many respects you are quite lacking.  
You can be rather moody, quick to anger, willful, and most stubborn.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And yet, Miss Karyl, you are no monster nor avatar of evil.  
To me, you have shown nothing but kindness.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
When I struggled to keep up with the rest of you,  
you noticed and made accommodations.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Always calling me \"Koro\"...  
When I had trouble with chopsticks, you would fetch me a spoon.  
When I stumbled, you took my hand  
 and asked me \"Are you all right?\"  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I still remember each detail.  
You are a kind soul, Miss Karyl, and I love you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The regret that you feel for your actions  
is all too clear from the tears that stain your cheeks.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That is the Karyl whom we love.  
And we hope for you to return alive to share a table with us once more.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I simply wish to hear you call me \"Koro\" again  
  
as you hand me a spoon.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If my mouth is dirty, I want you to wipe it for me,  
as you say with a sigh, \"You're still such a kid.\"  
I do not wish to lose these ordinary moments together.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And so, Miss Karyl, though this may be a childish request,  
please come home to us.  
To the happy table we share in the Gourmet Guild.
