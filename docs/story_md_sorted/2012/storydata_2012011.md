## Subtitle: Memories of Kindness
  
**Pecorine：**  
{player}!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We've been looking for you!  
Ameth told us you'd be somewhere in this dreamscape too.  
What have you been getting up to?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It is more proper to address her as \"Lady Ameth,\"  
Miss Pecorine.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wow, you're strict!  
But that aside, is this some kind of observation deck?  
Wow, the view from here is great! How crazy is that?! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heheh!  
 This is supposedly our real reality,  
but it all looks so strange and new...  
Wow... There are tons of buildings as big as the royal palace!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wait, we're not here to sightsee...  
We have to find Karyl!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Ah! Over where my lord is gazing,  
there stands a figure that resembles Miss Karyl!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Resembles\"...? Why would you be so vague— Ohhh...?

**Karyl?：**  
...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whoa! There *is* a Karyl-y looking girl—no other way to say it—  
standing on the other side of that fence!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wh-what's she doing in a place like that?  
Hey! Karyl-y looking girl! That's dangerous!  
One little trip from that spot could send you tumbling over the edge!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Could she be planning to leap to her own doom?  
Suddenly approaching her might shock her into jumping,  
which I suppose is why my lord was simply watching.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
H-how should we proceed?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Come on, let's move closer slowly!  
And then when I count to three, we all grab that Karyl-y looking girl  
and pull her over the fence...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm?  
Over in the direction the girl is looking,  
I think I see something weird...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Is that Landosol...? It's that restaurant we always visit.  
It seems disconnected from the rest of the scenery,  
like it doesn't belong here!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah! I do believe I see ourselves inside the restaurant!  
Could this be a vision of Miss Karyl's memories...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That seems pretty likely.  
After all, I remember this scene!  
I'd never forget any of the times we spent around that table together.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I think it was after the time we all harvested rice together.  
We brought some of the rice back to cook for ourselves...

**Pecorine：**  
Munchy munchy munchy!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhhh, delicious!  
 How crazy is that?! ☆  
Eating rice that you harvested with your own hands...  
Isn't it just the greatest feeling?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Nom nom nom!  
So gooooood! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Rice grown in the gleaming sunlight, drinking only the freshest of water!  
It's like the princess of rice!  
Princess Rice... or Pri:Rice for short! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
The heck's a \"Pri:Rice\"?  
And can you not talk while you eat?!  
You're spraying rice grains everywhere!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. Miss Karyl is quite right.  
Wherever are your manners, Miss Pecorine?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Awww! But I wanna talk more!  
I've gotta share this happiness with you guys!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But to talk to you, I have to stop chowing down!  
It's the cruelest of dilemmas!  
Ahhh, if only my body was covered in a hundred mouths!  
  
**Karyl：**  
One mouth's more than enough!  
Are you trying to become a monster?!  
Well, I guess you *do* basically eat like one already...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
How mean! Why've you gotta be so cruel, Karyl~?!  
Am I really all that monstrous?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. Miss Karyl is merely complimenting you  
on your most hearty of appetites. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yaaaay! Compliments from Karyl!  
 That's great!  
I super-duper love you too, Karyl~! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, blegh! Enough of the hugs already! It wasn't a compliment!  
If we left you alone, you'd chow down until you caused a global famine!  
If that's not a monster, what is?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I don't eat *that* much!  
Besides, I do know how to restrain myself!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I wouldn't want to hog all the food,  
so I always leave enough for you guys to eat! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Look! I borrowed the kitchen and made some special dishes myself!  
You've gotta try them all!  
The star of the show is the rice!  
 Our Pri:Rice~! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Are you still trying to make that weird name a thing?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. Perhaps she is hoping to establish a new brand.  
This rice truly is delicious, after all.  
Perhaps it is the cooking method?  
 Its sweetness grows with each bite...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, be sure to chew thoroughly before you swallow.  
Look, I will demonstrate for you. Munch, munch... Munch, munch...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Are you his mom?!  
You two really are way too close. It's almost creepy.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh.  
No need to be jealous, Miss Karyl. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Me, jealous?  
It's not like I'm into all that sappy stuff.  
  
**Karyl：**  
My family was pretty hands-off,  
so nobody ever really hugged me...  
It just weirds me out. You're definitely the freaky ones, not me!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whaaa~?! How can you be a family without hugs?!  
That does it! If your parents won't, then I will!  
The perpetually peckish Pecorine will be your personal hug machine!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Cuddle, cuddle~! ♪  
C'mon, Karyl, you know you like it!  
Drop the haughty act  
 and try showing us a real smile for once!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Arghhh, I told you to quit that already!  
Besides,  
 this rice... Shouldn't we eat it up  
before it gets all cold and chewy?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh! You're right!  
We can't waste food this good!  
  
**Karyl：**  
And, uh, not that I care...  
But did you really have to cook this much?  
Not everyone's got an appetite the size of yours, you know!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, then let's make the leftovers into rice balls!  
With a pickled plum inside, they'll keep till tomorrow, no problem!  
Or they'd make great fried rice, too!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Here, I'll give you the recipe!  
No... Maybe I should drop by your place and fry it up for you myself!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Um,  
 actually...  
You probably shouldn't come over to my place.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh~?!  
Why not? You haven't even told us where you live yet, have you?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aren't we all great friends?!  
Sheesh, what a mysterious girl you are! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
If you find out the truth,  
I'm sure you'll only end up hating me...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? What was that?  
You'll have to say it again! I couldn't hear you over the chatter!  
  
**Karyl：**  
No... It's nothing.  
Anyway, I've got work piled up, so I should get going.  
Can I make a few rice balls now to take with me?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'll eat them later.  
...Sorry I always have to leave so soon.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, you did say your work's been pretty hectic lately, didn't you?  
It's a shame, but there's no helping that!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Besides...  
We can always just get together for another meal later!  
The next day, and the next... I hope we'll keep doing this forever!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So please, don't say sorry like it's a bad thing, Karyl.  
You don't have anything to apologize to us for.  
  
**Karyl：**  
How can you be so sure about that?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, whatever.  
Can I make those rice balls now?  
If you've got any tips, I'm all ears.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Right! You leave it to me! I'm the queen of riceballdom!  
Kokkoro and {player}, you should join in too! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Squeeze the rice with lots of love!  
Fill it with delicious thoughts, and squeeze some more!  
  
**Karyl：**  
*That's* your technique?  
Not a shred of logic to it...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh~?  
 But it really is the most important part!  
Cooking is an act of love! Squeeze, squeeze~! ♪
