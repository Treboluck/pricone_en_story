**Narration：**  
Quite some distance from the unfolding crisis at Carmina's concert,  
out in the outskirts of Landosol...  
  
**Narration：**  
Among the bustle of citizens enjoying the festivities  
in the beastfolk quarter, Kaori of Caon is on patrol as usual.

*munch munch munch* ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Mmmm~! ☆  
 These skewers are just godly, no lyin'!  
...Hm? Godly lions?  
 We've got those back home! They're called shisa!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Uh, what? Come again?  
Wait, was that meanta be a gag?!  
Dangit! My comic reaction times've been at an all-time low lately!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I was gettin' so pumped  
for this festival's big comedy contest,  
but I done crashed an' burned in the qualifiers!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
This grill for the skewers may be sizzlin' hot,  
but it can't warm the chill in my heart!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Urghhh, back to business!  
Take it all, thieves!  
 I'll feed y'all full of meaty goodness!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Huh? Thieves? Where? Where?  
I'll capture them!  
Protecting everyone at the festival is Caon's job, you know!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
No, no, it's a turn of phrase...  
Wait, did I just miss another prime gag opportunity?!

**Tamaki：**  
...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hm? Hey, you over there... You just hid your face!  
Talk about suspicious! Could it be you're the real thief?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Th-th-th-th-thief, me?  
 Nyo idea what you're talking about!  
I'm just an honest, hardworking taiyaki seller!  
Try my wares if you don't believe me! Here, dig in!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oh, you run a stall?  
 My mistake, then!  
Crime's been on the rise around here, so we're all a bit on edge!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'm real sorry!  
Tell you what, I'll buy lots of taiyaki to apologize!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh? Well!  
 Always a pleasure doing business!  
Hope you'll be back for more!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Sure!  
The other Caon members all love sweet treats too,  
so I'll buy some extra to share! ♪  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myahhh~! ♪  
Now that's what I call a fine customer!

**Tamaki：**  
Phew... I managed to change the subject.  
It's not easy being a vigilante... Am I doomed to spend my life  
prowling in the nyight and hiding from the sun?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hey, Makimaki! That taiyaki's gonna burn if you ain't careful!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
M-myah?! Oh, meowzers! I'm a fire hazard!  
Burning my own prize taiyaki? What's wrong with me?  
If I waste ingredients, Mifuyu won't let me hear the end of it!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ahahah.  
You've really gotten into all that business stuff, huh, Makimaki?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
D'you really have to call me \"Makimaki\"...?  
Well, nyot that I guess there's a better option.  
\"Tama\"... would sound iffy if you repeated it.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Yeah, I've never been a big fan of stoopin' down to dirty jokes!  
You got a real knack for comedy, Makimaki!  
Whaddaya say we form a duo?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myah...?  
 Making people laugh sounds nyice and all,  
but I don't have time to be performing!  
I'm busy all through the day and the nyight!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ahahaha.  
I don't really get it, but less chatting and more cooking!  
The line of customers is starting to grow!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Whoa! You ain't wrong, either!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wow... I ain't seen business like this in years!  
There's more buyers than a seller can handle!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
That cash'll go towards rebuilding the farm,  
so I can't be complainin'!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Are your funds looking all right?  
If you like, I can ask Akino  
to send a bit more support from the Foundation.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Naw, y'all helped us more'n enough already!  
The farm's not lookin' too shabby, so we'll be fine for now!  
'Course, if we ever really need it, I'll be sure to ask!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyo need to hesitate!  
The Meow-curius Foundation is a friend to anyone in financial need!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hey, hey, are you from Elizabeth Park, then?  
Some of my friends from Caon are living there right now.  
Do you know if they're doing OK?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Shiori sends us letters, but Rin can never be bothered,  
so we don't know what she gets up to!  
After that big incident, we were all getting pretty worried, you know?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, you're from Caon too, are ya?  
Shioshio and Rinrin were both right as rain in the end!  
They've been helpin' us out a whole bunch around the farm lately!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
'Course, the whole thing did wear us out.  
Shioshio was pretty beat, so the others are lookin' after her back home.  
She sounded pretty sad to be missin' the festival...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oh, that's a shame! Hope she's OK...  
We're spread pretty thin here, so if she was around,  
I was hoping she could help us out...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It sure is busy this year!  
Can't complain myself, since it's all profits in the end,  
but you should see all the accounts!  
 Mifuyu was in her element!
