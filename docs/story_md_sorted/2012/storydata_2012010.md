**Ameth：**  
Hm? You don't know?  
Don't you recognize my voice?  
You hear it whenever I send you my guidance, don't you?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wha...? C-could it be?!  
Are you none other than Lady Ameth?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Yup! ♪ Oh, how I've longed to meet you, Kokkoro!  
Awwww, you're such a sweet little thing!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Awahh... Huh? Um,  
 ahh... Lady Ameth?  
Compared to my idle preconceptions, you seem... younger,  
or rather, more candid than I had imagined...!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ahaha.  
 Did I disappoint you?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway... Thanks to your remarkable efforts back there,  
I managed to bring you here,  
 into the dreamworld inside Karyl's mind...  
  
**Ameth：**  
But it won't last long. I don't have much power in this state,  
and Karyl's body is at its limit.  
Waste too much time, and she really will die.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I've been searching for a way to help for ages,  
so I'm glad I was able to do something...  
 But at the end of the day,  
linking people's hearts through dreams is all I'm good for.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Bringing Karyl back,  
and recovering the peaceful lives you all deserve,  
is still up to you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You have to find her in this world and talk to her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The topic doesn't matter. Talk about the weather if you like!  
Or about some delicious meal you had at a restaurant.  
Just hearing your voices should be just what her heart needs.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Underneath all the hatred, the pain and despair,  
her real heart is still waiting for you to reach it.  
You have to find it, hold it tight, and warm it with love.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And make a wish for her. To stay together...  
To go back to your happy days around that table.  
If Karyl hears that wish and accepts it, I'm sure she'll be fine.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Then you'll reach your very own happy ending.  
  
**Ameth：**  
In reality, wishes alone can't change anything.  
But this is a dream where wishes come true.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The wishes you share... Your bonds...  
They can heal the wounds on her unloved heart  
and save her soul. I know they can.
