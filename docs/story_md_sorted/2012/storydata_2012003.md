**Nozomi：**  
Thank you!  
All our fans in Landosol,  
 thank you for coming to see us today!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ahh, what a rush!  
These moments are the best!  
 I'm so glad I became an idol!

**Nozomi：**  
We do what we can to help, of course!  
First we get the audience to calm down, then lead them to safety!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Last time we went overboard fighting the monster,  
and someone got hurt as a result...  
Let's learn from our mistakes, and make sure nobody gets hurt this time!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Everyone! Stay calm, OK?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Listen closely to our voices and calmly do as we say!  
  
**Chika：**  
If anyone gets hurt in the confusion, bring them to me!  
I'll heal them with my Song Summoning!  
But please don't rush or panic!  
  
**Christina：**  
Excellent!  
You're on top of this. Efficient and effective!  
  
**Christina：**  
But no need to get all stressed, my dears...  
These strange dark Shadow creatures aren't causing any actual harm.  
  
**Christina：**  
All of them seem to be drifting towards the palace.  
  
**Chika：**  
Hmm... It's true. From here on the stage, it's plain to see.  
Just as you say, Producer,  
the Shadows are all moving gradually in the same direction.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
But... why the palace?  
Is there something inside that's attracting them?  
  
**Christina：**  
That, or someone inside the palace is deliberately summoning them.  
  
**Christina：**  
I don't like the timing. My Labyrinth allies  
are in the middle of their operation in the palace.  
It seems a situation may have arisen that we failed to forsee.  
  
**Christina：**  
Actually, Her Majesty... that \"Eustiana\"... told me something once.  
That the Shadows serve as a kind of emergency rations...  
  
**Christina：**  
What exactly did she mean by that?  
I don't quite follow, but it perturbs me greatly!  
  
**Shadow：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Uerghh! What are they doing?  
The Shadows are charging at each other  
and clumping together into one big mess!  
 Ew, I'm gonna barf...  
  
**Chika：**  
Yes... The combined Shadows  
are flowing together like a single current...  
As expected, their goal seems to be the palace.  
  
**Chika：**  
...I just tried listening to the wind,  
and it seems there are similar cases happening all over the city.  
I hear voices crying \"Shadows!\" from a wide area around us.  
  
**Chika：**  
The spirits are afraid, too...  
Whatever could this be? It's quite unnerving.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I don't know, but...  
We finished our final number, so our work as idols is done!  
From here on out, let's do what we can as ordinary citizens!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
As long as we try, we'll find a way through this, I know it!
