**Karyl：**  
What are you all muttering about...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I don't know what you're up to, but it's no use!  
No matter how much you pray, how hard you strive,  
this world never changes at all!  
 So give up, give in, and go away!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Nobody's ever going to be able to save me!  
I'm not worth it! There's no point!  
 Why do you even try?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Just looking at you people drives me crazy!  
I'll wipe you all from the face of this world!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I get it, Karyl.  
You're such a hopeless tsundere,  
you always say the opposite of what you really feel.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Day after day, we shared those meals together.  
We've talked so much that even an idiot like me can tell.  
I know what you really want, under all that bitterness.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I can see your real wish.  
You just want  
 someone to save you, right?  
To come close, hold you tight, and tell you they really love you!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So don't worry! As a princess, it's my job to grant my citizens' wishes!  
And you're my precious companion and beloved friend!  
So I'll make everything you're wishing for come true!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I want *everyone's* wishes to come true!  
That's my own true wish!  
  
**Karyl：**  
What are you, some kind of saint?!  
With that beaming smile on your face after all you've been through...  
I can't stand the sight of you!  
 Pecorine!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hahah! A... ahahahah! How's that?! A clean hit!  
I've sealed that nonsense-spouting mouth of yours  
for all eternity!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I did it... I did it, I did it! I finally killed her!  
Ahahahahah! I should have done this when I first met her!  
If I had,  
 I'd never have...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'd never... never have...?  
A... aaahhhh...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I killed... Pecorine...  
I... Ahhh... I killed...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm so sorry!  
 I'm sorry, I'm so sorry! I really did it!  
Forgive me! Forgive me for ever being born!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I... I... Aaaaahhhh...?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Pecorine...!  
You never did anything wrong, did you?!  
You were only trying to help me...  
  
**Karyl：**  
But I... I just...  
What did I even want to achieve...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Doing whatever Her Majesty said...  
Sucking up to her... Did I want her praise?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Was that more important to me  
than the happy times we had around that table...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
What was I really wishing for all this time...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Too bad!  
 Or rather, it's all right, Karyl!  
The Pecorine you just blasted away was just a silly fake! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?  
Th... that can't be!  
 How the hell are you alive?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Because I was born!  
And raised with love,  
eating delicious food every single day!  
  
**Masaki：**  
Let me explain! While Miss Rino and her companions drew your gaze,  
I secretly constructed a decoy,  
 exchanging it with the real Miss Pecorine!  
  
**Masaki：**  
I unleashed one of the artificial monsters we created in our research,  
and with a concoction of Mistress Neneka's,  
transformed its appearance to match Miss Pecorine's!  
  
**Rino：**  
By the way, this plan was all Big Sis's idea,  
and I shared it with everyone using arrow messages!  
A perfect team strategy!  
 How crazy is that?! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Did my catchphrase just get poached?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Anyway! While you were distracted by the decoy Pecorine,  
I was able to sneak up and get close to you!  
Karyl, you're all... mine! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Myaaghh?! L-let me go!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I won't ever let go!  
Sometimes you need to listen to your elders' advice a little!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Waaahh?! What the heck? Why should I listen to you?!  
You were just born earlier! What's so special about that?!  
What makes an idiot like you so much better than me?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This is our chance!  
Let us take my lord to Miss Karyl!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Nggghhh...!Even if you lock my limbs, I still have my magic!  
This time I'll make mincemeat out of all of you!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I don't think so!  
 You've misbehaved enough!  
This nasty thing is getting confiscated!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahhh! My magic staff...?!  
What's your problem?! All of you...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Why are you all going to these lengths  
for the sake of someone like me?!  
How stupid can you get?! It doesn't make any sense!
