## Subtitle: Chloe's Part-Time Pursuits: The Delivery
  
**Narration：**  
One Sunday morning, with no particular plans for the day,  
Chloe decides to look for a one-off job to earn a quick buck.  
  
**Chloe：**  
\"Delivery of goods, wage on request, all ages/genders accepted,\" huh...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Hmm...  
Might as well give this one a shot.  
Lessee... contact details...  
  
**Man：**  
So you see, all we need you to do  
is transport some letters and packages to the farm.  
Your team leader will fill you in on the specifics.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Roger that, chief.  
  
**Man：**  
You're assigned to Team F.  
The leader will meet you at the start of the route,  
so you can head straight there.  
  
**Man：**  
By the way, do you have any battle experience?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh?  
I dunno what kinda \"way\" that's \"by,\"  
 but sure.  
I grew up in a kinda rowdy neighborhood, so I can handle myself.  
  
**Man：**  
Oh, good! Then I'm sure you'll be just fine.  
You see, on the route—right about here on the map—  
there have been some monster sightings.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh... News to me.  
There's monsters 'round those parts?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Took my kid brothers there for a picnic not that long ago,  
and it seemed like a quiet enough forest to me.  
  
**Man：**  
I'm sure it would.  
The monster warning was only issued a few days back.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Warning, huh.  
  
**Man：**  
Don't worry, it's just a lone monster, separated from its pack.  
At any rate, Nightmare sent a team to deal with it,  
but weren't even able to locate the beast.  
  
**Man：**  
So I'd imagine the odds of meeting it are very low indeed.  
Unless you're very unlucky, you shouldn't have any trouble at all.  
No need to dwell on it too much.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh, is that right.  
Well, not like it makes much difference...  
  
**Man：**  
Oh, one more thing.  
About your team leader...  
  
**Man：**  
He may seem... rough around the edges,  
but he's a hard worker and a good person all around.  
Please take good care of him.  
 I'm counting on you.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh? Do what now?  
Isn't that backwards?  
Why've I gotta... Am I his babysitter?  
  
**Man：**  
Ha ha ha!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Think it's funny, do ya.  
No, for real though, the heck is this about?  
What's the deal with this team leader.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm your team leader, {player}!  
`Tag 1`  
**Chloe：**  
Ohhh... This guy... It all makes sense now...  
  
**Chloe：**  
But, uh, again?  
You're here *again?*  
What is this, fate?  
  
**Chloe：**  
And some \"team\" this is. It's just one guy.  
Even with me that's like, two.  
Just the good ol' Lost Boy and Part-Timer duo.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm not going to get lost today!  
`Tag 2`  
**Chloe：**  
I'd hope not. If their delivery guys couldn't find addresses,  
some postal service that'd be.  
 All of Landosol'd be in trouble.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Hang on... Wait a minute.  
Don't tell me all those times you got lost, you were on delivery jobs...?  
  
**Chloe：**  
No, don't tell me. I don't wanna know.  
I'd rather not learn any deep-seated societal issues.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uhh, on to the job, then.  
I'm Chloe, your part-time helper for today. Pleasure and stuff.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Gotta say, this role reversal is really kinda throwing me off...  
Don't you get that too?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm happy we can work together!  
**Choice: (4)**  I'm sad that we're working together...  
`Tag 3`  
**Chloe：**  
What are you, five?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, I guess... that's fine.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Chloe：**  
...What?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oops, silly me.  
Looks like I \"accidentally\" drew my dagger.  
Almost slipped 'round your back and pressed it to your neck.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh? I've got it wrong? It's 'cause of the monster warning?  
Oh... you were worried about me?  
Then say so, why don'tcha... Well, whatever.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Chloe：**  
Anyway, let's get moving.  
Uh, this is the stuff to deliver, right?  
...Heave-ho.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I'll carry it.  
`Tag 6`  
**Chloe：**  
No, I'm good.  
I'm getting paid for this. And you're the guy in charge, right?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh?  
Oh, you sure?  
Well... I guess, if you're gonna be that insistent...  
  
**Chloe：**  
The heck... When he's on the job, he's actually kinda cool...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh... Who'd've thought.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yep, I take it back.  
He's still hopeless.  
Mr. Team Leader's gotten us lost already.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I'm not lost.  
`Tag 7`  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, sure you're not.  
I mean, look, on the map they gave me...  
  
**Chloe：**  
...There, you see?  
We're well off the course we were supposed to take.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  I thought I heard a voice over this way.  
`Tag 8`  
**Chloe：**  
Excuses!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Like, are you for real? Voices?  
What's that even supposed to—  
  
**Girl's Voice：**  
Aaaaaaaghhh!  
  
**Chloe：**  
...!  
Someone's under attack?!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Let's hurry!  
`Tag 9`  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
N-nooooooo!  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Aaaahh! S-stay back!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Those idiots...!  
What're they doing here when there's a monster warning?!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Friends of yours?  
`Tag 10`  
**Chloe：**  
Well, uh. They're classmates.  
  
**Choice: (11)**  Let's save them!  
**Choice: (12)**  Let's take action!  
`Tag 11`  
`Tag 12`  
**Chloe：**  
Damn right.  
I'll dash in and distract the monster,  
so you get the girls to safety while I—  
  
**Chloe：**  
Wha—?!  
Wait... What the? My body feels super light...  
Huh? This is your magic...?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, whatever. Talk can wait!  
With this, it'll be over in no time...  
 Hahh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRUAAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pff...  
Shut up now, monster. You're way too loud.  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
A-aaahhh...? Chloe...?  
  
**Chloe：**  
See?  
You're making my friends scared.  
So it's time for you to quiet down.  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Whew... It's safe now.  
You guys OK?  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Y-y-  
yes...  
  
**Chloe：**  
You can quit shaking now.  
It's fine. I kicked that monster's dumb ass.  
Here, can you stand?  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Eeeeek!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ah... Ohhh, I see.  
Guess you're more scared of me right now than the monster.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well... figures. I don't mind.  
Anyway, glad you're OK at least.  
  
**Chloe：**  
C'mon, your parents'll be worried. Hurry on home.  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
U-um, ahhh...  
 How to say this...  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
G-good day to you!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Polite to a fault, huh.  
  
**Chloe：**  
But yeah.  
They're true sheltered little ladies.  
This whole thing must've been a real shock. Poor girls.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Still, uh... Like, for real?  
Did I really look that scary back there?  
  
**Choice: (14)**  You looked really cool.  
`Tag 14`  
**Chloe：**  
Oh? Well, thanks.  
  
**Chloe：**  
I mean, look, you weren't half bad yourself.  
You can be pretty cool when you try, I guess.  
  
**Chloe：**  
But, uh...  
It's just that... I dunno, like...?  
  
**Chloe：**  
It's kinda depressing that they didn't even thank me,  
but it makes me feel like a real hero, too.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Booyah.  
  
**Narration：**  
Chloe and {player} bumped fists to celebrate their victory,  
and went on to complete their delivery to the farm without issue.
