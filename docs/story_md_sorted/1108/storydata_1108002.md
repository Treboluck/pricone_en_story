# Chloe Episode 2
At St. Theresa's Academy, a school for respectable young ladies, most students keep their distance from Chloe. Meanwhile, after school, she works a part-time job at a shop dealing in illegal magic. As luck would have it, she runs into {player} again when he wanders lost into that very shop.

**Narration：**  
St. Theresa's Academy for Girls. For young ladies of  
respectable upbringing it has long been the school of choice,  
but less affluent students like Chloe can find it challenging to fit in.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Owww!  
  
**Teacher：**  
Miss Chloe?  
What's all this in the middle of class?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh—sorry!  
It's nothing. I just, uh,  
 kinda burned my finger...  
  
**Teacher：**  
Did I just see you hide something?  
Show me what you have beneath that desk.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uhhh... Sure.  
This is, um, just a bit of practice for tomorrow's test, so...  
  
**Teacher：**  
A scroll... recording magical techniques?  
  
**Teacher：**  
With your grades in magic, I appreciate your desire to study,  
but I'm afraid this is math class. Put that scroll away.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeah, I'm real sorry.  
Uh, I mean,  
 apologies for my behavior.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeeeesh, that was close.  
Good thing she didn't look too close at what's inside...  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Hm?  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Did you see the contents of that scroll just now?  
I thought I saw a most ancient-looking incantation...  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Yes, I was most curious myself...  
I do believe it was one of the cursed arts that are forbidden nowadays!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uerghh. Just my luck. They saw the whole thing.  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
F-forbidden curses?  
 My, how terrible!  
Whyever would Chloe bring such a scroll to the academy?  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
She's like a delinquent!  
If the teachers knew about this, she would be expelled, or worse!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ahhh... It's those girls, too.  
For some reason they always seem to be kinda scared of me.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, not like I care one way or the other...  
  
**Chloe：**  
...No, I can't ignore it.  
It wasn't easy to get into this school. Can't get myself expelled.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Hey. Got a moment?  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Eek! Ch-Chloe?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Sorry, we gotta talk.  
Just so we can clear a few things up.  
 Uhh...  
Can you come with me  
 out behind the school for a sec?  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
H-heavens, no!  
N-n-neither of us saw anything whatsoever!  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Indeed! We wouldn't dream of telling the teachers  
about any ancient curses!  
So please, spare us, we beg you...!  
  
**Chloe：**  
H-huh? Really?  
Well, uh, I guess I can't complain, then...  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
W-well then, the two of us  
should be on our way in a hurry!  
 Good day to you!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, right.  
Later, then. Take care and stuff.  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Ohhhh, whatever shall we do?!  
We have become prime targets for the infamous Miss Chloe!  
  
**Chloe：**  
...  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Why do I feel like they got the wrong idea.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, whatever, not like I come to school to have fun.  
Why should I care what they think.  
  
**Chloe：**  
It's no big deal, but...  
  

---  
  
**Mother：**  
Chloe?  
How's life at school? Is it fun?  
Have you made plenty of friends?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uhhh...  
 Yeah, well, it's fine, I guess.  
More to the point, Mom, aren't you s'posed to be in bed.  
  
**Brother：**  
Aw man, having all those friends sounds fun!  
I wanna go to school too when I get bigger!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeah, school's a fun place.  
So you kids better be good and study hard, got that?  
  

---  
  
**Chloe：**  
...That coming from me. Hah, irony much.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pff...  
 Time to work.  
  
**Item Vendor：**  
Ah, Chloe! I've been waiting for you!  
  
**Item Vendor：**  
How was the scroll I left in your care?  
I trust you bathed it in shadows regularly as I taught you?  
  
**Chloe：**  
This thing is a menace. It flared up red-hot during class.  
Scared the life outta me.  
I was this close to making you pay damages for injury and expulsion.  
  
**Item Vendor：**  
It's infused with the spinal fluid of a very feisty monster.  
A little heat is to be expected.  
Hohohoh... My condolences to you.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, why the chuckles? I'm legit pissed with you here.  
It's not some funny anecdote of school tomfoolery.  
Or what, does this face look amused to you?  
  
**Customer：**  
Hey, pops! Is that it?  
The forbidden curse scroll you told me about?  
  
**Item Vendor：**  
Forbidden what? We don't carry any of that here.  
This is just a basic charm for lighting campfires on the road.  
  
**Item Vendor：**  
Of course...  
If you were to misread a line of the incantation,  
you might find the resulting inferno rather dangerous.  
  
**Customer：**  
Gueheh! Well, that sounds awful.  
I'd better take extra-special care not to read that line wrong, then!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ugh, I heard nothing. Not a thing.  
*sigh*... What a dumb store this is.  
  
**Customer：**  
Well then, pops, I'll be taking that sweet old scroll home now!  
  
**Item Vendor：**  
Pleasure doing business.  
Now, let me teach you how exactly to misread the spell...  
  
**Item Vendor：**  
...Hm, I see we have a new customer.  
I'll be busy over here, so Chloe, this one's yours.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Sure. Come on in!  
Welcome to Bluebeard's Tomes 'n' Trinkets, where the most extreme—  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Hold it. I know that face.  
{player}, was it?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hi there.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chloe：**  
Yeah... Hi.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, what're you doing in *this* shop?  
No, don't tell me.  
You're lashing out at the ills of society?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Now listen.  
That's fine, but you prob'ly oughtta rethink.  
A seedy old shop like this is no place for nice guys like you.  
  
**Chloe：**  
I'm sure your folks or whatever are a pain in the ass,  
but in the end, it's your own responsibility to—  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm just lost, actually.  
`Tag 2`  
**Chloe：**  
...Not this again.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, it's progress. 'Least you stopped me early this time.  
No chance for my pointless rant to build steam.  
  
**Chloe：**  
That reminds me. How're your bruises from that tavern brawl?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Mmm... good. Looks like you're fine.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Still, one time's enough.  
'Kay? You steer clear of places like that from now on.  
I mean, uh, not that this shop's a damn sight better.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Even though you're working here?  
`Tag 3`  
**Chloe：**  
Huh? You debating me? Getting cheeky now?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Whew, those pure puppy-dog eyes...  
Huh, I guess you're just honestly curious, huh?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, I'm different, see.  
Like, I've got my own reasons. You know the deal.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh? Well, y'know, I need the cash, so, uh...  
Jobs like this pay well, see?  
You know, the uh, not-so-savory ones.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Sounds dangerous.  
**Choice: (5)**  Sounds badass.  
`Tag 4`  
**Chloe：**  
Well, I guess?  
I mean, I'm used to it, or just gave up caring a while back.  
Like I said, my tribe's kinda dead, so we do what we gotta.  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Chloe：**  
Huh?  
Come again. That one's a first. Like, the heck?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, wait up. You trying to flatter me here?  
For real? Well, dang.  
I guess... thanks?  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Chloe：**  
By the way... You ever been down to the beastfolk quarter?  
  
**Chloe：**  
I mean, I know I haven't.  
But the rumors say it's kinda not a place for the faint-hearted, right?  
Guess you wouldn't know.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Landosol in general's a safe-ish city.  
But it's a big one too, so if you take a wrong turn,  
there's still spots where the royal knights' eyes don't reach.  
  
**Chloe：**  
The district where I grew up's basically one of those types.  
Well, point is.  
I wasn't exactly raised with a silver spoon in my mouth.  
  
**Chloe：**  
So don't you worry. I'll be fine.  
I can deal with a shop like this, long as the cash is good.  
  
**Chloe：**  
And like, my mom's not in the best way.  
She's got enough savings to support us for a while,  
but I'd rather at least cover my own education, y'know?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Hey, I'm not gonna claim it's ideal.  
If I had the choice, some fancy shop with pretty trinkets  
might be more up my alley, I guess...  
  
**Chloe：**  
But in the first place, part-timing's a no-no at the school I go to.  
So working at a place where teachers might drop by  
would be pretty dangerous too, see?  
  
**Chloe：**  
So yeah, that's my deal. We clear now?  
  
**Chloe：**  
I'm sure  
 with that, uh... knightly...? hero...? getup of yours,  
you prob'ly come from some well-off family, but me...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I don't remember my family.  
`Tag 7`  
**Chloe：**  
Huh? Come again?  
  
**Chloe：**  
You've \"lost your memories\"?  
Huh. Not sure I get it, but... huh.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Hmmm...  
You look all happy-go-lucky,  
but I guess you've got your own troubles.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, maybe that's why, though...  
  
**Chloe：**  
I mean...  
 I'm not normally the type to go  
telling a stranger my whole life story.  
  
**Chloe：**  
But, well... there's something...  
Some weird vibes I get from you.  
They kinda throw me off.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, I mean that in a good way. I think.  
  
**Item Vendor：**  
Hmm...  
What's this, Chloe? A rare smile on your face?  
Ah, I'll wager this young man's your fella, is he?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, ew. That's creepy.  
But sure, whatever, just watch the shop for me.  
  
**Chloe：**  
I've gotta show this lost kid the way back to the main street.  
  
**Chloe：**  
C'mon, {player}, follow me.  
Ah geez, look at the state of your hair! Hold still a sec...  
  
**Narration：**  
As the eldest child of her struggling family,  
Chloe turned out to have a surprisingly caring side.
