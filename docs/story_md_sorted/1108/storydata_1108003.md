## Subtitle: Chloe's Part-Time Pursuits: The Rare Herb
  
**Narration：**  
The weekend is here, but there's no rest for the wicked.  
After losing most of her part-time gigs in a recent crackdown,  
Chloe has come to a neighboring village to meet a suspicious merchant.  
  
**Merchant：**  
Young Chloe, was it?  
The task I'd like to ask of you is to harvest a rare herb.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh. An herb.  
  
**Merchant：**  
It should be on this page, I think...  
Ah yes, here we are. This is the herb I need.  
  
**Merchant：**  
It's an endangered species, so it isn't traded in the market.  
But as a potent catalyst for a certain dark magic, it's still in demand.  
Care to hear about the spell in question?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Nope, don't care.  
I mean like, at all.  
  
**Merchant：**  
Hah. The less you know, the less the weight on your conscience, eh?  
  
**Chloe：**  
All I care about's the reward.  
If I bring the plant,  
you're really gonna buy it at the price you just said?  
  
**Merchant：**  
My business is built on trust. I wouldn't lie to a client.  
  
**Merchant：**  
If you mean to retrieve the herb,  
you'll be taking a passenger carriage to a forest in the east.  
I'll give you this map as well. Here.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh...? Wait, hold it. Isn't this...  
  
**Merchant：**  
Ah, so you noticed?  
Impressive for an outcast like yourself.  
  
**Merchant：**  
Yes, it's the Elven Forest.  
That's why city humans, particularly ones like us, can't get near.  
The forest's guardians can easily sniff out our sordid scent.  
  
**Merchant：**  
But it's different for you, hmm?  
Tainted or no, you're still of their kind.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh. Tainted, am I...? Hilarious.  
  
**Merchant：**  
If you want to back out, I won't stop you.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Nah...  
I'm just questioning how easy it'll really be to get into that forest.  
  
**Merchant：**  
Hohoh...?  
Sounds to me as if you're not fully a part of \"our\" world yet.  
I'd consider turning back before you become truly tainted, young lady.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Mm... Well, thanks.  
But I'll decide that stuff for myself.  
  
**Merchant：**  
Do as you please. Your reward will come after the deed is done.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Whew...  
  
**Chloe：**  
What a drag...  
Where's my motivation today.  
  

---  
  
**Brother：**  
Huh~?  
Hey, Sis, where you going? There's no school today!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh... Well...  
 It's just... a little job.  
  
**Brother：**  
A job?! You do work on your days off?  
Wow, Sis, you're awesome!  
  
**Brother：**  
Hey, hey, what kind of job?  
Baking bread? Cleaning floors?  
Streaming content on the crystal net?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Hah... Well, something like that.  
Gotta go. See you around.  
  

---  
  
**Chloe：**  
Listen to me... Ugh, I'm the worst.  
Doing work I can't even tell my family about.  
  
**Chloe：**  
But y'know...  
I've gotta get Mom well again  
and see the little ones have a good life, right?  
  
**Chloe：**  
*sigh*...  
Soon as I graduate, I'll get a respectable job.  
  
**Forest Guardian：**  
Well, well. So today you have come to visit  
the land of your distant forebears?  
  
**Forest Guardian：**  
Then this is a happy day indeed.  
Please, think of this forest as if it were your own home.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, sure. Got it.  
  
**Forest Guardian：**  
Our dwellings are over yonder.  
On your return, please do drop by.  
Well then, enjoy your stay, distant cousin.  
  
**Chloe：**  
...And they're gone.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Whew...  
Getting in here really was way too easy.  
  
**Chloe：**  
And like, not even an escort?  
Have these forest elves *heard* of security?  
And they call themselves \"guardians\"?  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Well, guess it just means they really trust me.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Tainted, huh...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well then.  
 Hmm, where to start...  
  
**Chloe：**  
I mean, y'know.  
Not like I'm gonna find a rare and valuable herb  
lying around in any old patch of grass...

**Chloe：**  
...Hell. This is actually the one, isn't it.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ehhh~? Is it just me, or is it growing all over the place  
like some common-ass weed?  
Bottom-tier rarity? What is this, a Killer Pen?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Can you at least *try* to give me a challenge.  
This quest'll be done in two seconds.  
Not a trace of thrill or excitement about it.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pff... What now.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, nothing for it.  
Guess I'll just grab a few sprigs and head straight on back...  
  
**Chloe：**  
*sigh*...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh... Actually, I'm tired.  
Forget the quest! Lemme lie down a moment.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hi there.  
`Tag 1`

`image display end`  
**Chloe：**  
Uwaaaaghhh?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Wh-who's there?!  
I-I didn't pick a single sprig yet!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It's me, {player}.  
`Tag 2`  
**Chloe：**  
Y-you...?!  
Wha...?!  
 The heck're *you* doing here?  
  
**Chloe：**  
No, hold up. Can you *not* pop up right behind me like that.  
Made me straight-up squeal like some kinda baby.  
I oughtta sue you for demolishing my tough-girl persona.  
  
**Chloe：**  
...So? What *are* you doing out in this forest?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I got lost.  
`Tag 3`  
**Chloe：**  
Really. Again.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, how in the actual.  
This your hobby? You never hit the road without a blindfold, or what?  
  
**Chloe：**  
And, uh. Wandering into the Elven freaking Forest?  
That takes *actual* talent. Maybe you oughtta make a career outta this.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You out on another job today?  
`Tag 4`  
**Chloe：**  
Huh?  
Well... yeah. Pretty much.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  What kind of job?  
`Tag 5`  
**Chloe：**  
What *kind*...?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uhhh... Well. I'm, you know...  
 Just... gathering? You know, like, plants.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Decorative flowers?  
**Choice: (7)**  Veggies for cooking?  
`Tag 6`  
**Chloe：**  
Uhh, yeah. Decorative.  
Looks like this herb is *so* in fashion right now.  
Check it out, isn't it the prettiest thing you ever saw in your life?  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Nope, can't sell it. It's just a weed.  
The more I look, the less I can bring myself to care.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, uh, listen. It's *so* normal, that's what, uh, makes it art?  
Like, it radiates waves of sheer mundanity?  
Out with the dahlias, in with the blah-lias?  
 Ugh, kill me.  
  
Jump to tag 8  
`Tag 7`  
**Chloe：**  
Uhh, yeah! Cooking!  
Looks like this herb's got the most awesome flavor.  
Boil it, fry it, stick it in a pot. Works with any recipe you can name.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Wh-wha...?!  
{player}, hands off! Don't try to eat it!  
I can't have you turning to the dark side over a freaking salad leaf!  
  
`Tag 8`  
**Chloe：**  
Ugh... All right. You got me. I made all that up.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  What kind of job is it really?  
`Tag 9`  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, for the...  
Can you *not* do that? The innocent question thing.  
It's just gonna give me flashbacks to my little brothers again.  
  
**Chloe：**  
That look right there. The puppy-dog eyes.  
Yeah, there's a real resemblance there.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Those eyes make my heart clench up.  
  
**Chloe：**  
...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeah, that does it.  
Let's go, {player}.  
I'll show you back to Landosol. Follow me.  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Weren't you going to pick the flowers?  
`Tag 10`  
**Chloe：**  
Nope. Forget 'em. I'm done with all that.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Bit late to be saying this now, but...  
Doing work I've gotta lie to my family about... it's not right.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Watching you, I couldn't help thinking that. That's all.  
  
**Chloe：**  
So yeah, let's get outta here.  
  
**Narration：**  
Turning her back on the rare herbs,  
Chloe set out decisively along a new, brighter path.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Wait, huh?  
{player}, why aren't you following?  
What'cha crouching down there for?  
  
**Choice: (11)**  I thought I'd pick some of these as a souvenir.  
`Tag 11`  
**Chloe：**  
Don't you dare.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Hell no.  
Be a good boy and leave 'em be.  
Here, I'll give you a shiny Killer Pen instead.  
  
**Narration：**  
Confused by Chloe's stern objections,  
{player} found himself taking home a low-rarity item  
instead of the flowers he'd wanted to pick.
