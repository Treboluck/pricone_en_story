**Narration：**  
One day after school, Chloe is invited by her classmates  
to hang out on the streets of Landosol.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ahhh, that crepe was good.  
Well then. Gotta get to my next job.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, wait, not a job. \"Volunteer work.\" The paid kind.  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Chloe, thank you again for spending time with us today.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Mm... I don't mind hanging out whenever.  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
This was the first time I have ever experienced  
eating food out on the streets!  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Hee hee.  
What *would* my father and teachers think if they knew?  
Do you suppose this makes us proud delinquents too?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, don't look at me.  
I mean, I dunno, but if that's what you think, isn't that enough?  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
S-so cool...!  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Only we can define our own lives...  
 A true delinquent philosophy!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Seriously, I'm not a delinquent or anything.  
If you keep spouting this stuff, I'll sock you for ruining my reputation.  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Ahh! Wanton threats of violence!  
The very embodiment of delinquent culture!  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
I'm going faint!  
 How I've dreamed of this!  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
So cool...  
 My heart can hardly bear it...  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Ahh, to be punched by those fists...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uhhh...? Did I make friends with the wrong crowd?  
  
**Chloe：**  
All right, well...  
I've played hard, and now I gotta work hard.  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Not that there'll be much to do here till evening.  
  
**Chloe：**  
*yawwwn...*  
Oh yeah, will {player} show up today, I wonder?  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Uh-oh...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Crap, I'm nodding off.  
It's been so busy, I've been missing sleep lately.  
Guess I'll take a nap on my next break...  
  
**Chloe：**  
*yawwwn...*  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hi there.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chloe：**  
Myaaaargh?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
O-ohhhh...  
 It's just you, {player}.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Listen. For real.  
Can you quit appearing when I least expect it.  
You made me sound like some kinda squealing kitten.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Actually though, this is perfect.  
I've been kinda waiting for you to show up.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, wait. When I say that,  
 I don't mean in a weird way...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Look, about the other day...  
Y'know, when the teachers almost blew my cover here.  
You really saved my hide, right?  
  
**Chloe：**  
It's all thanks to you I'm not expelled right now,  
b-but then you just up and vanished, so I kinda never got to say...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Like, uhhh...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Hm? Wait, huh?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, hang on.  
Why am I feeling kinda nervous right now.  
  
**Chloe：**  
What is this?  
Even feels like my heart rate's climbing. This is *so* weird.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Wait, am I really getting... flustered around him?  
  
**Chloe：**  
No, that's crazy. Why would I do that.  
Just gotta say thanks and get back to work.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Hey, listen.  
About what happened the other day...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh? What's this light...?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Whoa, whoa, whoa, it's just growing and growing. What is all this...?!

**Hanako：**  
Hmm? Oh, {player}.  
  
**Hanako：**  
Whatcha doing here?  
You were only helping out that one week, right?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I came for a cup of coffee.  
`Tag 2`  
**Hanako：**  
Oh. Just a customer, huh.  
Then come on in.  
I'm heading off, so have a good one.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You're leaving early today.  
`Tag 3`  
**Hanako：**  
Uhh, yeah...  
 I'm cutting work short today.  
  
**Hanako：**  
See, thing is, I've been feeling kinda dizzy.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Are you OK?  
`Tag 4`  
**Hanako：**  
I'm fine.  
Honestly, I could still work no problem.  
  
**Hanako：**  
But soon as I mentioned it, my boss insisted I rest.  
\"If you don't go home right now, I'm not paying you.\"  
Like, is that kindness or just plain harassment, right?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'll walk you home.  
`Tag 5`  
**Hanako：**  
Eh?  
Uh, no thanks.  
You're kinda creeping me out there.  
  
**Hanako：**  
Seriously, I'm totally fine.  
I've just been slacking on my beauty sleep.  
  
**Hanako：**  
School, work, home... I've got a lot on my plate lately.  
Guess you might call it... overwork?  
Just gotta curl up in bed and snooze awhile.  
  
**Hanako：**  
Well, see ya. I'm off.  
We can talk... sometime in the game or whatever...  
  
**Hanako：**  
Whoa...  
 Sorry, I lost my balance.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Please let me walk you home.  
`Tag 6`  
**Hanako：**  
Creep alert...  
  
**Hanako：**  
Oh, fine, whatever. Tag along if you want.  
  
**Hanako：**  
Ahhhh...!  
This fresh air really hits the spot today.  
Just walking along's making me feel a lot better.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  You do look really good.  
**Choice: (8)**  You do look much better.  
`Tag 7`  
**Hanako：**  
Huh?  
Wh-where'd that come from? Creep.  
  
**Hanako：**  
And with that face? Such an earnest gaze...  
Stop it, stop it, you'll make me blush.  
I'm way more sensitive to that kinda stuff than I look, y'know.  
  
**Hanako：**  
Anyway, I get it.  
You just meant to say I'm looking healthier, right?  
D'you really gotta phrase it in such a misleading way?  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Hanako：**  
You think so too?  
Well, that settles it. My head's feeling clearer, to boot.  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Hanako：**  
Pff... Right, I'm good now.  
I'll head back, cook dinner, and study.  
Huh? Astrum?  
 Mmm... Think I'll pass today.  
  
**Hanako：**  
Oh yeah.  
 The other day, inside the game,  
you called me Hanako, didn't you? Can you *not* do that?  
  
**Hanako：**  
It's not like I don't *like* my first name or anything...  
It's a gift from my parents, after all.  
But like, I just think, y'know...  
  
**Hanako：**  
Isn't \"Chloe\" just... cooler?  
  
**Hanako：**  
Well, that's all. Thanks for today, {player}.  
This is far enough. My house is right near here...  
  
**Hanako：**  
...Oh. There're my little brothers.  
  
**Brother 1：**  
Ahhh! Big Sis is here!  
  
**Brother 2：**  
Yaaaay! Welcome home, Sis!  
  
**Hanako：**  
Uh-huh. Here I am.  
  
**Brother 1：**  
...?  
Hey, Sis, who's this guy?  
  
**Hanako：**  
C'mon.  
Have some manners and introduce yourself.  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Nice to meet you. I'm {player}.  
`Tag 10`  
**Hanako：**  
Uh, I didn't mean you.  
  
**Brother 1：**  
Nice to meet you!  
Thanks for taking care of our big sis!  
  
**Hanako：**  
Yeah... To be honest,  
it's more like I take care of him,  
 but whatever.  
  
**Brother 2：**  
Hey, Sis, you're early today!  
Yaaaay! Now we can play together!  
  
**Hanako：**  
Uhh... Yeah... I... guess.  
 Haha.  
What should we play today, then?  
  
**Brother 2：**  
Let's play tag!  
  
**Choice: (11)**  Don't you still need to rest?  
`Tag 11`  
**Hanako：**  
Well, yeah, but...  
How do I say no? I'm a sucker for those eager little eyes.  
I never get much chance to play with them...  
  
**Choice: (12)**  I'll be \"it,\" then!  
`Tag 12`  
**Hanako：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Choice: (13)**  Think fast, \"Big Sis\"!  
`Tag 13`  
**Hanako：**  
Myaaaargh?!  
  
**Hanako：**  
What was *that?!*  
Where d'you think you're touching—  
  
**Choice: (14)**  You kids are going down next!  
`Tag 14`  
**Brother 1：**  
Waaahhh! You'll never catch me!  
  
**Brother 2：**  
Hahah! Over here, slowpoke!  
  
**Hanako：**  
Ohhh, I get it...  
He's keeping them busy so I can rest...  
  
**Hanako：**  
Honestly...  
I thought he'd lost it there for a second.  
  
**Hanako：**  
Hah... What a laugh.  
Always the good guy to a fault, that {player}.

**Brother 1：**  
Hey, no fair! He just picked up a sword!  
  
**Brother 2：**  
Is that even allowed?! This guy's a demon!  
  
**Hanako：**  
Uh... On second thought...  
Is he just having the time of his life...?  
  
**Brother 1：**  
You demon!  
We won't lose to you, Dark Knight of Tagging!  
  
**Brother 2：**  
Yeah!  
You'll see we're not useless pushovers like our big sis!  
  
**Hanako：**  
Eh? Who you calling a pushover, brats?!  
  
**Brother 1：**  
Aaaaghh!  
Sis came back to life as a zombie!  
  
**Brother 2：**  
Ahahaha! You're not catching us today!  
  
**Hanako：**  
Hold it, you!  
Haha... Ahahahah!

`image display end`  
**Ameth：**  
Aaaand welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hmmm... Now that's a shocker.  
So that's what Chloe's like with her family.  
Just seems like a great big sister, doesn't she?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Just kidding.  
It's not really all that surprising at all, is it?  
  
**Ameth：**  
In that world and in this one,  
Chloe may like to act like a cynical rebel,  
but she's really just a kind, caring girl beneath it all.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, I'm sure even you  
figured that much out a long time ago.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Now, I guess I'll send you on back.  
You'll forget all this when you wake up,  
but still, be good to her. See you around.  
  

---  
  
**Chloe：**  
Mmnhh...  
Huh? I was asleep... When'd that happen...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh. So were you too, huh, {player}?  
Morning, I guess.  
  
**Chloe：**  
So, uh... what's the deal?  
Didn't something like this happen once before?  
  
**Chloe：**  
*sigh*... Suddenly snoozing on the job...  
Maybe I'm more tired than I thought.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Hmmm...  
If it doesn't seem too busy,  
maybe I'll see if I can leave early today.  
  
**Choice: (15)**  Let me walk you home.  
`Tag 15`  
**Chloe：**  
Huh? Why?  
I can get back just fine on my own.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh... but...  
  
**Chloe：**  
I've got this weird feeling...  
If I take you along, it might make my kid brothers happy.  
  
**Chloe：**  
So, uh... sure, why not.  
Will you drop by my place?  
  
**Choice: (16)**  Of course.  
`Tag 16`  
**Chloe：**  
Yeah? Well, thanks.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, and... one more thing.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Thanks a bunch for helping me out the other day.  
  
**Narration：**  
In the end, Chloe managed to thank {player}  
with a warm, natural smile.
