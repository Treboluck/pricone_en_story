## Subtitle: Chloe's Part-Time Pursuits: The Clothing Store
  
**Narration：**  
Chloe's search for an honest part-time job continues,  
and after a number of failed interviews, she finds herself  
serving customers at a youth-oriented secondhand clothes store.  
  
**Chloe：**  
C'mon in.  
What kinda clothes you looking for.  
  
**Customer：**  
Tell me, miss. I'm interested in this dress,  
but do you have it in a slightly bigger size?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uhh, sorry.  
 If you don't see it, we ain't got it.  
  
**Customer：**  
That's a shame...  
I like the design a lot, but it's just a bit too small for me.  
Hmm, let's see...  
  
**Customer：**  
Hey, listen.  
Do you think I could pull off this look, even though it's a bit tight?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uhhh... I dunno.  
 You can try, but for you I'd probably say  
looser clothes are a better match than tight ones.  
  
**Customer：**  
Huh?  
  
**Chloe：**  
And to be totally honest,  
that's not an easy design to coordinate with.  
You sure you can make it work?  
  
**Customer：**  
U...  
 ummm...  
  
**Store Owner：**  
D-don't worry, miss!  
With your pretty face, I'm sure it'll look stunning!  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Eheheh... Well then, take your time!  
  
**Store Owner：**  
...Chloe.  
Can you come over here for a moment?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Sure.  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Chloe, darling, *please!*  
  
**Chloe：**  
Something up, boss?  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Come on!  
Can't you think before you speak?!  
Our job is to make the customers happy!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uhhh... You mean like, suck up to 'em?  
  
**Store Owner：**  
I won't ask that much.  
Anyone can see that smiles and honeyed words aren't your style.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Not sure how to feel about hearing that,  
 but yeah. True.  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Now, listen.  
I'm not saying you need to change that gruff, casual attitude of yours.  
  
**Chloe：**  
I don't?  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Frankly, at a youth-oriented store like this,  
it can be a plus for the staff members to have some unique character.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ohhh. Makes sense coming from you. Mr. Unique himself.  
  
**Store Owner：**  
I'd love for this store  
to be a place where customers can drop in casually,  
like coming to visit a friend.  
  
**Store Owner：**  
But this is still a business we're trying to run here.  
Which means we need happy customers  
who'll purchase plenty of our products.  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Telling them to hide their body because it's too plump to show off  
isn't going to make anyone happy, is it?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, nobody said anything that blunt.  
  
**Store Owner：**  
You may as well have done!  
 Have some tact!  
Young ladies can be very sensitive to these nuances.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uhhh, well, guess you've got a point.  
My bad. I'll be more careful.  
  
**Store Owner：**  
...Why the dirty glare? Are you sulking now?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Not at all.  
You're totally right. I should've done better.  
The face is just how I look.  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Hmmm...  
I originally thought it might liven this place up a little  
if I hired a girl like you...  
  
**Store Owner：**  
But perhaps I should have looked elsewhere.  
In the end, maybe you're not really cut out for this line of work?  
  
**Chloe：**  
No, I've learned my lesson.  
I mean, I won't let it happen again.  
  
**Chloe：**  
I swear I can do this.  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Really?  
Well, if you're sure, we can try this for a little longer...  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Oh, look. A new customer is here.  
Chloe, darling, that's your cue.  
  
**Chloe：**  
On it, boss.  
...I'll be right with you!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hi there.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chloe：**  
Really.  
You again.  
Is this just a thing now?  
  
**Chloe：**  
So what're you here for?  
This is a ladies' clothing store.  
Should I assume that's what you're, uh, into?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Like, if that's really your thing, I'm not gonna judge.  
Men's clothes, ladies' clothes, it's all just labels at the end of the day.  
Long as you're not being a suspicious creep, you go for it.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Even so, I gotta ask.  
What're you doing here?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I got lost.  
`Tag 2`  
**Chloe：**  
Of course. Yup, saw that one coming.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Is this where you work now?  
`Tag 3`  
**Chloe：**  
Yep.  
Though it might not be for much longer.  
  
**Chloe：**  
I mean, it's no biggie.  
I never planned on sticking to just one job,  
so I can always find another.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You seem kind of down.  
`Tag 4`  
**Chloe：**  
Well... I guess?  
I just got kinda chewed out.  
Told I'm not cut out for this job.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ugh, what a drag.  
Guess this is what I get for trying to put the customer first.  
  
**Chloe：**  
I mean, like, from their perspective.  
They're trying to pony up a big wad of their hard-earned cash  
for some clothes that'll make them look good, right?  
  
**Chloe：**  
So if I just butter them up  
till they buy something that's not for them,  
isn't that kind of cruel?  
 At least, I thought so.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  You're a kind person.  
`Tag 5`  
**Chloe：**  
Hah, you think? If that was really true,  
would I get told I'm doing this whole thing wrong?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Still, thanks, I guess.  
You just made me feel a bit better about myself.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pff... Right, that's that. Back to work.  
  
**Chloe：**  
In the first place,  
I guess it's up to the customer to decide what suits them.  
Dunno why I bothered trying to give my own opinion.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh yeah, did you say you're lost?  
I'm on a break soon, so hang on a sec.  
I'll show you the way back to the main streets...  
  
**Customer：**  
Sorry, do you have a moment?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, you again.  
 What's up.  
  
**Customer：**  
Um, listen. I'm not sure what's best myself,  
so I was wondering if you could help me choose a few items.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh? I mean, sure, but why?  
  
**Customer：**  
'Cause you seem trustworthy.  
If something doesn't suit me, you won't mince words!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uhhh, well, I...  
 Sorry 'bout that.  
  
**Customer：**  
No, no, it's totally fine!  
  
**Customer：**  
I was a bit shocked back there,  
but I'd rather hear it now than regret buying it afterwards!  
I really appreciate the honesty!  
  
**Customer：**  
Oh, right!  
 Is it okay if I ask your name?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, I'm Chloe...  
  
**Customer：**  
Thanks, Chloe. I hope we can get along!  
  
**Chloe：**  
S-sure.  
...Uh, I mean, sounds great.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh...  
 Actually, hang on. Wait here a sec.  
We've got something I think would look great on you.  
Lemme grab it real quick.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uhhhh, I think it was around here...  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Chloe, darling. I saw all that.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh... Boss...  
Uh, listen, don't worry.  
I'll be more careful what I say this time.  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Well, yes.  
It would be nice if you could keep our sales in mind as well.  
  
**Store Owner：**  
But... I take back what I said.  
I'm sorry.  
It looks like you're a good fit for this job after all.  
  
**Store Owner：**  
I hope I can keep counting on you,  
 Chloe, darling.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh?  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Now, hurry on back!  
We can't keep our customers waiting!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, right. Thanks, boss.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  You look happier now.  
`Tag 6`  
**Chloe：**  
...Heheh...  
  
**Narration：**  
As Chloe went back to work feeling ready to face anything,  
{player} watched over her with a smile on his face.
