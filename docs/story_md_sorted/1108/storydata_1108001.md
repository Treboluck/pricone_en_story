## Subtitle: Chloe's Part-Time Pursuits: The Tavern
  
**Narration：**  
Our scene: a small, dingy tavern on the outskirts of Landosol.  
Infamous among locals as a den of no-good ruffians,  
most prefer to keep their distance from the Mad Goat's Horns.  
  
**Narration：**  
Amidst the raucous cries of grown, drunken men making merry,  
a single teenage girl, quite out of place in this sordid setting,  
is serving the venue's customers with a most dispassionate air.  
  
**Chloe：**  
'Sup. Here's your order.  
  
**Chloe：**  
There. One spicy-ass dish of some kinda meat.  
And one bowl of veggie goop.  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Ehhh? When'd I order this?  
Oi, Chloe, you sure you ain't gotten this menu mixed up?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Nope. Doubt it.  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Chloe! Givvus more booze over here! I need the good stuff!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Whoa there, mister.  
Aren't you already on your fifth pint?  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Bah! So what if I am?!  
I ain't such a stinkin' lightweight  
I need a brat worryin' about me!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, I don't care what you do to your liver.  
It's your wallet I'm side-eyeing.  
  
**Chloe：**  
The tavernmaster here's a lunatic.  
When a patron can't pay, it sets him off ranting and raving.  
And us servers get the brunt of it. It's the worst.  
  
**Tavernmaster：**  
I heard that, Chloe! Who you calling crazy, eh?!  
You want me to slash your wages by ninety-ten percent?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
That's just called wage theft.  
Any court'd find you guilty in two seconds.  
  
**Tavernmaster：**  
Hah! As if you'd take me to court, Chloe!  
  
**Tavernmaster：**  
You ain't told your folks *or* your school you're workin' on the side!  
That's why you picked a shady, run-down joint like this  
where no one'll find ya!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, yeah. True facts. 'Preciate you taking me on and stuff.  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Whoa, whoa, hold it there, chief!  
You implyin' we do shady business in here?  
We'd never dream of wagerin' real money, would we, boys?  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Naw! We're just playin' a few nice, friendly games!  
'Course, we're generous folks, so on our way out,  
we might give the winner a big, fat cash prize! Gueheheh!  
  
**Chloe：**  
*sigh*... I heard nothing. Not a thing.  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
You said it! This is just a friendly game we're playin'!  
Which means... I don't gotta pay anyone if I lose!  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
...What was that?  
Hey, punk. You ain't gettin' any funny ideas  
about shirkin' on your obligations, are you...?  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Hmm? What obligations?  
 This is just a game, remember?  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Why, you...! I'll kill ya, you dirty piece of—!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ugh, again with the murder talk...  
Not that I care, but if you're gonna brawl, can you do it outside?  
  
**Tavernmaster：**  
Gahahah! Now that's what I like to see in my tavern!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, stop them.  
I'm not gonna do it, but you oughtta stop them.  
  
**Tavernmaster：**  
Now, my merry bunch o' louts!  
It's today's main event! Who's comin' out on top?!  
I'll take bets starting at 10,000 rupies!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Don't egg them on.  
Don't make money from this.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pff... Everyone here's wrong in the head.  
What a trashheap of a tavern. I can't even.  
  
**Chloe：**  
But somehow the patrons keep on coming...  
'Sup, how can I help ya.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hi there.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chloe：**  
Yeah... Hi.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Listen, we've got a bit of a situation here,  
so plates and bottles might come flying your way,  
but that's just business as usual for this place.  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Isn't this guy a little young?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Looks about as old as me, or  
 maybe younger?  
No way he's of age.  
What's a kid like him doing in this tavern?  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Well, not my business.  
God knows I can't be pointing fingers,  
and it's not like anyone else here's aboveboard either.  
  
**Chloe：**  
So? Mr. Dude? Why you just standing there?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I wanted to ask for directions.  
`Tag 2`  
**Chloe：**  
Eh? Can't hear you over the ruckus. What was that?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Actually, just take a seat.  
We can talk after you order.  
The bar fine with you?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Why's this guy seem so... spaced out?  
  
**Chloe：**  
He's clearly not used to places like this.  
Heck, I'd bet it's his first time.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Looks pretty upstanding... So, what?  
Did he have a fight with his folks and run out on 'em?  
Or maybe he's just playing the rebel... I dunno.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, he is a boy. They have phases like that.  
Hah, what a joke.  
Hope my little brothers won't end up like this in a few years...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Whatever.  
I'll just give him some non-alco booze and send him home.  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Hey, sonny.  
Ain't seen you before. You come from uptown?  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Your mommy gives you an allowance, right?  
We've got a fun game you should try! Come over and play with us.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, sorry, this guy's with me.  
You want a rube to scam, you look elsewhere.  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Oh...? Whazzat, Chloe? He your fella, is he?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ew. That's creepy.  
But sure, whatever.  
 Just beat it, 'kay?  
  
**Chloe：**  
C'mon, mister.  
You'll keep attracting attention if you stand around here,  
so come inside and take a seat already.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Thanks, boss girl.  
`Tag 3`  
**Chloe：**  
It's Chloe.  
And I'm just a part-timer. You?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'm {player}.  
`Tag 4`  
**Chloe：**  
Huh. Is that right.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, have this. First one's on me.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  What is it?  
`Tag 5`  
**Chloe：**  
Dark Forest Ether.  
A recipe passed down in my elf tribe.  
Guess you'd call it a... herbal cocktail?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, uh... not that my tribe's even around anymore.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  What do you mean?  
`Tag 6`  
**Chloe：**  
Mm... From what I heard,  
our forest home was ruined in some big disaster?  
So we wound up scattered across the world.  
  
**Chloe：**  
'Course, when I was born, we were already outcasts.  
I've always lived among humanfolk.  
Never knew all that forest stuff.  
  
**Chloe：**  
So really, that soft drink—  
sorry, uh, cocktail?—  
doesn't mean a whole lot to me personally.  
  
**Chloe：**  
But... I guess it's different for my mom.  
She always used to make it for me, see.  
Like, to remind her of home? Big feels and stuff.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Wow... the feels...  
**Choice: (8)**  Wow, this is good.  
`Tag 7`  
**Chloe：**  
Uh-huh? If you say so.  
Do you even know what that means?  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Chloe：**  
Yeah, not buying that.  
This stuff's just plain bitter.  
Or what, is your tongue busted?  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Chloe：**  
Well, either way. Thanks.  
You seem like a good guy. I guess.  
  
**Chloe：**  
So?  
Did you run away from home or what?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Not my business, but I'd suggest you head back soon.  
Trust me, a joint like this is no place for guys like you.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Not gonna say you should never break a few rules,  
but try not to do anything too uncool, OK?  
  
**Choice: (10)**  I want to go home, but I can't.  
`Tag 10`  
**Chloe：**  
Ahh... Well, I'm sure you've got your own problems...  
  
**Chloe：**  
And if you wanna be a rebel, that's your call.  
But you don't wanna make your folks worry.  
That's no good. It's super lame.  
  
**Chloe：**  
So yeah, time to head on home now.  
'Kay? Here, take 100 rupies for the ride.  
  
**Choice: (11)**  I don't know my way home.  
`Tag 11`  
**Chloe：**  
Eh?  
  
**Chloe：**  
You don't...  
 Wait, huh?  
So you're, what? Just lost?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ahhh... You came in here to ask for directions?  
Huh, figures...  
 So you're not even a customer.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Which means...? You're not some misguided rebel at all.  
Is that right. Huh.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pff...  
  
**Chloe：**  
I mean, it's fine! I'm the one who assumed!  
Not blaming you, but could you like, say something sooner next time?  
So I don't waste my breath.  
  
**Chloe：**  
And gimme back those 100 rupies.  
  
**Traveling Ruffian：**  
Dammitall!  
Try ta make a fool of me, will ya?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ahhh... There's another customer about to lose it.  
Listen, kid, I'd get outta here in a hurry if I were you.  
If you just head straight east, you'll see the main street—  
  
**Traveling Ruffian：**  
Hey. Got a problem, buddy?  
Whatcha starin' at?  
Think it's real funny that I lost all my cash? Do ya?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oookay, can you just not. Really.  
A grown man picking on an honest kid? That's just sad.  
  
**Traveling Ruffian：**  
Shaddup! Get outta my face!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ohhh boy. Property damage. Plus attempted assault.  
So far gone on booze, his eyes're blood red...  
Is this getting... y'know? Not-even-funny bad?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Hey, chief? What should I...  
 Wait, where'd he go?!  
  
**Traveling Ruffian：**  
Yo, girlie.  
Is this how this tavern treats payin' customers?!  
How you gonna settle this score, eh?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeesh, cracking his knuckles and everything...  
  
**Chloe：**  
What now.  
He's just a lousy drunk, so I could kick his ass in seconds...  
  
**Chloe：**  
But causing a big ruckus might attract the authorities.  
Any knight worth his armor'd shut this place down in no time.  
And I'd hate to lose one of my part-time gigs right now...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ugh, fine. Might as well just let him sock me one.  
When he sees what he's done, he'll snap right out of it.  
  
**Traveling Ruffian：**  
Ohhh~? Girlie, you've got some guts.  
Ready to take some punishment, eh?  
Well then! If that's what ya want...!  
  
**Traveling Ruffian：**  
Eat this!!!  
  
**Choice: (12)**  Leap in front of Chloe.  
`Tag 12`  
**Chloe：**  
...  
  
**Chloe：**  
...H-huh? I didn't feel a thing...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Wha—?!  
{player}...!  
Wh-why'd you... Are you OK?!  
  
**Choice: (13)**  It hurts, but I'll live.  
`Tag 13`  
**Choice: (14)**  I just... need to rest for a bit...  
`Tag 14`  
**Chloe：**  
Ahhh...  
Sure, you rest up.  
I'll take care of this punk.  
  
**Traveling Ruffian：**  
O-ohhh...? Why you glarin' like that?  
D-d'you still not get how tough I am?!  
I never lost a single fight back home! They call me Strongarm—  
  
**Chloe：**  
Shut it, buster.  
  
**Traveling Ruffian：**  
Wha... She vanished?! Wh-where'd the chick go?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Listen. You're way out of line.  
Think you can bash up my customers?  
  
**Traveling Ruffian：**  
Yeeaargh?!  
Wh-when'd she get right behind me?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
I said shut it already. No one needs to hear your squealing.  
  
**Traveling Ruffian：**  
Urghh... Who the hell *are* you?!  
Wh-what're you tryna do to me?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Settle the score, did you say?  
Those're your words, not mine.  
So sure, let's settle this.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Hold still. This won't take a second.  
  
**Traveling Ruffian：**  
W-waaaagghhh!  
I'm sorryyyyyyyyyy!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pff...  
What a loser.  
 Don't come back, dumbass.  
  
**Chloe：**  
You too, {player}.  
Like I said, you don't want to make your family worry.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Still... I guess I'll take one thing back.  
You're not as lame as I thought you were.  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Thanks.  
  
**Narration：**  
And with that, Chloe set about applying some ice  
to {player}'s red, swollen cheeks.
