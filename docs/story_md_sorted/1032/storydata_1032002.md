## Subtitle: Shopping for Dummies
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is out shopping one day when he bumps into Akino.  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, if it isn't Sir {player}!  
Thank you for your help the other day.  
I still intend to make you my knight, I'll have you know.  
  
**Akino：**  
But, I will stop trying to persuade you for the time being.  
After all, there are other matters that require my attention  
at the moment...  
  
**Akino：**  
I'm sure I mentioned that my father has told me to become  
\"an entrepreneur in my own right\", correct?  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, today I have been instructed to go shopping  
as the commonfolk do in order to learn more about society.  
  
**Akino：**  
Unfortunately, I'm at a bit of a loss...  
You see, I simply haven't the faintest idea of how  
ordinary people go about purchasing their necessities.  
  
**Akino：**  
Still, this *is* something my father has tasked me with,  
so I absolutely must see it through. Failing to do so  
would sully the proud name of House Wisteria!  
  
**Akino：**  
Say... Are you out shopping too, Sir {player}?  
Ah yes, I knew it!  
This is just perfect.  
  
**Akino：**  
I have a favor to ask, one that I believe suits you to the tee.  
If my method of shopping is not sufficiently \"common,\"  
could you please inform me straightaway?  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, so you accept!  
You are as reliable as the rising sun, Sir {player}.  
  
**Akino：**  
Now then, please take these two cards.  
One has an \"O\" written on it, and the other an \"X\".  
  
**Akino：**  
I ask that you accompany me as I go shopping,  
and if I do something a normal person wouldn't,  
please hold up the \"X\" card.  
  
**Akino：**  
I found these cards at a general store a moment ago,  
and purchased them thinking just such a situation might arise.  
You should know, I like to be prepared for every contingency.  
  
**Akino：**  
Well then, let us be off!  
  
**Akino：**  
We'll begin with this fabric store here.  
  
**Staff：**  
Welcome! We have everything you could possibly need.  
Are you looking for something in particular?  
  
**Akino：**  
I would like to purchase a tablecloth.  
  
**Staff：**  
Certainly. What size would you like?  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, dear me.  
I neglected to measure our table at home.  
It seems I don't have any other option...  
  
**Akino：**  
Okay then, I'll buy all of the cloth you have on hand.  
  
**Staff：**  
A-all of it?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hold up \"O.\"  
**Choice: (2)**  Hold up \"X.\"  
`Tag 1`  
**Akino：**  
I did it!  
My attempt to shop like a commoner was a resounding success!  
  
**Staff：**  
P-please, my lady!  
If you buy all of our stock, there won't be anything left for our other customers!  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh?  
Th-this isn't right at all!  
I must ask that you not play tricks on me!

`Tag 2`  
**Akino：**  
Oh? Are you sure you didn't choose the wrong card?  
That's the \"X\" card you have there.  
  
**Akino：**  
What? That *is* the right card?  
So what you're saying is I was doing something wrong.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Akino：**  
Well, buying the entire stock does admittedly seem like overdoing it.  
Please enlighten me: what would one of modest means do  
in this situation?  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, I see. So they'd buy a single large piece of cloth...  
In essence, they'd make a rough guess as to the size needed.  
  
**Akino：**  
We'll try some clothing next.  
My, this garment here looks very nice.  
I'd like to buy it.  
  
**Staff：**  
Thank you very much.  
I'll just need to take your measurements here  
so we can get the size right.  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, there's no need for that. I'll take every size you have.  
You see, I'm still quite young, so if I have all the sizes,  
I can wear my new purchases no matter how much I grow.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Hold up \"O.\"  
**Choice: (5)**  Hold up \"X.\"  
`Tag 4`  
**Akino：**  
Prepare now, profit later, as they say!  
I impress even myself at times!  
I knew my sense was in tune with that of the masses.  
  
**Child Passing By：**  
Mamaaa, I want some new clothes!  
  
**Mother Passing By：**  
But I just got you some!  
You grow and grow, and here we are.  
New clothes time. Don't forget that we don't exactly  
have rupies spilling out of our pockets.  
  
**Akino：**  
...What?  
Why, did you just give me the wrong answer intentionally?  
P-please take this seriously!

`Tag 5`  
**Akino：**  
At any rate, I assume the right choice here  
is to buy only the size that fits me, correct?  
Such an idea never would have crossed my mind!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Akino：**  
It appears that purchasing even a single garment  
is a weighty decision for those of humbler backgrounds.  
  
**Akino：**  
Let us move on to this fruit stand.  
I'd like to pick up a few of my father's favorite fruits.  
  
**Staff：**  
Hello there!  
We sell only the finest produce.  
  
**Akino：**  
My, this is quite the selection you have here.  
But I can't tell their taste by sight...  
Oh, I know! I'll take a test bite from each one!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Hold up \"O.\"  
**Choice: (8)**  Hold up \"X.\"  
`Tag 7`  
**Akino：**  
As if it could be any other way!  
You can't tell if a fruit is sweet or not unless you taste it.  
A fine example of working-class wisdom, I must say!  
  
**Staff：**  
Uh, miss? Can you please not do that?  
Otherwise I'm going to have to ask that you buy  
everything you eat!  
  
**Akino：**  
My word, you don't give out free samples?!  
Sir {player}!  
I-I'm counting on you to advise me properly!  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Akino：**  
You can't be serious! I have to buy anything I sample?!  
I never knew shopping was this involved...  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Akino：**  
Well, I'd say that is enough shopping for today.  
Thank you very much for your assistance, Sir {player}.  
  
**Akino：**  
Shopping as a commoner would is quite challenging.  
But, thanks to you, I was able to see the task through.  
Nothing less from the leading candidate for my personal knight!  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, I have an idea! If you would prefer not to be a knight,  
perhaps I can hire you on as an adviser who shadows me  
and raises the \"X\" card whenever I'm mistaken!  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, what do you think?  
Aren't you positively excited to work for me now?  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Hold up \"X.\"  
`Tag 10`  
**Narration：**  
{player} raised the \"X\" card faster than anything he'd ever done in his life.
