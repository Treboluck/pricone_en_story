# Akino Episode 4
Akino plays baseball with {player} and some children in a dream shown by Ameth. Despite her shaky grasp of the rules, Akino thoroughly enjoys herself. So much so that, upon awakening, she vows to bring baseball to Landosol.
  
## Subtitle: Play Ball!
  
**Narration：**  
{player} finds Akino on the streets of Landosol,  
shopping at a general store.  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, Sir {player}!  
Fancy meeting you here.  
It's wonderful to see you.  
  
**Akino：**  
What am I up to, you ask?  
Oh, just purchasing a few essentials for my guild,  
the Mercurius Foundation!  
  
**Akino：**  
And what kind of things am I buying, you ask?  
Well you see, this vase...  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, the vase... Why is it glowing?  
  
**Akino：**  
The light; it's so bright! Ah, aaahhhh!  
  

---  
  
**Boy：**  
Look out, it's a fly ball!  
  
**Akino：**  
That looks like a lot of fun.  
  
**Akino：**  
...{player}. How long have you been there?  
How mischievous of you. It's only polite to say something.  
  
**Akino：**  
What has captured my attention so, you say?  
That game the children are playing over there.  
It seems most interesting.  
  
**Akino：**  
Baseball? Is that what it's called?  
Now where have I heard that name before...  
Ah yes, I believe Father owns a company of that sort.  
  
**Akino：**  
I see...  
You throw the ball, hit it, run...  
and then see who can amass the most points!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Want to see if they'll let us play, too?  
`Tag 1`  
**Akino：**  
What a splendid idea!  
Learning about working-class pastimes certainly won't hurt.  
Excuse me, you boys over there!  
  
**Boy：**  
Huh? Waddya want, lady?  
  
**Akino：**  
If you don't mind, can my friend and I join you  
in playing this \"baseball\" game?  
  
**Boy：**  
Baseball? Sure.  
But lady, is this your first time playing?  
Let's see if you can throw the ball first.  
  
**Akino：**  
So this is the ball they use...  
And do I go... like this? Hyah!  
  
**Boy：**  
Strike!  
  
**Boy：**  
Whoa! Gee, lady, you got a killer arm!  
  
**Akino：**  
Heheh. As it happens, hurling things as hard as I can  
with little thought is a specialty of mine!  
  
**Boy：**  
Okay, let's see ya swing a bat now!  
  
**Akino：**  
Very well. Hm, it appears I might be quite good at \"baseball.\"  
Now I'll show you I'm just as skilled at swatting things away!  
So I hold the metal club like... this.  
  
**Akino：**  
Right, whenever you're ready!  
  
**Akino：**  
...Hah!  
  
**Boy：**  
Um, lady... That bat wasn't even close  
to hitting the ball!  
  
**Boy：**  
Yeah, you suck at batting.  
  
**Akino：**  
W-well, that ball was moving! It's nothing like pitching at all!  
You can't expect me to do something so difficult!  
Say, how about you set the ball right there and I try again?  
  
**Child 1：**  
Lady, that'd make this golf, not baseball!  
Ah, whatever. Hey, guys, we got some more players,  
so how about it? Let's play a game!  
  
**Akino：**  
I heartily agree!  
  
**Narration：**  
Everyone then moves over to a field  
and splits into two teams.  
  
**Akino：**  
Heheheh, it's reassuring having you on my team, {player}. Victory is all but certain!  
  
**Akino：**  
By the way, who might you be, good sir?  
  
**Referee：**  
Oh, I just coach these kids as a hobby.  
If it's all right with you, I'll be the umpire today.  
  
**Akino：**  
Interesting...  
This really seems to be a beloved sport among the commonfolk.  
Well, all the more reason to give it my all!  
  
**First Child：**  
I'm Tetsuto, our top batter!  
C'mon, show me whatcha got! I'll knock it out of the park!  
  
**Akino：**  
Hyah!  
  
**First Child：**  
Whoa!! I couldn't even see that!  
Geez, lady, no mercy even for kids, huh?  
  
**Akino：**  
Never lose a fight, even if it's all in good fun.  
That's the motto of the Todo Family!  
  
**Boy：**  
Aw man! A big whiff!  
  
**Referee：**  
Out! That's three!  
  
**Akino：**  
I did it!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Nice pitching!  
`Tag 2`  
**Akino：**  
Thank you!  
{player}, let us share in our joy using  
what they call a \"high five.\"  
Heheheh!  
  
**Akino：**  
All right, I'm up to bat!  
  
**Ace：**  
Heheheh, think ya can get a hit off me?  
  
**Boy：**  
That's Ogawa, the best on our team!  
He's a power pitcher and throws a mean curveball!  
You don't stand a chance, lady!  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, we shall see about that!  
Come now, don't hold back!  
  
**Ace：**  
Hiyaaaahh!  
  
**Referee：**  
Striiiike!  
  
**Akino：**  
What the?! Um, excuse me, may I call a timeout?  
I'd like to speak to the umpire for a moment.  
  
**Referee：**  
Time!  
  
**Referee：**  
So, what gives?  
Why the timeout? You need to talk to me?  
  
**Akino：**  
Was that really a strike just a moment ago?  
  
**Referee：**  
Uh, well it sure looked like one...  
A-are you disputing my call?!  
  
**Akino：**  
Would 500,000 yen change your mind?  
  
**Referee：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Akino：**  
Call every pitch I miss a ball,  
and I'll give you the same amount each time.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Don't disrespect the game like that!  
`Tag 3`  
**Akino：**  
But winning is all that matters! ...  
I'm rigging the game?  
Involving money with people in the game is against regulations  
in baseball, too?  
And here I thought it was such a good idea.  
  
**Narration：**  
The game moves on to the final inning.  
It's now the bottom of the 9th,  
and Akino's team is down by one run.  
  
**Boy：**  
Hey there, lady, you haven't gotten a single hit today!  
Once you strike out again, it's game!  
  
**Akino：**  
Last inning, two outs... There's a runner on base,  
so a home run would win it for us.  
But if I don't manage to hit it, it's all over...  
  
**Akino：**  
You must hit a home run...  
If you don't, that means you lose, Akino Todo!  
  
**Ace：**  
Hahaha, she's shaking like a leaf.  
Time to finish her off with my breaking ball.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Don't think, just swing!  
`Tag 4`  
**Akino：**  
O-oh! Yes, {player}...  
You're absolutely right! Not thinking too hard is what I'm best at!  
Hiyaaaahh!  
  

---  
  
**Ace：**  
What the?! N-no waaay!  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh my goodness!  
I did it! I actually did it!  
  
**Akino：**  
And I owe it all to you! I cannot express my gratitude enough!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Um, you're squeezing the life out of me.  
`Tag 5`  
**Akino：**  
Huh?  
Eep!  
  
**Akino：**  
A-a thousand pardons...  
That was most untoward of me.  
  
**Akino：**  
Yes?  
  
**Boy：**  
Well, I got the ball...  
and now I'm gonna tag ya!  
  
**Referee：**  
Youuu're out!  
That's the game!  
  
**Akino：**  
Whaaaat?!  
  
**Boy：**  
It wasn't a home run, so play kept going.  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh no...  
But that means *I* lost.  
  
**Akino：**  
But I haven't a single regret!  
I played with everything I had in me!  
  
**Akino：**  
And this \"baseball\"... It's nothing short of fantastic!  
Let's play again together sometime! Please, {player}!  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Okay, and that's a wrap.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Wow, baseball, huh? Looked like you all had a great time.  
  
**Ameth：**  
All the joy and sadness of life bottled up in a single sport.  
How dreamy! Maybe I'll give it a go, too...  
Heheh.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just saw now was akin to a dream.  
You'll most likely forget it all as soon as you wake up,  
so don't let it worry you too much.  
  
**Ameth：**  
If you can bring me even more Memory Shards,  
I have more dreams like this to show you.  
Don't go slacking off, now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyways, catch you later! ♪  
  

---  
  
**Akino：**  
Huh... Is this... Landosol?  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, did you see the same dream as I, Sir {player}?  
  
**Akino：**  
How very puzzling...  
Still, I have to admit that \"baseball\"  
was a truly amusing diversion.  
  
**Akino：**  
That's it!  
We shall bring \"baseball\" to the people of Landosol!  
And once we do, the future will be a home run!  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} looked on at an exuberant Akino, a smile on  
his face. As for whether Landosol actually got its  
own baseball league, that's a story for another day.
