**Narration：**  
One day when {player} and Akino  
are out on the town...  
  
**Akino：**  
Sir {player}, I would like to observe how the commoners dine,  
so how about we get some cake at that cafe?  
  
**Ruffian：**  
We're in luck boys. There she is!  
Hey, get the rope! We'll tie her up and haul her off!  
  
**Akino：**  
Wh-what is the meaning of this?  
Who are you people?!  
  
**Minion：**  
Shut it, missy!  
Just be a good girl and come along quietly!  
  
**Akino：**  
Eeek!  
  
**Akino：**  
To think I could be kidnapped so easily...  
It all happened so quickly. I completely let my guard down.  
  
**Akino：**  
...And they took you as well.  
Physical altercations have never been your strong suit, though,  
so I suppose it can't be helped.  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Hey, girly!  
Yer Old Man Wisteria's daughter, ain'tcha!  
Geheheh, we're gonna get a nice, fat ransom for you!  
  
**Akino：**  
I see, so that's what this is all about.  
It's money you men are after, is it?  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Yeah, 'course it is! With enough rupies, we can do  
whatever we want! And I'm sure your dear old pops  
will fork over anything in exchange for his baby girl's life.  
  
**Akino：**  
If that's all you want, then there's no need to bring  
my father into this. I can pay you myself.  
  
**Ruffian：**  
What, the person we kidnapped is gonna pay their own ransom?  
  
**Akino：**  
I'm quite wealthy in my own right, I'll have you know.  
If rupies can buy my safety, then I will gladly give you  
what you ask.  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Man, you rich jerks sure know how to spend money.  
Okay then, girly, ya got yerself a deal.  
We're gonna need enough loot to live on easy street forever.  
  
**Akino：**  
Very well.  
I don't have enough with me right now,  
but I can go get the rest from the manor. Is that acceptable?  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Yeah, no problem. We'll let *you* go.  
See, I'm cuttin' yer ropes now.  
  

---  
  
**Akino：**  
Phew. Free at last.  
Can I get you to undo his bonds as well?  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Whoa now, that ain't happenin'.  
He's our collateral. You could be pretendin' yer gonna pay,  
and then pull a runner or call for help if we let ya both go.  
  
**Minion：**  
You so much as *think* of tryin' anything funny,  
and lover boy here starts losin' digits.  
  
**Akino：**  
But I can't leave my friend behind in such a perilous situation.  
You must set us both free.  
Otherwise, you won't see a single rupie.  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Yer pretty lippy for someone who just got kidnapped!  
I think it's time we helped ya understand yer situation here!  
  
**Akino：**  
That you're so quick to turn to violence gives me cause to  
question your integrity. If you think brandishing your weapon  
at me like that frightens me, you're—  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Awright, that's enough outta you!  
Ya obviously ain't gettin' how all this works,  
so I'm gonna have to teach ya!  
  
**Akino：**  
Eek!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Intervene.  
`Tag 1`  
**Akino：**  
Sir {player}?!  
Ahh! Oh, oh no...!  
Were you trying to save me?!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Heh, a wannabe hero, huh?  
Anyway, I think ya get the picture now.  
Ya do as we say, or el—  
  
**Akino：**  
Silence.  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Nh...? Wh-what?  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, you've certainly gone and done it now.  
I planned on keeping this civil if money was all it took,  
but now that you've harmed my knight, I won't go so easy!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
H-hey, stop right there!  
Don't make me get nasty!  
  
**Akino：**  
Funny, I was going to say the same thing!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Gyeeaargh!!  
  
**Minion：**  
B-Boss?!  
D-damn, she sure don't fight like a rich girl!  
  
**Akino：**  
I'm not letting you off the hook, either!  
Prepare yourselves! Haaah!  
  
**Minion：**  
Gyaaah!  
I'm sorry! Please spare me!  
  
**Akino：**  
Sir {player}! Have you come to?  
I turned those brigands over to Nightmare.  
  
**Akino：**  
How is your wound?  
The bleeding doesn't seem too severe.  
Well, I'm relieved it isn't life-threatening.  
  
**Akino：**  
Still... I wish you hadn't been forced to witness that  
unsightly bit of business back there...  
  
**Akino：**  
I simply could not bear to see you mistreated so.  
My desire to keep you safe  
caused me to fly into  
an absolute frenzy.  
  
**Akino：**  
Has seeing me in such a violent state  
tarnished your opinion of me?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It was reassuring, actually.  
**Choice: (3)**  Thanks for saving me.  
`Tag 2`  
**Akino：**  
Me? Reassuring?  
Heheh, it pleases me to hear you say so.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Akino：**  
Sir {player}...  
It's not often I hear such words from you.  
  
**Akino：**  
Normally it is I who always relies upon your aid,  
so it gladdens me to be able to return the favor.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Akino：**  
What's that?  
If I'm so strong, then maybe I don't need a knight, you say?  
  
**Akino：**  
I see you don't understand.  
Strength is not a knight's only redeeming quality.  
  
**Akino：**  
He must also be ever-attentive to the care and needs of those  
around him, and, most importantly, have a resolute heart.  
  
**Akino：**  
The way you shielded me without hesitation...  
That was truly the act of a knight without peer.  
  
**Akino：**  
Mark my words.  
One day, I *will* earn your services as my gallant knight!  
  
**Akino：**  
But I think we've had enough excitement for today.  
Let us both be heading home.  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh? Is there something still on your mind?  
What, about how I referred to you as \"my gallant knight\"?  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, er...  
That was just a slip of the tongue!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus a failed abduction served to bring  
the two of them closer together.
