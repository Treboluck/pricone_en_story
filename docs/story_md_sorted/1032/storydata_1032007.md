## Subtitle: A True Entrepreneur
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is out for a stroll  
when he finds Akino agonizing over something.  
  
**Akino：**  
Dear me... What am I to do?  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, Sir {player}. What a lovely surprise.  
Though I am sorry you've caught me in such a dreadful state.  
  
**Akino：**  
The truth is, something Father said to me has been troubling me  
for some time... Namely, what exactly did he mean by  
\"make a true entrepreneur of yourself\"?  
  
**Akino：**  
I've embarked on various ventures with my guild,  
all of which have proven quite profitable. And I've also  
overcome many hurdles with your help, Sir {player}.  
  
**Akino：**  
And yet, for whatever reason,  
well, I feel that I still haven't fulfilled his wishes...  
Oh, what will it take for me to be a \"true entrepreneur\"?  
  
**Young Man：**  
Hello there!  
Please, take one!  
  
**Akino：**  
What's this?  
He appears to be handing out leaflets.  
  
**Young Man：**  
Oh, hey there, m'lady!  
Please take one!  
  
**Akino：**  
Hmm... What have we here?  
It seems they're seeking sponsorship for a monster hunt.  
  
**Akino：**  
A beast has appeared in a valley and is blocking all passage.  
But the locals lack the funding to assemble a hunting party,  
hence their search for sponsors.  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, a threat such as this certainly can't be ignored.  
  
**Akino：**  
Putting money toward this hunt will likely put us into the red...  
and push me that much further from obtaining  
my father's approval.  
  
**Akino：**  
However, this is the very essence of noblesse oblige!  
Ignoring the plight of the commonfolk is simply  
out of the question!  
  
**Akino：**  
Never fear, I will be your sponsor!  
...No, that alone is not enough.  
I shall also join the hunt!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It'll be dangerous.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll help, too.  
`Tag 1`  
**Akino：**  
I'm fully aware of the danger.  
Nevertheless, I feel I must do more than fund it.  
Don't try to dissuade me.  
  
**Akino：**  
What? You aren't trying to?  
It'll be dangerous, and that's why you're going, you say?  
So you're going to help me!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Akino：**  
I had a feeling you would say as much!  
My faith in you as a knight is well deserved!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Akino：**  
With you beside me, I will have the power of one hundred men.  
We'll give this orc a thorough drubbing!  
You have my word! I will put an end to your monster problem!  
  
**Narration：**  
The hunting party Akino sponsors  
heads straight for the valley in question.  
  
**Monster：**  
Grraaarghhh!  
  
**Warrior：**  
There it is! The monster!  
  
**Akino：**  
Victory comes to those who strike first!  
I'll end this in one fell blow!  
  
**Akino：**  
Drat, I merely grazed it...  
  
**Monster：**  
Grraaarghhh!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Look out!  
`Tag 4`  
**Akino：**  
Th-thank you...  
You're timing couldn't have been better.  
Now, let's bring this hunt to a close!  
  
**Monster：**  
Graaarghhh!  
  
**Warrior：**  
Hurray!  
We got the monster!  
  
**Akino：**  
*huff* *huff* Victory is ours.  
What a relief.  
Wonderful work back there, Sir {player}.  
  
**Narration：**  
One week later—  
  
**Akino：**  
Why, hello there. What is that bundle of letters you carry?  
  
**Akino：**  
You're doing delivery work... Oh? And these are for me?  
They're thank-you letters for getting rid of the monster?  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, I see...  
Well then, I may as well look through them.  
  
**Akino：**  
...They, they really are grateful to me, aren't they.  
  
**Akino：**  
I was simply doing what felt right,  
and yet they shower me with such words of gratitude...  
I'm deeply moved.  
  
**Akino：**  
I'm sure their feelings were only redoubled  
by the fact that I personally took part in the hunt.  
  
**Akino：**  
This sense of accomplishment I feel now is priceless.  
I had no idea such feelings existed...  
  
**Akino：**  
...I understand now!  
I know what my father meant!  
  
**Akino：**  
The enterprise of a true entrepreneur lies not in making money,  
but in bringing happiness to the people.  
Am I wrong?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Agree.  
`Tag 5`  
**Akino：**  
Ah, so you feel this way too, Sir {player}?  
In that case, I must be correct!  
  
**Akino：**  
Today, I have taken another step towards true entrepreneurship.  
And I have you, Sir {player}, to thank for it once again.  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, can you not see your own contributions?  
Very well, allow me to enlighten you.  
  
**Akino：**  
Mixing money with personal relations  
makes it difficult to discern the truth.  
  
**Akino：**  
If, let's say, I had paid for your  
services as a knight at the outset...  
I may not feel as I do now, Sir {player}.  
  
**Akino：**  
So you see, it is all thanks to that noble spirit of yours  
that I have experienced such growth...  
Not to mention this new wonderful feeling inside me.  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh? Is there something still bothering you?  
  
**Akino：**  
What's the wonderful new feeling you ask?!  
You see... well... Th-that's a secret!  
  
**Narration：**  
Akino stumbled over her words,  
having almost let slip her innermost feelings.
