## Subtitle: The Path to Restoration
  
### Place: Elizabeth Park
  
**Narration：**  
Thanks to the carriage Tomo provided,  
{player} and co. have made it safely to Elizabeth Park.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Phew.  
This carriage journey was better than our last.  
We reached our destination without a single explosion.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am more than a little relieved.  
Of course, I should hope such explosions are far from ordinary.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
Sounds like you've had your fair share  
of excitement in your lives too, huh?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'd rather live a peaceful life...

`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Yep! You're absolutely right.Nothing beats a bit of peace and security!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So if you have any more problems,  
I'm always here to help, okay?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
After all, you listened to my story without mocking me.  
You believed what I had to say.  
It may not sound like much, but that meant the world to me!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh!  
It's so nice to have friends, don't you think?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please do not embrace me from behind, Miss Pecorine...!  
I can feel some heavy lumps of flesh atop my head,  
and it is a rather humiliating sensation...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh?  
Have I put on that much weight?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
My Royal Equipment consumes a ton of calories,  
so I thought I wouldn't need to be careful with my diet!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Still, I must say...  
It looks like Elizabeth Park  
is in a surprisingly good state, isn't it?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's almost like  
the monster attack never even happened!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Not exactly.  
There are evident burn marks in the bushes,  
and fallen trees around the area.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Rather than there having been no attack,  
I would say some shockingly efficient repairs have been made.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Of course, not everything can be restored  
to exactly how it was before.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But I am glad to see that it is more peaceful here  
than I had originally feared.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
There are smiles back on everyone's faces, too!  
It's amazing how strong-hearted farming folk can be!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Sorry, can I butt in?  
I'm afraid I still need to go on a few more supply runs  
between Elizabeth Park and the city.  
  
**Tomo：**  
So I'll be taking my leave for the time being.  
Though we covered the basics  
during our discussion on the way here...  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'd like us to get together again,  
so that we can really sit down and exchange information.  
If you don't mind, I'll book a restaurant dinner.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh! That does sound wonderful!  
I've heard rumors of a high-class restaurant  
where only staff from the palace can get reservations...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ah, well...  
That place only opens its doors  
to customers with noble status.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'm afraid I was born a commoner,  
so I'm not sure I'd have much luck myself.  
Still, I'll see what I can do.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Thank you so much!  
I really appreciate all this!  
The carriage journey here was a big help, too!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I guess even the members of Nightmare  
aren't all bad, after all!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Thank you.  
Jun and I have been doing our best  
to give our guild a good reputation.  
  
**Tomo：**  
We are theoretically meant to be defenders of justice, after all.  
We'll do all we can to help the recovery efforts here, too.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
You and me both! We're gonna do tons of helping out!  
Right, Tomo?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Thank you, Matsuri.  
If I'm completely honest,  
I'd rather not foist too much hard work on a child like yourself.  
  
**Tomo：**  
But we need all the help we can get right now,  
so your enthusiasm is welcome.  
  
**Tomo：**  
With Christina now in jail, a number of her close associates  
have defected from the guild in protest...  
  
**Tomo：**  
It's left Nightmare  
with scarcely half of our usual resources.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh?  
Christina?  
You mean that extravagant, overbearing lady?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
She was one of the people  
who got mixed up in that explosion with me...  
So she made it out safely, huh?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I mean, she did give the impression  
of someone who wouldn't die even if you killed her...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But did you say she was arrested?  
What did she do to get herself into that kind of trouble?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahh...  
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty  
to share that with outsiders.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Sorry about that.  
You know how our guild is.  
We have a lot of secrets to keep and regulations to follow.  
  
**Tomo：**  
If you're really curious,  
you might have more luck with an information broker.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Nasty old Christina...  
If she's been arrested, she must've been a bad guy after all!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I knew something wasn't right about her!  
I could tell it from the gleam in her eyes.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Let's not make hasty assumptions, Matsuri.  
I'm not about to claim that Christina  
is exactly a paragon of virtue...  
  
**Tomo：**  
After all, plenty of our knights are out of action right now  
thanks to the struggle she put up trying to evade capture.  
  
**Tomo：**  
That's one reason why we're so short-staffed  
that the work is falling to rookie knights like myself,  
and even apprentices like Matsuri.  
  
**Tomo：**  
In truth, we don't really have time to be helping other guilds.  
If anything happened at the palace now, we'd be in trouble.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Well... At least Jun is still around.  
I can't see anyone getting past her.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm...  
Sounds like this would be the perfect opportunity  
for someone to sneak in and take care of that \"impostor.\"  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha...  
Could it be I've said a little too much?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Just so we're clear,  
defending the palace is my guild's primary duty.  
  
**Tomo：**  
If you do try to attack the palace,  
you'll be facing my blade again.  
  
**Tomo：**  
And this time, I won't hold back.  
The techniques you saw today  
are just a fraction of what the Mikuma style has to offer.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes, yes.  
I won't do anything too hasty.  
I'd rather not fight good people like you if I can help it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And this *is* the royal palace!  
Its defenses must be tough!  
If I do mount an attack, I'll need to be well prepared.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Anyway, shouldn't you be going soon?  
It looks like the carriage driver  
is starting to twiddle his thumbs with boredom...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ah, yes! Thank you for the heads-up.  
I do lose track of time  
when enjoying a pleasant conversation with my elders.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Come along, Matsuri.  
There's still plenty of work to be done.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Yes, ma'am! When the people are in trouble,  
a hero's what they need!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...And off they go.  
What a funny pair of knights they were.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Not quite what you'd expect  
from a royal guild like Nightmare...  
Well, she did say she was born a commoner, huh?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Now, um...  
What shall we do next, {player}?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
First we need to find this Saren person  
and let her know we're all okay, don't we?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  We should tell the Elizabeth Park girls, too.  
**Choice: (4)**  I could do with a rest, first...  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh yes, they must be worried about us too.  
We did kind of run off and go missing, didn't we?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The sooner we can show them we're doing great, the better!  
They've got enough to worry about already with the farm,  
so it'll be nice to give them one piece of good news!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm?  
We got plenty of rest sitting in the carriage, didn't we?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You really are a weakling, {player}!  
Maybe some more training's what you need!  
C'mon, let's see some fighting spirit!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, wait...  
You didn't mean you need the bathroom, did you?  
Sorry, I can be so dense sometimes!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Honestly...  
What kind of a dummy am I?!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmmm...  
I have been looking around for Miss Saren,  
but I see no sign of her. Where could she be?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This farm is not a small place,  
and with all these people milling around...  
Finding a specific individual may be a little difficult.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If we could find a familiar face,  
we might be able to inquire as to her location...  
  
  
**Lima：**  
Hmhmhmhmmm~! ♪  
'Scuse me! Coming through!  
I need a bit of room!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh! I know that fluffy white-furred figure...  
Hey there! We met the other day, didn't we?  
  
**Lima：**  
Hmm?  
Oh, it's {player}!  
And you're... Pecorine, was it?  
  
**Lima：**  
Thank goodness!  
It's good to see you're both okay.  
We were so worried when we heard you were missing!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh!  
I could say the same to you.  
It's good to see you in such good spirits!
