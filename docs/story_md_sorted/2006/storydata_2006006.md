# Chapter 6 Episode 6
Mistaking Pecorine for a \"bad guy,\" Matsuri draws her blade in the name of justice—only to be stopped by Tomo, who offers to battle Pecorine in her stead. Pecorine struggles with their hotheaded assault.
  
## Subtitle: Knights of Nightmare
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aww... That's so cute!  
...Wait, did you say \"Nightmare\"?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hmm?  
You look unsettled by the sound of that name...  
Don't tell me... you're actually a bad guy?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Nightmare is a guild devoted to the pursuit of justice!  
Enemy to villains everywhere!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
If the sound of our name makes you tremble in fear,  
you must be a villain yourself!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ehmmm...  
Miss Pecorine?  
Are you involved in some manner of criminal activities?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Come on now, didn't I say already?  
I've got an official bounty on my head  
as a false pretender to the throne!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
They've got it all backwards, of course...  
But nobody believes me about that!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, yes.  
From the impostor's perspective,  
the continued existence of the real princess must be troubling.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
By putting a bounty on your head,  
she must have hoped that some bounty hunter  
might take you out of the picture.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
What are you two muttering about?  
I don't go easy on criminals, you know!  
You're under arrest!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But no, first I oughtta try for a peaceful solution.  
How's about you come quietly?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Waahh! This is all a mistake!  
Put that sword away—  
you could really hurt someone!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hmmm?! Don't try to run!  
Surrender and prepare to be taken into custody!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whoaaa?!  
How crazy is this?  
This kid's actually pretty strong!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm not about to lose to her,  
but this might get a little messy,  
so you two should stand back!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ohhh?!  
You're going to resist?  
A willing confession can reduce your sentence, you know?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Can't you listen?!  
This is all a mistake!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Honestly!  
If you keep being so cheeky,  
I might have to give you a spanking!  
  
**Tomo：**  
What exactly is going on here?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Oh, hey! Tomo! Talk about perfect timing!  
You gotta help me arrest these guys!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Um... Explanations, anyone?  
I'm not sure what's going on,  
but you're only an apprentice, so you can't arrest anybody.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Leave the dangerous work to the grown-ups,  
and get yourself to safety!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Grrr, quit treating me like a kid!  
I may still be young,  
but my love for justice is greater than any adult's!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Just move, would you?  
I need you to get behind me!  
This girl looks like she may be quite the fighter...!  
  
**Tomo：**  
You wouldn't be able to handle her.  
Leave this one to me!  
  
**Tomo：**  
I am Tomo,  
Knight of Nightmare!

**Kokkoro：**  
Allow me to assist, Miss Pecorine!  
Right now, they have you outnumbered!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'll fight, too!  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ummm...  
With all three of us together,  
we should be able to win this skirmish...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But if we injure either of these people,  
that really would make us criminals!  
They'd totally charge us with obstruction of justice!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Listen, could everyone just calm down?  
This really is a misunderstanding!  
I don't want to have to fight you!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Peaceful solutions are best!  
Right? Right?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh?  
Hardly words I'd expect from a villain.  
And it's true that I don't sense much ill intent from you.  
  
**Tomo：**  
But with Her Majesty bedridden, the situation is tenuous.  
We can't leave any potential dangers at large!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Taste the full force of my blade! Hiyaaahhh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whoa-oa-oa!  
This girl really is a toughie! How crazy is that?!  
  
`image display end`  
**Tomo：**  
Heh...  
If my abilities are enough to unsettle you,  
you'll have no chance against the rest of Nightmare!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Resistance is futile! This will be easier if you come quietly!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oopsie-daisy!  
I'm not letting myself get arrested  
when I haven't done anything wrong!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hang on, though. When knights from Nightmare  
talk about \"Her Majesty,\" that means the impostor, right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What was that just now  
about her being bedridden?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm...  
Maybe using that battalion-class spell took a lot out of her,  
so she's incapacitated while she recovers her energy?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That would serve her right,  
and if she's out of action, that's lucky for us!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll seize this chance and take back my identity!You just wait!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And that's even more reason  
why I can't waste time getting arrested! Hiyahhh!  
  
**Tomo：**  
...Whoa!  
Your blows are forceful, to say the least...  
  
**Tomo：**  
But they're all power, and no finesse!  
Such a brutish style is no match for my traditional techniques,  
honed over centuries!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Taste the true power  
of the Mikuma school of swordsmanship!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh...  
For such an outwardly cool customer,  
this girl's pretty hot-headed in a fight!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I-I don't think she's going to listen to reason!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Honestly! You're really starting to tick me off!  
I'll have you know I developed these skills hunting in the wild!  
They've saved my life from monsters countless times!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
My practical skills  
won't lose to tired old techniques that are just for show!  
  
**Tomo：**  
I like your attitude.  
This is starting to get rather fun!  
Heheh... I love the pure thrill of battle!  
  
**Tomo：**  
...Hmm?  
Hang on! Sorry, time out!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Forgive me if I'm wrong,  
but might you be {player}?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Um, yes, that's me?  
**Choice: (4)**  Never heard of him.  
`Tag 3`  
**Tomo：**  
Yes, I thought as much. Well, what luck!  
I've been looking for you everywhere.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Tomo：**  
Huh? Am I just imagining things?  
Sorry, could you let me get a better look at your face?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Heheh... We're so close I could lick your cheek.  
Kind of thrilling, huh? Your face has gone bright red, too!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Yes... You're a perfect match for the description.  
You *are* {player}, aren't you?  
Why were you playing dumb?  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Kokkoro：**  
What's this?  
Are you somehow familiar with my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Really, my lord, how do you do it?  
We have scarcely met a young lady  
who was *not* an acquaintance of yours...  
  
**Tomo：**  
No, no, we haven't met before.  
I just know his face from a second-hand description.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I see, I see...  
So you're the {player}  
I've been hoping to meet.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Thank goodness.  
I thought I would never find you.  
Believe me, I've been looking for quite some time.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'm very sorry.  
This may sound unreasonable  
after I initiated the attack, but...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Could we call a truce for now?  
I'd like to avoid fighting.  
There are some things he and I need to talk about.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmmmm...  
This isn't exactly a satisfying outcome...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But like I said, I don't want to hurt anybody either!  
If we can avoid fighting,  
that's for the best in my book.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But, um...  
What exactly do you want  
with {player}?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I know Nightmare  
is in direct service to that \"impostor,\" so...  
To be honest, talking with you isn't exactly appealing.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Well, aren't we unpopular?  
Hmm... \"Impostor,\" you say?  
How very intriguing.  
  
**Tomo：**  
If at all possible,  
I'd like to hear your story, as well.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Don't get me wrong.  
I'm not really the kind of brute  
who values fighting above all else.  
  
**Tomo：**  
If we can settle this with words, so much the better.  
Wouldn't you agree, Matsuri?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh?  
Oh! Yeah, totally!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hero's Code, Rule the Eleventh!  
Violence is never the answer!  
  
**Tomo：**  
I see.  
I'd like to think of myself as a hero of justice, too,  
so maybe I'll take that rule to heart.  
  
**Tomo：**  
You always do help us  
to remember the things that really matter, Matsuri.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? Wh-whaaa?  
 Geez...!  
You can't just toss out sudden compliments! It's embarrassing!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Heheh.  
At any rate...  
We can't stand around in the middle of nowhere all day.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Would you accompany me to a nearby teahouse,  
where we can have a nice civil discussion?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ummm...  
That sounds lovely and all,  
but I don't think we really have the time!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We're in a bit of a hurry.  
We need to get in touch with the girls from the farm!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ah.  
Then allow me to provide a carriage for you.  
  
**Tomo：**  
As it so happens,  
I came to the city to procure a number of supplies  
that are necessary for the rebuilding effort.  
  
**Tomo：**  
It would be no trouble at all  
to take you along on the ride back.  
  
**Tomo：**  
We can always have our little discussion on the road.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh! Well, that does sound kind of perfect!  
Or at least, it certainly works for me...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
How does it sound to you,  
{player}? Kokkoro?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I cannot object.  
Ascending the mountain on foot was quite a daunting prospect,  
so I would be most grateful for a carriage ride.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, I trust you also have no objections?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Sounds fine to me!  
`Tag 6`  
**Matsuri：**  
Ahahah!  
Well, this was kind of weird,  
but it's just like in the Tora Tiger stories!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Finding common ground in the midst of battle,  
and forging new bonds!  
Yesterday's foe is tomorrow's friend!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Eheheh.  
Sadly, real-world conflicts  
are rarely so simple or satisfying...  
  
**Tomo：**  
But that's a fine ideal to strive for.  
So I'll see what I can do to follow it!
