## Subtitle: One More Prisoner
  
**Muimi：**  
What do you say?  
Like I said before,  
Rajraj is pretty worn out right now.  
  
**Muimi：**  
If I don't transfer back soon,  
my path out of here will close.  
  
**Muimi：**  
So you'll have to make your mind up quick.  
If you're joining us, take my hand!  
  
**Muimi：**  
What's the hold-up?  
The last thing I want is to wind up  
stuck here in this cell with you!  
  
**Muimi：**  
I really do want  
to get you outta here, if you'll let me.  
  
**Muimi：**  
You may be a tyrant,  
sadistic, annoying, and way too heavy on the makeup...  
But you're not such a villain that you make me sick.  
  
**Muimi：**  
You're not so evil  
that you deserve to have your freedom taken away  
and rot in some gloomy dungeon.  
  
**Christina：**  
...You might just be  
the first person to ever tell me that.  
  
**Christina：**  
Very well.  
You've sparked my interest.  
I'll join you on this little excursion.  
  
**Christina：**  
Whether I'll stay your ally... depends on my mood.  
Is that good enough for you?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Ahahahahah!  
I never thought I'd be able to keep a leash on you  
in the first place!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Freedom's what you're made of, right?  
\"Regina Geas\"...  
Christina Morgan of the Seven Crowns!  
  
**Christina：**  
\"Seven Crowns\"...  
\"Regina Geas\"...  
Why do these words sound so strangely familiar?  
  
**???：**  
Oh, shaddup! Quit running your mouth in there!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Wahhh?!  
Wh-who was that?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh, yes...  
When they threw me into this dungeon,  
there was someone already imprisoned in the next cell over.  
  
**Christina：**  
I don't know if he's irritable or just stupid,  
but he can get awfully loud at times.  
  
**Christina：**  
This may be an impenetrable dungeon of no escape,  
but the walls between the actual cells  
are surprisingly thin.  
  
**Christina：**  
Sound seeps right through them.  
Would you believe I can even hear the big lunk snoring at night?!  
  
**???：**  
The hell was that?!  
Actually, who d'you think you're even yapping at  
in the first place?!  
  
**???：**  
You started seeing things in there?  
Having a little tea party with the fairies in your head?  
  
**???：**  
If you keep blathering on much longer,  
I'm gonna break through this wall and shut you up myself!  
  
**Christina：**  
Big words from a brute.  
Where does a lowly common thief  
get off addressing me in such a manner?  
  
**???：**  
Hah! Sorry if I'm not hoity-toity enough for ya!  
I'm a ruffian by nature, born and bred on the streets!  
  
**???：**  
And you want me to talk like some fancy-pants noble?!  
Maybe when pigs fart pixie dust!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Wait... Hold up a second.  
This voice... It can't be!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Daigo! Is that you in there, Daigo?!  
  
**Daigo：**  
Ehh?  
Who the hell told you my name?  
  
**Daigo：**  
Hahah!  
I knew I was a swell guy,  
but I didn't know I was famous!  
  
**Daigo：**  
But hang on.  
That voice doesn't sound like my dungeon buddy.  
What's going on here?  
  
**Daigo：**  
Have I been stuck in here so long,  
I'm starting to hear things too?  
  
**Daigo：**  
Or has my neighbor taken acting lessons  
and started playing two parts at once?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Sadly, I have no such charming hobbies.  
...Is he a friend of yours, Novem?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah...  
Hey, Daigo.  
I don't suppose you remember me, do you?  
  
**Muimi：**  
It's me, Novem.  
Back in Eternal Society,  
we used to work together, remember?  
  
**Daigo：**  
Ehhh?  
Eterna... what, now?  
Never heard of it in my life!  
  
**Daigo：**  
Keep your weird delusions to yourself!  
I've had no friends or family since the day I was born.  
All I've got in this world is myself!  
  
**Muimi：**  
I'm so sorry, I never knew...  
If you'd spoken a bit more about yourself,  
maybe we could have become better friends...  
  
**Muimi：**  
But that settles it.  
You've forgotten everything too, huh.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Even so...  
You and I were guildmates.  
I won't abandon you here.  
  
**Muimi：**  
One extra prisoner won't make too much difference!  
While I'm here, I'll break you out as well!  
  
**Daigo：**  
What was that?  
Somethin' about a jailbreak?!  
  
**Daigo：**  
I mean, heck...  
If there was any way out of this stinking place,  
I'd take it quicker'n you can say \"creepin' cockroaches.\"  
  
**Daigo：**  
But you think you can really do it?  
This is the palace's deepest dungeon of no escape,  
which no one's broken out of for centuries...  
  
**Daigo：**  
Trust me, I've tried punching these bars,  
and it didn't leave a dent!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hmmm.  
How about the wall between your cell and Christina's?  
It's pretty thin... isn't it?  
  
**Muimi：**  
If both of you attacked it from either side,  
don't you think you could bust through?  
  
**Muimi：**  
If you can make it over to this cell,  
I can get you out of here!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Worth a try, right?  
Give it everything you've got!  
Let me see what the world's strongest man can do!  
  
**Daigo：**  
Ehhh?  
You're not making a lotta sense,  
but I can't just back down from a challenge like that!  
  
**Daigo：**  
If you're standing near the wall, get back!  
I'mma demolish this thing!  
 Hyaaarghh!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Ooh, looking good!  
I can see cracks in the wall already!  
Keep up the good work!  
  
**Muimi：**  
C'mon, Christina,  
give the guy a hand, would you?  
  
**Muimi：**  
With one of the Seven Crowns  
and a Princess Knight who wields their power working together,  
there's nothing we can't do!  
  
**Christina：**  
Excuse me? Why should I take orders from...  
But actually, I *have* been itching for a chance  
to stretch my muscles.  
  
**Christina：**  
In the name of healthy exercise,  
I suppose I could briefly assist.  
  
**Christina：**  
Those fools were so proud of their impenetrable cell  
that they threw me in here complete with my sword.  
  
**Christina：**  
So let's see how this wall likes my blade!  
Try to match my timing, ruffian!  
  
**Daigo：**  
You got it, crazy lady!  
Heave-ho... And a hefty thwack!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Ooh! This is great! You two really are incredible!

**Muimi：**  
Thank goodness... Thank goodness you're okay!  
I know you don't remember a thing about me...  
But it's so great to see you again!  
  
**Muimi：**  
I never could find any sign of you anywhere...  
You were stuck in this dungeon the whole time, huh?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Were you OK?  
You're not sick or hurt, are you?!  
I hope you managed to eat properly!  
  
**Daigo：**  
What are you, my mom?!  
Seriously, the heck?  
Ugh... This kid throws me right off.  
  
`image display end`  
**Christina：**  
Hahah... Well, isn't this a charming reunion.  
But didn't you say you were in a hurry, Novem?  
  
**Christina：**  
I hope you're not going to lose track of time  
and wind up trapped in here with the both of us.  
  
**Muimi：**  
R-right!  
 You've got a point. We can do all this later!  
  
**Muimi：**  
First of all, let's get outta here! Sweet freedom, here we come!
