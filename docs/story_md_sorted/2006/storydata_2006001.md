### Place: Sarendia Orphanage
  
**Saren：**  
All right then, I'm heading out.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Good luck out there, milady!  
 And please, do be careful!  
  
**Saren：**  
Yes, I'll keep my wits about me.  
There's a lot we still don't know about the situation,  
so we need to exercise plenty of caution.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Uh-huh... Sudden explosions in the mountains aren't exactly normal...  
And they're saying the damage could be totally unprecedented...  
  
**Suzume：**  
What could have happened to cause all this?  
  
**Saren：**  
I don't know.  
I mean, that's what we're heading to investigate.  
  

---  
  
**Saren：**  
What we do know is that the location of the explosion  
was awfully close to the Elizabeth Park farmlands,  
where we were planning to evacuate the children.  
  
**Saren：**  
{player} was on his way over there  
to give them our regards,and we haven't heard from him since.  
  
**Saren：**  
It worries me, I'll admit.  
I only hope he didn't get caught up in the explosion or anything...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Right.  
From what little I've heard about the situation,  
it sounded like the farm was in an awful state...  
  
**Suzume：**  
So I guess we might need to  
put the evacuation plan on hold...  
  

---  
  
**Saren：**  
Even so...  
I was very grateful when they offered to help us out,  
so the least we can do is return the favor.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'll do as much as I can to support their recovery efforts  
and help them to rebuild.  
  
**Saren：**  
First, I need to head over there myself  
and get a handle on the scope of the situation.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'll let you know as soon as I learn anything,  
so be ready to open a communication channel at any time.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, absolutely!  
I think I should be able to handle that.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Communication magic is tricky, so I'm not great at it...  
but if there's anyone's presence I can always locate,  
it's yours, milady!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Caon is going to be providing support too,  
so I'll see if I can work with them to back you up!  
  
**Suzume：**  
But please, please, and I can't say this enough,  
do be careful out there!  
  
**Saren：**  
I know. You remember it was Maho from Caon  
who originally recommended this guild to us  
before the incident happened?  
  
**Saren：**  
Well, I think she's feeling guilty about how things turned out.  
She seemed very willing to work with us on this.  
  
**Saren：**  
Getting to know people can help in unexpected ways!  
There's plenty of kindness in this world if you only look for it.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, and aside from Caon,  
an acquaintance of mine is offering her guild's help, too.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh?  
An acquaintance...?  
Who might that be, milady?  
  
**Saren：**  
It's Akino, from the Mercurius Foundation.  
You've met her before, haven't you?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh! That rather extravagant young lady.  
You've been friends since you were both children, right?  
  
**Saren：**  
I wouldn't call her a friend, exactly!  
Just... someone who always likes to bother me.  
  
**Saren：**  
When we were at family parties,  
there weren't many other children our age around...  
So we somehow ended up playing together a lot.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Haha...  
So Miss Akino started a guild, huh?  
The Merry... Curie... Umm, what was it called again?  
  
**Saren：**  
The Mercurius Foundation.  
Apparently it was her parents that insisted she join a guild,  
so she could learn the ways of the world.  
  
**Saren：**  
Calling it a \"Foundation\" makes it sound very dignified and proper,  
but in terms of scale, it's like a small-to-mid-size company.  
  
**Saren：**  
They do all sorts of different kinds of work,  
mainly in the financial sector.  
  
**Saren：**  
I often get into bidding wars with them at the morning market.  
They've got some ace merchants up their sleeve,  
so their business sense is nothing to sneeze at!  
  
**Saren：**  
From what I've heard,  
Akino seems to quite enjoy working there, too.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, I see!  
Well, if this guild is good enough for Miss Akino,  
they must be trustworthy!  
  
**Suzume：**  
She's always been  
such an innocent and kind-hearted person.  
  
**Saren：**  
Well, I'm not going to say you're wrong.  
But \"simple-minded\" is more like it, if you ask me.  
  
**???：**  
Excuse me?!  
Did I just hear somebody speaking ill of yours truly?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Waaahhhh?!  
Wh-wh-what was that?  
D-did you hear that loud voice booming out of nowhere?!  
  
**Saren：**  
Speak of the devil...  
I do believe I recognize that voice. It's Akino herself!  
  
**Saren：**  
But didn't it sound  
like the voice came through the ceiling?  
Where in the world is she hiding?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Actually, don't you hear a weird sort of noise, too?  
Like the wind... But I don't think that's it.  
What could be making it?  
  
**Akino：**  
Come along, Saren!  
Get out here already, why don't you?  
  
**Akino：**  
Your very best friend in the whole wide world  
has brought a special vehicle to whisk you away in no time flat!  
  
**Saren：**  
A vehicle...?  
Has she chartered an express carriage  
or something of the sort?  
  
**Saren：**  
Well, that's surprisingly considerate of her.  
I wasn't exactly looking forward to hiking through the mountains  
in the wee hours of the morning.  
  
**Saren：**  
Well then, Suzume...  
This is all a bit sudden,  
but I suppose I'd better be going!  
  
**Saren：**  
I know I can count on you  
to handle things here at the Orphanage.  
Look after the kids for me!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Of course!  
They'll be safe and sound with me, milady!  
  
**Suzume：**  
We can't rule out the possibility of another Shadow attack,  
so some of the kids are still a bit scared...  
  
**Suzume：**  
But Caon has doubled its guard patrols and everything,  
so I'm sure we'll be just fine!  
  
**Suzume：**  
It's not like Shadows are all that strong.  
As long as we're ready for them, there's nothing to worry about!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Anyway, you should hurry and get going, milady!  
Miss Akino can get sulky when people keep her waiting!  
  
**Saren：**  
You're not wrong!  
Right, then. I don't think I'm forgetting anything...  
So I guess I'll be on my way!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Right! Have a lovely trip!  
And do try to get along with Miss Akino, milady!
