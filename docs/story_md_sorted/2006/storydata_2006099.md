# Interlude 7
In the interlude world in between stories, Ameth explains that Eustiana is currently unable to move after expending her energy on the spell of mass destruction, Labyrista is unconscious, and Pecorine really is a princess. She also speaks of the Seven Crowns, who are like gods in this world.

**Ameth：**  
And that's another chapter over. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Haha...  
Things were relatively quiet this time, weren't they?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Which is a relief for you, I'm sure.  
But after last time's barrage of crazy events, like the final  
chapter of a cancelled manga, it's a bit of a leap in tone.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But well, it's not to say that nothing happened.  
There were some rather important encounters  
and twists of fate which you weren't around to see.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Besides which, there's a good reason why things  
were peaceful for you this time.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It seems like your greatest enemy, Eustiana,  
managed to use up all her energy on that spell of mass destruction,  
so she's out of action until she can recover it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Meanwhile Labyrista, the leader of Labyrinth, is unconscious,  
leaving both sides of the conflict without their biggest players.  
They can't do much right now but glare at each other.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Which isn't to say you should let your guard down.  
You should use this chance to prepare for the next conflict.  
  
**Ameth：**  
At any rate,  
one of the biggest bombshells we should probably talk about  
is the true identity of your friend Pecorine.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You know, I was pretty shocked myself when I first found out!  
I always thought she seemed a little... unusual in some ways,  
but who'd have thought she was a real live princess?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh, just to be clear, her story is absolutely true.  
There's no doubt about it—she really is a princess.  
Sounds crazy, I know, but sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But right now, her position has been stolen  
by the enemy we know as Eustiana.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I don't know what techniques she used exactly  
to pull off such a feat...  
  
**Ameth：**  
But this is far from the first time  
Eustiana has meddled with the rules of the world itself.  
She's even stolen other people's lives before.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So I can only presume this time is essentially no different.  
  
**Ameth：**  
If you want to fight back and restore Pecorine to her rightful place,  
you'll need the help of someone else with divine powers.  
Because your enemy is clearly breaking the natural order.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Using miracles that only a god should be able to achieve  
to do whatever she pleases in this world.  
And the only way to stop a god is with another god.  
  
**Ameth：**  
There's a name given to this world's gods—the \"Seven Crowns.\"  
So your job is to try to track down those Seven Crowns  
and convince them to fight on your side.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You've actually met a few of the Seven Crowns already.  
So the task of finding them shouldn't be all that difficult.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The only thing is...  
Your enemy must also see the Seven Crowns as a major threat,  
so she'll surely go after them too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's probably the reason why she used that massive spell—  
to eliminate multiple Seven Crowns at the same time.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's right.  
There were multiple Seven Crowns at the scene of that nightmare.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And right now, they all seem to have gathered at Labyrinth.  
So, making contact with Labyrinth would be a wise move.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh, and that Neneka girl you heard about? She's a Crown too.  
I don't know where exactly, but she's clearly somewhere in this world,  
so it's worth looking for her if you have the chance.  
  
**Ameth：**  
For a little while, though, I suppose you'll still be busy  
helping with the repairs at the farm.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Yes, that's right.  
You'll be helping out at Elizabeth Park for a while yet.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So good luck with that!  
It's a fine job which will enrich the lives of a lot of people.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And kindness to others is always rewarded eventually.  
That's your own brand of justice, and your greatest strength.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Memories or no memories, that part of you has never changed.
