## Subtitle: Nest of Monsters
  
**Pecorine：**  
So, um...  
With everything that's going on, it's hard to keep up,  
but what do you think our next move should be?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We're not going to be much use if we stick around here,  
so maybe we could go help with the monsters?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If they're tasty-looking monsters,  
we might be able to make a meal out of them afterwards!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
After a disaster,  
you need all the sources of sustenance you can get!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Haha...  
With you, Miss Pecorine,  
somehow everything comes down to food.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well, my lord, shall we accompany her?  
After coming all the way here, it would be a shame  
not to help these fine people in their hour of need.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Wait, huh?  
{player}! It's you!  
So you're all right! Thank goodness!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Good to see you too, Yukari.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm?  
May I take it you are acquainted with  
this young lady also, my lord?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, yes.  
For some reason or other,  
we seem to bump into each other a lot lately.  
  
**Yukari：**  
...Wait, hold on.  
You're... an elf, aren't you?  
I don't suppose... we've met before?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I doubt it.  
The community I call home has little contact  
with the elves of this region.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My father is the elder of a tribe far north of here.  
You may call me Kokkoro.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Whaaa?! You're an elder's daughter?! That's a big deal!  
Ummm, what was the proper etiquette again...?  
  
**Yukari：**  
M-My most humble greetings and respects unto you,  
esteemed cousin from a distant land...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Haha...  
Please, there is no need for such formalities.  
You are a very courteous individual.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, well, my parents were very strict with that kind of thing...  
But it's been a while since I left home,  
so I've probably forgotten half the manners they taught me.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Anyway, um...  
I belong to the Mercurius Foundation.  
You can call me Yukari.  
  
**Yukari：**  
It's a pleasure to meet you,  
Kokkoro!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Likewise.  
In the city, fellow elves are something of a rare sight,  
and I confess it makes me a little lonely.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It would comfort me greatly  
if we could get along with one another.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Well, sure.  
 Let's be friends, then!  
  
**Yukari：**  
With a child your age, I suppose there's not much chance  
I'll make a fool of myself...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Excuse me?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, nothing, nothing!  
Come on, we should get moving.  
There's still lots of work to be done!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
That's the spirit!  
At times like this, we gotta focus our energies!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
'Cause we're the Meow-curius Foundation!  
Defenders of the weak and enemies to evildoers everywhere,  
here to offer a helping paw to those in nyeed!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yes, let's do everything we can.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yukari, can you point out exactly where these monsters were sighted?  
I'll find the quickest route to get us there.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Thanks, Mifuyu!  
Let's see... they're in the mountains over there.  
  
**Yukari：**  
It looks like the explosion yesterday caused a cave-in,  
exposing a monster nest that was originally underground.  
  
**Yukari：**  
So the monsters that were hibernating inside got stirred up.  
And a number of them wandered too close to the farm.  
  
**Yukari：**  
They're agitating the local monsters too,  
so the situation's a bit touch-and-go.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hmmm...  
If we play our cards wrong,  
we could have another rampage on our hands.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
What to do, what to do?  
Usually you'd try to cut off the problem at its source...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
But depending how many monsters are involved,  
we might not be able to take care of them all by ourselves.  
  
**???：**  
Ohohohohoh! Fear not, my dears!  
A savior has arrived to solve all your woes!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Urk...  
Back already, are you, Akino?  
You never do miss a chance to steal the spotlight...  
  
**Akino：**  
Eheh!  
In this fine airship,  
I can be anywhere I please in the blink of an eye!  
  
**Akino：**  
Though I may have pushed it a little hard.  
The propulsion system is on the verge of giving way...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
That thing's not yours! Please don't go breaking it!  
We don't have mountains of funds  
to pay out in compensation!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Doesn't operating that thing for a single flight  
cost enough rupies to build a decent-sized house?!  
  
**Akino：**  
Worry not! The airship is my family's property, and this is  
officially a test flight, so it shouldn't cost us a thing!  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, if I damage the ship too much,  
I expect my father *will* drain my assets dry...  
  
**Akino：**  
Anyhow! I heard the gist of the situation!  
This airship is equipped with potent magical cannons,  
so we should be able to raze the monster nest from above!  
  
**Akino：**  
I'm afraid I don't have the magical expertise  
to operate the cannons alone,  
so Yukari, could you take the controls?  
  
**Akino：**  
Mifuyu and Tamaki,  
you take care of any monsters that escape the blast!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Who put you in charge?  
But, well... that doesn't sound like a bad plan.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
My only concern is,  
the monsters aren't exactly at fault in this instance,  
so I'm not sure we should exterminate them.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Let's just smoke them out  
and send them running.  
  
**Akino：**  
My, my. How very compassionate of you.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
It's the rational decision!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Many species of monster are known to have  
their own social communication networks.  
And they can hold some pretty nasty grudges.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
The last thing we want  
is monsters attacking the farm later on for revenge!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
But if we just drive them off, they'll think,  
\"This place is dangerous!\" and steer clear of it in the future.  
Try to think things through! Isn't that what I always tell you?  
  
**Akino：**  
Haha!  
Why should I think things through  
when you do such a good job of it for me?  
  
**Akino：**  
Like true guildmates,  
we're supporting each other as a perfect team! Ohohoh!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
More like I'm always drawing the short straw...  
But all right, then.  
We've got a plan, so let's get to it.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Okay!  
Hey, Akino? Can you toss down the rope ladder?  
  
**Yukari：**  
I'd love to jump on board,  
but somehow I don't think I quite have the leg power!  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh! Yes, of course.  
I'm ever so sorry.  
I always do forget the most obvious little things!  
  
**Yukari：**  
No, it's fine.  
It happens to us all,  
so don't stress yourself out!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Well, then...  
I guess we should head over  
and clear up any straggling monsters on the ground!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
{player} and co.,  
you can come along with us!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Don't underestimate a cat's sense of smell!  
I'll track down those beasties in nyo time flat!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
After all the desk work I've been stuck with lately,  
I've been itching for a chance to let off some steam!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's do our best.  
**Choice: (3)**  I'll exterminate every last one of them!  
`Tag 2`  
**Tamaki：**  
That's the spirit!  
We'll sort this out in a jiffy, {player}!  
Ready, set, meow!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Tamaki：**  
Ummm, were you even listening to Mifuyu?  
Exterminating bad! Our job's just to scare them off!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I think you might be a bit over-excited, {player}.  
Try not to get carried away and hurt yourself!  
That scary frown doesn't really suit you!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Pecorine：**  
All righty, then! Let's do this thing, shall we?!  
The Mercurius Foundation girls seem on the ball,  
so we'd better try to keep up!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed...  
It feels like things have settled  
into our usual style of unpredictable chaos.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Heheh...  
I am beginning to get used to this way of life.  
One might even say I enjoy it.
