**Pecorine：**  
Breakfast's ready! Eat up while it's hot, everyone!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I... I guess I'll dig in, then...  
I feel so awkward,  
letting a guest cook for us like this...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't worry about it!  
It's no trouble! I love to cook!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And I did kind of sleep here without permission last night.  
So you can think of this as my payment and apology!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Come on, kids! No need to be shy!  
I got up early to buy ingredients at the market, you know!  
It's all delectably fresh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh!  
I hope you like it as much as I do...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ummm, I'll have some, then...  
Ohh! This is good!  
  
**Ayane：**  
*munch munch*  
Mmm, this does taste pretty good!  
It's better than Suzume's cooking, that's for sure!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Urk...  
Well, if it makes the children happy,  
I suppose that's a good thing...  
  
**Suzume：**  
But I have been working hard to improve my skills  
and become a less awful cook, you know?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hey, don't get me wrong, your food tastes better lately!  
Now if you could just do something about the bits of eggshell  
I find in every other mouthful...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh, Kokkoro!  
D'you need a refill for your tea?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, much obliged.  
I appreciate your consideration,  
Miss Ayane.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Enough of that \"Miss\" stuff!  
We're both living here at the Sarendia Orphanage,  
so we're family now, right?  
  
**Ayane：**  
You can even call me \"Big Sis\" if you want! Heheh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahaha.  
I must apologize.  
This politeness is a habit of mine...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Well, I don't really mind.  
But you are the youngest one here, y'know?  
You should let us pamper you a bit more!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Right, Kurumi?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um, yes!  
Here, Kokkoro...  
I'll peel your boiled egg for you!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha!  
Would you look at that?  
Our little Kokkoro has become mighty popular!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
How embarrassing...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Everyone at the Orphanage has been so kind to us,  
even though we are little more than freeloaders...  
We cannot express our gratitude enough.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But that aside...  
Miss Pecorine, what brings you to the Orphanage?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
From what little I have gathered,  
I understand you were with my lord  
when he became involved in some terrible incident...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wait, huh?  
When you came back yesterday,  
weren't the three of you all together?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I found you lying in, um, the same bed,  
so I thought...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, no.  
As I believe I mentioned before,  
I was on a trip to a temple quite some way from here.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
There was something I needed to investigate,  
so I petitioned Lady Ameth for her wisdom.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It was yesterday evening that I finished my business there,  
and upon returning here, I found my lord  
sharing a bed with Miss Pecorine.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
To be frank,  
I was extraordinarily taken aback.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I had been quite looking forward  
to settling comfortably into bed by my lord's side...  
Just the two of us, for the first time in days...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, not this again!  
Didn't I warn you about the perils  
of casually hopping into bed with young men like that?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Seriously!  
Whatever would you do if an... accident... were to happen?!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Huh? An accident? Me and Kurumi get into bed with  
{player} sometimes too,  
when we had a scary dream or something…  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-is that not okay...?  
I always fall asleep much easier  
when {player} is cuddling me...  
  
**Suzume：**  
{player}...!  
For the love of all that's decent,  
could you stop getting so close with every girl you meet?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
If you get up to any funny business,  
I'll throw you clean out of the Orphanage!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hee hee...  
Miss Suzume, if you feel so left out,  
perhaps you should try sharing a bed with my lord yourself.  
  
**Suzume：**  
No, no, no!  
This isn't about feeling left out!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm long past the age where I need to cuddle up to someone  
to fall asleep at night!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hee hee...  
Surely even grown-ups  
need the warmth of another's companionship once in a while.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But alas, I must apologize.  
We seem to have completely lost sight of the topic at hand.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Tell me, Miss Pecorine,  
how did you end up sleeping here with my lord?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, well...  
To be honest, I'm not actually sure  
how I ended up in that bed myself!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmmm...  
It's like there's a bit of a gap in my memories.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let's see...  
Yesterday, we had this crazy experience in the mountains...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. So this unsavory individual  
unleashed a battalion-class attack spell upon you,  
and it seemed your doom was at hand.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank goodness the both of you  
escaped with your lives.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, yes...  
There was a giant explosion out there last night.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Milady was really worried about it!  
She headed out there to find out what happened.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I should use my communication magic  
to let her know {player} is safe with us!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes, good plan!  
You should tell her right away  
and put her worries to rest!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But, um...  
How *did* we survive that attack, in the end?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine... If you yourself do not know the reason,  
I fear the rest of us have no hope of answering that question.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  It [i]is[/i] a bit of a mystery.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
You too, my lord?  
Neither of you can recall how you escapedfrom that hopeless situation?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm afraid not!  
I did notice there were some people there  
who seemed crazy strong...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So I'm guessing one or more of them must have  
done somethingto shield us from the attack...  
  
**Suzume：**  
But, um, is that even possible?  
Blocking a battalion-class attack spell?  
Isn't that enough power to level a whole town...?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I mean... From what I saw in the papers this morning,  
it looked like it had carved a chunk out of  
more than one mountain...  
  
**Suzume：**  
If you were hit head-on by a spell like that,  
normally there wouldn't be anything left of you...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmmm... The woman who cast it did seem  
really confident in the spell's power...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It didn't sound like she thought there was any chance  
of anyone blocking it or escaping.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And she was nothing if not meticulous.  
She seemed dead set on wiping all of us out  
before we could do anything to stop her.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Why would she do such a thing?  
Tell me, who exactly was this mystery woman  
who was so determined to kill my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I cannot help but think you have some manner  
of history with her, Miss Pecorine.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Whenever you speak of her in particular,  
your face takes on an uncharacteristically bitter expression.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If there is any chance you can share them,  
would you consider explaining your circumstances?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If nothing else, my lord's life  
has been gravely endangered at this woman's hands.  
If you know anything, I feel we have a right to hear it.
