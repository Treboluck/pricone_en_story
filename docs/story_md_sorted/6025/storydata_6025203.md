**Kyoka：**  
Urgh... I'm trying to hand out treats,  
but people keep giving them to me instead...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  They look tasty.  
**Choice: (2)**  You're really cute, after all.  
**Choice: (3)**  Don't you like treats?

They do, don't they?!  
Like this cupcake—its delicious pumpkin scent is so...  
W-wait, this isn't what I wanted!

 I'm trying to be grown up...  
Don't treat me like a child!  
B-but... Do I really look that cute today?

W-well, I don't *dislike* them...  
But I'm a grown-up. I'm supposed to be giving, not receiving...
