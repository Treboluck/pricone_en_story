Mimi and Misogi really are such great friends to me.  
Friends are a wonderful thing to have, aren't they?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Friends help each other out.  
**Choice: (2)**  Friends tell each other off.  
**Choice: (3)**  Friends trust in each other.

That's right.  
If it weren't for Mimi and Misogi, I'd have given up.  
You, too... Thank you for coming to save us.

**Kyoka：**  
There is that as well, yes.  
 Honestly, with Misogi,  
it's like that's all I ever do...  
 But when it really matters,  
she's there for me too.  
 Just... don't tell her I appreciate it.

Yes. I know I can trust Mimi and Misogi.  
And they both feel the same about me, right?  
J-just so you know, I do... trust you, too...
