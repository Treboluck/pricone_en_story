## Subtitle: Loner vs. Loner!
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh, {player}! Hello!  
Let's do our best to fulfil the BB Brigade's goals today!  
  
**Aoi：**  
For starters, we should get warmed up.  
Everybody knows that making friends requires  
physical strength.  
  
**Aoi：**  
One, two, three, four!  
Whew... Somehow the sweat born of hard work and effort  
seems to sparkle and shine, doesn't it?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Yes, our sweat is shining...  
Huh? H-hang on? We really are shining!  
And it's getting brighter and brighter...!  
  
**Aoi：**  
A... Aaaaaahhh!

**Narration：**  
{player} randomly comes across Aoi  
playing with little birds in the park.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh... {player}... Hello...  
  
**Aoi：**  
I was just talking to the little birdies here.  
Practicing for when I make real friends someday...  
  
**Aoi：**  
...Please don't say anything...  
  
**Aoi：**  
I'm quite aware...  
This isn't exactly... something normal people do.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Maybe it's because I'm weird that I can't make friends...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're not weird, Aoi.  
`Tag 1`  
**Aoi：**  
Huh...? How do you mean?  
  
**Aoi：**  
You just saw me talking to birds. How is that not weird?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Then I'm going to talk to this mailbox.  
`Tag 2`  
**Aoi：**  
...Ehh?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ah! Um... {player}!  
Please stop talking into the mailbox opening!  
Everyone is looking at you like you're suspicious!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ahhh... You really don't have to shout  
\"Normies begone!\" like that!  
Everyone's keeping their distance already!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I-I admit defeat! You're weirder than I am...  
  
**Aoi：**  
But... Being weird and being a loner are different.  
I'm a bigger loner than you.  
That's one thing even I can say with confidence!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I can't back down on my loner status!  
  
**Aoi：**  
H-how big a loner am I? W-well!  
I have so few friends...  
I buy two portable game systems to play against myself!  
  
**Aoi：**  
H-how's that for friendless?!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Well, I play poker against myself!  
**Choice: (4)**  Well, I play Hangman against myself!  
`Tag 3`  
**Aoi：**  
Wh-what...?! Then there's no bluffing or deduction at all!  
It's just pure luck!  
 How can you possibly find any fun in that?!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Aoi：**  
A-are you serious...?!  
But that's like the ultimate waste of time!  
You know the answer before you even begin!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Aoi：**  
I... I admit defeat.  
Even in the field of lonerdom, it seems I can't outdo you...  
No wonder you're captain of the BB Brigade...  
  
**Aoi：**  
I think I'm... losing what little confidence I had left...  
Forget friends, I have nothing of value whatsoever...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Oh, but you do!  
`Tag 6`  
**Aoi：**  
Huh...? What could I possibly...?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  You have your own identity!  
`Tag 7`  
**Aoi：**  
M-my value lies in just being me...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Hopeless though I am...  
I can still hold my head high and take pride in this lonely life  
devoid of friendship?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
{player}... I... I think...  
That makes me so happy!  
I'm so glad I joined the BB Brigade!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Let's keep on working together  
to be the best Brigade we can be!

**Ameth：**  
Aaaand... that's all for now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just experienced was something like a dream.  
You'll forget most of it when you wake up,  
so don't worry about it too much.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Still, um...  
Back in those days, you sure had an interesting life, huh?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Did you see \"normies\" as your enemies?  
I have to say, that's going a little bit overboard...  
I'm glad you've settled down somewhat since then.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, try to collect more memories  
and close in on this world's secrets.  
When you do, I'll have more of these dreams for you!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, see you later! ♪

**Aoi：**  
Ahh! Where... Where am I?  
  
**Aoi：**  
The Elven Forest...  
Huh? You just had the same dream as me?  
How incredibly mysterious...  
  
**Aoi：**  
I must say, though, seeing you compete so hard  
to be even more friendless than me was surprisingly  
entertaining...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ahh...!  
I mean that in a good way, of course!  
I'm not making fun of you!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Anyway, it really made me laugh and feel happy...  
and somehow closer to you than ever!  
I really want to make our BB Brigade a success now!  
  
**Narration：**  
From that day onward,  
Aoi seemed to trust {player}  
more than ever before.
