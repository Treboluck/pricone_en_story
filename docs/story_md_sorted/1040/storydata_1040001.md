**Narration：**  
One day, while fleeing from a dangerous monster,  
{player} finds himself lost in the Elven Forest.  
  
**Narration：**  
As he wanders in search of a way out,  
he hears the sound of a girl's voice somewhere nearby.  
  
**???：**  
Eheheh... Now, what should we do today?  
  
**???：**  
Umm... Really, though,  
what *do* people do together to have fun...?  
I can't think of a single thing…  
  
**???：**  
Collecting all the fatty bits of a sirloin steak, maybe?  
  
**???：**  
A-anyway, let's hang out again tomorrow!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Step out in front of the girl.  
`Tag 1`  
**???：**  
...Aaaaghh!  
  
**???：**  
Huh...? Y-you're alive...  
 Are you a human?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Weren't you just talking to someone?  
`Tag 2`  
**???：**  
Huh? Ahh, um, no, it's just me.  
I was just talking to... um... this practice doll I made.  
He's called \"My Little Buddy Mk I\".  
  
**???：**  
I-I mean, it's not—I'm not some kind of...  
I was just... panicking? Umm... I'm....  
I'm not a suspici... suspici... susp...  
  
**???：**  
Suspicious suspender suspected suspense!!!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Wait! Don't run!  
`Tag 3`  
**Narration：**  
After a few dozen meters' chase,  
{player} manages to catch the strange girl.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You should take deep breaths.  
**Choice: (5)**  I'm not a suspicious suspender.  
`Tag 4`  
**???：**  
...Huff... puff... ...Aaahh...  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**???：**  
O-of course! I'm not a suspicious person either...  
I just... like talking to my doll, that's all...  
Wait, then... Are neither of us suspicious people?  
  
`Tag 6`  
**???：**  
I-I'm very sorry... I got carried away...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Your name is {player}, is it?  
Umm, I'm... You can call me Aoi...  
I live in this forest... I'm an elf.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? You just wanted to ask for directions  
out of the forest?  
 Th-that makes sense...  
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to run...  
  
**Aoi：**  
If it's the exit you want, I know the way,  
so let me show you right to it!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ahh... I-I'm sorry...  
Th-that was awfully presumptuous of me... wasn't it?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Trying to go along with you, when we're not even friends...  
I'm such a hopeless, obnoxious idiot...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I'm not sure what you mean...  
`Tag 7`  
**Aoi：**  
I... live in this forest,  
and I can talk to the plants and animals here...  
  
**Aoi：**  
But I don't have any human friends...  
I've always wanted friends, more than anything  
in the whole wide world!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I've been waiting for years now, practicing in secret  
with my trusty My Little Buddy Mk I...  
But at this point, we're running out of conversation topics...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  For years?!  
`Tag 8`  
**Aoi：**  
Eheheh... I mean, making real friends  
is an incredible thing.  
I'm sure I couldn't do it without ten years' more practice.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Even so... someday...  
Someday, I want to be a loner no more!  
That's my little... personal dream, I suppose...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ah... we're almost at the exit already...  
It's a little bit sad...  
Saying goodbye so soon.  
  
**Aoi：**  
There! This is the exit! It's been a pleasure!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Well then... I wish you all the best...  
I hope you'll remember me... once in a decade or so...  
  
**Aoi：**  
...Huh? Is...is something the matter?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  I just had a great idea.  
`Tag 9`  
**Aoi：**  
An idea...?  
Wh-what kind of idea do you...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ohhh...  
You've got amnesia, have you...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
So you don't have many friends either...  
But you do spend lots of time in the bustling city,  
so you'd like it if we could work on making friends... together?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Wait, whaaaaaaaa?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
A-are you serious?!  
You'd be willing to lavish me with such prodigious honors  
the likes of which are scarcely known to elfkind?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
You and me, making friends together...  
A new team is born! Yaaaaaay!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  We'll call ourselves... the BB Brigade!  
`Tag 10`  
**Aoi：**  
That sounds fantabulous!  
BB Brigade! BB Brigade!  
You and me are the BB Brigade!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Um! I promise, from this day forth,  
I'll wait for you every day right here!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Whenever you feel like it, please drop by!  
I can't wait to begin our glorious activities!  
Hooray! Hooray! Life is full of joy!  
  
**Narration：**  
Seeing Aoi's exuberant response to his casual suggestion,  
{player} began to worry about what he  
might have gotten himself into...
