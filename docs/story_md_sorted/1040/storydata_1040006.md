**Aoi：**  
Hello there, {player}!  
Umm... What should the BB Brigade  
aim to achieve today, I wonder?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Actually, there's something else bothering me...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh, no, it's nothing very exciting really...  
It's just, the big tree at the forest entrance was  
uprooted this morning.  
  
**Aoi：**  
If something's knocked that tree clean over,  
that might mean the barrier has been damaged...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh, umm, this forest and the human city are both surrounded  
by a single magical barrier that repels monsters.  
But if it's damaged, monsters might find their way into...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOOGGGHHHH!  
  
**Aoi：**  
...? That sounded like a monster... Where did it—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRAAAAAAGHHHH!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Aaahhh!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Aoi! Look out!  
`Tag 1`  
**Aoi：**  
Aaahh! {player}!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I-it can't be... {player}, you stood in the way  
to protect me from its attack...  
  
**Aoi：**  
You're \"all right\"...?  
Y-you don't look all right at all!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ah! {player}, here it comes again!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Face the monster.  
`Tag 2`  
**Monster：**  
GRRUOOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Aoi：**  
{player}...!  
I-I'll fight with you!  
This beast looks strong, but together, I'm sure we can...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You need to run, Aoi...  
`Tag 3`  
**Aoi：**  
B-but...!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Urgh...!  
  
**Narration：**  
Aoi turns and leaps away from {player}.  
But just as he's wondering if she'll make it to safety...  
  

---  
  
**Aoi：**  
Fear not!  
I wouldn't run away and abandon you!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I just retreated a little so it's easier to aim!  
I will protect my most precious treasures...  
The BB Brigade... and you, {player}!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Gotta make this shot count!  
I'll use my strongest arrow...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Haahhh...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Take this! Arrow of Judgment!  
  

---  
  
**Monster：**  
NGUOOOOORRGHHH!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Yes! It hit the mark!  
  
**Aoi：**  
How's that...? Did I defeat it...?  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRUOOOOOOGGGHHHH!  
  
**Aoi：**  
A-awaahh, it's not hurt at al—  
 Aaahh!  
I-it's dashing this way at full pelt!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ngh...! Wait a minute... Over there is...  
I've got it!  
  
**Aoi：**  
{player}!  
Press that switch, right down there!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Got it.  
`Tag 4`  
**Monster：**  
...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
What you just pressed was the activation switch for my creation,  
the All-Out Friend-Making Death Race from before!  
It makes a giant log come flying down, and...!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRRRUOOOOOOGGGHHH...!  
  
**Narration：**  
The log hits the monster, and sends it falling to its oblivion.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Wh-whew... Somehow... we defeated it.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh, {player}...  
Thank you so much!  
Ahaha... My legs, they're still... trembling like crazy...  
  
**Aoi：**  
...{player}, you're the BB Brigade's leader...  
If I lost you, I'd never be able to make any friends...  
  
**Aoi：**  
So please... Promise me you won't go anywhere!  
Don't get yourself hurt to protect me...  
That doesn't make me happy at all.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I promise.  
`Tag 5`  
**Aoi：**  
Thank you! The BB Brigade is eternal... Forever and ever!  
  
**Narration：**  
The smile Aoi and {player} shared that day  
spoke more than words ever could.
