## Subtitle: My Very Best Friend
  
**Aoi：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
Another day of grueling training  
in the name of making friends...  
  
**Aoi：**  
I started those push-ups on the spur of the moment, but...  
Do push-ups actually have anything at all to do  
with the ability to make friends...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
A-anyway! I'll see you to the edge of the forest  
like usual!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh...? Is it just me, or is there a weird light  
glowing around the forest entrance?  
  
**Aoi：**  
A-aaaaaahhhh!

**Aoi：**  
...Oh, {player}. Hello...  
  
**Narration：**  
On a day off, {player} happens to spot Aoi  
sitting alone in the pouring rain.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? What am I doing out here in the wet?  
Oh, well... Ahaha... The other day, some of my classmates  
miraculously asked me to hang out with them.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  They invited you out? That's great!  
`Tag 1`  
**Aoi：**  
Ahaha... Thanks for the sentiment. It's all thanks  
to the help you've given me  
in our BB Brigade activities.  
  
**Aoi：**  
So, um... I was waiting here all happy-like...  
But nobody... ever showed up...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Did you get the wrong time, maybe?  
`Tag 2`  
**Aoi：**  
Actually, I was starting to think that myself...  
I've been waiting here for six hours so far...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Six hours?!  
`Tag 3`  
**Aoi：**  
I think... I've worked it out.  
I got here at six o' clock in the morning,  
but they might have meant six in the evening...  
  
**Aoi：**  
They were talking about going out for a meal.  
I thought they meant breakfast, but...  
They must have meant dinner, I bet...  
  
**Aoi：**  
But I've got nowhere else to go, so I guess I'll wait  
another six hours until the real meeting time...  
Atchoo!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You're freezing to death...  
`Tag 4`  
**Aoi：**  
Ahaha... This rain is kind of cold...  
But I don't want to ruin this fun day for everyone...  
So I have to keep smiling!  
  
**Aoi：**  
It's okay... This is... just how my life goes.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Take Aoi's hand.  
`Tag 5`  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? {player}...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
\"Let's go kill time somewhere\"?  
Y-you'd waste your precious time just to keep me company?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Th-thank you so much!  
I... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you!  
You'll always be my number one friend!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Your hand feels so warm, too...  
  
**Aoi：**  
To be totally and brutally honest...  
I really am looking forward to hanging out  
with my classmates, but...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Part of me is actually wishing that I could just  
stay here with you all day long...

**Ameth：**  
How was that? A little present from yours truly!  
Did you have a nice dream?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I put that dream together based on your memories with Aoi,  
but you handled things a little differently this time.  
You were surprisingly cool there, you know!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, see you around! ♪

**Aoi：**  
Huh...? This is... the forest...  
Was that all a dream...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? You had the same dream as me just now?  
That's so mysterious...  
  
**Aoi：**  
But... Even in the dream, you were so nice to me...  
Somehow, I feel all warm and tingly inside!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I'm so glad to have the BB Brigade...and you as its leader!  
  
**Narration：**  
Thus continued the adventures of the BB Brigade,  
with Aoi and {player} feeling a little closer  
than ever before.
