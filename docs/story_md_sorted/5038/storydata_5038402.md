## Subtitle: The Friendship Club Stands Tall!
  
**Yuni：**  
Huaaahhhh! Finish hiiiim!  
Taiyaahhhh! Fwumbaahhhh!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Down! Doc Yuni, down!  
Enough berserking! That's serious overkill!  
  
**Chloe：**  
And like, why are you acting up?  
It's us who actually scrapped that metal, so don't leap in  
and act like you dealt the finishing blow after the fight's over.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Fwahahah! Friendbot X was no match for me!  
  
**Chieru：**  
We were the ones who did the fighting on the front lines.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeah, you just sat in the back giggling like a loon the whole time.  
  
**Yuni：**  
To each her proper place, my friend.  
What fool would send their strategist to no-man's-land?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, you've got a point,  
but I thought you weren't a fan of logic over heart.  
  
**Chieru：**  
You a science type, Doc?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Don't compare me to those dullards.  
We scholars of literature know that petty quibbling  
is a weapon to be used with precision.  
  
**Chieru：**  
You're gonna get a whole lotta nerds mad at you.  
And I mean science *and* humanities types.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm...?  
Wait. Those flashy figures approaching our position...  
Is that young Akino and her associates?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh! You're right!  
 The Merc girls are here!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, yes. How fortunate.  
As a humanities scholar, I was able to notice,  
but had I devoted my life to the sciences, I'd surely have missed them.  
  
**Chieru：**  
You really will make people mad.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uhh... So I guess... let's go say hi or whatever.
