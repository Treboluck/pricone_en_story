# The Maniacal Mechanism
Yuni and co. are despondent after their series of failures. Suddenly, the Mercurius Foundation members appear before them and present a tremendous new invention combining all three of the girls' ideas: the gigantic robot Friendbot X. But no sooner is the mechanical behemoth activated than it goes completely berserk.
  
## Subtitle: The Maniacal Mechanism
  
**Narration：**  
A few days after the special lesson's disastrous pitches...  
The members of St. Theresa's Academy (Friendship Club)  
have returned to their peaceful, if somewhat tedious, daily existence.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, good to see you, my friends.  
From the remote Ivory Tower in the far-off old schoolhouse,  
your guildmaster Yuni has arrived.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, why's the micro-Doc  
showing up tardy without so much as a \"sorry\"?  
She better be getting ready to hand out free snacks.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Desist, young Chloe.  
Muttered demands for material compensation  
are an offense to modern sensibilities.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Chelly morning~! ☆  
I'm glad to see our pasty-faced li'l Yuni  
with the healthy glow of a good night's rest for once!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Desist, young Chieru.  
Cease this superficial concern for my health,  
which serves only to criticize my oversleeping.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Is the noble goal of love, peace and friendship  
not the guiding principle of the Yuni-ettes?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yes, that's true. The noble goal of love, peace and friendship  
is the guiding principle of the St. Theresa's Academy Friendship Club.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Now, I'm told that the four of us have received a summons this fine day.  
Young Chloe, may I assume that this implies what one might imagine?  
A classic clash between juvenile delinquents from opposing institutions?  
  
**Chloe：**  
How should I know?  
Like, don't look at me.  
  
**Chloe：**  
But uh, if this really was one of those old-timey rumbles,  
why would you wanna get all sparkly-eyed about that.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well, I appreciate that rumbles in the jungle are an ecological threat.  
But I ask you, if I don't take the dangers of academic life with its merits,  
can I truly claim to have experienced the magic of youth?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Still, hrm... I wasn't expecting young Chloe to be unprepared.  
Very well. I'll unveil my own self-taught techniques  
for such situations.  
  
**Yuni：**  
First, when the delinquents' leader demands to inspect your belongings,  
the custom is to leap in place, such that your pockets produce a metallic  
melody.  
 Come, young {player}—practice with me.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Practice jumping.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuni：**  
Hippety-hoppety.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Nope, no jingles.  
Not a single monetary \"clink\" from either of you.  
Your hops are futile.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Everyone, good day.  
I'm glad to see you're all present.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, Teach is here. 'Sup.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Cheru~n! ☆  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hippety-hoppety.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Dear me... What's all this nonsense?  
It's a sorry state of affairs indeed  
if students of St. Theresa's can't even muster a proper greeting.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Why, I'll have you know that at your age, I was already—  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hey, Teach!  
D'you know why we were called here today~?  
  
**Teacher：**  
O... oh!  
 Yes, of course.  
We really shouldn't keep our honored guests waiting.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Honored guests. Huh.  
  
**Teacher：**  
The article has been transported, too.  
Please proceed to the school courtyard.  
Our guests are waiting for you there.  
  
**Friendship Club：**  
Huh...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh wow, what the heck. Why's this courtyard so cramped?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wow, you're right. Some kinda great big hulking thing's  
taking up half the space. AKA, in the way.  
Though with that huge cloth over it, who knows what it is.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Still, this scent of oil and metal is very familiar.  
Hrm... Mother Hilda mentioned an \"article.\"  
It seems it was transported here from outside...  
 But what have we here?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, quit looking at me.  
How'm I gonna answer that question.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Not a question, but a conundrum.  
 My chest is currently filled  
with academic curiosity alongside deep academic apprehension.  
In the terms of the layfolk, I'm excited and scared.  
  
**Chieru：**  
When Yuni says stuff like this,  
doesn't it usually spell disaster?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Hey.  
Whoa, girl. Hey.  
Don't tell me we're in for our second explosion this week.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Incidentally, my excitement exceeds my dread at present.  
Now, what have we here?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hey...!  
 Don't look at me!  
If you want to poke this nest, do it on your own!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Please don't say such things, my friends.  
The three of us are as one,  
united under the Friendship Club banner.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yes, that's right, we're united under the—  
  
**Chieru：**  
Why, this crafty fox...  
She actually used the real guild name!  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, how splendid!  
 Ohohoh!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh. The energetic gal.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyot forgetting the rest of us!  
  
**Chloe：**  
...And her merry maniacs.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Now, now, Chloe, that's very rude.  
Their proper name is the Chellurious Foundation.  
  
**Chieru：**  
And with that, hey guys! It's chellerific to see you! ☆  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. As expected, it was you who summoned us.  
Very well. Now, to celebrate our reunion... Hippety-hoppety.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Hippety-hoppety.  
`Tag 2`  
**Akino：**  
E-excuse me?  
 What strange ceremony is this?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh...  
 Don't mind her.  
She's gotten it in her head that getting summoned means hopping.  
Just ignore everything she says and does.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Um, so, what's this really about?  
So far all you've done  
is pop out of nowhere and scream \"splendid!\" for no reason.  
  
**Akino：**  
How could I not raise my voice in acclaim?  
Your words were deeply inspiring,  
members of the St. Theresa's Academy Friendship Club!  
  
**Akino：**  
Your lovely guild is forever united.  
Such a powerful claim! Friendship truly is a beautiful thing.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, you eavesdropped on us and *that's* your takeaway?  
Where'd you find that nuance?  
You conduct a full manhunt between the lines?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Well, leaving that aside...  
Today, we've come here to hold  
one more business discussion with you all.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oh...?  
 As I recall, each of the proposals we made  
was already delivered a merciless rejection at your hands...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yes, that's true.  
 But the pitches you made,  
even if they did have flaws, also displayed a certain originality...  
or rather, an impact that set them apart from other students'.  
  
**Yukari：**  
That's why after concluding the lesson,  
our guildmaster here... Akino made us a proposition.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
\"To gather the finest ideas, bring them together,  
and produce something still greater!  
Is that nyot the fundamental rule of business?!\"  
 ...is what she said.  
  
**Chloe：**  
\"To gather the... finest ideas... together... into... into...\"  
  
**Chloe：**  
Nope, too long.  
I got the feeling you were dying for an echo,  
so I tried to repeat the whole thing, but nope. Too long. Shorten it.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  To combine fine ideas into something greater!  
`Tag 3`  
**Akino：**  
Yes! It's just as {player} says!  
  
**Akino：**  
While each of your pitches sadly earned a No Rupie verdict,  
the unique ideas behind them provided us with great inspiration.  
It would be a waste not to bring them to fruition in some form!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wh-what the heck?! So... you're saying what?!  
  
**Akino：**  
Seeing is believing, as they say!  
Come—let us begin, Mifuyu, Yukari, Tamaki!  
  
**Yuni：**  
A-aaaahhhh...!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Wha— The heck?! What was that just now?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
The FSHOOM!  
It went FSHOOM and fired a laser cannon!  
Huh? Was that necessary? Who gave it a giant death ray?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I-I thought it would be... cooler with one...  
  
**Chieru & Chloe：**  
ARE YOU CHELLED IN THE HEAD?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Still... I understand, young Tamaki.  
Heart over logic—such is the philosophy of true romance.  
Friendbot X, I accept you as an honorary scholar of the humanities.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Is this any time to say that?!  
That big literary pal of yours just decimated half the freakin' school!  
...Though it's after hours, so at least there won't be casualties.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah yes, I almost forgot. This string of unprecedented events  
must have overstimulated my academic heart.  
 Rapid transformations  
and rays of destruction... It's like a scene out of a picture drama...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Wait—where's the drill?  
Hey, doesn't that thing have a drill?  
  
**Akino：**  
Mifuyu?!  
What in the world is going on?!  
What has become of our glorious Friendbot X?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
It's not accepting any of my inputs!  
It's gone completely berserk!  
  
**Yukari：**  
This is why I was against this!  
Akino's wild ideas never lead to anything good!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Liar! You were nyever against it!  
You were the one who approved the whole budget!  
  
**Yukari：**  
How very odd... I can't recall any of that...  
I just remember Akino offering me a lot of tasty-looking drinks...  
  
**Yukari：**  
A-anyway! Let's stop it quickly! At this rate, the academy's doomed!  
  
**Teacher：**  
All of you... What is this commotion?  
Young ladies of St. Theresa's should remain calm and composed at all—  
  
**Teacher：**  
UOOOGHHH! THE SCHOOL'S ON FIRE?!  
Wh-wh-what is that gargantuan metal beast?!  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
CHERU... CHERURURURURURURURU...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Friendbot X is on the move!  
`Tag 4`  
**Yuni：**  
Why, it's...  
 heading straight for Mother Hilda!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Teach, run away! Friendbot X is on your tail!  
  
**Teacher：**  
F-  
Friendbot X...?  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Yes.  
I Am Friendbot X. CHERU~N! ☆  
  
**Chloe：**  
It stopped...  
And it answered her?  
  
**Akino：**  
Yes, it's fully responsive to verbal input!  
This is its Chatterbox Feature (Chellish Edition)!  
Indeed, the very functionality proposed by Miss Chieru!  
  
**Chieru：**  
It's really not! This is so not me!  
My Chatterbox Chellypon is seven trillion times cuter than that thing!  
  
**Akino：**  
On top of that, behold!  
This street-smart design was inspired by Miss Chloe's fashion sense!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, \"street\"? Looks more like something out of a sewer to me!  
Compare it to my fashion sense again and I'll sue you all for defamation.  
  
**Akino：**  
And Miss Yuni's Floaty-Woaty Yunicopter served as the base  
for its artificial autonomous intelligence,  
which seems to be functioning perfectly!  
  
**Yuni：**  
What? That's news to me.  
Did you retrieve my Yunicopter's remains  
from the ruins of that sorry scene?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah—well. I will send my complaints  
to the Foundation's customer service center at a later date.  
For now, we should protect Mother Hilda—  
  
**Teacher：**  
Th-this giant... It speaks the common tongue?  
Ahem... You there, large being!  
This is a garden of learning! Please withdraw at once!  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Activating Chatterbox Mode.  
Target: Mother Hilda.  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Your Wrinkles Are Wonderfully Prominent Today. LMAO.  
  
**Teacher：**  
WHAAAAGHHHH?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ahhh! Look at Teach!  
The sudden insult's sent her into a state of shock!  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Self-Important Hag. Never Stops Prattling. Lectures Like A Textbook.  
Never Smiled Since She Was A Teen. Bullies Students To Compensate.  
Exploits Religion To Act Superior. As If The Heavens Give A Crap.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Awa... awawawawahhh...!  
 Guerkhh...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Teach! Teeeach!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh? Damn, that piece of junk's scary.  
Where'd that whole tirade even come from? Zero chill.  
  
**Akino：**  
Yes, a razor-sharp attack without restraint or mercy!  
And little wonder—for Friendbot X's personality is based entirely upon  
Miss Chloe herself, the Insult Queen of the Friendship Club!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, really!  
  
**Chloe：**  
'Scuse me for a sec, Merc gals. Might be a bit late to ask,  
but couldja just confirm one little thing for me.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Is this girl a moron?  
  
**Yukari：**  
W...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Well...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I ca nyot find it in me to deny it...  
  
**Akino：**  
I can hear you, you know! Who's a moron, exactly?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Now, my friends.  
 Hrm... What shall we do with this situation?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Friendbot X... It is a monstrous creation indeed.  
After all, it unites my intelligence, young Chloe's offensive stats,  
and even young Chieru's \"Cheru~n\" into a single being!  
  
**Chloe：**  
I mean, sure... But why's the Doc getting borderline hyperactive on us.  
  
**Chieru：**  
And um, wasn't there anything else you could have added from me?  
  

---  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
CHE... RUUUUUUUUUUN!  
  
**Narration：**  
In a nightmarish cross between the Mercurius Foundation's and the  
Friendship Club's talents, the diss-spitting, school-smashing robot of  
chaos, Friendbot X, was born. The academy had finally met its match.
