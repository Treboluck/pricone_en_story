**Friendbot X：**  
CHE-CHERUUUUUUUN!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrrrm... Friendbot X, is there no end to your self-enhancement?  
Despite your retro toy-like appearance,  
your inner workings are truly cutting edge.  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Shut Your Ugly Face,  
Mommy-Loving Half-Pint Full Of Useless Trivia.  
Less Talking, More Chelling.  
  
**Yuni：**  
H-hmph. So the upgrades don't extend to your insult prowess.  
As if a fount of serene dignity like myself  
would rise to such cheap and tired—  
  
**Chieru：**  
Shaddup! Shaddup, dummy!  
Don't insult our li'l Yuni, you piece of scrap!  
How dare you call her a mommy-loving half-pint full of useless trivia?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, *someone's* rising to the cheap jabs.  
  
**Yuni：**  
May I ask, was there a need to repeat that entire insult?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Doc Yuni isn't just any old mommy-loving half-pint full of useless trivia!  
She's the psycho who let the Little Lyrical kids think she was a lost eight-  
year-old and played house with them all day even though she's eighteen!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Chieru, your counter's doing more damage than the attack.  
Look at the poor girl. Her eyes are as dead as a Landosol sand fox.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Please cease moving your lips, young Chieru.  
Take a moment to reflect upon the concepts of friendship and  
respect for your elders.  
 In the terms of the layfolk: shut up, you fool.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ahhh! I can't believe Doc Yuni called me a fool!  
Buehhhh! If I'm a fool, then you're a fooly-fool!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Wha...?!  
 If you brand me, who graduated this academy's  
entry exams in first place, a fooly-fool, then by extension you  
brand your lower-ranking selves the fooliest of fools, fool!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Says who?!  
We're not talking about grades on tests, fooly-fool-fool!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, can you two just quit it.  
The fool talk's just making you sound like fools.  
  
**Yuni & Chieru：**  
Don't call us fools, you big fool!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh?  
Looking for a fight, you damn fools?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Shut up, fool!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Excuse me, fool?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
I'll murder your fool ass!  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Shut up and fight me, Fool Trio.  
  
**Fool Trio：**  
\"Fool Trio\"?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pff... Okay, look. What's that junk bot think it's saying?  
Tryna insult the intelligence of St. Theresa's biggest geniuses.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes.  
You have my full support. Go forth and do violence.  
Geniuses of St. Theresa's, full steam ahead!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yes, that's right!  
Geniuses of St. Theresa's, full steam ahead!  
  
**Genius Trio：**  
Hiyaaaahhhh!
