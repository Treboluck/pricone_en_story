# The Cheru~n Challenge
The special lesson begins, and Chieru takes the lead with the first pitch. She presents a talking plushie of herself named \"Chatterbox Chellypon,\" but the proposal is shot down due to its inability to speak any language other than Chellish.
  
## Subtitle: The Cheru~n Challenge
  
**Narration：**  
A few days have passed since the chaotic initial briefing.  
After a rush of brainstorming and groundwork,  
our hopeful students prepare themselves for the special lesson proper.  
  
**Akino：**  
...as the market dictates.  
That concludes my advice for you.  
  
**Student 1：**  
Th-thank you for your time!  
  
**Akino：**  
...Phew.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
A \"Blossom Cafe\" for enjoying food with flowers, huh?  
I can't deny it was a charmingly feminine idea...  
  
**Akino：**  
But with so many concept cafes already on the market,  
it simply didn't have the originality to stand out from the crowd.  
  
**Yukari：**  
The target audience seemed a little too narrow.  
All the proposed menu items were rather costly too,  
and using live vegetation limits the suitable sites and staff...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Worst of all, no taiyaki! It nyeeded way more taiyaki!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Tamaki, be quiet.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Perhaps expecting viable business plans from students  
just wasn't a realistic idea from the beginning...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Indeed... Particularly at this academy,  
where most students seem so sheltered from the world...  
  
**Akino：**  
That makes no difference.  
  
**Akino：**  
True genius is able to shine regardless of environment or experience.  
And one never can tell where it may be concealed!  
  
**Akino：**  
To uncover that raw genius  
so that we may cultivate its true potential  
is the goal that brought us here to this academy!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
When Akino gets like this...  
  
**Yukari：**  
It's bizarre how reliable she seems.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Akino seems meow-steriously reliable at times like this!  
  
**Akino：**  
\"Mysteriously\"?  
 What do you mean by that, Tamaki?!  
It almost sounds as if you think I'm not usually reliable!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Tamaki...!  
We both resisted saying it out loud, but you just...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Knock-knock~! ♪  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ah, yes. The lesson's not over yet.  
 Let's use our time efficiently.  
Hm, next up is...  
 Miss Chieru.  
Please enter the classroom!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Don't mind if I do! ☆ First-year at St. T's, always living her chelliest life!  
The Friendship Club's last bastion of sanity and all-round mega-cutie,  
Chierun is here! Cheru~n! ♪  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Che...  
 what...?  
  
**Chieru：**  
It's \"Cheru~n! ♪\"  
The hot new greeting that every teen in Landosol's saying right now!  
C'mon, say it with me, Mifuyu!  
 Cheru~n! ♪  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
That's... the latest slang?  
Does everyone at this school use it?  
I-in that case, I suppose I'd be remiss not to follow suit...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ch-cheru~n... ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Good morning. *pointed stare*  
`Tag 1`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Even your friend isn't saying it!  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh!  
Is my dear {player} accompanying you?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yep! I brought him today as my personal assistant.  
Definitely not a ploy to make a good impression on you gals  
'cause you all seem so fond of him or anything!  
  
**Yukari：**  
...Well, at least she's honest.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, that reminds me!  
 Can you spare a quick moment before the pitch?  
Since you came all this way to visit us here at St. T's,  
I thought I'd bring some local snacks for you to try!  
  
**Chieru：**  
...{player}. Reveal the goods.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Hand out steaming taiyaki.  
`Tag 2`  
**Tamaki：**  
Is that taiyaki?!  
And whoa. Smooth anko, lumpy anko,  
 custard... all the bases covered!  
You've got potential! 7 trillion points! You're a nyatural winner!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
That's a bribe.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Clearly a bribe.  
  
**Akino：**  
A barefaced bribe.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huhhh~? What's a bribe~?  
I'm just bringing a little more happiness to the world!  
Taiyaki times are happy-chelly-times! ☆  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I can already see this girl isn't one to take lightly.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Guess I can't be too careful.  
I'll put the 7 trillion points on hold for nyow.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Is this what the teens of today are like?  
I'd like to think I'm not that far out of my teens myself,  
but I suppose time stops for no woman...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Enough gazing off into the distance, Yukari.  
Let's hear the proposal she came here to present.  
Time is money, and we can't waste a penny of it.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, I getcha!  
I always try to put all my energy  
into relishing every second of my magical youth!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Today I'd like to show you one product of those efforts:  
a product sure to go so viral you'll need vaccinations!

**Chieru：**  
I call her... \"Chatterbox Chellypon\"!  
  
**Akino：**  
Is that... some kind of plushie?  
  
**Chieru：**  
No, it's not!  
 She's \"Chatterbox Chellypon\"!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Uh-oh. Persnyickety about branding.  
And it's clearly based on herself.  
How self-absorbed is this girl?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well spotted!  
 This is a fully-chellerific miniature Chierun,  
produced by Chierun for Chierun lovers everywhere!  
No Landoguy or Landogal could hope to resist her charms!  
  
**Chieru：**  
However!  
 This product doesn't end there.  
Wouldja believe my \"Chatterbox Chellypon\" has a super-secret feature  
never seen in any other trinket past, present or future?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
You're brimming with confidence, that's for sure...  
But are you sure it's wise to raise the bar so high?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Let's hear the details before we decide.  
Though given the product name, I can see where this is going.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Shockingly, my \"Chatterbox Chellypon\"...  
is blessed with the power of speech!  
 Who'da thunk it?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
...I knew it.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Whoa there, Doubting Tina!  
The words  
 \"I knew it, cheru~n!\"  
 are written all over your face!  
  
**Yukari：**  
You nailed the first half, but the second half's a swing and a miss!

`image display end`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Umm... So it's just a standard talking plushie?  
The kind where you push the tummy  
and it plays one of a few pre-recorded lines...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Are you chellin' me?! You think a pioneering pilgrim like Chieru  
would rip off any old dime-a-dozen artifact lying around Landosol?!  
Everyone knows Chierun's a trend-setter, not a trend-netter!  
  
**Akino：**  
Haha! I'm certainly enthused by your energy.  
What we seek is fresh and surprising ideas.  
Please go on, Miss Chieru.  
 I have high hopes for you.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Then allow me to set those hopes alight!  
Wouldja believe my Chatterbox Chellypon  
is blessed with the power of speech?!  
 Who'da thunk it?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
She's looping like a broken Sound Record?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
To think I'd see that smirk a second time.  
I've nyever been so bamboozled!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wait, wait, hold up! I'm just getting to the good part!  
Forget the tired old one-sided chats you're used to.  
This chelly-pie holds full two-way conversations in real time!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Two-way...?  
You don't mean to tell us that plushie is actually intelligent?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Umm... What was it again? According to my yunilicious Chief of R&D...  
To brand this \"true intelligence\" would be a misnomer.  
 In layfolk's terms,  
it merely selects fitting responses from a vast database of blah blah blah?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Point is,  
 this chellster can totally chell!  
Talk at her, she talks back! It's a revolution in the plushie world!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Allow me to provide a demonstration.  
Come now, {player},  
address our little friend in your freakishly dulcet tones!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Nice to meet you, Chellypon.  
**Choice: (4)**  It's been a while, Chellypon.

**Yukari：**  
Yes... It did seem to answer without any prompting...

Can it be true?  
Hey~! Can you answer my meow-tiful voice, too?

What'd I tell ya?!  
 See? Isn't she legit amazing?!  
Full of originality and unstoppable selling power?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
What's more, according to our R&D Chief, the more you talk to her,  
the more advanced her conversation engine becomes!  
And best of all, she's totes adorbs!  
  
**Akino：**  
Why, I'm astounded!  
I have never seen a product remotely like it!  
  
**Chatterbox Chellypon：**  
I'm chelly flattered by the chellpliment! ♪  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
The... \"chellpliment\"?  
  
**Mifuyu：**

**Mifuyu：**  
Excuse me. Can I run a few brief tests of my own?  
  
**Chieru：**  
But of course! Please enjoy!

\"Chatterbox Chellypon\"... Good morning.

Nice weather we're having today.  
  
**Chatterbox Chellypon：**  
Etchellaree-chellaroob.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Umm, I might've forgot to mention,  
but thanks to the latest in cuteness tech, our little chellster  
comes out with some pretty hilarious responses sometimes!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
...This goes far beyond that.  
This doll has fundamental errors in her language programming.  
  
**Chieru：**  
No, that's a feature.  
Chellish is the language of the future, available to you today.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
How can we speak it if it doesn't exist yet?!  
What is this utterly brain-addling conversation?!  
It's a production flaw! This warrants a full recall!  
  
**Yukari：**  
N-now, now, Mifuyu!  
The feature itself is impressive,  
so if we make a few adjustments to the settings...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, that's not possible.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Why not?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
I mean, Chellish is her whole identity.  
Are you telling me you can't accept that?  
This is discrimination against chellsters everywhere!  
  
**Chieru：**  
I'm begging you!  
Accept my li'l Chellypon as a champion of diversity!  
Find room in your hearts for the Chellish way!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
S-such myad passion...!  
Everything she's saying is loony,  
yet somehow I feel like I'm in the moral wrong!  
  
**Chieru：**  
I'm on my hands and knees! If Chellypon sells, then \"cheru~n\"...  
My \"cheru~n\" will finally be a universal language!  
{player}, get down and beg with me!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  We're counting on your support.  
**Choice: (7)**  Chellerapperoo chelleray.

**Chieru：**

`Tag 8`  
**Tamaki：**  
They've tossed out logic and turned to emotional blackmeowl?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
U-ummm...  
Can we assume this marks the end  
of Miss Chieru's product pitch...?  
 We can, can't we?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, all right.  
Though I could chell on all day, I'll rest my case.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Well then, Akino.  
Let's hear the final verdict on the \"Chatterbox Chellypon\" proposal!  
  
**Chieru：**  
...!  
  
**Akino：**  
That's a decisive \"No Rupie\" from me!  
  
**Chieru：**  
No waaaay!  
  
**Chatterbox Chellypon：**  
Jeruuuun!  
  
**Narration：**  
And the plaintive cries of Chatterbox Chellypon and her producer  
rang out endlessly through the halls of the school building.
