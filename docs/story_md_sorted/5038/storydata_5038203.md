Cheru~n! ☆  
I blocked that fake Chieru like the worst kind of toxic follower!  
  
**Chloe：**  
So hey. While we're here. I've been wondering for a while.  
Chieru, what the *heck* is that chaos-engine fighting style you use.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hmm? What about it?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Chloe is having trouble with layfolkese.  
 Allow me to translate.  
Young Chieru, where do you find that bizarre strength?  
Are you trained in a little-known martial art?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, no, I never took lessons. I just kinda checked out people  
who looked strong  
 and did what they did? Though they were  
all super uncute, so I put my own twist on most of it.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Self-taught? Damn.  
You can't just invent a killer new fighting style  
like some kinda exercise fad.  
 Apologize to the ancient masters.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Young Chloe... We must endeavor not to forget.  
Young Chieru has the gift of universal genius.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ahah... C'mon!  
Anyone could do this with a little bit of effort!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Not even saying that to boast, is she? She actually believes it.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Wait, young Chloe. Sheathe your blade. Think of our friend's personality.  
Even if she had subjected herself to years of grueling training,  
she would sooner die than let it show.  
 It's a question of aesthetics.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ooh, cute take! I'll go with that!  
 Ain't I just the sweetest~?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Mrgrgrgrgr...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh—I just noticed, we still haven't seen the Merc gals, have we?  
Where'd they go?  
 D'you think we should take a looksie a bit further in?  
Me, I'm all tired out, so I vote we go home for a bath.  
  
**Chloe：**  
She sure knows how to enjoy life.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Agreed. Setting the idle genius's vote aside,  
let's pursue the missing Foundation.
