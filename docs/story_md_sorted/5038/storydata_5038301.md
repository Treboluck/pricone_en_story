**Friendbot X：**  
CHERUUUUN!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Way too loud.  
And too lame.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yep, lame's the word.  
A metal tribute to lame.  
Even I can hardly bear the sight of it.  
  
**Yuni：**  
And yet, is it truly?  
 Its aesthetic is so outdated  
as to evoke a form of nostalgia.  
 Perhaps it's a statement  
against the banal mass-market appeal of the modern age.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Doc, you're killing me.  
Ever considered writing a gourmet column?  
Bet you could make the filthiest tripe sound like a delicacy.  
  
**Chieru：**  
The only praiseworthy feature this thing's got is having the taste to ape  
the up-and-coming fashion leader Chierun. But please try harder.  
Chieru's more than just a pink paint job and a catchphrase.  
  
**Chloe：**  
There's more to you than pink and \"cheru~n\"?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm! Enough idle chatter. The machine moves.  
Come, young {player}, it's time for learning.  
Bestow on me your academic might.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Here it cooomes!  
Wa... waaaaahhhh!  
Chaaaarge! For glory and triumph!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ahh... C'mon...  
Don't go charging in with your puny defense stats...  
  
**Chieru：**  
You know, I've noticed that  
when Yuni gets powered up, she kinda goes berserk, doesn't she?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Chieru. C'mon, let's move.  
If we leave Yuni on the front lines, she'll come back in tears again.
