# The Celebrated Celebrities
The special guests running the new lesson turn out to be Akino and co. from the Mercurius Foundation. When the businesswomen promise to invest serious capital in any credible business ideas the students can come up with, the Friendship Club girls kick their motivation into high gear.
  
## Subtitle: The Celebrated Celebrities
  
**Narration：**  
A few days after the announcement of the special lesson...  
The students who applied for this new class  
have gathered to attend an initial briefing.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm...  
How careless of me. I seem to have arrived a little early.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Barely half the students have arrived, much less the teachers.  
Worst of all, my fellow Yuni-ettes are nowhere to be seen.  
  
**Inner Chieru：**  
\"Yep, that's tough!  
The Friendship Club members are nowhere to be seen!\"  
  
**Yuni：**  
Dear me... This after I, the hyper-low-energy  
habitual latecomer and oversleeper,  
 took a double dose of  
Dr. Mitsuki's get-up-and-go potion to ensure my timely arrival.  
  
**Yuni：**  
But in all my wisdom, I can't let these free moments go to waste.  
I must put them to good use  
recuperating my mental faculties from their daily strain.  
  
**Yuni：**  
*yawn*...  
In the terms of the layfolk, it's naptime...  
Zzzz...  
  
**Student 1：**  
Those desks over there look free. Shall we take a seat?  
  
**Student 2：**  
No—wait just a moment.  
That diminutive young lady at the next desk over...  
Could it be the famous Dr. Yuni?  
  
**Student 1：**  
Dr. Yuni? The academy's greatest ever genius  
who earned an honorary doctorate in high school?  
The near-legendary figure spoken of only in whispers?!  
  
**Student 2：**  
I'm certain of it! No longer fit for ordinary classes,  
she attends to her own theses in the old schoolhouse's library.  
That elite among academic idlers!  
 So she really does exist!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Shnorrrk... Purbleburble...  
  
**Student 1：**  
Oh—do you see this?  
 The doctor is deep in meditation!  
I feel certain that her noble mind is exploring  
sophisticated notions beyond our ability to comprehend!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Mrgogorhh...  
 Eheh... eheheh... Mama...  
  
**Student 2：**  
My! This air of contentment! She must have solved a complex problem!  
We're not worthy to be in the presence of such an esteemed figure.  
Let's leave her be and find another seat.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Mm... mnhh...  
 Mnuahh...?  
  
**Yuni：**  
O-oh dear! What's this now?  
As I open my eyes, I see a pair of schoolfellows  
walking away, their backs turned to me...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Good grief. My hermetic existence is so easily misunderstood.  
Though I shun the world, I also harbor a deep desire for companionship.  
In the layfolk's terms, I crave the magic of youth.  
  
**Yuni：**  
How to induce my peers to casually join me at my seat?  
Hrm... It strikes me that perhaps my greatest failing  
is this unyouthful style of speech that I acquired from my village's elders.  
  
**Yuni：**  
And my greatest boon is this stature that seems younger than my years.  
I've seen the picture scrolls that young folk enjoy.  
 Yes, \"manga,\" was it?  
Let me attempt to imitate the manner of the young girls depicted therein.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes, my mental image is sound.  
When next I am asked \"Hey, can I sit here?\"  
I shall put this strategy into action.  
 Come, my schoolfellows!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Can I sit here?  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuni：**  
Uwehhh, you wanna sit next to Yuni~?  
I was so wonewy all on my own... Uweeeehhh!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh? You screwin' with us?  
I mean... You screwin' with us, Doc?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oh... So it was only you.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh? Who'd you think it was?  
Were you gonna spring that \"uweh\" crap on unsuspecting innocents?  
Not gonna stop you, but I'm pretty sure they'd send you to a shrink.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yuni...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Check *that* out. Chieru's got no words.  
And you've seen how many words she's usually got.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Loneliness leads a man to madness.  
That was an earnest attempt to dispel my unapproachable aura  
by acting the part of the wide-eyed juvenile, as is the latest fashion.  
  
**Chloe：**  
The fashion where? Tell me so I can stay away.  
Anyway, Doc, that act's prob'ly just gonna scare 'em off more.  
  
**Chieru：**  
That's right! Our little Yuni's best just how she is!  
Don't turn to cheap artificial charms  
when you've got so many natural eccentricities of your own!  
  
**Yuni：**  
I apologize for the trouble. *bow*  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Hrm...? Why did I just get lectured?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh! Look, the teacher's arrived!  
Time for the briefing! Get in your seats, guys!  
  
**Teacher：**  
Good day, girls.  
I'm glad to see everyone is present.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Ah... Well then.  
In advance of the special lesson,  
today I would like to introduce you all to your guest tutors.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh... Right, this lesson's being handled  
by some teachers from outside the school, huh.  
  
**Chieru：**  
What do you think they'll be like?  
Isn't this getting chellerific?!  
  
**Teacher：**  
Our guests today boast a wide range of achievements  
from the economic to the martial.  
 Allow me to introduce,  
from one of the most highly-valued guilds in all of Landosol...  
  
**Teacher：**  
...the ladies of the Mercurius Foundation!  
  
**Akino：**  
It's an honor to be able to visit the prestigious St. Theresa's Academy!  
In the name of the Mercurius Foundation,  
I thank you all for this opportunity!  
  
**Teacher：**  
My, my, how wonderful!  
Let's give a big hand to our special tutors, everyone!  
  
**Teacher：**  
By the way, the guildmaster, Miss Akino, is from your own generation.  
Please take this opportunity to learn the secrets of her youthful success!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Whew... I gotta say.  
I always thought I had some fancy pals myself, but assets in the trillions?  
Is that allowed outside of national coffers?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Nope, can't process those numbers.  
Way past the level where I can even, like, get jealous.  
It's just, uh, sure.  
 Go you. Pile it up. Swim in freakin' gold.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Still, our generation?  
Does this mean that she—young Akino, alongside her business—  
also attends another academy as a student like us?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, how would she even find time...?  
Well, I guess we can't rule it out. If anyone can handle it, it's her.  
Huh, where would she even go, though?  
  
**Chieru：**  
What school indeed?  
Like, over at Lucy AC,  
I guess I've seen a few energetic gals like her...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Chieru. I know the shock's killed your entire vocab,  
but there's no way we can write that monster off  
as just an \"energetic gal.\"  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yet the logic is sound.  
Alongside the whirlwind of talent and astounding status,  
I do sense a certain Lucentism from her.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, so. Spill it, {player}.  
You're a Lucy AC guy.  
I don't s'pose you've ever met an \"energetic gal\" like her?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Sure, I know her.  
`Tag 2`  
**Akino：**  
Oh!  
I thought I heard a voice I recognized.  
Could that figure in the crowd be my dear {player}?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ohhh! It *is* {player}!  
I was *nyot* expecting to see you here!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I know he tends to pop up everywhere,  
but even at a girls' academy...?  
  
**Yukari：**  
So much for the concept of gender boundaries.  
What brings you here, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm a special transfer student.  
**Choice: (4)**  I'm in the St. Theresa's Academy (Friendship Club  
**Choice: (5)**  I'm a Yuni-ette.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yukari：**  
Oh! I did hear that they've been considering going co-ed.  
Well, I suppose if any boy  
 can stay out of trouble here, it's you!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Um... So tell me, just how harmless a reputation have you built?  
Yukari's smile gives me the weirdest impression of implicit trust  
that goes way beyond logic or even sound judgment...  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 4`  
**Mifuyu：**  
\"Friendship Club\"?  
 Is that a new activity?  
Well, since it's you, I suppose there's no need to worry.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh... Wait, wait, wait, {player}.  
Say what. Why's the freakin' Dragon Slayer  
sound like she'd trust you with her life.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh? She trains you?  
 Since when?  
Wait, no way. So you're what, Mifuyu's apprentice?  
Huh... The Dragon Slayer's successor...  
 That's, uh... pretty cool.  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Tamaki：**  
I'm... nyot sure I quite understand.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Then I shall give a full explanyation.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Girl, back in your seat.  
C'mon, suck on this candy or something.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, hold up though. That stuff aside...  
Am I getting this right that you know all these gals personally?  
What the heck. That's hilarious. You creep.  
  
**Chieru：**  
How's this guy have, like, an actual infinite supply of girl-type friends?  
It's getting a li'l bit scary now. Right? It's not just me?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Such is his nature. We must make peace with the fact. I have long since  
accepted it. He could befriend princesses, royal knights, ghosts,  
or even legendary vampire overlords, and I wouldn't bat an eyelid.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I know all those.  
`Tag 7`  
**Yuni：**  
Uwaaaahhhh!  
Y-y-y-you do?! For reeeeal?!  
I wanna see them! Introduce me!  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh? This academy certainly is a lively place.  
I confess it's a little different from my expectations...  
  
**Teacher：**  
W-w-w-well, those three...  
 No, those four are, ah... unusual...  
C-come now, that's enough greetings! Shall we get to the point?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Well then, as for this Special Lesson in Entrepreneurial Spirit... Studying  
such an essential quality at a desk would be inefficient. Direct application  
is the greatest source of knowledge—that's what we believe.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Did you just say \"we\"? That was all you.  
  
**Chloe：**  
I can dig it.  
That's Dragon Slayer wisdom.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
That's why, just as Akino... I mean, our guildmaster Akino explained,  
we'd like you all to brainstorm for yourselves  
and present us with brand-new business ideas of your own.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Next time—at the special lesson itself,  
we hope to hear concepts filled with your fresh student spirit!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Business ideas full of...  
 student spirit...?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh boy.  
Here we go again with the vague assignments.  
  
**Yukari：**  
We'll ask you to give a brief verbal presentation,  
and we ourselves will act as judges  
to assess whether the concept seems likely to succeed.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'm nyot easy to satisfy!  
So you better bring a meowntain of taiyaki-based ideas!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Tamaki, be quiet.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hmmm. It's all so vague, there's not much to go on...  
But I guess we just use our flair  
to invent a shiny new product with a taiyaki twist?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Indeed.  
I'd set the taiyaki aside, myself,  
 but otherwise I would concur.  
  
**Chieru：**  
I've had thoughts about opening a shop of my own, you know!  
My latest idea is a cute new drink... Like maybe a milky tea,  
but with some kinda chewy little bubbles thrown in for texture!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Doesn't it sound wild?! Won't it be a hit?!  
It'll be my brand, full of never-seen-before originality!  
I'm thinking I'll name it  
 Tapi-Chelly Milk Tea!  
  
**Chloe：**  
The name killed my appetite.  
I don't wanna drink anything with \"chell\" in it.  
And what's a \"Tapi\"? Where'd that even come from.  
  
**Chieru：**  
From my heart!  
The muses of chelldom spoke to me!  
In other words, it's a 100% original idea! Copy it and I'll sue you!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm... Yes, I see. Study complete.  
I was just observing the judges' faces,  
 and they looked rather pleased.  
I surmise that young Chieru's daring inspiration fits our latest task well.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Original business ideas are the game.  
We must form a plan, espouse its merits, and win our tutors' full support.  
In the jargon of their kind, it's a funding pitch.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Which means?  
We're the entrepreneurs? Explaining our products?  
And the Merc gals are like our investors? So they judge us.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ohhh~! Yep, I get it!  
It does sound like a funding pitch. Well, a play-pitch.  
  
**Akino：**  
Ohohohoh!  
A play-pitch, you say? Perish the thought!  
  
**Chloe：**  
This gal's got one heckuva laugh, ain't she.  
And like, the heck? She making fun of us now?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Is there more to explain?  
`Tag 8`  
**Akino：**  
It is as you say, my dear!  
I never miss an opportunity!  
In other words, I spare no expense for fresh ideas!  
  
**Akino：**  
Now listen closely, dear students!  
The pitch you make to us will not be treated as play-pretend!  
  
**Friendship Club：**  
...?!  
  
**Akino：**  
If any of the business ideas you offer us  
are judged to be worthy of implementing in the market...  
  
**Akino：**  
We of the Mercurius Foundation  
will fund your concept and support its realization to completion!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Umm... So you're saying what...?  
  
**Akino：**  
Precisely what I mean.  
We will provide all necessary capital to initiate the venture,  
and assist in its administration  
 to the limits of our capacity!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Full financing guaranteed!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Support in every area!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh crap. This smells like the big rupies.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I won't deny that Akino can be nonchalant and unpredictable,  
but her sense for business opportunities is second to none!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
She saw the merit in my taiyaki stall, you knyow!  
  
**Akino：**  
The full support of House Wisteria, finest merchants on the continent!  
Can there be a greater opportunity?!  
Well, what do you say, my dear budding entrepreneurs?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uhhhh...  
Sorry, can you hold the phone a minute.  
  
**Chloe：**  
'Kay, Friendship Club emergency meeting.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Cheru~n!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yuni~n!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  {player}~n!  
`Tag 9`  
**Chloe：**  
This roll call scares me.  
  
**Chloe：**  
So? What's the verdict on this gig.  
The Merc gals are offering cash in spades,  
but like, are they for real? They'll fund students just like that?  
  
**Choice: (10)**  That's just who Akino is.  
`Tag 10`  
**Chieru：**  
Whew!  
 Who knew we'd find investors  
who'd fund a chelly nobody like me  
with nothing but good looks to her name?  
  
**Yuni：**  
No—nothing can be certain until the pitch is made.  
If this is indeed no game, I cannot imagine the judging will be lax.  
  
**Yuni：**  
But the fact remains that if we can win the Foundation's approval,  
a life of celebrity will be ours for the taking.  
In the terms of the layfolk, who needs scholarships anymore?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? Wait, is that true?  
Um, doesn't that change things from the ground up?  
Stuff like priorities, and motivation...  
 Like, big hype?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, it's a fight worth winning.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Indeed.  
My compatriots, we're in agreement.  
Failure in this endeavor is not an option.  
  
**Friendship Club：**  
On our honor as the Friendship Club!  
  
**Akino：**  
Hee hee. I can see this is going to be an interesting lesson.  
  
**Akino：**  
I hope you'll show me business ideas  
that are aflame with passion and originality,  
students of St. Theresa's!  
  
**Friendship Club：**  
Yeahhhhh!  
  
**Narration：**  
Never ones to pass up the scent of big bucks,  
the members of St. Theresa's Academy (Friendship Club)  
seemed passionate enough to spontaneously combust where they stood.
