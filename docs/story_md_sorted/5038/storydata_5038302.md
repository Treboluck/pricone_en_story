**Chloe：**  
Oh god.  
The lame-o scrap machine is back in action.  
How did this happen?  
  
**Yuni：**  
And with heavily increased energy levels and output.  
Dear me. I didn't expect this capacity for self-repair and learning.  
What impressive technology the Merc girls possess.  
  
**Chieru：**  
It's more infuriating than impressive!  
Why would they waste their skills on this stuff?!  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
CHERU~N! ☆  
CHEPPERICO CHELLERY-POO CHEPPY-LAPPA!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh?  
What's all this noise.  
 It doesn't make a damn lick of—  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wha...?! How can you say such awful things, Friendbot X?!  
No... we won't let you get away with it!  
We'll protect St. Theresa's Academy no matter what you say!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh? What did the bot say.  
Why'd you suddenly go all dramatic, Chieru?  
Was the stuff it said that outrageous?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Dear me. Even its Chellish skills have increased in strength.  
Young Chieru, young Chloe, we must reduce it to dust  
before it grows any stronger.  
 Yuni-ettes, full steam ahead!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yes, that's right!  
Friendship Club, full steam ahead!
