**Narration：**  
At the special lesson's initial briefing...  
After hearing the details of the lesson from Akino and co.,  
the students of St. Theresa's sit stunned, unsure of how to proceed.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. I see, I see.  
 If we have an inspired idea,  
they'll put the Foundation's financial might behind it.  
So that's the concept of this lesson.  
  
**Yuni：**  
With no results yet to speak of, new startups struggle to secure funding,  
prompting them to seek the fickle approval of \"angel investors.\"  
In our own case, these ladies may be just the angels we need.  
  
**Chloe：**  
The Angelic Dragon Slayer...  
Legend-killer of the heavens...  
Huh. I like it.  
  
**Chieru：**  
So, we only signed up thanks to Mother Hilda's abuse of power,  
but this turned out to be our ticket to fame and fortune!  
Forget manna from heaven, it's a goose that's laying golden manna!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Did that last one need to be manna?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Don't sweat the deets, girl!  
 School events like this one  
are usually just hours of super-boring lectures  
or hours of writing super-boring reports, you know?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Mm-hm.  
Well, by those standards, I guess a one-and-done pitch  
where results translate into riches is a miracle.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, right... All we need is results... Huh? Huh?  
Then don't we have a winner already?  
 Can't we just use that?  
You know, the Doc's pet.  
 That rock she uses as a paperweight...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah—Rosetta.  
 Hrm. Come to think of it, that improvised quasi-golem  
is a twisted creation—ahem—a unique technological feat that only my  
reclusion—  
ahem—my unique lifestyle could create. It would qualify, yes.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Really.  
Uh, then aren't we done? We've got big results.  
Damn. Battle won before it starts. Nothing left to do.  
  
**Akino：**  
Now...  
That concludes our briefing on the lesson.  
Some of you may be confused, but the key point is very simple.  
  
**Akino：**  
The will to try new things!  
As students looking to the future,  
we hope you will show us your freshest new aspirations!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh? Is that Akino gal looking straight in our direction?  
Uh, why. The heck. Doc, put that in layfolkese.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. Fresh aspirations... Not just results, but the journey...  
Yes, I see.  
It seems she's warning us not to rest on our laurels.  
  
**Yuni：**  
This isn't a business per se, but a lesson in business.  
In business, results are everything, but not so in learning.  
The Foundation must be deferring to their client's wishes.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Their client?  
 Oh, you mean the school.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Indeed.  
 Accursed academy.  
They must have warned these tutors to beware of our methods.  
  
**Chloe：**  
That does sound like Mother Hilda.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ol' Hildy's been one step ahead of us lately, hasn't she?  
  
**Akino：**  
One last thing.  
In this special lesson, your methods are as important as the results.  
Along with your pitch, we'll need each of you to submit a full report!  
  
**Chieru：**  
...That's what the client told you to say,  
 huh?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hmph. A methodology report?  
They expect me to map my mental processes?  
How impudent. Has this academy never heard of intellectual privacy?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Really, it's just a huge pain.  
A report... so like, an essay-type thing?  
I've never been great at that kind of stuff...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Just how much time are they forcing us to spend on this?  
Are we students or serfs? In this modern age? Is that even legal?  
  
**Yuni：**  
I agree, young Chieru, but this is not labor.  
Regrettably, our nation's reforms have yet to reach the education system.  
In the terms of the layfolk, we have to grin and bear it.  
  
**Friendship Club：**  
Sigh...
