**Yuni：**  
Hrm... The atmosphere is warm and humidity reduced.  
As a result, my body temperature has increased  
and I feel a strong desire to moisten my palate.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Lotta words to say you're thirsty.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Here—I've got a jelly pack.  
  
**Chieru：**  
I really don't know where you always pull those snacks out from.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh... Well... I'm always dealing with cheeky brats at home, so.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yaaay! Jelly! So sweeet!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, I see. So that's how you tame them.  
Hmm...? Yuni's not exactly a foodie, though,  
so will it really be effective on her?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Sweet...  
 Hmm? It's only sweet?  
Young Chloe. What exactly is this substance?  
Reveal its nutritional information.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh? Uhh...  
I dunno.  
 Probably just sugar and gelatin mostly?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Why, that's just cheap candy!  
  
**Chieru：**  
What exactly did you think it was?  
  
**Yuni：**  
What exactly do you take me for?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Enough what-exactlys. C'mon, let's get moving.
