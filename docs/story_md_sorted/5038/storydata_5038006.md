# The Friendship Formation
The Friendship Club girls take to the field of battle to stop the rampaging Friendbot X. By demonstrating their unbreakable bonds of friendship to neutralize the machine, they succeed in defending the academy.
  
## Subtitle: The Friendship Formation
  
**Narration：**  
Friendbot X, a monstrosity born from the Mercurius Foundation  
in all their Chellurious glory, has gone out of control upon activation  
and begun annihilating everything its lasers of destruction can reach.  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
CHELUPPER, CHELLERELLY, CHELLO-LARELLO!  
  
**Student 1：**  
Aaaahhhh?!  
M-my, what is this? It feels as though the academy is shaking!  
  
**Student 2：**  
I hear tell that a gigantic fellow is causing chaos outside in the courtyard!  
And what's more, he assaults all who approach with ghastly disses!  
The academy is in peril! We must witness this for ourselves!  
  
**Student 3：**  
Whaaa...? I gotta say all that \"chelly-relly\" talk  
sounds kinda familiar...  
 Couldn't be... right?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pff... So what's the plan here.  
Looks like we're starting to draw a crowd.  
  
**Yuni：**  
The few remaining students must have noticed all the commotion.  
This saves us the trouble of gathering them to evacuate,  
but I fear coming here will not save them from danger.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Now, my friends, what say you?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, don't look at me.  
Guess the obvious plan would be  
to give the great big bot a great big bashing.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well, yes, I'm sure it would!  
But how do we bash that thing?!  
Will our sweet maidenly fists even leave a scratch on that steel chassis?!  
  
**Akino：**  
Have no fear!  
The Foundation will take full responsibility for this calamity!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah! Young Akino!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Well... yes.  
We can't allow ourselves to leave a stain on this academy's fine history.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
The Meow-curius Foundation is a guild of elites!  
You can count on us to sort this out!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Mifuyu...! Tamaki, too...!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Haha.  
 It's time for you to watch how the grown-ups get things done.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Even the Ouroboros...!  
  
**Yukari：**  
...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Um, who? Ouro...  
 Huh? Say what?  
  
**Chloe：**  
The Ouroboros.  
The other day, I finally remembered.  
Knew I recognized that face of yours from somewhere, Yukari.  
  
**Chloe：**  
A while back, on one of my one-off jobs...  
 uh, I mean, volunteer gigs...  
there was this crazy lady who emptied the whole cellar of barley broth.  
The manager said: \"Forget fish, that girl drinks like a freakin' Ouroboros.\"  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ouroboros. The snake that consumes its own tail.  
 The alpha and omega;  
the great singularity; symbol of infinity. It has represented many things,  
but a heavy drinker is a new innovation indeed! Let me write that down.  
  
**Ouroboros：**  
...Wh-whatever could you mean? You must have the wrong person.  
  
**Ouroboros：**  
Also... did you need to bring that up at this of all times?  
 I mean—  
you know? We had some momentum going. And now it's stopped dead!  
See, everyone's eyes have glazed over!  
 I-it's not what you think, Tamaki!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyo, I didn't say anything.  
It's way too late for that.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Why can this guild never manage to keep up a serious mood...?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'll fight together with you guys!  
`Tag 1`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh, no.  
I appreciate the offer, but you're a student here.  
This is an order—stay back and protect your schoolfellows.  
  
**Chloe：**  
S-so cool...  
You're way too cool, Slayer lady...  
  
**Akino：**  
Now, let's get moving!  
Mifuyu, Tamaki, Ouroboros!  
  
**Tamaki, Yukari & Mifuyu：**  
Yeah!

**Friendbot X：**  
CHERURURU...  
Targets Approaching. Four Hostiles.  
Initiating Defensive Protocols.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Taaake... this!  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Target: Tamaki.  
Target-Specific Counter: Taiyaki Cannon. Fire.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Mya-myah?!  
It's taiyaki!  
You can't waste that!  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Too Chellin' Easy.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myaugh?!  
I-I was bamboozled...  
  
**Chloe：**  
A taiyaki cannon. Huh. The hell's that for.  
  
**Akino：**  
Tamaki insisted  
 \"This is a nyecessity!\"  
and added it to the blueprints on her own initiative!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Geez... What do you call that, Tamaki?  
I guess I'm up next... Friendbot X!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Haaaahhhh!  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Target: Yukari.  
Target-Specific Counter: Barley Broth Splash. Fire.  
  

---  
  
**Yukari：**  
Yeaugh! Buegh?! This is... Noooo!  
Ahhh... now I'm feelin' all floaty...  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
One Second Flat. LMAO.  
  
**Yukari：**  
*hic*... I-I can'h dhrink another drhop...!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Umm...  
 What was that?  
  
**Akino：**  
That's the outlandish weapon Yukari scribbled on the blueprints  
while in barley-broth mode.  
 Why we took it seriously and constructed it  
to perfection... That's a question we must all ask ourselves later.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Both of you are so hopeless...  
But you won't be finding any obvious weaknesses with me!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Now... En garde! Friendbot X!  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Target: Mifuyu.  
Target-Specific Counter: Jewel Shield. Deploy.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh? Precious gems?  
...Ah! If I get those,  
I can efficiently compensate for all of today's damages!  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
You're Wide Chellin' Open.  
  

---  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Aaaaghhh!  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, heavens! Why did you look away, Mifuyu?!  
If I knew this would happen, I would never have used Friendbot X  
as a convenient storage container for my spare jewel stash!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh-huh. Talk about a parade of unforced errors.  
Can you at least avoid the ones that make the Dragon Slayer look bad.  
  
**Tamaki, Yukari & Mifuyu：**  
Oooohhhh...!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ummm...  
So you guys went out there sounding all confident and stuff,  
but that all fell apart in record time, huh. Still in one piece?  
  
**Akino：**  
Friendbot X... You are more skilled than I expected.  
As I thought, we were not mistaken to see a spark of promise  
in the Friendship Club's original ideas!  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Main Cannon: Charging Energy.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Nooooo!  
This is un-good!  
The big bot's trying to fire off another massive FSHOOM!  
  
**Akino：**  
...So it would seem.  
I will handle this one myself.  
Members of the Friendship Club, flee to safety while you can!  
  
**Chloe：**  
On your own? Quit splittin' my sides.  
Now, I think it's our turn to—  
  
**Akino：**  
Stuff and nonsense, my dear Chloe!  
Are we not the world-renowned Mercurius Foundation?!  
Take your amusing jokes elsewhere, or I really will have to...  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Target: Akino.  
Main Cannon: Fire.  
  

---  
  

---  
  
**Akino：**  
...split this to the sides!  
 Ohohohoho!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ahhh! Incredible!  
Akino bisected the beam down the center!  
  

---  
  
**Tamaki, Yukari & Mifuyu：**  
Haaaahhhh!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Even her Foundation allies are mustering their remaining strength!  
This is the power of friendship... Heart and soul...  
The magic of youth incarnate!  
  
**Akino：**  
N-now, members of the Friendship Club!  
It is time you fled to safety!  
  
**Chloe：**  
So she says. What's the call?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  We stay and fight!  
`Tag 2`  
**Yuni：**  
Indeed! In this moment, I am deeply inspired.  
My friends, we must match their passion in kind!  
Blare your inner opening themes, and let's crush that titan together!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, if you say so.  
Basically what I was planning anyway.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Time for some Friendship Club activities!  
 Cheru~n! ☆  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, you girls...!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Nice. The big robo beam ran outta juice.  
Let's get up close and personal...!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Merc ladies, you can take a short recess!  
We'll need you to jump in again at the next FSHOOM!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Now, let our youth commence! Yuni-ettes, onward ho!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Lend them your power.  
`Tag 3`  
**Friendship Club：**  
Hiyaaahhhh!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Tch... So tough! You kiddin' me?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
No waaay!  
Are our attacks even doing anything?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. How awkward.  
For all our redoubled motivation, the foe stands firm.  
I fear we won't get anywhere without a clear plan.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  The Friendship Club doesn't lose!  
`Tag 4`  
**Friendbot X：**  
The-Friend-Ship-Club-Does-Not-Lose...?  
Gu-guh... Cheru... Chelurelly... Che...?  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Huh?  
Did it just bug out for some reason?  
  
**Yuni：**  
That reaction... Friendbot X's artificial ego  
was disturbed by the words young {player} spoke...?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm... Young Akino.  
Friendbot X's core is formed from my Yunicopter, is that correct?  
  
**Akino：**  
W-well... yes, that's true...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Which means...  
 Oh, right!  
Like the 'copter, it's got some really dumb design flaws, huh?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
E-ehm. Well, you do have the right idea,  
but I'm not sure I'd choose to put it quite that way. Hrm...  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
The-Friend-Ship-Club... Gu-guh... Frien... d... ship...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Friendship...?  
Aha! I see it now!  
Friendship itself is the key!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh?  
What's this new brand of dumb?  
You chelled your own head up, Doc?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. Yes, that right there. Take that sardonic tone.  
Friendbot X's personality  
is modelled upon Chloe, the Insult Queen.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, for the...  
I mean, yeah, but like...  
  
**Chieru：**  
It's not really got the right idea of her there, has it?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Correct—it is flawed.  
Chloe may appear an Insult Queen on the surface,  
but that isn't her true nature.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Similarly, its view of the Friendship Club itself must be flawed.  
To this robot, the Friendship Club is a cursed hive of mutual abuse.  
  
**Yuni：**  
No, it absolutely must be so. The machine is inflexible.  
The notion of us standing united in friendship  
contradicts its foundations. That must be what's causing this error.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh. How d'you figure that.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Can you simplify that into one sentence?  
  
**Yuni：**  
The robot's weakness is friendship!  
  
**Chieru & Chloe：**  
Gotcha!  
  
**Akino：**  
Wait, they understood her from that?!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  They're the best of friends, after all.  
`Tag 5`  
**Yuni：**  
Now, my friends! Let's begin the clash anew!  
Initiate Final Operation: Declaration of Friendship!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, first I've heard of that.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Guess I'll leave the nitty-gritty deets for you to work out.  
Me, I'll just dive in and scrap some metal!  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Damage Pitiful.  
Initiating Interception Algorithm.  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Chatterbox Mode—Target: Chloe.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm?!  
 Steel yourself, young Chloe!  
It means to unleash the psychological assault that disabled Mother Hilda  
in a matter of seconds...!  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Your Face Is Too Scary. Children Would Cry At Less.  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Huh.  
So? Like, I know that. No point telling me now.  
...As if I care.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ohhh!  
As expected of the utterly implacable Chloe Ironheart!  
The mental attack is entirely ineffe...  
 Huh? It isn't working, is it?  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Sweet-'N'-Sour. Slum-Ass Loser. Wears Her Uniform To Bed.  
Thinks She's So Cool. Goes \"Dere\" For Peanuts. Basically Just A Waifu.  
In A Landosol Bad Naming Sense Contest, She'd Break The Point Chart.  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Y-you can't faze me... Why the hell should I care...?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Not good. This unending rush of verbal abuse  
is bringing tears even to young Chloe's eyes.  
  
**Chieru：**  
What does that hunk of metal even think it's doing?  
All those things are what's cute about Chloe,  
so they're not insults, they're compliments!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Indeed. Her harsh demeanor and inner sweetness are one and the same.  
Like the boxed feline, perceiving one side only collapses her true essence.  
In the terms of the layfolk, she's cool and cute with a bow on top!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Go on— you too, {player}!  
Shower Chloe with compliments already!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  You're as cool as you are cute!  
`Tag 6`  
**Chloe：**  
Huh?!  
Wha—You creep—Huh?—What're you even—You creep!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh? No, uh, I mean... I'm not saying *don't* say it.  
So, like, go on. Since it's the plan and all. Keep saying it if you want.  
I mean, uh, just to make sure. Let's hear it one more time. Yeah.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Pushover much?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Really now, young Chloe.  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Chloe Is... Cute... Gu-guh... Gahh...!  
  
**Akino：**  
It's really working!  
 Ah, I see... Its weakness is friendship!  
Displaying the very opposite of the club's true brutal nature...  
So this is your secret stratagem—Operation: Declaration of Friendship!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Do you, like, take our guild for  
some kind of den of society's demons?  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Adjusting Victim.  
Target: Chieru.  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
God, Quit It With The Humblebrags.  
Everyone Wants To Punch You.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ohhhh, sure. The old \"everyone's thinking it\"!  
Yes, yes, I know the spiel. Oof, big ouch.  
But sorry, botster! I hear that kinda salt every day, so—  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Public Nuisance #1. Peddler Of The Inane. Failed Idol Who Thinks She's  
A Comic. Probably Drops The Act At Home. Broken Sound Record. One-  
Gag Wonder. Reality Says Hi, Bitch. Will You Still Be Like This At Thirty?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Haaaghhh?! This icky piece of junk!  
I'm not looking at that metal face for another second!  
Kill me. I feel sick. Gonna barf. Going home now.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Calm yourself, young Chieru. I don't view you as such.  
Your unique spirit allows you to brighten any scene like no other.  
In the field of social prowess, even I stand to learn much from you.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Mm, yeah. Don't hate having you around. Like, when life's a drag,  
we all need a raving weirdo to keep us on our toes, don't we?  
C'mon, you straight-talk her too, {player}.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I always have fun when you're around!  
`Tag 7`  
**Chieru：**  
Huh...? A-are you sure?  
People don't tell me that out loud much...  
Heheh. It's kinda nice to hear, actually.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Pushover much?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Get a load of that girl.  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Chieru... Fun...? Gah... Gagagaga...!  
  
**Akino：**  
Its vibrations are growing!  
Everyone, I think you're almost there!  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Adjusting Victim: Yuni.  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Flat As A Board.  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Young Chloe, what is this machine saying?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Don't turn to me like I'm some kinda professional insult analyst.  
But, well... I think it's taking jabs at your physical development.  
Or lack of it.  
  
**Yuni：**  
That's... an insult...?  
  
**Yuni：**  
*sigh* A dated perspective from a bygone age. And woefully  
short-sighted. The body is but a shell and mouthpiece for the soul.  
In this world, physical size serves to differentiate, not to divide.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Besides, I'm still a growing youth. Why mock the bud before it blooms?  
Dear me—it seems this scientifically-minded dud  
never stood a chance of disturbing the serene waters of my heart.  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Don't Kid Yourself, Runt. Your Growing Days Are Over.  
  
**Yuni：**  
What did you just say?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't rise to cheap taunts.  
Everybody knows you're way more grown-up than you look.  
  
**Chieru：**  
That's right! Our li'l Yuni isn't just itty-bitty and adorable!  
She teaches me lots of complicated stuff even I never knew!  
Go on—you tell her too, {player}!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  You're always educating me, Yuni.  
`Tag 8`  
**Yuni：**  
Whaaa? Really, now, are you sure?  
Learning from me? Gueheheh.  
Spare me the empty praises. Muohohoh.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pushover much?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wow, she's down so bad.  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Yuni... Intelligent...  
Friend... Ship... Club... Best... Of ... Friends...?  
  
**Akino：**  
It's come to a halt and it's leaking smoke!  
We just need one last push!  
End it with a decisive No Insult, members of the Friendship Club!  
  
**Friendship Club：**  
Haaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Friendship Club：**  
The Friendship Club...  
  
**Choice: (9)**  ...are the best of friends!  
`Tag 9`  
**Friendbot X：**  
The Friend... Ship... Club... All-The-Best-Of-Friends...  
CHERU~N... CHERU... CHERA... CHELLO...  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
CHELLARALLY RULLERELLO LOPPER  
CHEMIPPY LULUMI CHEPPYPO  
CHELLUPEEPALOO CHE-CHERU~N!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pff...  
 That's a wrap.  
  
**Akino：**  
Why, you did it!  
Friendbot X has been entirely disabled!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes.  
'Tis a victory for the bonds of the Yuni-ettes.  
  
**Chieru：**  
That's true.  
It's a victory for the bonds of St. Theresa's Academy (Friendship Club).  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Are we forgetting something...?  
`Tag 10`  
**Friendbot X：**  
Logic Conflict Irresolvable.  
Fatal Error Detected.  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Hrm?  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Initiating Self-Destruct.  
Begin Countdown. 60...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Aaaahhhh!  
Of course! This makes it explode, doesn't it?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Calm yourselves, my friends.  
Let's take the collapsed Tamaki and co. and carry them to safety.  
Fear not; we have a generous sixty seconds to—  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Fifty-Nine... Fifty-Eight... Ugh, Screw It. Ten... Nine...  
  
**Chieru：**  
The bot just skipped half the countdown!  
Why do you do these things, Chloe?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Please don't look at me.  
Actually...  
Uh, do we even have time to be messing around?  
  
**Chieru：**  
That's what I'm trying to tell you!  
This is the big bad! We're talking certain death with no backsies!  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Eight... Seven...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrmm... Too late to flee, I fear.  
At this point, our only chance may be  
to dampen the explosion by destroying its energy source...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, like, sure, but who's doing that?  
  
**Akino：**  
...!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah... Young Akino...?!  
  
**Choice: (11)**  What are you doing?!  
`Tag 11`  
**Akino：**  
We need to destroy its power source, yes?  
Then leave this to me!  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Six... Five...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Wait. At least let me finish!  
If you do that, you'll be far too close to escape the—  
  
**Akino：**  
I do not care!  
As the guildmaster of the Mercurius Foundation...  
No, as a special tutor at St. Theresa's, it's my duty!  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Four...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
M... mnhh...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ahh! Akino, what are you...?!  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Three...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Huh?! Akino, you mustn't!  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Two...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Akinoooo!  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
One...  
  
**Akino：**  
Farewell, my friends!  
This is how I... the great Akino Wisteria...  
choose to live my life with priiiiiide!  
  
**Choice: (12)**  Akino!  
`Tag 12`  
**Friendship Club：**  
Akinoooo!

**Chloe：**  
I can't believe she did it...  
  
**Chieru：**  
But... she went out as she lived... Like a boss.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ahh, such passion and fervor.  
I can't restrain my metaphysical tears...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Akino... You made us all proud...!  
  
**Yukari：**  
I'll offer a pint of barley broth to you every day!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
You can leave the Meow-curius Foundation to us...  
I'll make it the finest taiyaki business Landosol's ever seen...!  
  
**All：**  
Oh, Akino!  
  
**All：**  
At least rest in peace...!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Isn't this super touching...?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
A myagnificent finale for the ages...  
  
**Narration：**  
Thus St. Theresa's was saved from an explosive end.  
But the price for their victory was all too high.  
Shine on, Akino Wisteria... The world will never forget you!

**Akino：**  
*cough*... *cough*...!  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Ah.  
  
**Akino：**  
Ahhh...  
 That explosion was wilder than I expected!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wow. She's alive.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Shocker of the year.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Indeed.  
This outcome seemed frankly inevitable.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Guess having a trillion roops makes you literally invincible!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyope, Akino was just born tough.  
Even with Yukari's sacred protection,  
most people wouldn't survive that without a scratch.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Our guildmaster really is on another level.  
But what a relief!  
Everyone's safe, and the biggest problem is out of the way.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yes, that's true...  
All that's left is... the state...  
 of the school...  
  
**Akino：**  
Business ideas that are literally aflame with passion!  
You've delivered exactly what I first asked for,  
students of St. Theresa's Academy!  
  
**Akino：**  
Ohohohoho!  
  
**Narration：**  
And though the school building burned merrily on in the background,  
nothing could sully the Wisteria heiress's delighted laugh.
