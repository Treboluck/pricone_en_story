## Subtitle: Friendbot X Mk. II
  
**Yuni：**  
Hah! Hahah! It's complete!  
It's finally complete, my friend!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Now, feast your eyes.  
This is my Friendbot X Mk. II.  
The culmination of all we have learned from this latest experience!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's a bit... smaller than the old one.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuni：**  
Indeed. The first flaw I identified with the old model was its sheer bulk.  
It's not a military weapon,  
 so why should it be such a titan?  
In the terms of the layfolk... I don't have the Foundation's vast resources.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Of course, this miniaturization isn't a mere compromise.  
The old adage may go that bigger is better, but I would argue otherwise.  
Each of this model's components is far more refined than the original's.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Take the taiyaki cannon. My version reflects the latest market research.  
It anticipates and prevents all conflicts resulting from matters of taste.  
In the terms of the layfolk, you can choose a smooth or lumpy filling.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hahah.  
I see you're surprised. Your jaw hangs slack and agape.  
But this isn't all I've improved—far from it!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Take the Barley Broth Splash.  
To avoid over-intoxication, after a certain level of usage, this model's  
Health Defense Protocol replaces the booze with an actual warm broth.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Next, the original's star feature: Chatterbox Mode.  
In response to the recent fad for pets,  
I've upgraded this function into the superior Walkies Mode.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Upon detecting nearby motion, it will follow behind its owner,  
maintaining a safe distance while crying \"Cheru~n! ☆\" all the while.  
A veritable walkie-talkie. Heheh.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Well, this was fun.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm? Wait, wait. Hold on a second.  
Where are you going? There are still so many features left to explain.  
What? Lessons?  
 Ah yes, ordinary students must attend to such things...  
  
**Yuni：**  
So be it, then.  
Come, Friendbot X Mk. II, follow along behind our friend.  
Make sure he takes good care of you.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm?  
 No, no, it's quite all right.  
You helped a great deal with this model's development...  
And to be frank, I created it for you from the beginning.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm...  
Well, the point is, I wanted to thank you...  
In the terms of the layfolk, it's what you'd call a present.  
  
**Yuni：**  
As my research assistant... no, as my first ever friend,  
you've given me so much support, both mental and physical.  
  
**Yuni：**  
And yet, as you may know, I'm not adept at expressing emotion.  
I'm not so childish as to be embarrassed by words of gratitude,  
but I'm rarely able to find the appropriate timing to offer them.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Both in the past and on into the future,  
there'll surely be times when I fail to offer the thanks you deserve.  
That's why, as a substitute, I'd like you to have this gift.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well, I sadly can't vouch for whether it will be to your tastes,  
but that falls beyond my realm of responsibility.  
All the literature assures me it's the thought that counts.  
  
**Yuni：**  
This one-of-a-kind creation is the product of my efforts.  
It would please me greatly if you'd kindly accept it.  
  
**Yuni：**  
In the terms of the layfolk, you're a valued friend. *bow*
