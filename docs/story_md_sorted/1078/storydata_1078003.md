The Gourmet Guild is taking a quick rest at the beach. Karyl, noticing Kokkoro is asleep, does her best not to wake her, to which Pecorine teases Karyl about being much more caring than when they first met.

A few hours later...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Phew... We sure did go wild there. ♪

**Karyl：**  
Hee hee.  
I was pretty pissed about the sorry state of this situation,  
but it's actually turning out to be real fun.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Makes all the effort I spent to clear up work early worth it.  
Always something nice about getting away from the city  
and enjoying time at a place like this.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Didn't think I'd use quite this much magic, though...  
I knew I'd have to expend some on myself, but Koro and  
{player} not being able to swim as well came as a surprise.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That spell that lets them walk underwater is a  
Karyl original,  
but it's still in the experimental phase.  
Using it as it is drains my energy pretty quick.  
  
**Karyl：**  
And that's taking its toll on me now, in fact.  
They're enjoying themselves thanks to it though, so I don't mind.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Feels nice to do something nice.  
Here's hoping the whole vacation winds up this peaceful.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl!  
I got us some drinks! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The ones you had, uh, stored in your bracelet?  
Those are all out, so I figured we should restock!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Look, look! That beachside cafe opened this afternoon.  
They've got stuff like yakisoba and cool tropical drinks!  
How crazy is that?!

**Karyl：**  
Hey.  
Keep it down a bit, okay?  
Koro's sound asleep over here.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Zzz... Zzz...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh?  
Oops! Sorry about that!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hehe.  
Your lap must be real comfy, Karyl.  
Look at that adorable little face of hers... ♪

`image display end`  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh gosh, her cheeks are so squishy.  
I wanna poke them... Poke, poke. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey now.  
This is her first time at the beach, so she's exhausted.  
Let her have her rest.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Mmm...  
Mnhhh. My lord...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Waugh...?  
D-did I...  
Did I fall asleep, perchance?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Look, you went and woke her up.  
Feel free to go back to sleep, Koro.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
H-huh?  
I was sleeping your lap...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please accept my apologies!  
I know full well how adverse you are to others touching you...  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're still a kid, so don't sweat it.  
Besides. I'm fine if it's you guys.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhh! I heard that loud and clear!  
And I'll take it as the go sign to hug you as much as I want!  
Hug, hug! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Sorry. Lemme correct myself.  
I'm fine with people that aren't super annoying. Like you.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Your words! They wound me so!  
That said,  
you're much kinder now than when  
we first met, Karyl. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Give it a few more months,  
and you'll be the one begging *me* for hugs...!  
Don't worry. I'll be sure to reciprocate when that time comes. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Keep dreaming, Dumborine.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Dumborine?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're Pecorine. You're dumb. Thus, you're Dumborine.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aww, come on!  
You can't just change my nickname like that!  
Things'll just get confusing!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hehe.  
That said, I'm glad we can have back-and-forths like this now.  
You were kind of scary when we first met, Karyl.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Really?  
I don't think I've changed that much since then, to be honest.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You really, really have.  
Right, {player}? ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh.  
You went with her to buy stuff, huh?  
Good work, my loyal servant.  
Now bequeath thy goods unto your master. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Koro here went and fell asleep on my lap, as you can see,  
so I've been stuck here under the boiling sun the whole time.  
I'm about five seconds away from dehydration now.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Come on, hurry up.  
Less staring, more handing over the goods.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Pass her a drink.  
**Choice: (2)**  Pour it over her.  
`Tag 1`  
**Karyl：**  
Attaboy.  
Thanks for that.  
  
**Karyl：**  
*gulp, gulp* Ahhh, now that hit the spot...  
Nothing like enjoying a nice tropical drink at the beach.  
I might just forget we've barely even left Landosol.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Karyl：**  
Waough?!  
Oh my GOD. You're done for. I'm gonna kill you dead!  
  
**Karyl：**  
What is it with you and your weird antics sometimes?  
And don't gimme any of that amnesia crap!  
I know you've got some common sense in that head by now!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...What?  
You poured water over me 'cause you were worried about me getting dehydrated?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ohhh...  
You bought regular old mineral water along with  
those tropical drinks, and that's what you poured over me?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I mean, it definitely cooled me off a bit...  
But I'd much rather drink water, you know.  
You *did* try to help, though, so I won't complain.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe. Pleased to see the two of you getting along so well.  
Now that we're well rested, what say  
we go for another swim while the sun is still up?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aren't you the energetic little one?  
I'm definitely down! The ocean is practically calling us over! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm...  
Sorry. I need a bit more rest,  
so you guys go on ahead. I'll watch from here.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Really?  
It kind of feels like we're leaving you out of the fun if we do that...  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's cool. I know that's not the case, so get going.  
I'm just a frail, old mage. I don't have the same stamina as you  
frontline fighters, especially with my magic reserves all drained.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't worry.  
I'll be right there after I get some rest.  
'Cause I wanna make the most of the beach myself, too. ♪
