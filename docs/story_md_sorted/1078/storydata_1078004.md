## Subtitle: I'm a Lot Happier Than You Think
  
**Narration：**  
A little over an hour later...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Zzz... Zzz...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Mmm...  
Oh. Guess I fell asleep.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Shoot. I forgot to put on sunscreen.  
Getting in the bath is gonna be tough  
after I've been roasted this much.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Sunburn's just a less extreme version of a regular old burn, though.  
I can just heal it with magic if it comes to it.  
  
**Karyl：**  
*yawn*  
Sleeping around this time's left my head feeling kinda fuzzy.  
  
**Karyl：**  
How long was I out for?  
I'll be mad if I spent precious time sleeping instead of having fun.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Then again, I was a lot more exhausted than I thought.  
And no wonder,  
considering all the sleep I lost powering away at work.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Makes sense that my body'd make up for it here.  
Ugh. What am I? Some kid that was too excited for their field trip?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Good morning, Karyl.  
`Tag 1`  
**Karyl：**  
Hm? Oh, {player}. Morning.  
What're you doing hanging around here on your own?  
Where'd Pecorine and Koro go?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  They went to the cove over there.  
`Tag 2`  
**Karyl：**  
Cove?  
Huh. Pecorine's teaching Koro how to swim there,  
'cause it's nice and shallow and waves won't get in?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well then.  
You sure you weren't better off joining them, though? You kind of  
forgot how to swim thanks to your amnesia, didn't you?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ohhh. I get it now.  
You didn't want to leave me behind, did you?  
That's why you stayed while they went off.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm pretty much wide open while asleep.  
Not like there's anyone else here right now,  
but who's to say when some pervo or monsters could turn up.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Guess I ought to thank you, then.  
Except it's... kinda embarrassing to just say it outright.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Have some water.  
`Tag 3`  
**Karyl：**  
Hm?  
O-oh.  
Did you buy this for me?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Great.  
My throat's parched, so I probably got a bit dehydrated while  
I was asleep.  
No surprise, considering how hot out it is.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Awfully thoughtful, aren't we?  
You did well, my loyal vassal.  
  
**Karyl：**  
No, that's not right...  
I need to thank him properly.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ummm, {player}. I, uh...  
I wanted to, well, say tha—  
  
**Karyl：**  
Whoa?!  
What's with the light show all of a sudden?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ugh, it's so bright...  
Come on, I was just about to say thanks!  
Don't just start shining out of nowhere!

**Kiruya：**  
La la laaa. ♪  
Which. One. Should. I. Go. For...?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Hm... This one? Might be a bit too racy.  
...Hold up. That's expensive.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Can I even afford it? Let's see how much I have on me.  
One, two, three... Just barely, I guess?  
But spending all my money here would kinda defeat the purpose.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
On the flip side,  
I'm gonna get laughed at if I take my school swimsuit.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Hm...  
Maybe I should just cut my losses and  
go look somewhere cheaper?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Ughhh.  
This wouldn't even be an issue if that cheapskate  
I call a mom would just give me some money!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Huh... Hey,  
you!  
Yeah, you with the dumb face!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
{player}, was it?  
What're you doing in the trendy part of town?  
You're way out of place, buddy!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I live close by.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kiruya：**  
Well then. Color me surprised.  
That's a Tsubakigaoka uniform you're wearing, isn't it?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Not like I actually care or anything.  
More importantly, you actually came at a pretty good time.  
How about sparing me some cash?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
There's a field trip to Okinawa coming up at my school.  
So here I am, trying to find myself a nice swimsuit.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
We're allowed to dress how we want during the trip,  
swimsuit included, so I wanna be nice and trendy.  
Especially when everyone else'll be doing the same.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
I'm kinda strapped for cash, though.  
And these prices don't give me much leeway.  
I want the best I can get, so come on. Just a bit'll do.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
I'll pay you back, too. I swear.  
Please?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Meh. Figures.  
You might be way too nice for your own good,  
but no one's just gonna give money to some random middle schooler.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
It's fine. I just wanted to try my luck.  
Not like I thought it'd actually pan out.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Oh well. Kind of related, but are you free right now?  
Mind helping me pick something out if you are?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Take a look around. This place is overrun with couples.  
I don't wanna be the only weirdo here on my own.  
That, plus I've kind of lost track of what's appealing and what isn't.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
That's not too much to ask, is it?  
Not that I'll force you if you're busy, though.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  So be it.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kiruya：**  
Sounding a bit haughty there, my dude.  
Not that I mind.

**Kiruya：**  
Lemme ask, then.  
Which one do you think suits me best?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  That one with the cat pattern is pretty cute.  
**Choice: (7)**  How about going with something more revealing?  
`Tag 6`  
![107800402.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/107800402.webp)  
**Kiruya：**  
You mean this one?  
I mean, it is cute...  
But it'd make me look like a kid, wouldn't it?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Hell, it IS for kids!  
Can you seriously not tell the difference?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Or maybe, just maybe,  
that's how you actually see me?  
  
Jump to tag 8  
`Tag 7`  
![107800403.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/107800403.webp)  
**Kiruya：**  
Uhhh... Are you for real?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
God. No way.  
You have got to be kidding.  
Just look at this. It'll barely cover anything!  
You'll catch me dead before I wear this!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Do me a favor and take this seriously,  
'cause I sure am!  
  
`Tag 8`  
`image display end`  
**Narration：**  
A little over an hour later...  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Ugh...  
I can't even make up my mind anymore...  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Okay, this isn't gonna work.  
You're not cut out for this. Probably 'cause you're single.  
I mean, you sure look like you are. Ahaha. ☆  
  
**Choice: (9)**  I take it you have a boyfriend, then.  
`Tag 9`  
**Kiruya：**  
And who said you could ask, huh?  
You think we're close now or something?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
...Well. I *am* single.  
But I do have someone I... look up to, I guess?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Mana Senri, yeah. I told you about this before.  
It's nothing romantic, plus she's way older than me.  
And she probably doesn't even know who I am in the first place.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
*sigh*  
I could be picking out swimsuits with her,  
but here I am spending that time with you instead.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Sorry. You gave up time for me as well,  
so I shouldn't be saying that.  
I mean it. Sometimes it sucks to be such a brat.  
  
**Choice: (10)**  I'd say you're a good kid.  
`Tag 10`  
**Kiruya：**  
Excuse me?  
How'd you come to that dumb conclusion?  
I'm just the dregs of society. Your average old delinquent.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
...Whoops. I gotta run.  
It's almost time for cram school.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
As for the swimsuit...  
I'll get that sorted out another day.  
Hopefully I can convince my mom to give me enough money for one.  
If she does, I'll take a look based on your input as well.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Catch you around.  
And, uh... As for today...  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Dammit! Why's saying thanks so hard?!  
This is why everyone thinks I'm a brat!

**Ameth：**  
And there we have it. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Think of what you just saw as something of a dream.  
Chances are you'll forget about it the second you wake up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Color me surprised, though.  
She was in a pretty good mood this time.  
Normally she goes straight for the jugular whenever you meet.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She must've been really excited for that field trip.  
Kinda nice to see her act her age for once.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Thing is, though...  
She never actually gets to go on it.  
All because her mother skimps out on paying Kiruya's share.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The truth comes out when Kiruya asks for money to buy  
a new swimsuit... Needless to say, she  
doesn't take it very well.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I guess there's no real point in telling you, though...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hey, {player}.  
You could tell how excited she was, couldn't you?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I can almost guarantee that it was the same for her \"over here.\"  
  
**Ameth：**  
Eagerly picking out her swimsuit, looking forward to the trip...  
And unlike \"over there,\" she actually got to go.  
With people she gets along with, to boot.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What happened to this world isn't right, no matter how you  
look at it. But it also gave her an opportunity she'd never have  
had otherwise. So let her make the most of it, will you?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway.  
That's enough chatter from me today, so I'll excuse myself now.  
See you in another dream.  
  

---  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey. You listening?  
  
**Karyl：**  
What's the deal?  
Took me by surprise when you slipped and fell over  
like that, you know. Are you okay?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm...?  
I'd prefer it if you didn't stare at me like that.  
  
**Choice: (11)**  That swimsuit's real cute.  
`Tag 11`  
**Karyl：**  
Excuse me?  
Where'd that even come from?  
I really dunno what goes on in that head of yours.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Come on, though. Cute?  
I might've appreciated it more if you said it suited me.  
Especially since I picked out a nice, sophisticated one.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I guess I still don't really look the part just yet, though.  
If anything, picking something like this might make me seem like more of a kid.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hehe.  
You did make the effort to compliment me, though.  
I'd be lying if I said I minded.  
  
**Karyl：**  
So yeah.  
Thanks for that, {player}.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Actually...  
Thanks for everything you've done for me, really.  
I'm a lot happier than you think because of you.
