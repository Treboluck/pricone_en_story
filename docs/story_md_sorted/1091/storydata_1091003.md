# Shizuru (Valentine) Episode 3
Despite thinking she had made plenty of chocolate, Shizuru finds herself overwhelmed by a sudden rush of customers asking for it. Thankfully, {player} has heard the rumors too, and shows up just in time for Shizuru to give him the very last box.
  
## Subtitle: The Final Box
  
**Narration：**  
Valentine's Day has finally arrived.  
Having prepared a mountain of chocolates for {player},  
Shizuru carries them back to the crepe stall.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Phew... These sure took some effort to carry!  
 I know it's all for {player}, but did I make too much?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
No, no, there's no such thing.  
After all, to fully express my love for {player}  
would take so much more than this!  
 What else could I do? ♪  
  

---  
  
**Shizuru：**  
{player} and I will just have to hold  
our own private chocolate party!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I'll feed him, morsel by morsel...  
And maybe he'll even feed me too!  
What a thought... Eheheh! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
There's still a little while left until he'll be here to meet me.  
It'll pass in a flash while I'm serving customers!  
  

---  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Or so I thought, but business really isn't great today...  
Does nobody want to buy crepes on Valentine's Day, I wonder?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ahh... I'm so bored.  
At this rate, the minutes will feel like hours...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
And what's worse, our sales might fall short too.  
We're nowhere near our monthly target... Oh, what to do?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Aw man, with Valentine's chocolates everywhere,  
nobody's thinking about crepes at all...  
  
**Girl：**  
E... excuse me!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yes? ...  
Oh! Are you a customer?!  
Welcome to our stall!  
What kind of crepe would you like?  
  
**Girl：**  
N-no, I'm not here for crepes...  
  
Could I buy one of these, please?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh?! You mean... these chocolates?  
I'm terribly sorry, but they're not actually for sale.  
  
**Girl：**  
Oh no... Can't you spare any? Please, I beg you!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ahhhh... I'm not sure what to say...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I mean, all of these are chocolates I prepared  
especially for {player}.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
How could I give such special chocolates to anybody else?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But this customer really does seem desperate for them...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Would one of my chocolates put a smile on her face?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Besides, the crepes aren't selling at all today,  
and I have to make money somehow  
for the sake of Labyrinth's finances...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
So... just this once...  
I suppose I could make an exception...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
...All right, then.  
Just this once, I'll sell this chocolate to you as a special favor.  
  
**Girl：**  
Th... thank you very much!  
I... I'm so bad at making chocolates,  
and I really wanted a cute one like this!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Eheh. I hope things go well with your special someone.  
I'm rooting for you!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Just this once...  
 Just this once.  
All the others are for {player} alone! ♪  
  
**Housewife：**  
I heard you have the most delicious chocolates.  
I'd like some for my sons. Could I have three?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Wh-what exactly is going on?  
Why are all these customers suddenly lining up?  
  
**Woman：**  
Is it true that you made all these yourself?  
Everyone's saying they taste like heaven!  
I'd like five to share with my friends!  
  
**Man：**  
Wow, you're as cute as they say, too!  
Hey, I'd like ten to eat myself. Can you bag them up for me?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Whaaaa?!  
C-could it be that  
the chocolate I sold before has got people talking?  
  
**Man：**  
Uhh... This is a chocolate store, right?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
No, it's a crepe stall!  
  
**Man：**  
Well, whatever.  
 Ten chocolates, please!  
  
**Woman：**  
See, I promised my friends we'd buy each other chocolates,  
but then I totally forgot!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
L-listen. These chocolates aren't actually for—  
  
**Housewife：**  
Actually, I think I'll buy one for myself as well!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Like I said! This stall is for crepes,  
and these chocolates aren't for sale...!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Wh-what do I do? These people are being really insistent,  
so I might have to sell them after all!  
 ...Oh, fine then!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
A-all right, everyone stop pushing!  
Get in line and wait your turn!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Urgh... This is great for our profits,  
but my chocolates for {player}  
are vanishing one after another...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Whew... Finally the customers have thinned out.  
I didn't think it would turn into such a massive rush...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I finally understand  
why confectioners make such a big deal of Valentine's Day.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But I've only got one box of chocolates left.  
Aw, man. I was really looking forward to  
sharing them with {player}...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, here comes another customer.  
I feel kinda bad, but I really must turn this one down.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
How can I help you?  
Listen, we're actually all out of chocolate...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Wait, huh? {player}?!  
Why are you here? It's not time for us to meet up yet, is it?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I heard rumors of some delicious chocolates.  
**Choice: (2)**  Oh... Are you all sold out?  
`Tag 1`  
**Shizuru：**  
What?! The rumors even reached you, {player}?!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh? N-no! They're not all gone!  
I saved these ones just for you!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shizuru：**  
Here. A gift of chocolates from your big sister.  
There aren't as many as I planned, but they're all full of love!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
By the way, why did you want to buy chocolates?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh? A present for me?  
You wanted to surprise me?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Eheh... Must've been a surprise for you instead  
when you saw who was selling them!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But thank you!  
Just that sentiment alone is an incredible treat!

**Shizuru：**  
Here, open wide.  
I'll feed you a delicious morsel.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
No need to get embarrassed! Go on, say \"ah\"! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hee hee...  
 How is it? Delicious?  
  
**Narration：**  
In the end, Shizuru managed to give {player}  
her chocolates after all,  
and the beam on her face seemed even wider than usual.
