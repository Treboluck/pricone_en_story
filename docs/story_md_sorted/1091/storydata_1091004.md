**Narration：**  
Having successfully given {player} the gift of chocolate,  
Shizuru basks in his happy expressions as he eats it.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hee hee. You're such a cutie, {player}...  
It makes your big sis so happy  
to be able to spend Valentine's Day with you.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh? You inhaled so much you choked?  
Aw, hang on. I'll get you some water.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ummm...  
I'm sure there was a pitcher of water around here...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, there it is!  
Huh? The water's shining?  
Like it's reflecting rays straight from the sun...

**Shizuru：**  
*staaaare*  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, you finally woke up, {player}!  
I came over hoping to wake you up nice and early,  
but you were so cute in your sleep, I ended up staring!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hm? About an hour or so, I guess?  
Heheh. Anyway, I've actually brought you  
an extra-special surprise today!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Curious now, aren't you?  
Then get yourself dressed and come downstairs!  
I'll be waiting for you!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Nobody's here...?  
`Tag 1`  
**Shizuru：**  
Heeeey, {player}! Over here!

**Shizuru：**  
You finally made it down!  
I thought the wait was going to kill me!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hee hee, I'm kidding.  
I'm actually still getting ready.  
Could you hang on a few more moments?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
...Hm?  
Why are you staring at me with such an intense look?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ohhh? Did seeing me in an apron  
get you all excited?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Did you think I was your blushing bride?  
Too bad, it was just your big sis! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Actually, I'm making a packed lunch for you right now!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It'll be ready in a minute,  
 so be a good boy and wait!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hm? This all looks like chocolate, though?  
Well, yes, of course!  
It's Valentine's Day, after all!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Boys like to compete at school  
to see who got the most chocolate, right?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
So I thought I'd make absolutely sure  
you had plenty from the get-go!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Even if none of the other girls give you any,  
you'll have nothing to be embarrassed about now, see?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Actually, I might be even more embarrassed.  
**Choice: (3)**  You're the best.  
`Tag 2`  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, look at you getting all defensive.  
Is this your rebellious phase?  
It doesn't make you any less cute, though!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
If you get lots of chocolates at school,  
I'll acknowledge you're all grown up.  
Until then, eat your big sis's chocolates to grow big and strong!

`Tag 3`  
**Shizuru：**  
Ahaha. You're so straightforward, {player}!  
Like sister, like brother, I guess!  
You're such a cute sweetheart, too.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yep yep, I know every last one  
of my little bro's charms, don't you worry!  
I hope you never feel like you have to change! ♪

**Shizuru：**  
Oh, that reminds me!  
 I made chocolate for your breakfast, too.  
It's over there on the table, so dig right in, OK?  
Or would you rather I feed it to you myself?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
...Well, I guess there's no time for that.  
We'll have to save that treat for another occasion!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Here, a little chocolatey something for you!  
  
**Schoolboy 1：**  
Whoaaaaaaa! Thank you so much!  
Together with my mom's, that makes two this year!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Here,  
 one for you as well!  
  
**Schoolboy 2：**  
W-well, gee, thanks!  
I really appreciate it!  
Aw yeah! No big fat zero for me this year!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
This is for you,  
 and one for you too! Now, hmm...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
...Yep, I think that makes everyone!  
There's nobody left who didn't get any, right?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
...Oh, good morning, {player}!  
That look on your face says, \"What are you doing in my classroom?\"  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Well, as you can see,  
I was handing out some chocolate treats  
to all your lovely classmates!  
  
**Schoolboy 1：**  
Big Sis!  
Thank you so much, thank you so much!  
  
**Schoolboy 2：**  
Now I won't have to buy myself consolation chocolate this year!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yep yep, glad to see everyone's happy!  
Oh, of course, none of those are my \"real\" Valentine's chocolate.  
Even if I did make them all by hand.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Now, last but not least...  
 The real deal!  
A treat full of my love for you, {player}!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hm? I already gave you chocolates this morning?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Those were for lunch! This is for your afternoon snack!  
I'll be making chocolates for dinner too, so come home quickly, OK?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, and I brought a few extra for your lunchbox too!  
Make sure to let me know if it's not enough!  
I love you, {player}!

**Ameth：**  
And that should do it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Wheeew, Shizuru sure does love you to bits, doesn't she?  
  
**Ameth：**  
How did your teeth not dissolve after eating that much chocolate?  
I was actually starting to get legitimately worried.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Still, I have to say... Shizuru is always fun to watch.  
She does the craziest things sometimes,  
but it's all because she thinks of you as a precious little brother.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, it looks like you've accepted her, quirks and all,  
so I'm sure you'll keep getting along just fine.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Going any further than that might take a little courage, though.  
So you should consider that carefully.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ah well, I think that's enough for today.  
See you later! ♪

**Shizuru：**  
Huh? Was I... asleep just now?  
I guess I must have tired myself out making chocolate all day, ahaha.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
What a funny dream it was, though...  
I was making chocolate at your house, {player}...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
And then I fed you enough chocolate to fill you right up!  
...  
That's like, just what I didn't manage to do today.  
 Hahaha...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh? Don't tell me you just had the exact same dream?  
Oh, wow! I guess we really are bound together by fate!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Well then, did all my love in the dream make you happy?  
No, I need to share more love with you in real life, too!  
  
**Narration：**  
Though it had been a long and tiring day,  
the joy of fulfilling her goal inside the dream  
seemed to have left Shizuru more bright and cheerful than ever.
