**Tamaki：**  
Island Whale... That's where you're wrong!  
A world where dreams don't come true is worthless?  
That's not how it works at all!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It's things that aren't easy that are worth doing!  
I want to work with the rest of the Foundation  
to make life outside this island even more fun than on it!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yes... Our dreams aren't wishes to be granted.  
They're goals to seize for ourselves!
