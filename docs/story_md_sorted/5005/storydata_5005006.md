# Island Attack!
Akino attempts to negotiate with the Island Whale, but the beast is not impressed. The Mercurius Foundation members declare their ambitions anew, and do battle with the island-sized monster. When they finally stand victorious, a wave of drowsiness overcomes them all once more.
  
## Subtitle: Island Attack!
  
**Narration：**  
With the members of the Mercurius Foundation reunited,  
together with {player}, they discuss the nature of the  
great Island Whale on which they find themselves stranded.  
  
**Akino：**  
I see, I see... If everything you say is true,  
we should be able to speak with the island itself  
by sailing offshore and calling out to it.  
  
**Akino：**  
First we negotiate...  
And if that doesn't work, we'll have to use force!  
Either way, we're leaving this place and returning to reality!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Yes... I think we've been here long enough!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  We can do this if we work together!  
**Choice: (2)**  Actually, I'd kind of like to stay here...  
`Tag 1`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Right! We're going home, no matter what!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyo way!  
We're done with running away from reality!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Akino：**  
Now then, let's get on this raft and take to the waves!  
  
**Yukari：**  
So... We've paddled a fair way from the shore...  
  
**Yukari：**  
But even from out here, I can't see a face anywhere on the island...  
Are you sure it's a monster?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
There's nyo doubt about it! That thing's the Island Whale!  
The diary laid it all out, nyice and clear!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hey, you! Big fella! Island Whale!  
We've had enough of your fake old island!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
How very odd... There's no response...  
  
**Akino：**  
Tamaki, Mifuyu...  
Could it be that you're still caught in some kind of illusion?  
Who can say if that diary was even real...?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I-it's just gotta be real...  
We should definitely be able to talk to the whale...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh, I know!  
  
**Yukari：**  
What is it now, Mifuyu?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
That whale is fueled by greed!  
Instead of provoking it with fighting words,  
we should catch its interest with something it cares about!  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, I see! That certainly sounds worth a try!  
Oh, Mr. Island Whale!  
I have a little deal to offer you!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hmm? Is it just me, or do you feel some kind of shaking?  
...An earthquake?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ahh! Look, everyone! The island's rising out of the water!

**Island Whale：**  
...GRROOOAAAHHH!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Aaaahhh?! A gigantic face appeared from beneath the waves!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
So that island really was a monster all along...!  
  
**Island Whale：**  
Tiny humans... What deal do you offer...?  
Do you ask, like the human before you,  
that I spare your meager lives so that you may bring others?  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, no, I think not.  
Tell me, would you like to form a contract with me?  
  
**Island Whale：**  
A contract...?  
  
**Akino：**  
Your goal is to collect the desires of humans, is it not?  
In that case, the Mercurius Foundation would like to offer you  
a business opportunity! We'll promote you far and wide!  
  
**Akino：**  
I'll call it the One-Week Dream Life Island Experience!  
  
**Akino：**  
We will transport customers directly to your island to grant their desires,  
and before they die, we will forcibly return them to their lives!  
It will be a massively popular attraction!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, Akino... You do come up with the wildest ideas...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
But that does sound like an efficient solution...  
The only question is whether the Whale will take the bait.  
  
**Island Whale：**  
P...  
  
**Island Whale：**  
Preposterous!  
Did you truly believe I would debase myself  
to become a tool for human entertainment?!  
  
**Akino：**  
It made him angry?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Well, at the end of the day, he *is* a monster...

**Yukari：**  
Hmm? What's this?  
As the Island Whale sinks...  
Something is spurting up from its back...  
  

---  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oww! These little hard things...  
Hey, look... They're CatCoins!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
So the coins really did exist...  
Maybe they're treasure left behind by the pirate crew  
that was stranded here before us!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Looks like we made some unexpected profit!  
But there's still one question left...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Can we actually get all the way back to Landosol on this raft?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Exactly... *yawn*...  
The thought of it is making me sleepy...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
*yawn*... This drowsy sensation feels awfully familiar...  
But this time, it's going to take us *away* from the island, right?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Will we be all right...?  
Will we actually make it back home this time...?  
  
**Akino：**  
Tell you what... Let's hold hands to make sure we stay together.  
All of us... The Mercurius Foundation... Together... forever...
