# Paradise Lost
Akino and Yukari ruin Tamaki and Mifuyu's kingdom in the most outrageous manner. As the castaways protest the destruction of their paradise, Akino scolds them that their desires are too petty. Yukari's appeals get through to them as well, and the two of them come to their senses.
  
## Subtitle: Paradise Lost
  
**Narration：**  
After uncovering the diary with its shocking revelations,  
Tamaki, Mifuyu and {player} discuss how to proceed.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
What do we do from now on...?  
The way I see it, we have two main choices.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
The first is to let the Island Whale feast on our desires,  
and enjoy a fulfilling life here, short though it may be.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
And the other option is to force or persuade the whale  
to let us return to our real lives, right...?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Which is the happier outcome for us, I wonder...?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I can say one thing for sure...  
There's no denying that life here is pretty great!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yes... We can live our lives in freedom, doing whatever we wish.  
It really is an ideal paradise.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I wonder...  
Is it such a bad idea to accept this life?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  None of it's real, though.  
**Choice: (2)**  It's like you've been possessed...  
`Tag 1`  
**Tamaki：**  
So what if it isn't?!  
I don't know if I could bear leaving it behind nyow...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I have to admit, I feel the same way...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Tamaki：**  
What's that s'posed to mean?!  
You stay out of this, {player}!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mifuyu：**  
For the moment, let's stay here and think it over for a while!  
Eheheh...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Agreed! For nyow, I'm gonna have some fun before heading home.  
So {player}, you head back in your own good time.  
 Myeheheh...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Good plan. Eheheh...  
I'll do some training, and then go visit the bargain sale!  
See you later, {player}!  
  
**Narration：**  
As Tamaki and Mifuyu rush happily off,  
{player} is left standing at the cave entrance  
pondering how to solve their conundrum.  
  
**Akino：**  
*huff* *puff* This island certainly is large...  
Oh...? Could that possibly be Sir {player}  
I see standing over there?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh...! It really is {player}!  
Thank goodness we found you!  
  
**Akino：**  
Whatever are you doing in a place like this?  
Did you not come here with Tamaki and Mifuyu?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  The truth is...  
`Tag 4`  
**Akino：**  
I see, I see... So this wish-granting island  
is actually a monster called the Island Whale.  
I think I grasp the situation.  
  
**Yukari：**  
And the others have been so totally bewitched by the island's charms,  
you were struggling to work out what to do...  
Well then, I think it's time for us to step in! Right?  
  
**Narration：**  
Two hours later...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myaaahhh... I'm totally pooped after all that fun!  
I should hire a few kitties to carry me to the Tamaki Palace...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Here, kitty kitty!  
Take this CatCoin and carry me home now, would you?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Huh? My coins aren't working? Wh-what's wrong?  
Hey... There's someone over on that beach!  
Is that... Akino?!  
  
**Akino：**  
Ohohohoh!  
This island's meagre finances are in my hands now!  
I have purchased every last asset, so these coins are now worthless!  
  
**Akino：**  
From now on, these silly \"CatCoins\" will be replaced in the market  
by newly-minted \"AkinoCoins\" featuring my own face!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
M-my precious CatCoin economy  
has been completely collapsed by a single crazy rich lady?!  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, well, Tamaki! I thought I might find you here!  
It's good to see you're all right!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Akino... What are you doing here?!  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, of course, we came to rescue  
the two of you and Sir {player}!  
Yukari and I, that is!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Yukari? I don't see her. Where is she nyow?  
  
**Akino：**  
I think you'll find her in the vicinity of the shopping district!  
She should be bringing Mifuyu to her senses about now!  
  
**Narration：**  
Meanwhile, in the shopping district...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Eheh... Where should I start today  
to make the most of these bargains?  
The swimsuit shop? Or the herb store, perhaps...?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hmm? What's this now...?  
I hear some kind of noise coming from that  
\"Feelgood Water\" store over there...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Th-there's someone inside...! Is that... Yukari?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Ahhhhh... Thish feely-good water...  
It reeeeally makes you feel good! Isn't there any morrre?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yukari is... sloshed beyond belief...?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Ahhh! It'sh Miffy-yu! Where'vh you been~?!  
I already went and drunk up eeeeverything in all the shopsh 'round here!  
Where'zh more of the good stuff?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
M-more...?!  
 No way! This bar's whole supply  
is completely empty?! I can't believe it...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, an' yeah... Y'know how this place is kinda fancy an' stuff?  
Like, the walls are all made of bottles and barrels...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yes. It's a rather stylish touch, incorporating drinks  
as part of the building's design.  
I'm quite fond of it myself...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Yeah, an' I couldn't help wond'ring  
what they tasted like...  
So I kinda drained all of them totally dry...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
...Huh?  
You drank all the Feelgood Water  
from the walls of the building?  
  
**Yukari：**  
And since then, it's like the building's been all wibbly-wobbly, right?  
So I figure it'll go \"ka-splunk!\" pretty soon...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ahhh...! Y-Yukari, get up! It's really collapsing!  
Ugh, in this state, I guess I'll just have to carry you...  
Oh, give me a break!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hey! Mifuyu... Don' move me so suddenly...  
It's making me feel sick...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Arghhh!  
The whole shopping district is toppling down like dominoes...?!  
  

---  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oopsie-daisy... There goes all the silly shopsies~!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
My precious... bargain sales on bargain sales...  
Urghh... The shopping district of my dreams...  
  
**Narration：**  
A few minutes later, Tamaki and Mifuyu find themselves  
firmly seated for a lecture from Akino and Yukari.  
  
**Akino：**  
Ohoho! There was a previous occasion  
when Tamaki and I were given an excruciating lecture  
by Mifuyu and Yukari, wasn't there?  
  
**Akino：**  
So Mifuyu and I have had a reversal of position this time!  
Ohohohoh!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I never thought I'd end up on the receiving end... I'm so ashamed...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Urghh... When you put it like that, it feels like I'm the  
hopeless one, stuck in the same position every time...  
  
**Yukari：**  
And somehow I'm always giving the lectures...  
Well, whatever!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Tamaki, Mifuyu, you know you almost threw your lives away?  
What've you got to say for yourselves?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
...  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, at least we found the three of you before it was too late.  
Now, let's escape from this awful island!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I-I don't wanna!  
  
**Yukari：**  
What's that, Tamaki?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
A-Akino! Yukari!  
Ruling this island as queens was the best time we ever had!  
We were fine just staying here! Why'd you have to mess it up?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yes, we were happy enough accepting this as our fate...!  
  
**Akino：**  
Tamaki... Mifuyu... Frankly,  
 I'm disappointed in you!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
D-disappointed...?  
  
**Akino：**  
Yes, indeed!  
Surely your true ambitions cannot be so triflingly small  
as to be satisfied by this farce!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Our true ambitions...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
...are bigger than this...?  
  
**Akino：**  
Letting this tiny island fulfill your petty desires...  
If that's enough to satisfy you, you're not thinking nearly big enough!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Yeah, tha'ss right! This island can't hold enough feely-good water  
to account for a tenth, no, a hundredth of what I really want!  
  
**Akino：**  
Why do you think our Foundation exists?  
So we can work together to boost our potential exponentially!  
With our desires combined, we can reach inconceivable heights!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Sheesh, you're both so high-and-mighty...  
But... I guess you might have a point.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
This little island isn't enyough for me!  
I wanna play with cats as far as the eye can see!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
It's true... I can't let a 90% discount on 90% discounts satisfy me.  
What if there's a sale with 90% off on 90% off on 90% off  
somewhere out there in the world?!  
  
**Akino：**  
Also... I should be clear that the two of us came here  
because we were worried about you.  
We really were scared for you, you know.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Akino... Yukari...  
I never knew you cared about us so much...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Ahhh...! I was shooo worried!  
Tamaki... Mifuyuuuuu!

**Mifuyu：**  
Waahh! Y-Yukari, please don't grab onto me like that...  
  
**Yukari：**  
I'b so happy you're oh-kayyyy! Waaaahhhh...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh, Yukari...  
  
**Akino：**  
I'll have you know, since we heard of your disappearance,  
neither of us has been able to sleep a wink.  
Our guild isn't complete without every last member accounted for!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ahahah... You were that worried about us, huh...  
I'm... sorry about everything, guys.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
You two came all the way here...  
Laid waste to our kingdom in a matter of minutes...  
Snapped us out of our dreams...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
You're horribly rowdy, and ridiculous, and you drive me mad...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
But life's never boring with you guys around!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It's all four of us together that makes the Meow-curius Foundation!

`image display end`  
**Choice: (5)**  I'm here too...  
`Tag 5`  
**Yukari：**  
Yeah! That'sh right! We've got {player} too!  
Four heads is good, but five heads is bester! Ehehehhh!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ahaha... What are you even saying, Yukari? Hahaha... Ahahahaha...!  
Oh dear—did the sea breeze blow salt into my eye...? Ahaha...  
  
**Narration：**  
Thanks to Akino and Yukari's decisive intervention,  
Tamaki and Mifuyu's kingdom paradise was no more.  
But even through their tears, they couldn't help but laugh happily.
