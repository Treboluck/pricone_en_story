As they discuss rumors of an island where wishes are granted, Tamaki, Mifuyu and {player} suddenly drift off to sleep and awaken to find themselves stranded on a mysterious desert island. Though they initially panic, they swear to work together to escape.
  
## Subtitle: The Wishing Island
  
**Narration：**  
Down on the Marjan Coast, {player} runs into  
Tamaki and Mifuyu from the Mercurius Foundation.  
Together, they head out to sea to fish up some dinner.

**Mifuyu：**  
Hmmm... The fish don't seem to be biting...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Since we came to the beach, I get why you'd want  
to fish up our own dinner and save cash, Mifuyu,  
but this is getting boring nyow... I wanna go home...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Now, now, Tamaki—it would be very inefficient to give up now.  
We paid good money to rent this boat, so let's make the most of it!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Speaking of which, {player}...  
I should thank you for securing this boat for us.  
You were a great help!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Yeah, but... What can we do when nyothing's biting?  
Myaaahh... If only there were some kitties around, at least...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Back in Landosol, the cats lend me a paw,  
so I can lie back and let them do most of the work...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Don't ask the impossible.  
How do you expect to find cats out at sea?  
This isn't some kind of fairy tale.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Fairy tales, huh...  
Actually, just yesterday, I heard a bunch of tourists  
talking about something funny.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
They were saying out in these waters south of the Marjan Coast,  
there's an island that grants people's wishes.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ah yes, I've heard that rumor myself.  
Apparently a traveler who was stranded there  
struck it filthy rich, or something...?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Well, it's just a rumor.  
I haven't heard anyone saying they've seen it for themselves.  
Someone probably made the whole thing up.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What would you do if it was real?  
**Choice: (2)**  Do you think we can get rich, too?  
`Tag 1`  
**Tamaki：**  
If it was me...  
 I'd wish for a cat-filled paradise  
and live a life of luxury surrounded by kitties!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Riches may be going a bit far,  
but I'd like to wish for some lower market prices at least.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Well, an island that grants wishes obviously can't be real,  
but it's fun to dream, nonetheless...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
You knyow it! Actually, the sun's so warm and bright,  
I feel like a bit of dreaming right nyow...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yes... My fishing rod hasn't even twitched in a while,  
and the waves are so calm, it makes me feel... rather sleepy...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myaaahhh... What a purr-fect feeling...  
Just a little... a tiny catnap... couldn't hurt, I guess...

**Choice: (4)**  I'm getting sleepy, too.  
**Choice: (5)**  Zzzz...  
`Tag 4`  
**Mifuyu：**  
What's that, {player}?  
...He's dozed off already. And there goes Tamaki too... Oh well!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Tamaki：**  
Hey! That's nyo fair, dozing off before I do!  
I'm gonna sleep too!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Mifuyu：**  
I guess everyone was longing for some rest...  
But as the captain of this boat, I can't afford to sleep...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I can't... afford to... *yawwwwn*  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...Mnnhhh... ...Huh? Where am I...?  
I'm lying on the beach...  
When'd we get back to the Marjan Coast?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Well, if we made it back OK, I guess that's fine...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Wait! This place doesn't look like the Marjan Coast at all!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Mifuyu! {player}! Wake up, quick!  
Something crazy has happened!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Mnnhh... What is it...? I don't wanna...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Wait, d-did I fall asleep?! I can't believe it!  
Wh-where even are we?!  
This certainly doesn't look like the Marjan Coast...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I can't see the boat we rented anywhere, either...  
Which means... It sank while we were asleep,  
and we somehow drifted to this beach by ourselves?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ummm...  
I can't stand water, so I couldn't have swum in my sleep...  
But of course, I don't remember drowning either. This is weird...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
More to the point, what is this place, exactly?  
Unlike back on the Marjan Coast, I don't see any sign of other people...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Looking at the beach's shape, it seems like an island...  
I'll give a holler and see if there's anyone nearby!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Heeeey! Is anybody out there?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
...No reaction whatsoever.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
You don't think...?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hey, Mifuyu, {player}...  
D'you mind if I say what I'm thinking right nyow?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
What a coincidence... Something just popped into my mind, too.  
But please, you go first!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
All right, I'll come out and say it...  
You don't think we could've drifted all the way  
to an uncharted desert island, do you...?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Haha...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ahahahaha...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Mya... myahah... Myahahahahah...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
That's exactly what I was thinking!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myaaaargh! I knew it!  
We're on a desert island,  
stranded with nyo sign of our boat!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
W-wait. Calm yourself, Tamaki!  
We can't be sure that the island is totally deserted!  
Our first step should be to investigate our situation!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
{player}, you can help too!  
Let's work together and efficiently explore this island!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyice thinking! {player}!  
Let's find ourselves a boat,  
 and escape this place in nyo time!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yes! We'll make it back alive from this!  
We can do it!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so {player} found himself, along with Tamaki  
and Mifuyu, setting out to explore a mysterious island...
