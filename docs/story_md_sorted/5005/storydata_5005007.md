# Back to Reality
The Mercurius Foundation members hold a party to celebrate their successful return. Tamaki and Mifuyu are in high spirits—until they hear the size of the bill for their rescue operation. Forced to work to pay it off, they rue the day they ever left their paradise.
  
## Subtitle: Back to Reality
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Mnnh... Unnhh... This is... the Marjan Coast...?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
We made it back to solid ground!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Guys! Guys, wake up! We're finally back in our own world!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Mrowr...? You're right...  
Feels like forever since I saw this coast!  
We're back home!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Thank goodness we made it back safely!  
  
**Akino：**  
Now then! It looks like this adventure is over,  
and we even brought back treasure, so let's celebrate our victory  
with a grand party!  
 The dress code is... swimsuits!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, yes! It's all-you-can-drink, I hope?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Is that all you think about, Yukari?!  
  
**Akino：**  
Sir {player}, you are of course invited too!  
  
**Narration：**  
So the Mercurius Foundation and {player}  
hold a magnificent celebration together on the Marjan Coast.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
A toast, everyone, to a mystery solved and a treasure bounty! Cheers!  
  

---  
  
**Everyone：**  
Cheers!  
  
**Yukari：**  
*glug glug glug glug glug*  
Ahhhh~! Now that's a swig of true happiness!

**Mifuyu：**  
Happiness, huh... Though I wouldn't admit it to that awful whale,  
I really am going to miss life on that island...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
My very own training dojo... A special spa... Massages...  
Sleeping when I liked, and waking when I was ready...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Those helpful kitties took care of everything for us.  
And just saying \"thank you\" made them look so happy...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Those fluffy beds... Delicious food...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
It was like the perfect summer resort, wasn't it?  
I suppose we ended up having a nice vacation!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Ohhh...? So while we were worried sick,  
you were having the time of your lives?  
That's so unfair!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Y-you say that, but it was all an illusion, you knyow!  
We were this close to dying, even!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Three cheers for the Mercurius Foundation  
who risked their lives to save us!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, yes, we couldn't leave you there! If you didn't come back,  
who'd take care of all your work, or pay off Tamaki's tabs  
at all the places she owes money? The thought was terrifying!  
  
**Akino：**  
Yes, quite! If even one of us is missing, we end up so overworked  
we can't even sleep a wink!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh...? When you said you couldn't sleep a wink,  
*that* was what you meant...?  
  
**Yukari：**  
So of course, we spared no expense in order to rescue you both.  
 Here's the bill! All for you—enjoy!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Eh?! That's... Let me count the zeroes... Thirty billion rupies?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
D-didn't we just strike it stinking rich?!  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, not at all! I already sold all the CatCoins we gathered,  
but it wasn't nearly enough! Fuel for my family's airship  
and long-term boat rentals don't come cheap, you know!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Wait... This is a joke, right?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, no, it's very real!  
The two of you are going to be working nice and hard  
to pay all of this back!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Y-you demon! Fiend! Avatar of evil!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
If... if this is real life, I wish I'd stayed on that island after all!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
This is why I hate unnecessary expenses!!!  
  
**Yukari：**  
You're not getting away! Not until you've worked all this off!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hold on! I'm gonna wake that Island Whale up again!  
Come baaaack! My dream island!

**Narration：**  
And so it was that Tamaki and Mifuyu,  
scarce moments after their rescue from their strange ordeal,  
ran off again in a bid to flee their cruel reality...
