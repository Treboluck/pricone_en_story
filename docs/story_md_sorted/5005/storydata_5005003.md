# The Lure of Paradise
Tamaki builds her own palace surrounded by cats, and Mifuyu has her own training dojo. Surrounded by all the things they've ever dreamed of, the two of them lose their will to leave the island. Meanwhile Akino and Yukari, worried about what has become of them, head to the Marjan Coast.
  
## Subtitle: The Lure of Paradise
  
**Narration：**  
Thanks to Tamaki's endless supply of taiyaki, the island has developed  
a thriving economy based on the local CatCoin currency,  
and Tamaki and Mifuyu's kingdom is blessed with prosperity.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ah... Move the statue a few more feet back, would you?  
  
**Cat：**  
Meow!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Purr-fect. Nyice work, little one. Here's your CatCoin.  
  
**Cat：**  
Meow!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It's finally complete!  
A beautiful bronze statue of Queen Tamaki!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myahhhh... Cats really are the greatest...  
They helped me to build an economy, and even do my work for me!  
It's thanks to them that we can sit back and rule as queens!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'm feeling fantastic, so I think I'll go out and play!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Wait, Tamaki! Sheesh...  
Oh well, whatever! I'll just go try out my brand-new training dojo!  
{player}, you can relax on the beach!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Whew... I played till I dropped!  
What a fun day... Time to go home to my Tamaki Palace!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
It's true... Thanks to the cats doing whatever we ask  
in exchange for those coins, we've been able to build  
a wonderful life for ourselves.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
The Tamaki Palace filled with adorable cats...  
An all-year-round bargain sale on bargain sales...  
A training dojo all to myself, not to mention relaxation facilities...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It really is like paradise!  
Somehow in this mysterious land, everything goes swimmingly!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Is it just me, or are even the monsters behaving themselves?  
{player}, this peaceful life suits you as well, right?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
It's so strange thinking back to our lives before.  
As long as we stay here, we can enjoy life as we wish...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
To be honest, I'm nyot sure if I want to leave the island anymore.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
You're right... A happy life here is more appealing...  
Wouldn't you agree, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are you serious?  
**Choice: (2)**  I could live here forever...  
`Tag 1`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Of course I'm serious!  
We're all nice and happy here, aren't we?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Tamaki：**  
You said it!  
A life without work or struggles...  
We can just laze around without thinking about anything...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Don't you think it would be lovely to stay here forever?  
Just the three of us together?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
What a purr-fect idea!  
If we're the two queens of the island,  
{player} can be the king!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Who do I marry? Both of you?  
**Choice: (5)**  I've got a bad feeling about this.  
`Tag 4`  
**Tamaki：**  
Myahahah! It's too soon to be thinking about marriage!  
But that wouldn't be so bad, either!  
We can do whatever we like here!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Tamaki：**  
Myahahah! You're so silly!  
Life's so fun right now, I'm sure everything will turn out fine  
if we just go with the flow!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Precisely. After all, we're not in Landosol anymore.  
This is our own personal paradise of hopes and dreams!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Let's forget all about our old lives and embrace this new world!  
  
**Narration：**  
Meanwhile, in the Mercurius Foundation guildhouse...  
  
**Akino：**  
Yukari, have you still not heard any word from Tamaki and Mifuyu?  
  
**Yukari：**  
No, not a thing...  
I'm starting to think something really must have happened to them...  
  
**Akino：**  
I fear you're right...  
Some incident must have occurred down on the Marjan Coast...  
  
**Yukari：**  
If they went missing out at sea,  
you don't think it could already be... too late...?  
  
**Akino：**  
Yukari! Don't say things like that, even as a joke!  
Our guildmates are made of sterner stuff than that!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Y-you're right... I need to stop being negative.  
Who knows, maybe they drifted to an island somewhere  
and are enjoying a lovely vacation!  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, that would be worrying in its own way...  
I hope they haven't let themselves go *too* much.  
At any rate... Let's go and see what information we can find!  
  
**Narration：**  
Thus Akino and Yukari set out for the Marjan Coast  
in search of the missing Tamaki and Mifuyu.
