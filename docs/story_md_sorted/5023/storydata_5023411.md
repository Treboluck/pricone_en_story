## Subtitle: Farewell, Academy Life
  
**Chloe：**  
Hey. Is this seriously Aoi's last day?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Whaa~?!  
 That's no fun at all!  
C'mon, Aoi, can'tcha just stay at our school forever? Can'tcha?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Young Chieru, desist from clinging to and nuzzling her with your  
entire head.  
 You're causing young Aoi a great deal of concern.  
 Still, yes.  
It's sad we must part, but let us all  
 make the most of this final day.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Everyone...  
 Th-thank you so much! I'm going to do my best  
as a proud student of St. Theresa's Academy to the very end!
