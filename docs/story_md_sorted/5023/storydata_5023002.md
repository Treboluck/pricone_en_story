# That Important First Step
During their lunch break, Chloe and friends head over to check in on Aoi, but she has already disappeared. Thanks to a spark of inspiration from Yuni, they track her down. Discovering that she is worried about how to communicate with her classmates, Chloe tells her exactly what she needs to hear.
  
## Subtitle: That Important First Step
  
**Narration：**  
The next day after Aoi's transfer into St. Theresa's Academy for Girls...  
  
**Chloe：**  
So tell me. What's the deal here.  
  
**Chloe：**  
We came to the middle school department during our lunch hour  
just to check on that kid...  
  
**Chloe：**  
So where is she.  
I'm not seeing her anywhere.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Cheru~~n! ♪  
Hey, Aoi~! Wanna join me for lunch~?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wait, it's just you and {player}, Chloe?  
Where's our cute li'l Aoi?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Damned if I know.  
Ah geez, what do we do now?  
  
**Chieru：**  
At times like this, you gotta ask around for info!  
Hey, cute little passerby there!  
Have you seen Aoi?  
  
**Female Student：**  
Huh? You mean the new transfer student?  
I'm pretty sure  
 she ran off like a spooked gazelle  
the second the bell rang for lunch...  
  
**Chieru：**  
That's the ticket! As thanks, I'll let you spread this new greeting!  
Cheru~~n! ♪  
 All together now:  
 Cheru~~n! ♪  
  
**Female Student：**  
Ch-cheru~~n...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Get all the middle schoolers using it, OK? ♪  
...Sigh. Well, you heard her, Chloe.  
Looks like we came all this way for nothing.  
  
**Chloe：**  
You can switch it on and off just like that?  
And, uh... If she's not here, where is she?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm.  
I may be able to answer that.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh, Yuni, when did you even pop up.  
Whenever it was, you're late.  
  
**Yuni：**  
No, this was, you see, ehm, unavoidable. My place of work,  
that is to say, the Ivory Tower, lies near the old school building.  
Alas, it's quite some distance from this newer campus.  
 Yes, that's why.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Whatever you say.  
For reals though, do you actually know where Aoi's run off to?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Did nobody teach these girls to respect their seniors...?  
Well, it's a mere hunch, but yes. I asked myself where I would go—  
a subjective approach, but not without merit.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Then let's get moving already, yeah?  
My stomach's growling something fierce.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Thanks, guys.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chloe：**  
Eh?  
Say what. Like, don't *thank* us.  
We're just doing our own thing here, y'know.  
  
**Yuni：**  
You heard the girl, young {player}.  
To take good care of your dear friend Aoi  
is to deepen our relationship with you.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Which in turn brings us one step closer  
to the scholarship we were told to earn by befriending you.  
  
**Chieru：**  
I guess this little club *was* originally formed  
just to get our hands on that cash.  
Even if nowadays  
 we're all total besties regardless! ♪  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, we're what now.  
  
**Aoi：**  
...*sigh*  
  
**Chloe：**  
We're coming in...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Hyeek?! C-C-C-Chloe...?!  
{player} and Chieru and Yuni, too...?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
There you are~!  
 Our little Aoi~! ♪  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hah. An isolated spot, just as predicted.  
You see? My behavioral psychoanalysis paid dividends, did it not?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeah, uh. This is our fifth try.  
We basically checked the whole school.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Y-you guys... But why?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, that's our line.  
What're you in an empty classroom for.  
It was a real pain finding you.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ah... W-well... I, ah...  
I wasn't sure how to talk to my classmates...  
  
**Aoi：**  
I couldn't even introduce myself properly...  
The lessons were hard too, so I was feeling totally lost...  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Now see here, kid.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ooookay, Chloe!  
I think that part can wait,  
 so let's eat lunch, shall we?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Very wise.  
Though our search was over quickly thanks to my capable analysis,  
time waits for no man. We can speak just as easily while we eat.

**Chieru：**  
Hey, actually...  
 isn't it pretty rare for us to all  
get together for lunch like this?  
  
**Yuni：**  
I suppose you aren't mistaken.  
Despite spending most of our time as a group of late...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, yeah. We meet up for guild stuff after school,  
but there's no point rounding everyone up just for lunch.  
  
**Chieru：**  
You think so~?  
If you ask me, sharing lunchtime is pretty fun stuff!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ngrhh... I see young Chieru is making a show of her affable nature!  
As her elder, I can't allow her to outdo me...!  
Y-Yuni loves happy mealtimes too~! Ehehh~!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeah, you can stop that now.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It really is fun eating meals as a group.  
**Choice: (3)**  It really is fun spending time with Chloe.  
`Tag 2`  
**Chloe：**  
What, you trying to get in on the cuddly act too?  
So you wanna be cute?  
Finally figured out the cool angle wasn't working for you?  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Chloe：**  
Huh. Is that right.  
Really. You think so.  
Well, I'm, uh, not having a bad time either.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Chloe：**  
And I mean, like, yeah?  
If you're being serious about the mealtime-sharing stuff,  
it's not like I've got any, uh, objections or whatever.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Did you hear that, Yuni?!  
Isn't Chloe masterful?! A bundle of cute to the bone?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Urgh... I thought better of you, Chloe.  
To think you would so readily compromise your \"cool beauty\" status  
for the sake of a moment's potent allure...  
 For shame, you harlot!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, say what now.  
Why am I being dissed to death just for saying I'll be lunch buddies?  
Don't push weird ideals on me like some idol you stan or whatever.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ahah! Lunch together really is fun, huh?!  
Isn't it great, just chelling the chellerific vibes together?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, am I s'posed to agree with that?  
And that weird language? You can stop trying to make it happen now.  
The world will literally end before it becomes a thing.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Umm...  
 Why do you three always seem to be together?  
You're all in different years...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, it's not like we're always together.  
I guess we do meet up a lot,  
but we're basically outcasts in this academy, so.  
  
**Aoi：**  
I feel...  
 really envious of you all.  
I wish I could be as close to someone as you all are...  
  
**Chloe：**  
You could find a better example to follow than us.  
Just now, weren't you saying you don't know how  
to talk to your classmates?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Y... yes.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Is there much point getting all nervous? You're not here for long,  
and you'll be saying bye-bye before you know it,  
so why stress yourself out.  
  
**Chloe：**  
So, uh, I guess, what I'm trying to say is,  
 uhh...  
Y'know?  
 ...Ugh, I can't even.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Chloe's trying to say  
 that you should relax a little  
and be more true to yourself!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Can you quit putting words into people's mouths.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh, Chloe...!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I think Chloe's got a good point.  
`Tag 5`  
![502300202.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/502300202.webp)  
**Aoi：**  
Yes, I think she does!  
Thank you for your help, Chloe!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I feel like I might be able  
to work up a little bit more courage now!  
  
**Chloe：**  
I didn't do a thing...  
Like really, not even one thing.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Aren't you just super happy, Chloe~?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh? Like, how?  
 'Course I'm not.  
  
**Yuni：**  
There's no need to hide it, young Chloe.  
I too am filled with pride at my junior's achievement.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, yeah, sure.  
Quit talking now and munch your damn food.  
You trying to waste our whole lunch break?

**Aoi：**  
It's fine. It'll be fine.  
Remember the encouragement Chloe gave you...!  
  
**Female Student：**  
...  
  
**Aoi：**  
E... e-e... excuse me!  
  
**Female Student：**  
Yes?  
  
**Aoi：**  
G... g-g-g... g-good...!  
  
**Female Student：**  
H... huh?  
  
**Aoi：**  
G-good... day...!  
  
**Female Student：**  
...  
Yes.  
A good day to you too, Aoi.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, whaddaya know.  
  
**Chieru：**  
She really pulled through, our little Aoi!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah—look closely!  
Young Aoi's other classmates have taken this opportunity  
to engage her in conversation!  
  
**Chieru：**  
I bet they were all just waiting.  
For Aoi herself to take that important first step.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Isn't this great?  
`Tag 6`  
**Chloe：**  
Huh?  
Uh, why're you looking at me.  
As if I care what she gets up to.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, I guess...  
 it was bugging me a little.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Waahh! Chloe's going all red!  
 That's *so* cute!  
  
**Yuni：**  
This elevated pulse I feel...  
I can't deny that its root cause lies with young Chloe...!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ughhh... Shut *up*.  
  
**Female Student：**  
By the way, Aoi, did you hear?  
Earlier today, all the water in the school pond vanished out of the blue.  
  
**Female Student：**  
Whatever could have happened to it?  
  
**Aoi：**  
The pond water vanished?  
  
**Narration：**  
Aoi had taken her first steps towards fitting in.  
But in the background, a seed of unrest seemed to be taking root...  
  
**Mandragora：**  
...
