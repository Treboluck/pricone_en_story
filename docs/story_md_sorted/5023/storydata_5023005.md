# Mandragora Hunters
The gigantic plant terrorizing the academy turns out to be a rare Mandragora that Aoi unwittingly set loose on school grounds. Realizing that it can be sold for a high price, Chloe and friends make plans to capture it. But when they track it down to the old school building, they find it has grown even larger than expected.
  
## Subtitle: Mandragora Hunters
  
**Narration：**  
After school, Aoi gathers {player} and the others  
for an emergency meeting in a classroom.  
  
**Aoi：**  
I-I'm sorry for calling you all on such short notice!  
  
**Chloe：**  
No biggie, really.  
We're used to it by now.  
  
**Chieru：**  
The five of us are like, basically \"the squad\" at this point, huh?  
The usual suspects. The trouble bubble.  
  
**Yuni：**  
A distinguished team deserving of the name of the Yuni-ettes.  
I couldn't be more proud.  
  
**Aoi：**  
So, um...  
 listen.  
There's... something terrible happening in this academy!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Like our guild name getting savagely mangled?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Like our guild name getting hijacked by cringe?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Endure it... I must endure it...  
Facing resistance and ridicule is the burden of all visionaries...!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Um... It's actually about the plant  
our teacher mentioned just after my presentation...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  The huge, humanoid-looking one?  
`Tag 1`  
**Aoi：**  
Yes. I'm not, um... quite sure how to say this, but...  
  
**Aoi：**  
I think  
 it might be the Mandragora I brought when I arrived!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. I see—this explains a lot.  
The draining of the academy's pond water  
must also have been this Mandragora's doing.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh... Actually, now that you mention it,  
some of my friends said they'd seen a big, hulking thing around!  
  
**Chloe：**  
A Mandragora from the Elven Forest, huh.  
  
**Yuni：**  
No... From young Aoi's description,  
I'd wager that this is a Toxic Mandragora—quite the distinct breed.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I presume you mistook it yourself for an ordinary Mandragora?  
Well, I can't blame you.  
Even in the Elven Forest, this species is exceptionally rare.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Wow, Yuni, you're amazing!  
There aren't many people who know about our native plants...!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Please, my dear Aoi, these are fundamental basics.  
Dear me, ha ha ha!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wow, what a smug expression!  
Someone's seeking praise and attention!  
  
**Chloe：**  
A Toxic Mandragora...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Something up?  
`Tag 2`  
**Chloe：**  
Huh?  
Oh... no, I was just like, uh,  
 remembering something?  
Don't worry, I'm good now.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeah. Let's capture that thing.  
  
**Chieru & Yuni：**  
Huh?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Y-you'll really help me recapture it?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
I mean, isn't that why you called us here?  
It's fine. I know I'm up for it.  
  
**Aoi：**  
O-oh, Chloe...!  
 I can't thank you enough!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's gotten into you, Chloe?!  
Isn't this usually where you'd be all  
\"Nope in, nope out, nope it all about\"?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
What's that hokey phrasing?  
I've literally never said that.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Could it be you're feeling unwell, perchance?  
Please, feel free to retire to your room...  
  
**Chloe：**  
One positive statement, and this is what I get?  
What do you take me for. Pff...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Sooo~?  
What was it that you suddenly remembered?  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Well, I guess I can come clean.  
See, I used to work at...  
 wait, no,  
 *visit* this weird store,  
and I heard something there once.  
  
**Chloe：**  
The Toxic Mandragora.  
Priced on the black market at...  
  
**Chieru & Yuni：**  
...?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
U-um, hello? What are you three whispering about?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Young Aoi! Have no fear!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
We'll fix this up in a chelleroonie!  
  
**Aoi：**  
U-um...?  
  
**Chloe：**  
We're on it.  
That Mandragora of yours is as good as caught.  
  
**Chieru, Yuni & Chloe：**  
On our honor as the Friendship Club!  
  
**Aoi：**  
You guys...! I can't believe you'd do all this for me!  
I'll work hard too, on the honor of the BB Brigade!  
  
**Chieru：**  
So, we just searched the whole school building,  
and now here we are on the school grounds.  
Yuni, don't you have any trivia that could help us here?  
  
**Yuni：**  
I wouldn't consider any of my knowledge trivial, young Chieru.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Still, let's see. The Toxic Mandragora draws sustenance  
from airborne magical energy, and when fully grown, not only its roots  
but also its flowers and fruits are poisonous.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Sounds dangerous.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yuni：**  
Indeed.  
However, that poison itself is highly valued in many fields.  
The bitterest medicines are often the best, as the saying goes.  
  
**Chloe：**  
And the thing grows at turbo speed outside the forest, right?  
If we don't find it soon, that's gonna spell trouble...  
It's even got enough smarts to hide itself, like bugs and fish.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm? These details weren't in the texts I read...  
Most intriguing...  
 Is this knowledge passed down among elves?  
  
**Chloe：**  
I think I heard a couple other things about 'em, too...  
What was it again? I shoulda taken that job more seriously.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Um, Chloe? Part time work's against school rules...  
Well, I'll pretend I didn't hear anything.  
I'm a sweetie pie who knows how to keep secrets!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Still, a plant with the intelligence to conceal itself...  
We may have quite some trouble finding it.  
If only we had some other way to investigate...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Let's try asking other plants.  
**Choice: (5)**  Let's try asking the animals.  
`Tag 4`  
**Chieru：**  
Um...? Have you finally lost it completely, {player}?  
Is talking to flowers your hobby? Do you hug trees too?  
Should we take you to a head doctor?  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. Has young {player} found a flair for fairytale fancy?  
A ploy to accentuate his childish charms...? So be it.  
Come, leap into my motherly bosom.  
 Let me shower you with affection.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Aoi：**  
Of course!  
Why didn't I think of that myself?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ohhh... Good call.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, yes... I *have* heard that the elves who protect the forest...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? What the heck's the deal now? You guys?  
Don't leave me standing here like the odd cutie out!  
Do I need to cry? Are you heartless goons who'd make a girl cry?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
The truth is, I can talk to all kinds of plants and animals!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? For reals?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Yes!  
Wait here a moment! I'll ask them right away!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I didn't know the academy even had a building like this...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Uerghh... What's this atmosphere? Like some kind of ruin or dungeon...  
Hey, Aoi~? Is your stray Mandragora really in a place like this?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Y-yes.  
 The flowers behind the school  
said they'd seen it sneaking inside...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Even so...  
 Searching this big old place'll be a massive pain.  
Yuni, this building's your turf.  
Tell me you've got some handy tips right about now.  
  
**Yuni：**  
No... While it's true that the Ivory Tower I call home does lie nearby,  
I'm afraid I have little call to venture into the old schoolhouse proper.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Right, you're a true shut-in, aren't you?  
For all your \"magic of youth\" talk, you never go outside if you can help it.  
So of course you'd be no use when we need you!  
 Don't sweat it! ♪  
  
**Yuni：**  
...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Chieru, there's snark, and then there's verbal manslaughter.  
The light's gone out of the poor girl's eyes...  
  
**Yuni：**  
...N-no, wait!  
My vast knowledge can still be of use here!  
  
**Yuni：**  
As a chronic note-taker, I have records of all the minor chitchat  
ever made by this school's faculty!  
Perhaps I can uncover some leads! Give me one moment!  
  
**???：**  
...  
  
**Aoi：**  
...Ah!  
Did you all hear that?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Uh, I didn't hear anything?  
What now, Aoi, you going for a spooky trail experience?  
  
**Chieru：**  
I'm game!  
 Let's make our own spooky trail!  
Sadly I'm way too cute to play a ghost or monster,  
but if you put Chloe in a shadowy corner, she won't even need—  
  
**Aoi：**  
N-no, ah...  
I just thought I heard a voice from behind this door...  
  
**Chieru：**  
So in the... \"Main Auditorium\"? That's what this sign says.  
  
**Yuni：**  
The old schoolhouse's main hall?  
Hrm. I have heard the school matriarch speak of the place...  
This area has long been sealed off due to severe structural decline.  
  
**Yuni：**  
So if you really did hear a voice from inside...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Must be... bingo?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Isn't this getting chellerific, {player}?!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Let's take a peek inside.  
`Tag 7`  
**Mandragora：**  
GRRRUUOOOOGHH!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm...  
Rejoice, my compatriots. We've found our target.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Looks like it!  
But I've got one little question...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pff...  
 How do we catch *that*.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Wh-wh-wh...  
  
**Aoi：**  
When did it get so ridiculously enormous?!  
  
**Narration：**  
Aoi and the others were shocked to see  
that the Mandragora had grown beyond all their expectations.
