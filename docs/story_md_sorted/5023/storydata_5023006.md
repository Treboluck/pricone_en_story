# Our Hearts as One
Though the Friendship Club members are able to take down the Mandragora thanks to Aoi's help, they are dismayed to see it explode into nothing. When they confess their money-making intentions, Aoi doesn't mind at all, and they all laugh happily together at a team effort well executed.
  
## Subtitle: Our Hearts as One
  
**Narration：**  
In a sealed-off area of the old school building,  
Aoi and the others come face to face with the escaped Mandragora.  
  
**Mandragora：**  
GRUOOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ahh... Aaahhh...  
What could possibly have made it grow so huge?  
  
**Yuni：**  
The environment, I expect.  
 From the soil's nutrients to the mana  
in the air itself, this region differs greatly from the Elven Forest.  
...  
Direct your eyes upward.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, blech.  
Is that a huge flower dripping with poison?  
It's the least cute thing I've ever seen!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pff... That ain't good.  
If the flower's blooming, that means it's fully grown.  
  
**Chieru：**  
And for us that means what exactly?  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Bye-bye to St. Theresa's.  
  
**Chieru：**  
This is *that* big a deal?!  
Ueghh... This is so not what I signed up for...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Accelerated growth can prompt unique mutations.  
An interesting case study indeed, but...  
  
**Mandragora：**  
GRUOOGHHH!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Look out!  
`Tag 1`  
**Chieru：**  
Wha—?! Is that thing attacking us?!  
Those vines aren't playing around!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pretty frisky for a literal plant...  
Bah, this is such a pain in the ass...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Beware! As I believe I just explained, this Mandragora is highly toxic.  
In the terms of the layfolk,  
 make sure you don't touch the vines!  
  
**Mandragora：**  
GRUOOGHHH!  
  
**Chieru：**  
And *how* do we not touch them?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
You're asking the impossi... Huh?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Hup! Hyeegh! Haah!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Whoaaa?!  
 Aoi, you're amazing!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes...  
 Impressive reactions indeed.  
  
**Aoi：**  
W-well, r... running away is what I always do,  
so it's my one real skill...  
 Hyup!  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Regardless of their origins,  
 your skills are quite superb.  
  
**Aoi：**  
I'm so sorry for my pitiful existence!  
Sorry for breathing everyone's precious air!  
Sorry for all the trouble I've ever caused!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Those motions...!  
I salute you, young Aoi. You have achieved loner enlightenment.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Amazing...  
 Um, *is* it amazing?  
Is that really an example we ought to follow?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Not happening. Like, not happening.  
  
**Mandragora：**  
GRUOOGHHH!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Look out, {player}! It's attacking in your direction!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm sorry for always getting lost!  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm sorry for trying to eat money!  
`Tag 2`  
**Chloe：**  
I mean, you do.  
 Not denying you do.  
But is this the time for apologies?  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Chieru：**  
Wait, you did what now?!  
I *so* want to hear the story behind that one!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Chloe：**  
Wait, he's really doing it.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Somehow those apologies are helping him dodge...!  
  
**Yuni：**  
I'm beginning to suspect this technique may be our solution!  
  
**Chieru, Yuni & Chloe：**  
Do we really have to...?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Let's follow in the master's footsteps!  
`Tag 5`  
**Mandragora：**  
GRUOOGHHH!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Come, it can't hurt to try!  
My apologies for being an incomparable genius!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Sorry I'm too cute to handle!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh-huh. Sure. Sorry for whatever.  
  
**Aoi：**  
I-incredible, you guys!  
You've earned your loner diplomas!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Is that a compliment?  
Guys, should I be happy about this?  
Oh, who cares!  
 Yaaaay!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeah, whatever works.  
I *am* getting used to those tentacles now.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Indeed!  
Then perhaps the time has come to unite our strengths...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  ...And strike back!  
`Tag 6`  
**Chieru, Yuni & Chloe：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ahhh... It's as though each cell in my body brims with pure energy!  
With this power...!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Allow me to take the lead in our offensive!  
Huahhh!  
  
**Mandragora：**  
GRUOOGHHHH!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Not even gonna swing that axe thing, huh? Amazing.  
You crack me up.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Careful now, Yuni! Don't get carried away!  
Cheruru~n!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Knocking that gigantic Mandragora off balance...  
You're incredible, Chieru!  
  
**Chloe：**  
You two trying to hog the loot?  
Ah, fine. Guess I'd better at least earn my  
 share!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Chloe...?! She closed in so quickly!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I had no idea you were all so strong!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Spare us the glowing praise.  
This is really no big...  
 Eheheheh...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Your childish glee is showing.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Bet you're impressed that I can be this strong  
*and* this cute at the same time!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I-I-I'll do my best too!  
I can't be the one to hold you all back!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I-I know... The concoction I made in my presentation!  
  
**Aoi：**  
It's a little dangerous,  
 but if I apply it to this arrow...!  
  
**Mandragora：**  
GRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Uweeegh?!  
Ahh...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Did I apply too much? U-ummm...  
I-  
it'll be fine... won't it?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Let's finish the job, young Chloe, young Chieru!  
Our dream is almost within our grasp!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Mountains of hard cash!  
  
**Chloe：**  
We win at capitalism forever.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Their attacks have created an opening!  
This is my only chance!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Everyone, please get back!  
You'll get caught in the blast!  
  
**Yuni：**  
What's that? A… \"blast\"...?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Huh?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wait...  
  
**Chloe：**  
For real?  
  
**Aoi：**  
With my bow... I'll protect everyone!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Really, Yuni? That's your best excuse?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ahhh... Fine, sorry, I'll come clean.  
Truth is, we were planning to capture that Mandragora and sell it.  
  
**Yuni：**  
My apologies.  
We were sadly unable to resist the lure of boundless riches...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Priceless goods,  
 AKA temptation in monster form.  
  
**Chieru：**  
So yeah, um.  
All that chelling around was really just for our own sakes.  
So we were... kind of tricking you, I guess. Real sorry, Aoi.  
  
**Aoi：**  
...O-oh, is that really all?  
  
**Chieru, Yuni & Chloe：**  
Huh?  
  
**Aoi：**  
I... I don't mind any of that!  
  
**Aoi：**  
You know,  
 when I first arrived at this academy, I felt so alone...  
  
**Aoi：**  
But then {player} introduced me to the Friendship Club...  
I was scared at first,  
 but now I'm so glad that he did.  
  
**Aoi：**  
I got to know you guys better,  
and you helped me with so many things...  
  
**Aoi：**  
I feel like I really understand you now.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Yuni, you know all sorts of things,  
and you're even similar to me in some ways...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Chloe, you can be scary,  
but you're really kinder than anyone...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Chieru, you're so bright and peppy it's blinding,  
yet you never let that get in between us...  
  
**Aoi：**  
So, um,  
 even if you had your own reasons, I don't mind!  
In fact, I-I'm really sorry if I ruined it for you...

**Yuni：**  
Young Aoi... You truly are incomparable...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Aw, isn't that sweet!  
  
**Chloe：**  
...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hmm~?  
Hey, Chloe, why's your face looking extra pink all of a sudden~?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Shaddup. What's it to you.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Are you blushing?  
`Tag 7`  
**Chloe：**  
Say that again and I punch you. Hard.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Heheh...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ahah! You're always soooo easy to read, Chloe!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Indeed. I must take notes on this unique expression of emotion.  
Eheheh... You entertain me greatly, young Chloe.  
  
**Chloe：**  
All right, line up.  
Who wants to lose their teeth first.  
  
**Narration：**  
After working together to overcome a great challenge,  
Aoi and the Friendship Club members couldn't help but laugh happily.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Aw, isn't that sweet!
