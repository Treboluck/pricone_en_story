Aoi finds herself participating in a special transfer program at the prestigious St. Theresa's Academy for Girls. But the new friends who await her there are a trio of eccentric problem students!
  
**Aoi：**  
St. Theresa's Academy...  
A school for fine young ladies, famed throughout Landosol...  
S-so how did *I* end up wearing this uniform?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? Whoa. Hold up. Yuni, Chloe, look over there!  
Isn't that cutie the cutest? Not saying hi would be a crime!  
Cheru~n! ☆  
 I'm Chieru! Great to meet you! Let's be BFFs! ♪  
  
**Chloe：**  
Wait, who even is this.  
 And I mean... Why the cornered-mouse look?  
Don't tell me this kid sees us as some sort of object of terror.  
That's kinda rude. I oughtta sue her for defamation of character.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm, from the middle-school division?  
 A rare encounter to say the least.  
In the terms of the layfolk:  
 Greetings! We welcome you kindly. *bow*  
By the by, I suffer chronic cravings for the magic of youth. Care to assist?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ahh... Aaahh... So many...  
 strange people...!  
This is too much for a loner like me!
