## Subtitle: Trial by Fire
  
**Narration：**  
Having become an official member of Forestier,  
Aoi is working as a guide in the Elven Forest.  
  
**Aoi：**  
U-ummm... So, this is...  
  
**Tourist 1：**  
Wow, look down here!  
This butterfly! There's *so* nothing like it in the city!  
  
**Tourist 2：**  
Whoa, neat! It looks so magical!  
Hey, Miss Guide, what's this one called?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh?  
 Um... th-th-that's a...  
  
**Tourist 1：**  
Hey! What's this weird stuff?!  
The Elven Forest's so freaky!  
  
**Tourist 2：**  
Right?!  
Miss Guide, where are we going next?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Um, n-next should be...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Urghhh... Gathering herbs and growing plants is one thing,  
but me, acting as a tour guide...?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I... I want to run for the hills!  
  
**Tourist 1：**  
Hm? What's this plant...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ah!  
 Don't touch that! It's a Mandragora!  
If you pull it out, its cry—  
 Waaaagggh?!  
  
**Tourist 2：**  
A-are you OK, Miss Guide?!  
I'm sorry, I guess I got a bit overexcited!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I... I'm all... right...  
  
**Misato：**  
Welcome back, Aoi.  
How was your guide duty?  
  
**Aoi：**  
*sigh*... Um, I really don't think I can do this...  
  
**Misato：**  
Really?  
But those girls just now seemed really grateful to you.  
  
**Aoi：**  
...D-did they...?  
Even so, I can barely talk to people, let alone guide them...  
  
**Misato：**  
Are you sure?  
 Hmmm... Perhaps you do need  
a little more practice talking in front of other people...  
  
**Misato：**  
Listen, Aoi.  
Do you know St. Theresa's Academy for Girls?  
  
**Aoi：**  
I've heard the name...  
It's a school over in the city, I think?  
  
**Misato：**  
Yes.  
 Actually, they sent a little request to us here at Forestier.  
  
**Misato：**  
To build relations with our guild,  
they'd like us to send a short-term transfer student to their school!  
  
**Aoi：**  
...?  
  
**Misato：**  
The student would use their elven expertise  
to give a special presentation to their new schoolfellows.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ummm, you don't mean...  
  
**Misato：**  
So... congratulations, Aoi!  
You're going to be attending St. Theresa's Academy!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Whuueeeegggghhhhh?! No way!  
I can't! Never, never, never! Not in a bajillion nevers!  
  
**Misato：**  
Are you sure?  
 I think this is a wonderful opportunity.  
A chance for you to work up just a little bit more courage.  
  
**Misato：**  
It's all right. I know you're a good girl. You can do this.  
Here—your uniform, a brochure, and a set of textbooks.  
  
**Misato：**  
I just know you'll have a lovely time. I believe in you.  
Well, good luck!  
  
**Aoi：**  
N-n-n-n... No way...  
  
**Aoi：**  
W-wait...!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I can't do thiiiiiiiiiiis!  
  
**Narration：**  
With her transfer to St. Theresa's Academy for Girls set in stone,  
Aoi let out a cry that would put any Mandragora to shame.
