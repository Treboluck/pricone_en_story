**Mimi：**  
What should we play next~?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um, Mimi,  
 we're not \"playing.\" This is a battle...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Oh, that's right!  
I was just having so much fun playing games with everyone!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Let's have... a dodgeball contest next.  
Ayane, does that sound all right?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Heheh. Sure, bring it on!  
I'll start by sending this ball...  
 right there!  
  
**Ayane：**  
All right!  
{player}, you're out!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
A-Ayane!  
{player} isn't the target, remember?  
  
**Ayane：**  
O-oh, right...  
I guess all of Misogi's pranks  
 got me confused...  
  
**Misogi：**  
All right! Back to the game, then!  
Take this...  
 Trick Bomber!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Waaahhh?!  
M-Misogi, isn't that a real bomb—  
  
**Ayane：**  
*cough cough* Wh-what part of this is dodgeball?!  
Misogi, you're out! Red card for cheating!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Bahhhh...  
It was totally worth it, though! ☆  
  
**Mimi：**  
This time, let's throw a real ball!  
Yaaaah!  
  
**Ayane：**  
A wimpy ball like that is no match for us!  
Pukichi Fullswiiiiing!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh! The ball scored a direct hit on Pukichi!  
That means Pukichi is out!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Whaaaa?!  
 No way!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Urgh... Guess we can't have it both ways.  
Kyoka, you clever cookie.\"  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh, I get it!  
That's why you picked dodgeball, is it, Kyoka?  
That's our Miss Kyoka for ya!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Now, remove Pukichi from the field!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wh-what now, Ayane...?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Urgh... Without Pukichi's help, I can't touch the balls...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Heheh! The enemy's decisively weakened!  
Mimi! Kyoka! Finish 'em off!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Waaaaahhh! Heeeelp!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Aaaaagh! This would be nothing if I had Pukichi!  
  
**Narration：**  
The dodgeball match ended in a clear win for Little Lyrical.
