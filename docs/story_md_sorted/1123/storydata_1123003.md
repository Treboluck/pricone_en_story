## Subtitle: Magic with Feeling
  
**Narration：**  
After breaking free of her troubles as a magical girl,  
one day, Shiori notices certain feelings beginning to grow inside her.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I wonder if I can get closer to {player}.  
Our conversations are pleasant, but having more physical contact  
and growing closer would be nice...  
  
**Shiori：**  
But I don't have the confidence to be so assertive...  
Oh, that's right! Maybe now that I can use magic, I can find a spell that  
will give me courage─  
  
**Shiori：**  
...No, I mustn't!  
According to all the books on the topic,  
it's taboo to use magic to change one's feelings.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Besides, would {player} even─  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Would I what?  
`Tag 1`  
**Shiori：**  
Eeek!  
Why...? What are you doing here...?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You're the one who invited me.  
`Tag 2`  
**Shiori：**  
Huh...? Oh, that's right.  
It's the perfect day for a stroll.  
Don't you think? Heheh... heh...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Why did I say it like that?  
What should I do? He's bound to think I'm a weirdo...  
What to do...? Er, ummmm...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...Huh? Hyaaa!  
  

---  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I-I can't see anything...  
**Choice: (4)**  What was the point in that?  
`Tag 3`  
`Tag 4`  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...I-I'm so sorry!  
I'll dispel the magic right away!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Goodness, why is {player}'s face covered in bubbles?  
Is it because I didn't want him to see me panicking?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
How do I fix this? I need to do something fast...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...Hyaaa!  
  

---  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...Nghhh!  
H-huh...?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Th-that hurts...  
`Tag 5`  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
S-sorry!  
I'll untie us right away...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Wh-why... are {player} and I wrapped together...?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Heheheh. I can't say I'm not happy about it though...  
...No! This isn't the time to be thinking about that!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
This time... please, pull us away from each other!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...I'm really, really sorry.  
I never thought something like this would happen...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I know you didn't mean to do it.  
`Tag 6`  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
I'm sorry...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
I can't believe I'd blow someone I care about this far away...  
He's bound to hate me now...  
Huh?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
That wound—how did you get it?  
It wasn't my magic just now, was it...?!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
I've got it, I'll heal you with another spell─  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...Or maybe I shouldn't.  
It's because I'm relying on my magic for everything that this happened.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
I wonder if there's anything I can do as I am now.  
I guess not... I mean, I can't even use magic properly.  
I can only do this much...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...Um, here.  
It's just a normal bandage.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
I'm so sorry. This is all I can do right now.  
I wish I could heal you with magic, but I keep messing up, so...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  This is more than enough.  
`Tag 7`  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Huh? I don't believe you.  
I mean, I've been such a nuisance—to the point that I even hurt you...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
I'm going to grow much stronger as a magical girl,  
so that one day I'll be able to heal you.  
So please, until then...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Those feelings make me happier than any magic could.  
`Tag 8`  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
{player}...  
  
**Narration：**  
After reflecting on her overreliance on magic, Shiori convinced herself  
that the best way to express her feelings was through her efforts alone.
