**Narration：**  
Magical Huntress Purely★Shiori has become a total celebrity in  
Landosol. She is all fired up by her sense of duty to proactively  
help others, just like her big sister Hatsune.  
  
**Man：**  
Yo, magical girl! You're working hard, huh?  
How ya holding up?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
All is well, thank you very much.  
How have you been since the last incident?  
Is there anything at all troubling you?  
  
**Man：**  
Lemme think... Not particularly.  
Haha, maybe just my mom giving me a hard time.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
There must surely be something.  
Anything at all.  
If I can be of use, please don't hesitate to let me know.  
  
**Man：**  
Huh? Let's see...  
Nope, everything's totally fine right now. Yeah.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Oh,is that right?  
Well, I'm glad to hear it...  
  
**Boy：**  
Oh! It's Purely Shiori!  
Hey hey, do that thing!  
\"Purely Arrow!\"  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Heheh. Maybe next time.  
More importantly, is there anything at alltroubling you?  
I'll help you out, whatever the problem may be.  
  
**Boy：**  
What? I dunno about that kinda stuff.  
Hey, lemme see thattransformation of yours!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Again, maybe next time.  
I'm the type of person who helps others, you know.  
So, if you need any help with anything, please tell me─  
  
**Boy：**  
Boo, you're so lame!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Ah... And he's gone.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Aren't you being a little impatient?  
`Tag 1`  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...Huh?  
No, I don't think I am.  
I'm only trying to be helpful to others.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
I'm sure Hatsune would have better luck...  
  
**Man：**  
M-monster!  
Another monster appeared!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...!  
Did you hear that just now?  
Let's hurry over there!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
There it is. It's the same as last time.  
It's a type of Antibeast, isn't it?  
We have to do something about it...  
  
**Woman：**  
Ah, it's you! You're here just in time!  
Look, it's one of those things again.  
Sorry to ask this of you, but could you please save us?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Of course!  
Let's go, {player}.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Now's my chance to save everyone...  
Just like Hatsune!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
It's dangerous, so please stay back.  
Here I go... Purely Arrow!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...I missed?!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Sorry, I'll try again...  
Purely Arrow!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
I can't hit it...!  
Why is this happening?  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Woman：**  
Aaaahhh!  
  
**Man：**  
The monster's heading for the business district!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
What should I do? At this rate...  
At this rate, I won't be able to save anyone at all! I'll never be like  
Hatsune!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Support me while I take it on.  
`Tag 2`  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
But then...  
I promised *I* would save everyone...  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRRRRHHH...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Oh no, the monster's heading this way!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
!  
{player}, look out!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Purely Shower!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...Now's your chance! Its guard is down! Attack!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
I'm so sorry.  
I was supposed to be the one to defeat it, but I ended up relying on you...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I couldn't have done it without you, Shiori.  
`Tag 3`  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
But...  
  
**Man　：**  
Holy moly, you really saved us back there!  
Once again, the magical girl came to the rescue.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Honestly, I didn't do anything...  
My magic failed, and I put everyone in danger...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Deep down I knew.  
I knew that I couldn't do it...  
  
**Woman：**  
What are you talking about?  
We were saved by both of you, weren't we?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Both of us...?  
  
**Woman：**  
Exactly. If it weren't for the two of you,  
we'd be in the ground by now.  
So you really should give yourself some credit.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Give myself some credit...  
I guess I was far too eager to be more like Hatsune.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
I want to look cool helping others, just like her...  
But there's no way my magic will work when I feel like that.  
  
**Boy：**  
Hey, hey, Purely Shiori!  
Show me that thing you did earlier!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...Heheh. I guess I have no choice.  
Okay, watch closely. It goes like this...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Hatsune is Hatsune, and I am me.  
Together with {player}, I hope I can  
help those around me in my own way.  
  
**Narration：**  
With that, Shiori secretly resolved to do her best as a magical girl,  
but in her own way.
