**Narration：**  
One day, when there are remarkably no monsters in Landosol,  
Shiori is out with {player}, as previously promised...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Um... Could I possibly ask a favor of you?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Yeah, of course.  
`Tag 1`  
**Shiori：**  
I was hoping we could get a little exercise today.  
Like, at an amusement park or a sports park...  
  
**Shiori：**  
I don't mean to force you, of course...  
It's just, I don't usually go to such places, so I thought it might be okay  
from time to time.  
Can... we?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's go.  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm a little worried about you, but okay.  
`Tag 2`  
`Tag 3`  
**Shiori：**  
Are you sure?  
Heheh, thank you so much.  
  
**Shiori：**  
All right, let's g─  
  
**Shiori：**  
What's this light...?  
Eek?!  
  

---  
  
**Shiori：**  
{player}, over here!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You're awfully energetic today.  
`Tag 4`  
**Shiori：**  
Am I?  
I'm not trying to be different from usual.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Is it okay for you to be in such high spirits?  
`Tag 5`  
**Shiori：**  
Don't worry about me so much.  
It's no good living my life as though I'll always be in poor health.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hey, look at that. See that spinning thing over there?  
What kind of ride is it?  
Let's go and check it out!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Wow...  
I didn't expect the swing ride to spin so fast.  
How it looks and how it feels are totally different.  
  
**Shiori：**  
*cough* *cough*...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Are you okay?  
`Tag 6`  
**Shiori：**  
I'm fine.  
...Heheh. Just a little surprised.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ah, look at that over there.  
It says \"Transformation Corner\"...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Look, you can rent costumes here.  
It seems there are many different types.  
We might as well give it a try, seeing as we're here.

**Shiori：**  
...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Um... How do I look?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  It suits you perfectly.  
**Choice: (8)**  You look like a real-life magical girl.  
`Tag 7`  
`Tag 8`  
**Shiori：**  
Heheh... I'm glad.  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's a magical girl costume.  
Just once, I wanted to try a costume like this.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Pure Heart, Lock On!  
Magical Arrow: Critical!  
  
**Shiori：**  
...Or something, heheh.  
Look, I can even pose like this.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Don't overdo it, okay?  
`Tag 9`  
**Shiori：**  
I'm fine!  
I'm confident about my health today─  
  
**Shiori：**  
H-huh...?

`image display end`  
**Shiori：**  
Huh? Did I...?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I see... So I did pass out after all.  
Sorry about that. And you were already worried about me...  
  
**Shiori：**  
I know it's quite strange, but I really thought I would be okay today.  
You're always so worried about me,  
so I thought maybe I should try a little harder today... Sorry.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I guess this is just...  
my fate. To stay unwell forever...  
  
**Boy：**  
Oh! Here she is!  
Look, the girl from before!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Huh?  
  
**Girl：**  
What was that about? Jeez—  
girls are so wimpy.  
  
**Boy：**  
Miss Magical Girl, are you okay?  
Did the bad guys get you?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Did you... see me faint earlier?  
  
**Girl：**  
Tch! I thought you were so cool back there.  
You better get well soon.  
  
**Boy：**  
Miss, you are the girl from earlier, right?  
Please do that thing again—Magical Arrow!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Umm, uh...  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Let's come back again when you feel better.  
`Tag 10`  
**Shiori：**  
...Definitely.  
I'd love to come here with you again, {player}.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Listen, you two.  
I promise I'll come back one day and transform into a magical girl again.

**Ameth：**  
Aaand we meet again.  
How was the dream?  
Well, you'll forget it when you wake up,  
so don't think too much into it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Shiori's health wasn't the best, so it always troubled her.  
After all, she was making you worried.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So she would try too hard to show you that she was fine.  
I find that part of her really admirable.  
I'm sure you understand, so forgive her, okay?  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's all for today.  
Well then, see you next time.  
  

---  
  
**Shiori：**  
...*yawn*  
Huh? Why was I sleeping in a place like this?  
  
**Shiori：**  
...Oh no, it's already so late!  
{player}, wake up!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Just when I thought we could hang out together...  
It ended up just being a nap date.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ah, do you want to go to a cafe?  
There's still time for that.  
  
**Choice: (11)**  Let's chat until closing time.  
`Tag 11`  
**Shiori：**  
Heheheh...  
I Actually know a stylish cafe─  
  
**Man：**  
Wahhh!  
Another monster appeared!  
  
**Shiori：**  
...  
  
**Shiori：**  
I heard about it from Hatsune─  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Man：**  
Somebody!  
Can anyone defeat it?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
...Heheh.  
Goodness, there goes the rest of the day.  
  
**Shiori：**  
But I guess that's just how it goes for us.  
Let's go, {player}.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Pure Heart, Lock On!  
Magical Arrow: Critical!  
  
**Narration：**  
Magical Huntress Purely★Shiori once again joined forces with  
{player} in order to exterminate an Antibeast.
