## Subtitle: The Holy Beast of Wonderland
  
**Narration：**  
Maho and {player} have come  
to the beach to take part in a certain event.  
  
**Maho：**  
Mmm! Mighty fine weather today.  
Can't think of a better time to visit Wonderland.  
  
**Maho：**  
What's with that adorable li'l expression,  
my prince?  
This isn't Wonderland, it's just the regular ol' beach, you say?  
  
**Maho：**  
Come now, my prince.  
The beach becomes Wonderland during the summer.  
That's common sense in the Maho-Maho Kingdom.  
  
**Maho：**  
That said, there sure are a lot of people here for the festival.  
Stay close by me, my prince, otherwise we might get split up.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's this festival about?  
`Tag 1`  
**Maho：**  
Well,  
it's a festival held to thank the holy beast of Wonderland  
for a bountiful harvest.  
  
**Maho：**  
The holy beast's awfully kind, you see.  
It's always watchin' over and protecting us.  
  
**Maho：**  
That's why we hold this festival.  
We pay tribute to it by dancin' a dance of gratitude.  
  
**Maho：**  
I make it a point to never miss this festival myself.  
After all, the holy beast of Wonderland is a resident of the Maho-Maho Kingdom.  
  
**Maho：**  
It only makes sense that the princess of said kingdom comes along, doesn't it?  
Hehe. I couldn't be any happier that you're here with me today.  
  
**Maho：**  
This sea of people and the sun blazin' down's  
already got me exhausted, though. I ain't that good with the heat in the first place.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's take a break.  
`Tag 2`  
**Maho：**  
Thanks a bunch, my prince.  
Sorry for the hassle.  
What say we make our way to those food stalls over there?  
  
**Maho：**  
It ain't a festival without food stalls,  
after all.  
Feels like the perfect place to rest.  
  
**Maho：**  
Freshly broiled fish, accessories made from seashells,  
water balloon fishing...  
Hehe.  
You can just feel all the hustle and bustle.  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh, that stall over there's sellin' shaved ice.  
How wonderful.  
We might as well pop over. ♪  
  
**Staff：**  
Welcome!  
What flavor would you like?  
  
**Maho：**  
Wow! Choosin' between this many'll be mighty hard.  
Strawberry's lovely, but it'll make my tongue all red.  
And I'd be red myself  
if I let my prince see that.  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
What the heck?!  
How about you watch where you're goin'?!  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh!  
Awfully sorry about that. I didn't meant to bump into you.  
You're not hurt, are you?  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Ouch! The pain's killing me! I-I can't even stand!  
My leg's definitely broke!  
You're gonna have to cough up the money for me to get it treated.  
  
**Maho：**  
Am I...?  
Well that ain't good.  
I ain't got much on me in the first place...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You bumped into her on purpose, didn't you?  
**Choice: (4)**  You don't need to cough up anything.  
`Tag 3`  
**Maho：**  
Huh? On purpose?  
Why would he do that?  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Maho：**  
But his leg's broken, my prince.  
I can't just ignore him...  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Maho：**  
Oh, I know.  
I can fix him up with my magic. ♪  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Magic?! As if that'll make things right—  
  
**Maho：**  
Ain't no need to be so reserved.  
Miracle Mahorin, twinkle-twinkle hoy. ♪  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
What the heck? It's cold... My body's... freezing up...  
Qu-quit it!  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh. I wanted to use healing magic, but looks like I messed up.  
It should be fine this time, though.  
Twinkle-twinkle ho—  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Wh-whatever!  
I'll remember this!  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh my. He ran off with a spring in his step.  
Guess I managed to heal him after all. ♪  
  
**Woman：**  
Are you two okay?  
Looked like you were being pestered by that ruffian.  
  
**Maho：**  
My prince protected me, so I'm fine.  
He was so cool and gallant. ♪  
  
**Woman：**  
That's a relief.  
We've been seeing a lot more people like that recently.  
It's kind of becoming a big issue.  
  
**Maho：**  
There do seem to be some awfully scary folk around,  
now that you mention it.  
How come?  
  
**Woman：**  
There've been rumors of some poachers trying to catch  
the holy beast and sell it off for a pretty penny.  
Chances are they're the ones who hired all those ruffians.  
  
**Maho：**  
They... want to catch the holy beast?  
  
**Maho：**  
Not just that, they also want to sell it off?  
That's horrible.  
I won't forgive anyone  
that tries to bully our holy beast!  
  
**Woman：**  
The feeling's mutual.  
They're just rumors, though. We don't have any actual proof.  
  
**Maho：**  
That's true.  
We can't go around catchin' them before they've actually done anything.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Let's protect the holy beast.  
`Tag 6`  
**Maho：**  
Yeah! We can keep an eye on it and catch  
anyone who's going after it red-handed!  
  
**Maho：**  
This is an issue for the Maho-Maho Kingdom, after all.  
As princess, I can't be letting no poachers have their way.  
  
**Maho：**  
We'll protect the holy beast together, my prince!  
Let's get goin'!  
  
**Maho：**  
The sea before us is where the holy beast lives.  
We'll hide between these trees and see if the poachers turn up.  
  
**Maho：**  
The breeze here  
sure feels great, though.  
Hiding in the shade's makin' me a li'l bit sleepy.  
  
**Maho：**  
Come on over here, my prince.  
It's too hot to be out in the sunlight.  
  
**Holy Beast：**  
Squeak! Squeak!  
  
**Maho：**  
Hm? I know that squeaking! Have a look, my prince.  
That's the holy beast over there, sticking its head slightly out of the water.  
  
**Maho：**  
Those big, round eyes are so adorable.  
I should offer up a prayer, just for good luck. ♪  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Look! There it is!  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
All right! Go get it!  
  
**Maho：**  
And there're the poachers, too.  
That's a mighty big crew.  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh no! They're throwing rocks at it!  
Let's go, my prince!  
  
**Maho：**  
That's enough!  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Huh?!  
You're that weird couple from before!  
You here to get in our way now?!  
  
**Maho：**  
The prince and princess of the Maho-Maho Kingdom  
are duty bound to protect the kingdom's residents.  
We won't let you have the holy beast!  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Quit running your mouth!  
I ain't holding back this time! You're in for a world of hurt!  
  
**Maho：**  
They're comin' for us all at once.  
It'd be great if you could lend me your power, my prince.  
  
**Maho：**  
Thanks a million.  
Let's get started, now!  
Miracle Mahorin, twinkle twinkle hoy!  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Argh?! Wh-what the heck?!  
Th-that explosion was wild!  
  
**Maho：**  
It really is easier to control my magic when you're helpin' out. ♪  
Miracle Mahorin, twinkle twinkle hoy!  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
N-now you've done it!  
We've got plenty more people, though!  
  
**Maho：**  
Gosh. I didn't think there'd be this many of you.  
Whatever should we do?  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Heh heh heh. We've got you now!  
You're gonna regret this!  
  
**Maho：**  
It'd be real easy if I could go all out,  
but I'd hate for the holy beast to be caught up in my spells...  
  
**Holy Beast：**  
Squeak! ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Hm?  
That was the holy beast's voice, wasn't it?  
  
**Holy Beast：**  
Squeak! Squeak squeak!  
  
**Maho：**  
I see, I see.  
Got it.  
  
**Maho：**  
Mind if I ask you a favor, my prince?  
The holy beast is saying that it wants you to use your power on it.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Sure thing!  
`Tag 7`  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Quit the talk already!  
Let's waste these two and take the holy—  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
H-hey...  
Something's coming right at us!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
M-monsters?! They just popped right out of the sea!  
Hold up! They're coming right for us! Run!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH  
  
**Maho：**  
That swarm of monsters went straight at them...  
Did you call them?  
  
**Maho：**  
Wouldn't expect any less from our holy beast.  
  
**Holy Beast：**  
Squeak!  
Squeaky-squeak! ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
It's all thanks to my prince's power?  
That makes sense.  
He's super amazing, after all.  
  
**Holy Beast：**  
Squeak!  
  
**Maho：**  
You need to return home, do you?  
Take care, then.  
Bye-bye!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Hopefully it gets home safe.  
**Choice: (9)**  Thanks for helping us!  
`Tag 8`  
**Maho：**  
Aye.  
Can only pray that it doesn't get lost.  
  
Jump to tag 10  
`Tag 9`  
**Maho：**  
Hehe.  
I'm sure your feelings've come across. ♪  
  
`Tag 10`  
**Maho：**  
Doubt those poachers'll be back again after that.  
Another happily ever after. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Real glad I got to talk with the holy beast,  
too.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hm?  
How come I was able to understand what it was saying?  
  
**Maho：**  
Because it's a resident of the Maho-Maho Kingdom, of course.  
Makes sense that I would understand,  
right?  
  
**Maho：**  
And don't forget you're the prince of the kingdom.  
I'm sure you'll understand what it's saying next time you meet.  
  
**Narration：**  
Maho stares out at where the holy beast disappeared into the waves,  
a warm smile on her face.
