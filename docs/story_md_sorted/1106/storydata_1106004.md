## Subtitle: An Extra Special Summer
  
**Narration：**  
The sun has begun to set by the time {player}  
and Maho are done enjoying their time with the holy beast.  
  
**Maho：**  
Today sure just flew by, didn't it?  
  
**Maho：**  
Have a look, my prince.  
The sunset reflectin' off the sea  
makes for a mighty pretty sight, doesn't it?  
  
**Maho：**  
It's almost like there's rays of light comin' right down from the sky.  
They're so bright and shiny...  
  
**Maho：**  
Hm? Wait. Are they really comin' down from the sky?  
They're so pretty. ♪

**Maho：**  
Oh! Good morning,  
my prince.  
Hehe. I knew I'd meet you if I came here. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Truth is, I planned this li'l ambush  
'cause I had a favor to ask of you.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  A favor?  
**Choice: (2)**  A li'l \"ambush\"?  
`Tag 1`

Hehe.  
I knew you would hear me out.  
You're the kindest prince in all the land, after all.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Maho：**  
I just had to meet you, no matter what.  
This is a real important favor.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Maho：**  
We have a break comin' up, don't we?  
I wanna go see some horses durin' that time.  
  
**Maho：**  
But horses from the Maho-Maho Kingdom are special.  
They walk through the sea, not open fields.  
All while the prince and princess  
ride on their backs.  
  
**Maho：**  
Gazin' at the bright blue sky and sea, nice 'n slow. Nice 'n slow.  
Sounds lovely, doesn't it?  
  
**Maho：**  
With that said.  
How's about you come join me, my prince?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Sure will.  
`Tag 4`  
**Maho：**  
Hehe.  
Always a straight answer with you.  
  
**Maho：**  
That settles it.  
Let's go see ourselves some horses. ♪

**Maho：**  
Wow!  
Never realized that you'd be so high up when sitting on a horse.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hehe.  
Thanks so much for comin' along today, my prince.  
  
**Maho：**  
Glad we picked a course that lets the both of us ride together.  
It's almost like you've come along to  
take me on a date.  
Ever so romantic, ain't it?  
  
**Maho：**  
Do you mind if I hold on to you a bit tighter?  
It'd be terrible if I fell off.  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh. Are you a li'l bit embarassed, my prince?  
Hehe. That's mighty adorable.  
  
**Maho：**  
Mmm!  
The water feels nice and refreshing. Itr's great.  
  
**Maho：**  
Horse ridin' with my prince over the calm sea,  
under a lovely blue sky...  
  
**Maho：**  
Reckon there ain't a better summer vacation that that. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Eeek?!  
Wh-why did it stumble all of a sudden?  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh. It hit a li'l rock, did it?  
There, there. Settle down.  
That's a good horsie.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hm? What's the matter, my prince?  
You're awful fidgety.  
  
**Maho：**  
Did that take you by surprise, too?  
  
**Maho：**  
Huh? It's because I'm clingin' onto you so tight?  
You're a real shy one, ain't ya? ♪  
  
![110600402.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/110600402.webp)  
**Maho：**  
Hehe. I can hear your heartbeat  
when I'm holdin' onto you like this.  
  
**Maho：**  
I was never that fond of the sea durin' summer before.  
I couldn't handle all the people and all the noise.  
  
**Maho：**  
Spendin' time together with you like this  
is one way to make me change my mind, though.  
  
**Maho：**  
It's just the two of us here together,  
ridin' a horse towards our dreams.  
  
**Maho：**  
That's what I call a great summer.  
I wish it would go on forever.

**Ameth：**  
A summer trip to the sea together, is it?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Sounds pretty great.  
Sure wish I got summer vacations.  
  
**Ameth：**  
No doubt in my mind that Maho  
sees you as her Prince Charming.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So do your best not to destroy that image of her's, okay?  
Be the prince you know you can be.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I guess it's almost time.  
I'll let you get back to enjoying the beach.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Bye-bye. ♪

**Maho：**  
Mmm... When did I fall asleep?  
*yawn* I feel nice and refreshed, at least.  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh. He's asleep, too.  
Hehe. He was even leanin' against me.  
  
**Maho：**  
It's about time we go home, though.  
Wake up for me, will you?  
  
**Maho：**  
Good mornin'. Did you get some good sleep?  
Don't worry. I fell asleep as well.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hey. I had a dream about you.  
We were ridin'  
along the seashore on a horse together.  
  
**Maho：**  
Huh? You had the same dream?  
We really can't be separated, even in our deams. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Now then.  
Sad as it is, it's time we make our way back home.  
  
**Maho：**  
Not only did we get to experience Wonderland,  
we got to hold the Maho-Maho Kingdom's national event.  
Just a perfect summer all around.  
  
**Maho：**  
It'd be real great if the two of us  
could go another trip together someday.  
  
**Narration：**  
Staring up at the sunset, {player} and  
Maho think back on the fun experiences they shared.
