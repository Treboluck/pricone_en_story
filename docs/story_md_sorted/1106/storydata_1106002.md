**Narration：**  
Maho, who is slated to perform a dance for the festival,  
arrives with {player} for a meeting.  
  
**Maho：**  
So this is the stage...  
Just the idea of dancin' here  
has me all nervous...  
  
**Organizer：**  
Um, excuse me.  
Are you one of the performers scheduled to dance today?  
  
**Maho：**  
That's correct, yes.  
I'm looking forward to it.  
  
**Organizer：**  
Well... I hate to say this,  
but your partner for today has come down with a case of food poisoning.  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh no! That's awful.  
Is he okay?  
  
**Organizer：**  
Yes, fortunately. The symptoms are light,  
but not enough to allow him to perform today.  
  
**Maho：**  
Well then...  
That leaves me in a li'l bit of a pickle.  
  
**Organizer：**  
Indeed.  
We're going to have to cancel the whole thing at this rate...  
  
**Maho：**  
This dance is the main attraction of the entire festival. Everyone's been lookin' forward to it, too.  
Is there nothing we can do?  
  
**Organizer：**  
Hm... The only solution I can think of  
is if someone else steps in to be your partner.  
  
**Maho：**  
Urgh... That's a fairly big demand...  
If only there were someone around here, real close by,  
that could be my partner. *glance*  
  
**Maho：**  
It's a cryin' shame. This'll put a real damper on the whole festival.  
I really wish there was someone who could fill in... *glance, glance*  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Volunteer.  
**Choice: (2)**  Raise hand.

Hehe.  
I'm so happy that you'd volunteer.  
Let's give it the best we've got. ♪  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Maho：**  
Always there to save the princess when she's in a pickle,  
just as a prince should.  
Thanks a bunch.  
  
**Maho：**  
Now we've got the princess and prince of the Maho-Maho Kingdom  
set to dance together.  
This might as well be our national event.  
  
**Maho：**  
We gotta make it a success.  
  
**Maho：**  
You ain't got nothin' to worry about, my prince.  
I'll teach you everythin' you need to know.  
  
**Maho：**  
Now then. Let's get to practicing. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
I'll show you an example first, so just watch how I do it.  
  
**Maho：**  
First, you hold your fan like this.  
And then,  
one, two, three. ♪ One, two, three. ♪

`Tag 4`  
**Maho：**  
Praise from the prince himself!  
Ain't I a happy gal? ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
I took lessons in all sorts of subjects before comin' to Landosol.  
Dancing is something  
I was particularly fond of.  
  
**Maho：**  
All righty. It's your turn, my prince.  
Try mimicking how I did it just now.  
  
**Maho：**  
Aaand one, two, three. ♪ One, two, three. ♪  
You've got your hand movements backwards, my prince.  
  
**Maho：**  
Let's try again.  
One, two, three. ♪ One, two, three. ♪  
Oh no. Now you dropped your fan.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hm... This dance does have a tricky rhythm to it.  
It's not the best choice for a beginner...  
  
**Maho：**  
Why, you're all out of breath.  
Are you okay? Do you need a break?  
  
**Maho：**  
Huh? You want to give it another shot?  
If it's a national event, then you'll give it everythin' you've got?  
  
**Maho：**  
You really do care about the Maho-Maho Kingdom, don't you?  
I'm almost tearin' up here...  
  
**Maho：**  
If that's the case, then let's give it everythin'  
we've got together  
and make it a big success.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hm? Together...?  
That's it!  
  
**Maho：**  
We can change it up a li'l bit so that we're dancing together!  
It's one, two, three, except now we're holdin' hands!  
  
**Maho：**  
The rhythm's much easier to grasp this way.  
It should be a lot simpler for you.  
  
**Maho：**  
Plus, I can take the lead while we dance.  
It'll be a joint effort!  
  
**Maho：**  
Okay. Let's get back to practicin'!  
Stand facing towards me first, then place your hand around my back.  
  
**Maho：**  
As for your other hand... Here.  
  
**Maho：**  
Together, now.  
One, two, three. One, two, three.  
  
**Maho：**  
Um... Would you be able to bring yourself closer to me?  
Ain't no need to be shy...

Yup, that's better.  
Your face is so close that I can't help but gaze into your eyes... ♪

Aaand  
one, two, three. One, two, three.  
Heehee.  
It's almost like we're takin' part in a ball at our castle.  
  
**Maho：**  
I'd be wearin' a nice, frilly dress, and you'd be wearin' a tuxedo.  
It'd be a big castle with a hall to match,  
and we'd dance away hand in hand.  
  
**Maho：**  
We'd have all sorts of guests from Wonderland,  
and they'd be dancin' away as well.  
One, two, three-in' to the sound of real elegant music.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hehe. You're doin' well.  
We're perfectly sync'd up.

Yup. We should be good to go now.  
This'll be real fun.

**Maho：**  
How's that? Have you settled down?  
You don't hafta to be so nervous.
