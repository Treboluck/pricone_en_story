**Narration：**  
Around three months have passed  
since the defeat of the Omniscient Kaiser...  
  
**Karyl：**  
There, there!  
You're both such good widdle babies! ♪

Eheh... ♪  
Our two young wards have grown so very fond of you, Miss Karyl.  
It warms my heart to see them smiling and at ease. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait, since when am I a babysitter?!  
I'll kill you! I'll kill both of you brats dead!

`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, sweeter death threats I have never heard.  
But Miss Karyl, if I may...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I would appreciate it if you could be  
a little more careful with your language for the time being.  
It would not do for my lord and Miss Sheffy to pick up any bad habits.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Urgh... Geez, I guess if you insist.  
I mean, helping out with this guild is the main condition for  
my probation, so I'll do the babysitting thing if you need me to...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Still, though... \"Sheffy,\" huh.  
So you finally settled on a name.  
But where did that one come from?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I based it upon the response she gave,  
\"Shehh... fooh...\"  
 when I first inquired as to her name.  
Miss Sheffy herself seems quite fond of the sound.  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Shee foo! ♪  
Shee foo! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah, sure, sure, I get it already...  
But I gotta ask, who is she anyway?  
We ended up looking after her as a matter of course, but...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Sheffy's identity...  
We are, I am sorry to say, no closer to solving that mystery.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine used her influence to gather information from the citizens,  
but we have yet to find anyone who recognized the description  
of a girl with pale blue hair, strange wings, and a tail.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh...?  
They really are unusual, those wings and tail she's sporting.  
Would they make her a \"dragongirl\"?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Still, I gotta say, Pecorine's a real big shot now, huh.  
Never thought I'd see her barking out orders and stuff.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine is, after all, a most royal personage from birth.  
She may not seem so to us, since she has always been so kind  
as to treat us as equals...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But she even promised us that she would endeavor  
to further investigate the nature of my lord's ailment.  
Though restoring the palace's great library may still take some time...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It seems that to fund the city repairs, many treasures and artifacts from  
the palace vault are being auctioned off to the public.  
 Some of these  
artifacts may be able to aid a person's mental state,  
 or so she claims.  
  
**Karyl：**  
If it's just a \"may,\" I guess we shouldn't get our hopes up.  
  
...Hey, stop that, {player}!  
My hair isn't a toy for pulling!  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Goo! Goooo! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yaaghh!  
 ...Not you too, Sheffy!  
Please don't start sucking on my ears!  
Gahhhh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl... The children really are very fond of you.  
I actually feel a little envious...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, come on, Koro! Aren't you a bit too accepting of all this?!  
Doesn't it weird you out at all?!  
How are you happily caring for them like a proud new mother?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Well, let's see.  
Even I do have certain reservations...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But my lord and Miss Sheffy are happy and full of energy.  
Compared to the period when we feared they may never awaken,  
I cannot help but feel this is far preferable.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Urgh...  
Well, I can't argue with that, but...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Besides, while I was proud of my lord's developing gallantry,  
his current innocent state is also most adorable...  
That is how I honestly feel. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
*sigh*... I almost forgot.  
You've always been a bit crazy when it comes to him...  
  
**Karyl：**  
If you ask me, this child-raising stuff is just exhausting.  
I'm still too young to deal with this kind of thing...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Now, now. Let us remain positive, Miss Karyl.  
We still have a roof above our heads,  
and many wonderful friends to aid us  
 with housework and meals.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey there! ♪  
We're back again, Kokkoro!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, just as I mentioned.  
Miss Hiyori, Miss Yui.  
It is good to see you.  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh, Karyl's here too!  
Hi there!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Uh... hi.  
  
**Sheffy：**  
*giggle*  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Goo goo! ♪  
`Tag 3`  
**Yui：**  
Eheh.  
 Mr. Knight and little Sheffy still seem happy!  
Good boy, good girl! ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh?  
Is Miss Rei not accompanying the two of you today?  
  
**Yui：**  
Right—I was about to explain that...

**Hiyori：**  
Hey guys, let's go to the festival together!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm... A festival, you say?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It's not a big one like before the battle.  
Just a little party to celebrate rebuilding!  
That's where Rei is—she's helping set things up.  
  
**Yui：**  
Some people are complaining it's not appropriate,  
when there are still citizens without homes...  
But everyone's been working so hard, they need to cut loose a little.  
  
**Yui：**  
When things are tough, you need to smile.  
You've got to keep finding happiness where you can.  
That's what I think.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed... I do believe I agree.  
My lord and Miss Sheffy deserve a taste of fresh air, as well.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well...  
 Then, um...  
I think I'll stay and guard the fort!

**Hiyori：**  
Aww~! Why don't you come with?  
I bet the little ones  
 want everyone to come to the festival, right?

`Tag 4`  
**Sheffy：**  
Fessivul! ♪  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh! They spoke!  
Hey, guys, did you hear that?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes...!  
My lord and Miss Sheffy said their first words! ♪  
  
**Yui：**  
Well done, Mr. Knight!  
 You too, Sheffy!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...*sigh*  
Up till a few months ago, he was an idiot, but he could at least talk.  
How did we end up like this...?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
So...? C'mon, Karyl!  
You're gonna come to the festival with us, aren't you?  
  
**Karyl：**  
O-oh, all right.  
If you want.  
I'll try not to get in the way or anything...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Eheheh. Yaaaay!  
  
**Sheffy：**  
*giggle*  
  
**Yui：**  
...Hey, Kokkoro...  
Do you think Karyl has some kind of problem with the three of us?  
Sometimes it feels as though she's avoiding us...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
No, I do not think that is the case.  
If anything, Miss Karyl is simply shy around new people.  
  
**???：**  
...  
  
**???：**  
...Heh.  
So dumb...  
  
**???：**  
Look at 'em all toiling away.  
Talk about causing a racket.  
  
**???：**  
I guess the wounds the Kaiser left  
have finally healed enough to form a scab?  
Hah.  
  
**???：**  
Now, I wonder... Will that scab bleed if you scratch it?  
Or maybe it'll cause some noisy squeals?  
Heheheh...  
  
**???：**  
Either way...  
Sucks to be Zane and the others,  
but I feel like winning this game before it starts!
