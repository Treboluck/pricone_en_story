GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's no good...!  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord!  
Please stand back!  
  
**Kariza：**  
Heh! Akira Mosakuji's Princess Knight, huh?!  
Then you can...  
 die too!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hold on a minute!  
That's-Enough-of-That Strike!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Pecorine!  
You...  
 Y-you're late, dummy!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh!  
Sorry it took me so long to get here, everyone!  
And...  
  
**Kariza：**  
...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
As for you people...!  
I don't know who you are, but I won't let you—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wh-whoa! My Royal Equipment's running at full blast,  
and my attacks still don't work!  
How crazy is that?!  
  
**Yui：**  
Be careful, Pecorine!  
These monsters are...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I know!  
That aura nullifies all our attacks, doesn't it?  
Looks like what Neneka told me was true!  
  
**Kariza：**  
Hah!  
That peewee-hag from the Crowns gave you tips, huh, Princess?!  
  
**Kariza：**  
But too bad.  
Just knowing how my powers work won't help you—

**Pecorine：**  
Big huuuuug!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  ?!  
`Tag 2`  
**Kariza：**  
Wait, huh?! The hell're you doing?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh?  
I'm hugging {player}, that's what!  
  
**Karyl：**  
We can see that, dummy!  
Th-that's not the point...  
  
**Yui：**  
Um... um, um, why are you doing that right now?!  
Pecorine...!  
  
**Monster：**  
G-GRUOGHH...?  
  
**Rei：**  
Even the monsters have stopped stock-still in surprise...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Is this some kind of new strategy?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine has always been over-affectionate,  
so I doubt it somehow...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  ...  
`Tag 3`  
`image display end`  
**Yui：**  
...Um, Pecorine...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...H-huh...?  
Well, that's weird.  
Neneka said if I did this, everything would be ready to go...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ready...?  
  
**Kariza：**  
Tch.  
What a dumb joke...!  
Don't just stand there, monster scum! Get 'em!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Waaaaahhhhh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Owwww...!  
Hey, Dumborine!  
Your entrance was cool and all, but it hasn't changed a single thing!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Owieee...  
Th-that's really weird.  
Is there still something else I need to do...?  
  
**Kariza：**  
Hah!  
The hell? For all your dumb games, you're still helpless?  
I knew you couldn't be all that tough, Princess Knight and company!  
  
**Kariza：**  
Well then, let's finish this!  
  
**Yui：**  
...Hold on!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yui?!  
  
**Rei：**  
Yui, look out!  
You mustn't get too close...!  
  
**Yui：**  
Kariza!  
Just now, you said your target was me, didn't you?  
  
**Kariza：**  
...Ehhhh?  
  
**Yui：**  
Then leave Mr. Knight...  
Leave everyone else out of this, OK?!  
You can do what you like with me!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Don't say that, Yui! You mustn't...!  
That's no good at all!  
  
**Rei：**  
Agreed!  
We could never allow you to sacrifice yourself!  
  
**Kariza：**  
Hahah!  
Hahahah!  
Oh, this is great! I love it when weaklings beg for mercy!  
  
**Kariza：**  
You \"won't let her\"?  
 Get over yourselves!  
Who says Pinky's life is even enough to satisfy me?  
That's for me to decide!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGGRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
A-aahhhh...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  ...!  
`Tag 4`  
**Yui：**  
Run... away... Mr... Knight...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Yu... i...!  
`Tag 5`  
**Sheffy：**  
Yooee!  
  

---  
  
**Choice: (6)**  ...!  
`Tag 6`  
**???：**  
...  
...  
  
**???：**  
...A new key.  
From the peak of creation's tower to the depths of heaven.  
  
**???：**  
One and ten exchange places.  
The goddess, her eyes unmasked,  
forms a new key to sever the blackness.  
  
**???：**  
Deeply, softly.  
Toward the newly opened eyes deep within.  
Speak the words...  
  

---  
  
**Choice: (7)**  A new... key.  
`Tag 7`  
**Pecorine：**  
Wh-what's all this light?!  
The ground beneath my feet and Yui's is shining super bright!  
  
**Yui：**  
Is this... the same as before...?!  
  
**Kariza：**  
...Tch! Not this again.  
Guess we'd better finish the job before it's too late!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGGRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Rei：**  
Not so fast!  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's about time you quit acting so high-and-mighty!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey, Yui! Are you OK?!  
  
**Yui：**  
Y-yes...!  
I used my healing magic...  
But why did this light appear again?  
  
**Karyl：**  
And is it just me, or are there two of you glowing this time?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh—  
I get it!  
This must be what Neneka meant!  
The sign that everything's ready!  
  
**Yui：**  
Ready...?  
I don't think I prepared anything like this...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No, no! I'm pretty sure you can do it too!  
Accept this new power from {player}...  
and allow it to transform your body!  
  
**Yui：**  
A new power from Mr. Knight...?  
And did you say \"transform\"?!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  ...\"Speak the words...\"  
`Tag 8`  
**Kokkoro：**  
...My lord...?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hold up...  
Are you completely back to your normal self?!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  That's not what matters right now.  
`Tag 9`  
**Pecorine：**  
Right!  
For now, we fight!  
  
**Yui：**  
Okay! Let's try this transformation thing!  
If that's what'll save everyone!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Great!  
Then let's do this! Yui!
