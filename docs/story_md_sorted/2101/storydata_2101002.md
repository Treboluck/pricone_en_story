## Subtitle: Princess Eustiana
  
**Narration：**  
Meanwhile back in the city,  
Pecorine is busy meeting with the nobles of Landosol  
as part of her royal duties as Princess.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Hm...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Just now, I thought I heard  
{player}'s voice calling from far away...  
Was I imagining things?  
  
**Chairman：**  
...Then as planned, the restoration of District Seven and District Eight  
of Landosol City will be overseen by the Richmond Corporation.  
Does that seem all right, Your Majesty?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...  
  
**Chairman：**  
...Princess Eustiana?  
No objections, I trust?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh—nope!  
Sounds fine to me!  
  
**Chairman：**  
Dear me... We do need you to focus, Majesty.  
Each nod and stamp of approval you give  
decides the fate of this country's citizens. Try to remember that.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
O-of course... Please don't worry.  
I'm quite aware...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
All the palace staff whose memories the Kaiser had stolen  
have remembered that I'm the real Eustiana.  
And that's a wonderful thing, of course...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But... it turns out my mother and father  
were being drained of their magic for a long time.  
Though they're alive, they still have yet to awaken.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So I've laid down my sword and taken up the quill and seal  
to succeed them in their duties and rule this kingdom as best I can.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I do understand.  
So many people suffered at the Kaiser's hands,  
and we have to work hard to give them their old lives back.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Until the people of this city  
have roofs over their heads and delicious meals on their tables,  
I want to do everything in my power to help them.  
  
**Chairman：**  
Then direct your efforts to fulfilling your royal duties.  
The Council of Nobles will do all we can to support you in your tasks.  
Will we not, gentlemen?  
  
**Noble：**  
Of course, Chairman Gorschin!  
For the continued prosperity of Landosol!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
To Her Majesty the Princess Eustiana of Landosol!  
Long may she reign!  
  
**Noble：**  
Her Majesty the Princess Eustiana of Landosol!  
Long may she reign!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Yes.  
The Princess of Landosol, Eustiana...  
That's me now. The role I was originally born to fulfill.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I wouldn't want to turn my back on the citizens...  
But recently, I've barely had any chance to live my life  
as Pecorine of the Gourmet Guild.  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Princess Eustiana! Long may she reign!  
  
**Noble：**  
Princess Eustiana! Long may she reign!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Eustiana.\"  
It's my real name that I've had all my life...  
Yet somehow, hearing it feels so strange now.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
All my friends who used to call me Pecorine...  
What are they doing now, I wonder?  
  
**???：**  
...Mr. Knight. Mr. Knight...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  ...Huh...?  
`Tag 1`

Everyone's gone home already.

`Tag 2`  
**???：**  
Oh, me? I was just looking at you while you slept.  
Heheh. You were so cute!  
I could have watched you all day.  
  
**???：**  
After all, I've been...  
The truth is... for the longest time, I've been in l...  
  
**???：**  
Eheh...  
Eheheh...  
  
**???：**  
Silly {player}... You bad boy.  
It's not proper to bury your face in a lady's soft body like that.  
  
**???：**  
Oh, you're so hopeless.  
Sweet little baby...  
I'll just have to take good care of you! ♪  
  
**???：**  
Honestly... What appeal is there to find in such a young body?  
You truly are as depraved as they come.  
  
**???：**  
*sniff*... Are you really that kind of creep?  
  
**???：**  
Oh, you suspicious creep!  
Go get yourself arrested!  
  
**???：**  
Creeps like you deserve to be executed!  
I'll bring you to justice!  
  
**???：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  ...?  
`Tag 3`  
**???：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Who's there...?  
`Tag 4`  
**???：**  
...  
  
**???：**  
This world is... falling apart.  
At this rate...
