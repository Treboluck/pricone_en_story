# Part 2: Chapter 1 Episode 3
{player} and the mystery girl show no signs of waking up, so the Gourmet Guild and Twinkle Wish do their best to care for them in their sleep. In the end, they do awaken, but their minds have reverted to an infant state.
  
## Subtitle: My Lord Returns...?
  
**Narration：**  
The mysterious girl had fallen out of the sky without any warning.  
As he caught her, a sudden flash of pain rushed through  
{player}'s head, and he lost consciousness.  
  
**Narration：**  
Since those events, three days have now passed...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...I see.  
 So that's what happened.  
That must've been tough, Kokkoro...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
No... Please do not worry about me.  
More concerning is the fact that my lord remains asleep.  
We cannot determine why he will not awaken.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
There are no signs of injury or internal damage.  
The doctor who inspected him  
suggested the possibility of mental fatigue as a potential cause, but...

**Kokkoro：**  
...Miss Yui.  
I believe you are a far more skilled user of healing magic than I.  
Please, might I ask you to take a look at my lord yourself?  
  
**Yui：**  
Of course—I'd be happy to!  
I'll do everything I can to help.  
 Spirits of light...  
  
**Rei：**  
And this is the girl you mentioned  
who came falling from the sky? Who in the world is she?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I have never seen her before either.  
My lord is acquainted with a great many young ladies,  
so it is possible that he knows her, but...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
We can ask them both when they wake up!  
...Yui, how's he look?  
  
`image display end`  
**Yui：**  
Hmm... I ran all the checks I know,  
but I couldn't find any traces of injuries or magic,  
or signs of things like curses either.  
  
**Yui：**  
I guess I'll try a few healing spells for starters.  
I hope that's all it takes to wake him up...  
  
**???：**  
Ahahah! ♪  
As if, as if! ☆  
How could it possibly be that easy?  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh?!  
You're, um... a fairy?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Miss Nebbia.  
This is the Guide Fairy who has long resided here  
in our guildhouse, young ladies of Twinkle Wish.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh...? She's so cute!  
Aw man! I bet it would be so much fun to have a little fairy friend! ♪  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Heheh! ♪ Well, thanks!  
Miss Beastgirl, that attitude is earning you  
brownie points with me already! ♪  
  
**Rei：**  
Nebbia. You claimed that Yui's efforts are misguided...  
Do you have suspicions of your own about why they won't awaken?  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Huh? How would I know a thing like that?  
If I knew the answer, I'd have told Kokkoro ages ago.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
But you know...  
I do have one idea for a technique  
 that might wake him up!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Really, Nebbia?! You do?!  
  
**Rei：**  
What is this method?  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Hee hee!  
Well, of course... It's a kiss! ♪  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh?! A-a-a-a kiss...?!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Yep! A little smooch from a cute girl  
will make his heart pound so fast, he'll wake right up!  
That's how these things work!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...This again?  
Your enthusiasm for such things is quite troubling, Miss Nebbia...  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Oh, c'mon. Don't you think it's worth a try?!  
Not on the forehead like Karyl did—let's see you go for the lips this time!  
  
**Rei：**  
Of all the suggestions,  
 a kiss, you say?!  
I-I find it hard to believe that it would have any real effect...  
  
**Yui：**  
Th-that's right! It's crazy talk!  
It wouldn't be right to kiss him while he's fast asleep, anyway...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
B-but, you know...  
Just like Nebbia says, we can't be sure until we try, can we...?  
  
**Rei：**  
W-well... I suppose this is only a medical procedure...  
Something like artificial respiration.  
If his life may depend on it,  
 then, well... um... I suppose...  
  
**Yui：**  
H-huh? Huhhhh?!  
Don't tell me Rei and Hiyori are both OK with trying this out?!  
Wh-what should I even say now?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  ...  
`Tag 1`  
**Nebbia：**  
Kiss time! ♪  
Kiss time! ♪  
C'mon, who's gonna go for it first?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
W-wait one moment, Miss Nebbia.  
...Can it be? My lord...?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Mnhh...?  
`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight!  
Thank goodness... You actually woke up! ♪  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, wow!  
Are you OK? How do you feel? Does it hurt?  
 Or are you hungry?  
  
**Rei：**  
Could it be that we woke you with all our commotion?  
Even if we did, it really is a relief.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  ...? Mm...?  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
I too am so very relieved, my lord.  
If you had remained in that state indefinitely,  
I don't know what I would have...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Isn't this great, Kokkoro?!  
I guess maybe Mr. Knight really was just super tired after all!  
  
**Rei：**  
In the month since we faced the Kaiser,  
I hear you've helped a lot with clearing the rubble from the city.  
Perhaps you do need some proper rest.  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight, you must be hungry, right?  
I'll make something easy-to-digest.  
What do you want to eat?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  ...Ahh...  
`Tag 4`  
**Nebbia：**  
Ueeeghh...!  
I'm covered in drool!  
Geez, what the heck was *that* for?!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  *giggle*  
`Tag 5`  
**Yui：**  
U-umm...  
The way he's acting...  
Doesn't it seem a bit like he's...  
  
**Rei：**  
Yes... It's as if he's returned  
to the state he was in just after his memories were lost...  
No, he may have reverted even further...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord...  
Can it be that some kind of shock  
has caused you to mentally regress?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
No waaay!  
Wh-what now?!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
For starters, keep him away from me!  
I do *not* want to end up stuffed into his mouth again!  
...Hm?  
  
**???：**  
...  
...  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh? It looks like the girl has woken up too...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Umm... Let's see.  
 What's your name?  
Me, I'm Hiyori!  
 It's great to meet you!  
  
**???：**  
...?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Hmm?  
 Does she not understand me?  
Your name, OK? Tell me, what's... your... name?  
  
**???：**  
Shehh... fooh...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Is she still disoriented from sleeping...?  
It seems she is struggling to speak.  
  
**Rei：**  
...No, I feel like there's something strange about her too...  
  
**???：**  
...Dahh?  
Auwahh...  
  
**Nebbia：**  
U-um, what now? Why are you staring at me like...  
...Aughh!  
  
**Yui：**  
Wahhh!  
The girl... She grabbed Nebbia in her hand...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
She's lifting her towards her mouth?!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Come on, you idiots! Stop gawping and save me!  
Save me alreadyyyyyy...! ...Ahh...  
  
**???：**  
*giggle* ♪  
  
**Choice: (6)**  *giggle* ♪  
`Tag 6`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ehm... For now, to summarize the situation...  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight and this girl... are both, um...  
  
**Rei：**  
Mentally, they seem... no older than infants.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Wha...  
  
**Rei：**  
...Wha...  
  
**Yui：**  
...Wha...  
  
**All：**  
What nooooow?!
