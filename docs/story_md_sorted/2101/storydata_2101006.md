**Narration：**  
Kokkoro, Karyl, Yui, Hiyori, Sheffy and {player}  
are strolling through the city plaza lined with festival stalls.  
  
**Yui：**  
Wow!  
This area already looks as good as new!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yeah!  
At a glance, you'd never think there'd been a battle here!

**Kokkoro：**  
Lately, due to the pressures of childcare,  
I have been unable to assist with the restoration...  
But the sight of the city decked out for festivities is heartening indeed.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Still, I must say, this is quite the bustling crowd.  
My lord, Miss Sheffy.  
Please take care not to let go of my hand.  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Mm!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Uh-huh!  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
Hee hee.  
Kokkoro, you're just like their mama.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Their \"mama\"?  
Do you think so...?  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Mama!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Mama!  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, Mama is here. Hee hee... It may not be ideal forever,  
but I do enjoy strolling through the town in a motherly role like this. ♪

**Hiyori：**  
Aw man, you guys make such a sweet family...  
Hm?  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Hee-o-ree! Hee-o-ree! ♪  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Eheheh! You gonna hold hands with me too?  
You're such a good girl, Sheffy!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Since you're so good, I'll give you a meat pie I bought at that stall!  
Blow on it before you eat, OK?  
 Like this—blow, blow~!  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Bwow, bwow...  
*munch*...  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Mmm, dewishus... ♪  
  
**Hiyori：**  
S...  
 so cuuuuute! ♪  
  
**Yui：**  
Here, Mr. Knight.  
I brought one for you too!  
  
**Yui：**  
Blow... blow...  
There, all ready! ♪  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Dewicious!  
`Tag 3`  
**Yui：**  
Heheh. That's good to hear.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Our little ones are becoming so skilled at speech already.  
Witnessing my lord and Miss Sheffy's growth like this  
fills me with an overwhelming pride... ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeesh. You sappy bunch... Well, whatever.  
...Hm?  
What's all the fuss at that stall over there?  
  
**Onlooker：**  
Whoaaa!  
Nobody else in this eating contest  
can down the pies half as fast as that girl!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh?  
The face at that table with the cheeks full of pie...  
It seems unmistakably familiar...  
  
**???：**  
Mmm, so good! These special meat pies from Elizabeth Park  
are so delicious it's crazy! ★ I could keep eating all day! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Guehh...  
 This dumb-sounding voice  
that's so sugary sweet it gives me indigestion...!

**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh! ♪  
Karyl! Kokkoro! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And there's Sheffy, and Yui, and Hiyori...  
Ooh, even {player}! ♪  
Heyas, guys! ☆  
  
**Yui：**  
Hi there, Pecorine!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I see you're chowing down like always!  
  
**Karyl：**  
H-hey, hold on a minute!  
Should you even be out and about in public?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whatever are you talking about, Karyl? ♪  
The Gourmet Guild is all about going out to find new flavors!  
That's why I'm here to taste them before anyone else!  
 Eheh! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Uh, I don't mean that!  
What about your... actual position?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha,  
 I know, I know, Karyl!  
That was just my little joke!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But right now, I happen to be on my lunch break! ♪  
Besides, with such tasty scents wafting from the plaza,  
how was I supposed to stay put in the palace?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh.  
You certainly seem as lively as ever, Miss Pecorine.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yep, you too, Kokkoro!  
I've got a bit of business with you guys, so my actual plan  
was to head over and find you all first...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But on the way, I thought I'd drop by for just a teensy bite at these stalls,  
and before I knew it, I couldn't stop!  
But you guys found me here in the end, so it's all good, huh?! ☆  
  

---  
  
`image display end`  
**Karyl：**  
Sheesh. Even when you're a princess, no one can stop that appetite!  
So, what's this \"business\" you've got?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, I was looking for a way to fix {player}  
and Sheffy's baby problem, and using my royal status,  
I found some magic items that might be able to help! ♪  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Wow... You're amazing, Peco!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh.  
 I mean, personally, I think our new baby {player}  
is super sweet too, in his own way...  
But I do want to be able to talk to him normally again! ♪  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh, yeah... I feel exactly the same way!  
He's so cute like this,  
 but I miss the old him too...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So to that end, I brought a bunch of artifacts!  
I dunno which will work,  
 so I thought we could just try them all!  
Let's see, we've got...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A potion to temporarily boost intelligence!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ooh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A magic ice pack that refreshes the mind as well as the body!  
  
**Yui：**  
Ahhh...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A crystal ball that taps into (probably) past memories!  
Those are the three I found!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Whoa...  
Wait, huh?  
Did you say \"probably\"? About that last one, I mean.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, you know, I haven't actually tried it out yet!  
Items like this are often only good for a few uses, so...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm... I must say, the palace vault certainly holds many treasures.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Actually, even I barely know half the stuff that's stashed in there.  
The items inside were collected by my family over generations,  
and it looks like the Kaiser left a few new ones, too.  
  
**Karyl：**  
And you think these mystery items are safe to just try out?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Umm, don't you think some of those could be super valuable?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes, they might.  
But you know, for the sake of rebuilding the city,  
we're planning to sell most of them off anyway...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Besides, if it's to save our {player}, I'd pay any price! ♪  
So c'mon, let's start with the potion! ♪  
Here, just down it all in one gulp!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  *glug glug*...  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
How do you feel, my lord?  
Have any new sensations taken hold of your body?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  ...?  
`Tag 5`  
**Yui：**  
Looks like... it's not doing much at all. Yet, at least.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm... Well, I guess we can wait and see.  
In the meantime, let's move on to this little crystal ball!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What a mysterious item.  
 It appears as clear as the finest crystal,  
but its surface is soft like fruit to the touch, and I feel a faint warmth.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Ahhhhh.  
`Tag 6`  
**Karyl：**  
H—hey!  
Don't put it in your mouth, dummy!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
She's right, {player}!  
Okay, I can't deny I was just thinking myself  
that it looks like a sweet lychee, but...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Huh?  
Hey guys, look!  
There's a super flashy carriage coming this way!  
  
**Yui：**  
It's so big, and covered in gold...  
{player}, Sheffy.  
You really shouldn't get in its way, so come over here.  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Mm!  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh? The carriage stopped?  
  
**Karyl：**  
*cough cough*  
Hey! Did you have to raise all this dust?!  
  
**???：**  
Well, well.  
My, my, what have we here?  
It's quite the surprise to run into you here, dear princess!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And you're... Creditta?!  
Well, I guess there's no need for surprise.  
It's your guild that's in charge of today's celebration, after all.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine.  
Might I inquire as to this woman's identity?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Umm,  
 Creditta here is the leader of a guild known as  
the Richmond Corporation.  
They've played a central role in the rebuilding project.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The city couldn't have recovered this quickly  
without all the diligent efforts of Creditta's guild!  
  
**Creditta：**  
My, my. Heeheehee.  
To think the princess herself would deign to personally introduce me.  
Now, isn't this an honor.  
  
**Creditta：**  
But alas, this won't do. This won't do at all, princess.  
The leader of our entire nation,  
 standing around in public, her mouth  
smeared with food? Together with  
 these lowly commoners, no less?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, hold on a minute!  
I don't like your attitude!  
What's the big idea?!  
  
**Creditta：**  
Now, now. I was merely stating the plain, objective truth.  
Whether she likes it or not,  
Her Majesty the Princess Eustiana represents this kingdom.  
  
**Creditta：**  
If the neighboring nations were to witness her in this state...  
Landosol's dignity would be called into question.  
Diplomacy, trade, cultural exchange... It could compromise them all!  
  
**Citizen 1：**  
Huh? A princess...?  
  
**Citizen 2：**  
Does she mean that girl?  
  
**Creditta：**  
Hmm, hmm. Just now, I received word from one of my men on security.  
Princess Eustiana... Is it true that you were offering these commoners  
the unrestricted use of a number of national treasures?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh...? Well, I suppose so...  
  
**Creditta：**  
The disgrace. Oh, the disgrace! A personage of your standing,  
making exceptions for individual citizens! Oh, it will not do!  
The ruling class must be fair and impartial!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Creditta of the Richmond Corporation...  
She certainly is a most opinionated individual...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'd call it just being a pompous jerk.  
Geez, she pisses me off!  
  
**Yui：**  
It might be a good idea to take Pecorine  
somewhere a bit more private for now.  
...Huh? Mr. Knight? Where did you go?  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Goo...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah... My lord is moving towards Miss Creditta...?  
  
**Creditta：**  
...Hmm?  
My, my.  
Now, who is this strange boy?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  *wipe wipe*  
`Tag 7`  
**Creditta：**  
Wait...  
 Excuse meeeee?!  
How dare you wipe your meat pie-caked hands  
all over my exquisite finery?!  
  
**Creditta：**  
I imported these furs from Erald Island specifically for this occasion!  
How much do you think these things cost?!  
  
**Creditta：**  
Oh, you've done it now...  
Mercenaries, I need you to teach this filthy brat a lesson!  
  
**Mercenary 1：**  
Heheh. Leave it to us!  
  
**Mercenary 2：**  
Yeah, get over here, brat!  
We'll play with ya!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It wasn't nice to mess up her clothes,  
but he's only a little kid! Let him off the hook, please!  
  
**Creditta：**  
Excuse me? A \"little kid,\" you say?  
At the very least, he looks a great deal larger than you,  
Little Miss Beastgirl!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whether he's big or little,  
nobody gets to bully {player} on my watch!  
After all, he's a precious friend of mine!  
  
**Creditta：**  
Princess... Oh, you foolish, foolish princess!  
Declaring this lowly and uncouth brat your \"friend,\"  
and giving him such special treatment!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I don't care what you say!  
You can make fun of me all you like... but I won't let you hurt him!  
  
**Creditta：**  
Nghhhh...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Mrgrgr...!  
  
**Creditta：**  
Now, see here!  
A princess you may be, but you shouldn't take me lightly!  
  
**Creditta：**  
Managing finances! Organizing construction!  
Preparing a workforce! Keeping them well-fed!  
Can you do any of this without my help?!  
  
**Creditta：**  
If I and the Richmond Corporation withdraw our services,  
it will be your citizens who suffer!  
You'd do well not to forget that fact, princess.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Is that not merely a case of each serving their own role?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Peco's got her own important work to do!  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Goo... Buehh!  
  
**Creditta：**  
Oh, please, do be quiet! As if ignorant children such as yourselves  
could understand the vicious world of merchantry  
and the strength it took for me to dominate it!  
  
**Creditta：**  
But perhaps you'll be able to appreciate this.  
 Behold!  
The proof of my success and symbol of my status... is right here!  
  
**Yui：**  
Wow, what a huge tower!  
  
But why's there a cloth draped over it?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I suppose this *is* a grand opening.  
She'll be planning to whip away the cloth for a dramatic reveal.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That's why she used her funds, organized this festival,  
and gathered all these people.  
Ugh, what a massive show-off.  
  
**Creditta：**  
Hahah! ♪  
Go ahead and call me what you wish.  
  
**Creditta：**  
Before you lies the proof of my success!  
A new landmark of this nation worth over a billion rupies!  
My new guildhouse... The grand Creditta Tower!  
  
**Creditta：**  
Now... let it be unveiled!  
Mercenaries,  
 pull down the cloth!  
  
**Mercenary 1：**  
Aye-aye, sir!  
  
**???：**  
...Fire.
