## Subtitle: A Chaotic Incursion
  
**Yui：**  
Wh-what just happened?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It looked like the whole building went kaboom!  
Is this part of the ceremony too?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Of course it's not!  
Who blows up their own new building?!  
That explosion looked like a magical attack!  
  
**Creditta：**  
N-no way!  
It can't... it can't... it can't beeeee!  
  
**Creditta：**  
My glorious Creditta Tower!  
My billion rupies of hard work and capital!  
Wh-who would do something so cruel... so barbaric...?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I must agree, from Miss Creditta's state of disarray,  
it seems unlikely that this was her intention.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If the explosion truly was an attack, then the culprit cannot be far away.  
My lord, Miss Sheffy, danger is near,  
so please try not to stray from my side.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  'Kay!  
`Tag 1`  
**Sheffy：**  
'Kay!

**Yui：**  
...!  
Another explosion...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
This time, it came from up on that roof! ...  
Ahh!

**Rei：**  
Haaaaahhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
...Rei?!  
That's Rei, fighting a monster on the roof!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, right.  
Rei's on duty working security in the city today!  
  
**Rei：**  
Everyone, look out!  
This isn't the only monster at large!  
  
`image display end`  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Karyl：**  
What are these things?!  
Where did they pop up from?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Umm... umm...!  
For now, should we help Rei fight them off?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Considering my lord and Miss Sheffy,  
I would prefer to retreat to a safe location if possible, but...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
Ahhh!  
There's one here too!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The people in the plaza are in danger!  
Let's help them!  
  
**Creditta：**  
Arghhh!  
Why are you just standing around?!  
Take action, mercenaries!  
  
**Mercenary 1：**  
Whaaa?! B-but...!  
Our contract didn't mention anything like this!  
  
**Creditta：**  
I'll pay you a fat bonus on top of your fees!  
So pulverize those monsters  
and pile them up where my beautiful tower once stood!  
  
**Mercenary 2：**  
A bonus?!  
Wahoo!  
Now we're talkin'!  
  
**Mercenary 1：**  
Move it, you punks!  
This bonus is mine for the taking...  
Gyearghhh!  
  
**Mercenary 2：**  
Gyeaaaarghhh!  
  
**Creditta：**  
Wha...?!  
Did they defeat you already?!  
Can't you try to show at least a *little* fortitude?!  
  
**Yui：**  
These monsters seem pretty strong...!  
  
**Rei：**  
Yes, they're certainly no pushovers!  
Don't let your guard down, Hiyori!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Right!  
I'm on it, Rei!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll help out too!  
Haaaahhh...  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Wait one moment, Majesty!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Uwehh?!  
Ch-Chairman?!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Princess Eustiana of Landosol! Permit your loyal Marquis Gorschin,  
Chairman of the Council of Nobles, to offer a word of counsel!  
I beg you sheathe your blade and return to the palace forthwith!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It would appear yet another rowdy fellow has arrived.  
A noble of some standing, no less.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ugh. Not him...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
B-but look, Mr. Gorschin!  
The whole plaza's being wrecked by monsters...!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
The ruler of our fine nation cannot stoop to doing battle with beasts!  
Were anything to befall Your Majesty, it would be a national tragedy!  
Please accompany us to the safety of the palace!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But... but... I can't...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Pecorine.  
Go and do what you have to do!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
K... Karyl?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
As this kingdom's Princess,  
you should be saving your citizens, not scuffling with monsters!  
Only you can do that right now!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
B-but...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hurry and get out of here!  
Or are you gonna prove that Her Majesty... Lady Mana...  
was right all along to call you a charging boar?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
U-urghh...!  
Aaahhhhhh...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...A... all right then...!  
I'll be back soon and bring plenty of help...  
So guys, you'd better hang in there for me!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Golden Hand, militia of the Council!  
Defend the Princess!  
We must not permit a single scratch to befall Her Majesty!  
  
**Soldiers：**  
Yes, sir!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...  
  
**Gorschin：**  
...Hmph.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Sheesh.  
That titled toady who used to suck up to Lady Mana  
sure has gone up in the world!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Eheh. Miss Karyl.  
As ever, you are most kind to Miss Pecorine.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Shut your face. It's not like that at all!  
I'm not trying to...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Uwaaghh?!  
  
**Yui：**  
...Spirits of light!  
  
**Yui：**  
Karyl! Are you OK?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh... y-yeah.  
...Thank you... very much...  
  
**Rei：**  
Gourmet Guild!  
If you plan to stay and fight, stay on your guard!  
These monsters are no joke...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Y-you're right!  
I've been hitting them with a bunch of attacks,  
but they've barely had any effect!  
  
**Yui：**  
Yeah... Attack magic, obstruction magic—they deflect it all...!  
All we can do is slow them down...!  
  
**Rei：**  
Also... what is this?  
The way the monsters move... It seems strange somehow.  
  
**Rei：**  
They're not just rampaging wildly.  
And yet I don't think they're being controlled.  
In the first place, where did they all appear from...?  
  
**Monster：**  
GGGRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Rei：**  
Ngh...!  
It's too strong...!  
  
**Yui：**  
Rei...!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Goo goo!  
`Tag 3`  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, please!  
How long've you gotta do the baby thing?!  
Use your Princess Knight power to help us out already!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
E-ehm... Miss Karyl.  
I am sure you are aware of this,  
but my lord did not enter this state of his own volition...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Of course I know!  
But if only he could do his usual thing,  
we might stand a better chance here!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Do you hear me?!  
Power us up! Power—us—up!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Pow! Wah! Up!  
`Tag 5`  
**Karyl：**  
Ah... It worked!  
It's not quite like normal, but this is his power!  
For now, it'll have to...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait, hold on!  
The only part of me you've powered up is my ears!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Alas, it is as I feared...  
  
**Rei：**  
This just means we can't afford to always rely  
on his power to save us!  
Let's prove we can fight with our own strength for once!  
  
**Yui：**  
Y-yeah!  
You're right, Rei!  
This time it's our turn to protect Mr. Knight!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
But... but... nothing seems to even hurt these monsters!  
How are we gonna beat them...?  
...  
Ahh?!  
  
**Boy：**  
...  
  
**Monster：**  
─GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Little boy!  
Look out!  
 Run for it...!
