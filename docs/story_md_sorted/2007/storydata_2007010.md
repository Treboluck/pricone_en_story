## Subtitle: The Hidden Laboratory
  
### Place: Ancient Castle
  
**Illya：**  
Well then, I shall activate the teleportation circle.  
  
**Miyako：**  
So excitey! Where're we going today?  
Miyako votes for the Dreamy Pudding Kingdom,  
where everybody eats only pudding!  
  
**Illya：**  
Let's stick to places that actually exist.  
Calm yourself a little, there's a good girl...  
  
**Illya：**  
Teleportation is a highly advanced form of magic.  
It requires the utmost care and concentration.  
  
**Illya：**  
The circle that we are about to use  
was not simple for me to activate even in my prime.  
  
**Illya：**  
If I misjudge the balance even a little,  
we may be stranded for eternity in the void between dimensions.  
  
**Yori：**  
Then just to be safe, shouldn't you return to your adult form?  
  
**Akari：**  
Ooh, yes.  
This is a very adult matter, after all!  
  
**Akari：**  
C'mon, {player}, throw your arms around Illya!  
Touch her tenderly!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Let's not get too excited, everyone.  
We wouldn't want to disturb Illya's concentration.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Speaking of which...  
Are you all intending to accompany us?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Considering our numbers...  
The magic circle is barely large enough to accommodate us all,  
resulting in some discomfort.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It is a bit of a squeeze...  
**Choice: (2)**  Shall I put my arms around you?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Exactly.  
Also, with all of us gathered so close together,  
our combined body heat is a little overwhelming.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh...? No, there is no need for that.  
Though space is tight, I do have room enough to stand by myself.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shinobu：**  
Haha... Neneka may not be thrilled  
to have such a large group suddenly visit.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
But we're the only ones who have already made her acquaintance,  
so we'll introduce you in person.  
If that's all right with you, of course.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Neneka is... more than a little wary of strangers,  
so if you were to visit alone, she'd probably hide...  
Or worse, mistake you for intruders and mount an attack.

**Illya：**  
Is there really no way for me to achieve this form  
besides getting touchy-feely with you...?  
I find myself becoming awkwardly flustered each time...

**Akari：**  
No faaair!  
 Why couldn't I have a character quirk  
like not being able to breathe unless I hug {player}?  
  
**Yori：**  
\"Character quirk\"...?  
You should really be a bit more careful with the opposite sex...  
  
**Akari：**  
You're such a wallflower, sis!  
{player} is the most oblivious guy, so you'll need  
to be more daring if you want to win his affections!  
  
**Yori：**  
Wh-wh-wh-why would I want that?!  
...Ah! Look! The magic circle's glowing!  
  

---  
  
**Illya：**  
Indeed. The spell is ready.  
Our destination... is Neneka's hidden laboratory, yes?  
  
**Illya：**  
The laboratory itself is defended by  
all manner of magical protections...  
  
**Illya：**  
We cannot teleport there directly,  
so we will have to make do with a location nearby.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Sounds good to me!  
Hey, isn't this all super exciting?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Let us keep our wits about us.  
We are about to come face to face with  
one of the mysterious \"Seven Crowns,\" after all.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord...  
Please try not to stray too far from my side.

**Illya：**  
What a chaotic bunch you are...  
  
`image display end`  
**Illya：**  
Miyako, are you all right?  
You are a ghost, after all, and thus more susceptible to magic.  
  
**Illya：**  
Unlike the living with bodies of flesh,  
you are fully exposed to magical energies.  
Was your spirit form unharmed by the teleportation process?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Oh, I'm OK!  
Miyako's a strong girl!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Eheheh...  
I eated up lots of puddings just now,  
so I'm full of happy power!  
  
**Miyako：**  
What about you? You're all little and tiny again.  
You can't fight beasties like that, so Miyako'll protect you!  
  
**Illya：**  
Ahhh...  
That teleportation spell consumed most of my magical energy...  
I feel drained through to the core.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Hmm...  
For the moment, it seems we all arrived safely, at least.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yep, looks like we pulled through!  
Nice going, everyone! That's a relief!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So, um...  
Is this the lab where this Neneka person does her research?  
  
**Illya：**  
To be precise, these are the underground ruins nearby.  
One must follow a specific path from this point  
to reach Neneka's laboratory itself.  
  
**Illya：**  
Her laboratory is likewise located below ground.  
Above lies an impenetrable mountain range, so few find their way here.  
Particularly with all the monsters that call this place home.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Sounds like some pretty impressive security!  
But why would Neneka want to live so far from civilization,  
and then go so far as to hide herself below ground?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Could it be she violated some kind of terrible taboo,  
so she's continuing her research in secret  
where the authorities will never find her?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
It's quite possible.  
I'm afraid I don't know the details.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
In our guild, we all have things we'd prefer to hide as well.  
So we have an unspoken agreement not to ask too many questions.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm... So you're like an underworld community!  
It's quite an honor to be allowed into your shadowy society, then!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We'd never have found this place on our own!
