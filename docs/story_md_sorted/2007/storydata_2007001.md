### Place: Elven Forest
  
**Shiori：**  
This way, {player}.  
And, um, Kokkoro.  
  
**Shiori：**  
The ground isn't that stable around here,  
so try to watch your step. It's easy to trip and fall.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank you for the warning.  
Personally, I am accustomed to traversing forest land,  
so I think I should be all right.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But my lord, you should certainly take care.  
Perhaps it would be best if I were to hold your hand?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Thanks, Kokkoro.  
**Choice: (2)**  No, I'll be fine.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please, no need to thank me.  
Protecting you at all times, from morning until night,  
is my duty and honor as your loyal attendant, my lord.

`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm.  
Somehow when you say that, it only makes me worry more.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Look, there are tree roots sticking out of the round, so do be careful.  
Ahhhh, I cannot bear to watch... Could we please hold hands after all?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh.  
Here, grip my hand nice and tightly!  
  
**Shiori：**  
You two seem like such close companions.  
It makes me a little jealous... You're like family.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So we are frequently told.  
I am but a humble attendant, yet my lord is often asked,  
\"Is this your sister?\" or even, \"Is she your daughter?\"  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It has reached the point where I even find myself  
almost calling my lord \"Big Brother\" or \"Papa\" from time to time...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If I did not catch myself, I fear I would die of embarrassment.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I don't think that's anything to be ashamed of.  
You're still so little, after all...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, but look.  
The elf village is just up ahead!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh...!  
As expected, this looks quite different from my home village.  
So it is true that each elven tribe has its own distinct culture...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, is that right?  
What's it like, then? The village where you grew up?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmmm... It is difficult to explain,  
but it has more of an air of straightforward practicality.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Though it is well-maintained, it is lacking in personality...  
Overall, I would say it gives a much colder impression.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Perhaps that is only natural, given its northerly location.  
It is literally quite frigid.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Whereas in this Elven Forest,  
I can feel the warmth of nature all around...  
It is most pleasant. The whole forest is full of life.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What is more, as far as I can see,  
there are no signs of damage from that magical attack.  
I believe the center of the blast was nearby, so I expected worse...  
  
**Shiori：**  
You're right...  
Perhaps there was no need for us to come all this way after all.  
The plan was to send support if necessary, but let's investigate first.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed.  
Thank you again for agreeing to be our guide,Miss Shiori.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Heheh... I actually have a sister who lives here in this village.  
Since it's not too far, I come here quite often.  
I'm used to the route.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I also go into the forest a lot  
to guard Elizabeth Park, or to hunt for food.  
So I know this place better than the back of my hand!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Guiding you through the forest is the least I can do  
to thank you for all your help back at the farm.  
Besides, I was worried too. About my sister, you know.  
  
**Shiori：**  
And with the currents still disturbed from the effects of the attack,  
I couldn't reach her with communication magic...  
So I had to come out here myself, either way.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Hmm?  
Hold on a moment.I think I see somethingquite unusual...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Please stand back, both of you.  
I don't know if it's due to the disturbed currents,  
but there have been sightings of strange monsters around here recently.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I heard they have a very unnatural appearance,  
as if multiple monsters have been fused together.  
I can't let either of you get hurt, so I'll handle them with my bow.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, no... I don't think this is actually a monster.  
Ehm, how do I describe it?  
It looks almost as though someone is floating through the air...

**Hatsune：**  
Bwahhh?!  
Wowwwww, that was a shock!  
I thought I was a goner!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wait, huh? {player}! It's you!  
I guess you caught me mid-fall, huh? Thanks so much! ☆

**Kokkoro：**  
So this young lady is Miss Shiori's sister.  
And as expected, you are acquainted with her too, my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
No matter where we travel,  
somehow you always manage to run into a lady friend...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ummm...  
So we've got {player}, and Shiorin, and a girl I don't know!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
What kind of gathering is this?  
Umm...  
Do you all have some kind of business at our village?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I'm not sure I really get it, but you're more than welcome!  
Though I'm afraid most of the villagers  
are out investigating that big explosion thingy at the moment.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
We couldn't just leave the whole village empty,  
so I stayed behind to keep watch!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Actually, that's right! Shiorin! Are you okay?!  
That explosion was right nearby, and the monsters were going crazy!  
We even saw smoke coming from the farm! It looked really bad!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
In fact, I was so worried about you,  
I convinced the rest of the guild to join me  
and went charging through the monsters to the farm myself!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
But when we got there, it was empty...  
I really thought I might have lost you!  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm sorry, Hatsune...  
I'm okay, though.  
  
**Shiori：**  
You must have just missed us.  
We evacuated for a bit and camped near Landosol.  
  
**Shiori：**  
We're all back at the farm now,  
working hard to get it back in shape.  
Don't worry, nobody was hurt too badly!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
R-right...!  
Yeah, I did hear afterward that you'd evacuated somewhere.  
But I couldn't get in contact, so I didn't know what to think!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Shioriiiiin!  
I'm so glad you're okay!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ahaha...  
I'm sorry I made you worry, Hatsune.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I really am all right.  
And I'm relieved, too, to see you're not hurt either.
