### Place: Sarendia Orphanage
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh...  
Please try to hold still, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmhmhmm~♪  
Hee hee... There, all nice and dressed up.  
Now we are ready to leave at any time.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm all ready too!  
But hang on, Kokkoro... Do you do this every morning?  
Putting on his clothes for him like that?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Is there a problem with my doing so?  
As my lord's humble attendant,  
it is my pride to attend to his every need.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, I suppose it's not a problem exactly...  
But if you don't let him do anything for himself,  
he might grow up into a lazy bum, you know?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You tend to treat him like a baby.  
Or maybe like royalty, even.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh.  
Hey, what would you think  
if I called you \"Your Highness\"?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sounds good!  
**Choice: (2)**  Just my name is fine.  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? You really wouldn't mind?!  
Yaaaay! Thank you, Your Highness!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Hmm?  
It actually feels pretty weird, so you'd rather I didn't?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? Is that a no, then?  
Awww... Since you guys gave me such a cool nickname,  
I've been kind of wanting to call you all by nicknames too.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Actually...  
Miss Pecorine, are you not a real princess yourself?  
Did you not have servants of your own for this kind of thing?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, well... My family wasn't really into that kind of stuff.  
Sure, I was pampered like crazy when I was really little,  
but I quickly got sick of being waited on hand and foot.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"That man,\" though... That fake \"Eustiana\" seems to be  
living it up, milking the role for all it's worth.  
Hmph. It takes more than arrogance to be royalty, you know!  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, my.  
Are you all heading out somewhere?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh—yes!  
We're going to look for that mysterious fortune-teller!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Apparently our resident ladies' man already knows her,  
so it shouldn't be too hard to get in touch.  
  
**Saren：**  
{player}, how *do* you make all these acquaintances?  
  
**Saren：**  
Well, if you learn anything, do let me know.  
We're all sleeping under the same roof, so let's work together!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But of course.  
By the by, Miss Saren, are you heading somewhere yourself?  
  
**Saren：**  
Sure am.  
I have yet another meeting to attend  
with Caon and Nightmare.  
  
**Saren：**  
It's really starting to get tiring...  
I'm sure the kids won't be too happy  
that I'm coming home late again...  
  
**Saren：**  
But after that magical explosion, and the farm rebuilding...  
There's still so much for us to discuss.  
Honestly, it's like a full-time job, but without the pay!  
  
**Saren：**  
In the process of sorting out one issue,  
we always seem to run into two or three new ones!  
  
**Saren：**  
You'll never guess what happened this time.  
It looks like that Christina has broken out of prison!  
  
**Saren：**  
Nightmare is in a real state right now  
trying to deal with the mess *that's* caused.  
  
**Saren：**  
Apparently they'd thrown her in an impenetrable dungeon,  
yet somehow she vanished without a trace!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Urk...! Christina's at large again, is she?  
I was actually kind of relieved when I heard she was arrested...  
  
**Saren：**  
You're not the only one.  
Honestly, though! It's just one thing after another lately!  
  
**Saren：**  
But oh well.  
We'll just have to sort them out one by one,  
if that's what it takes to give the children a peaceful future.  
  
**Saren：**  
That's worth a little discomfort, isn't it?  
If I learn anything new, I'll let you guys know as well.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, that would be great!  
Hang on, though. I kind of ended up  
staying here at the Orphanage by default, but...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Are you sure that's okay?  
Though I know it's a little late to ask...  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, I don't mind. We have plenty of rooms to spare.  
Though ideally, it would be nice if you could pay a little rent.  
  
**Saren：**  
But you and {player} and Kokkoro  
all seem to be at the center of something pretty big, right?  
So there might be value in keeping you around.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm not just doing this out of the goodness of my heart,  
so no need to feel like you owe me one!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You don't mince words, do you?  
I like that!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmmm...  
But I'm still a little worried  
that having me around might bring trouble to the Orphanage.  
  
**Saren：**  
We've already been mixed up in plenty of trouble.  
But the guards my father sent are doing a good job,  
so I think we should be able to protect ourselves.  
  
**Saren：**  
And I figured we needed a way to evacuate the kids on short notice  
in case of an emergency...  
  
**Saren：**  
So even though it's not strictly allowed,  
I put a word in with my father,  
and he managed to get us a warp gate set up.  
  
**Saren：**  
We're ready for just about anything.  
Not that that means we should get complacent,  
but I'm always doing my best to ensure the children's safety.  
  
**Saren：**  
That's what the Sarendia Orphanage is all about!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A \"warp gate\"...  
What exactly is that again?  
I feel like I've heard the phrase somewhere...  
  
**Saren：**  
It's a form of magic that can join two distant locations,  
allowing instantaneous travel between them.  
  
**Saren：**  
The gate we've set up here can only be used a few times,  
but it's enough to get all the children to safety.  
  
**Saren：**  
Right now, usage of warp gates is forbidden by the Palace.  
If anyone found out we have one on our property,  
we'd be in serious trouble...  
  
**Saren：**  
So I'd appreciate it if you could keep this between us.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Gotcha!  
...By the way, can you choose exactly where  
this warp gate connects to?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If we make good use of it,  
we might even be able to leap straight to the palace,  
and take out Eustiana in no time flat!  
  
**Saren：**  
Hmmm.  
I'm afraid that would be difficult.  
A given warp spell can only link two specific locations.  
  
**Saren：**  
The palace is well-protected against magical attacks,  
so I don't think anyone would be able to warp inside.  
  
**Saren：**  
And it's an advanced form of magic, anyway.  
You could probably count the people who can use it  
on the fingers of a single hand.  
  
**Saren：**  
Believe me, it wasn't an easy task to get one set up here.  
  
**Saren：**  
And my father always demands payment, even from family...  
He was kind enough to not charge me any interest,  
but I've got a hefty little debt to pay off now.  
  
**Saren：**  
Honestly...  
We have enough money troubles as it is!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahahah.  
When I reclaim my place on the throne,  
I'll see if I can't get you some financial support!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So I'd better hurry up  
and take back what's mine sooner rather than later.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Here's to our imminent victory!  
Hip, hip, hooray! ☆
