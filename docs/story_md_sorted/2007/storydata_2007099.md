## Subtitle: Interlude 8
  
**Ameth：**  
...Oh?  
Hello there, {player}.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I wasn't expecting you to appear before I even summoned you here.  
It looks like you fell asleep from sheer exhaustion.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I suppose you went through quite the ordeal this time...  
Before you lost your memories, you used to explore dungeons without  
a care, but doing the same thing in the real world is a different story.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Struggling across uneven ground through dirt and rocks,  
fighting with monsters, navigating a maze of tunnels...  
And then having to turn and flee an exploding laboratory.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Not the kind of day you'd wish on a friend.  
  
**Ameth：**  
At any rate, you used up all your energy,  
and now you're asleep and dreaming.  
  
**Ameth：**  
While you're snoozing out there,  
it looks like that Rajraj fellow is carrying you along.  
  
**Ameth：**  
By the way, you're now on your way  
to the hideout of that secret society, Labyrinth.  
There's much for you to learn there.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Their guild's devoted to investigating the world's mysteries,  
though I'm not sure how much they've actually uncovered.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But meeting with them and sharing information  
will surely be a valuable experience for you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
However, you should hurry.  
This isn't some comic book for children.  
Our enemy isn't going to just wait around for us forever.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She'll use everything at her disposal to crush you once and for all.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm afraid that means there's probably  
a rather sad scenario in your near future...  
  
**Ameth：**  
But don't give up.  
Try to at least stay strong, okay?  
If you lose heart, that really will be the end.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Just do your best.  
I can't do anything but cheer you on,  
but remember, I'm always on your side.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And what's more, I'm not the only ally you've got.  
  
**Ameth：**  
There's the people who helped you out today—  
Shinobu and the rest of Diabolos—plus a whole lot more  
who will be there for you when you need them.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The bonds you've formed with others will be your salvation.  
Those connections are your greatest weapon.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So try not to forget that you're never alone in this world.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Of course, not everyone you meet will be so pure of heart  
as to gladly do whatever you ask of them.  
Everyone is just trying to live their own lives, after all.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Particularly the Seven Crowns and those surrounding them.  
It's likely their interests won't align with your own.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So to be totally honest, I was pretty concerned  
when I saw you heading off to meet Neneka.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The Seven Crowns are all key players—the heroes of their own stories.  
Each of them is in a similar position to your own.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's exactly why, in the previous life that you've currently forgotten,  
you found yourself embroiled in a fierce conflict with them.  
  
**Ameth：**  
However, nothing's stopping you from forging bonds with former  
enemies. In fact, just like in your past life, doing so is exactly how  
you can become this world's hero and savior.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's because of that nature of yours that Eustiana,  
who seeks to become a lonely ruler—  
or rather, a god—  
won't be able to defeat you in the end.  
  
**Ameth：**  
This world has been reshaped and reformed  
by earnest prayers twisted out of shape...  
  
**Ameth：**  
But I believe that the pure feelings you retain,  
your still-untwisted heart, will be able to overcome it all.
