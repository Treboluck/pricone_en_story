### Place: Prano Plains
  
**Masaki：**  
Ahhh, my gratitude knows no bounds! Thank you kindly!  
Today of all days, I thought my life may truly be forfeit!  
  
**Masaki：**  
I swear to repay this debt someday!  
But right now, I have more pressing matters to attend to!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hold it, hold it. Where d'you think you're going?  
Your injuries are worse than they look.  
You need to get some rest and treatment.  
  
**Muimi：**  
We've got a medical facility you can use  
at the Labyrinth base where I'm staying.  
  
**Masaki：**  
Kind though your offer is, I cannot waste another second!  
My mistress Neneka has been kidnapped!  
Rescuing her must take priority above all else!  
  
**Masaki：**  
As her knight, that is my sworn duty and obligation!  
Nay, my destiny!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Then you better hurry up and get treatment,  
or you won't make it twenty steps before you collapse!  
Settle down a minute, would you?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ehm...  
  
**Masaki：**  
Hmm?  
I see a number of unfamiliar faces.  
 Who might you be?  
  
**Masaki：**  
No, as a gentleman, I should offer my name first!  
I am known as Masaki!  
  
**Masaki：**  
A noble and devoted knight in service  
to the esteemed Mistress Neneka of the Seven Crowns! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Th-this fellow is certainly full of energy.  
In some ways, he reminds me a little of Miss Pecorine.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? I'm not that much of a clown, am I?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Everyone, quiet down a moment.  
Yes... We just detected an explosion.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Just as, ehm... Your name was Muimi, yes?  
Just as Muimi said, the underground ruins  
seem to have collapsed entirely.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
If we'd stayed any longer, we would have been in terrible danger.  
It's a good thing we managed to escape when we did.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I gotta say, talk about bad timing.  
What were you doing down there anyway?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Well, due to certain circumstances,  
{player} and his companions were hoping  
to get in touch with Neneka.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Our guild has had dealings with Neneka in the past,  
so we were planning to introduce them.  
  
**Masaki：**  
Hahah!  
You girls always have been an entertaining bunch!  
Very good, very good! ☆  
  
**Illya：**  
I could say the same of you.  
But what madness transpired down there?  
I heard Neneka was kidnapped...  
  
**Illya：**  
But that young lady operates on a higher level.  
I cannot imagine her being taken captive so easily.  
  
**Masaki：**  
But of course.  
Mistress Neneka hardly ever leaves her fortress of a laboratory,  
and she possesses great power in her own right.  
  
**Masaki：**  
And naturally, I was there to defend her.  
However, when faced with hundreds and thousands of soldiers,  
even we were powerless to resist.  
  
**Masaki：**  
Mistress Neneka has the power of transformation.  
It is possible that she slipped away from her captors  
and is concealing herself in a different form.  
  
**Masaki：**  
But there was an attack spell that caught her unawares.  
She seemed grievously injured...  
I fear for her safety.  
  
**Masaki：**  
Ahh, but my noble Mistress Neneka!  
Even in that moment of crisis, she put my needs above her own!  
  
**Masaki：**  
Berating me as a liability because I am not capable  
of transforming myself to evade our attackers' pursuit...  
  
**Masaki：**  
She drew our pursuers' attention to herself,  
while shouting at me to \"get lost\" in the coldest of icy tones.  
  
**Masaki：**  
But I saw the truth!  
This was Mistress Neneka's way of showing her kindness!  
  
**Masaki：**  
Even at the cost of her own life, she strove to deliver me to safety!  
The goodness in her heart shone through!  
  
**Masaki：**  
So I hid myself in the shadow of the overheating reactor,  
and as the flames seared my skin, I swore a solemn oath!  
  
**Masaki：**  
No matter what perils may befall me,  
I would rescue Mistress Neneka from her nefarious captors!  
  
**Masaki：**  
And that, you see, is why I cannot waste a moment  
in these empty fields!  
  
**Masaki：**  
You saved my life, and for that I will show my eternal gratitude.  
But at this moment, I must depart!  
  
**Masaki：**  
It was an army of royal soldiers that captured Mistress Neneka.  
So I mean to storm the palace and recover her by force!  
Ah, I feel just like a knight on a quest to rescue his princess!  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Calm yourself, please.  
Reckless action will only lead you to an early death.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
A few days ago, I infiltrated the palace myself,  
and they have increased their security in response.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Try to invade the palace now, and you will be captured in seconds.  
Worst case, you may be executed on the spot.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Hardly the most reasonable course of action.  
You should consider your options more carefully.  
  
**Masaki：**  
Hmm...  
And who might you be? You have a most unusual aura.  
Strangely reminiscent of my mistress herself.  
  
**Muimi：**  
That's Rajraj.  
He's the one who saved you with his Spatial Leap,  
so let's see some gratitude.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Rajraj's Spatial Leap can't transport too many people,  
so it's just me and him here right now...  
  
**Muimi：**  
But Christina and Daigo are also nearby,  
along with Labyrista... or rather, \"Akira.\"  
Any of those names ring a bell for you, Masaki?  
  
**Masaki：**  
Hm? My apologies.  
I usually have a talent for recalling names and faces, but...  
  
**Masaki：**  
To be frank, I do not even recall meeting you before,  
my dear, charming young lady.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I see...  
So you've forgotten everything too, huh.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I was hoping that the meticulous strategist Neneka might have  
anticipated the world's reconstruction and taken measures against it...  
So that she of all people might still remember something...  
  
**Muimi：**  
But since she's not here, who can say for sure?  
Ugh... Our enemy's always two steps ahead.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Well, whatever.  
For the moment, no point standing around chatting out here.  
  
**Muimi：**  
We've got a Labyrinth hideout not too far from here,  
so let's head there to regroup.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Masaki, that includes you.  
...{player}, what about you guys?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm...  
After what just happened, we find ourselves unsure where to turn...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
There is much that we still need to clarify,  
so we would like to join you if it is not too much trouble.  
You may be able to answer some of our questions.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm with Kokkoro on that.  
**Choice: (2)**  What I need right now is some rest...  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Excellent.  
Eheh. Somehow it feels as though  
you never question my judgment.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I would not mind if you asserted yourself a little more on occasion.  
My greatest wish is to fulfill your own wishes, my lord.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh.  
Yes, we have had quite a tiring day.  
A soft and inviting bed would be most welcome indeed.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If there is a safe location where we can recuperate  
and ask a few questions in the process, that would be ideal.  
What do you say, Miss Muimi?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Muimi：**  
Okay! I've been hoping for a chance  
to talk things over properly with you guys, too.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Well then, follow me.  
It's right this way!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hahah. Let's see if together we can bust our way out  
of this great, big mess of a situation!
