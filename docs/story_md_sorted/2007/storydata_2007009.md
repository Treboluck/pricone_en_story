With their immediate problems taken care of, Saren and the Caon members breathe a sigh of relief. But when Octo shows up to announce that he is the new vice-captain of Nightmare, tensions quickly flare back up.
  
## Subtitle: A Troubled Meeting
  
### Place: Caon Guildhouse
  
**Maho：**  
Oh, Saren! Lunch is ready!  
Go ahead an' eat as much as you like!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ahaha!  
It's my turn to cook today!  
This recipe's from my homeland.  
 I hope it suits your fancy!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I'm not a fan of this bitter stuff...  
Kasumi, can you eat it for me?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
To think you can't appreciate this gourmet flavor...  
You can be such a child.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
*munch munch...* This is quite the delicacy.  
It might be pretty popular if you sold it at your family's bar.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oh, if you ever want the recipe, just ask!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hmmm...  
I'm not much for bitter or spicy foods. Sweet snacks are more my style.  
  
**Saren：**  
It's always so lively here at the Caon guildhouse, isn't it?  
Makes me happy to see you're all doing well.  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh, yes!  
Our lot ain't the type to dwell on past troubles for too long.  
  
**Maho：**  
Even if the marks of that Nightmare attack  
are still lyin' around here and there...  
  
**Maho：**  
Nobody got all scared an' decided to quit or anything.  
And as you can see, we've fixed up the guildhouse pretty good.  
  
**Maho：**  
For the moment, that's the end o' that.  
Back to our old peaceful life.  
  
**Makoto：**  
You keep saying that, Princess,  
but I'm still not happy about letting this slide.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ugh, those Nightmare jerks,  
treading dirt all over our home...  
  
**Makoto：**  
I heard Christina herself somehow went missing from prison, too...  
Something doesn't sit right with me about all this.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Without somewhere to direct this anger,  
it feels like I'm gonna explode from the stress.  
  
**Maho：**  
I get that, sure... But we can't just go around  
pickin' fights with folk like Nightmare.  
  
**Maho：**  
It took a lot o' negotiation to settle this whole conflict  
without any violence. You gotta settle yourself down  
an' swallow your pride a li'l for me.  
  
**Maho：**  
The last thing we want is for anyone else to get hurt on our account.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I know, I know.  
Don't worry, Princess, I'm not gonna go berserk or anything.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Actually, you should show some remorse, Makoto.  
You were the original trigger, you know.  
If you hadn't acted carelessly, none of this would have happened.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You couldn't be expected to foresee the whole conspiracy,  
but you could try to think a little before you act.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ah, shaddup.  
My specialty's fighting, not thinking.  
  
**Saren：**  
Um, sorry to suddenly change the subject, but...  
I was wondering why our guildmaster meeting  
is being held at the Caon guildhouse this time.  
  
**Saren：**  
I went to the guildhouse we normally use,  
but they told me to come here, so I wasn't sure what to think.  
Not that I don't appreciate the generous offer of a free meal...  
  
**Maho：**  
Heheh. Thing is, it sounds like Nightmare couldn't make it today.  
You know how busy things've been for them lately.  
  
**Maho：**  
So since it's just gonna be the two of us,  
not much point havin' a full meeting, right?  
At first I thought I might call the whole thing off...  
  
**Maho：**  
But y'know, since you already made the trip all the way here...  
I figured I'd at least invite you over for dinner.  
  
**Maho：**  
An' there's topics aside from Christina's attack on Caon  
that we can talk over on our own.  
  
**Maho：**  
So I figured we could have a nice, cozy chat over lunch.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh,  
 you mean like the whole Shadow business.  
How's all that going?  
  
**Saren：**  
You asked Kasumi to investigate, didn't you?  
Has she had any luck?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ah... I hate to sound like a hopeless detective,  
but I've hardly been able to uncover anything so far.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The only thing is, ever since that spell of mass destruction  
was unleashed a few days ago,  
we've hardly had any Shadow sightings at all.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Up until then, there were at least a few every day.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But lately, it seems they haven't been appearing anywhere.  
Nobody knows why. It's all rather perplexing.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh...?  
If they've suddenly gone extinct  
and never show up again, that would be good news.  
  
**Saren：**  
But it's a little unsettling not to know the reason.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The timing matches perfectly, so I'm fairly sure  
it has something to do with that terrible spell.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But I can't say anything beyond that.  
Sorry I couldn't be of more help.  
  
**Saren：**  
That's all right.  
I'm sure you gathered all the information you could, Kasumi.  
  
**Saren：**  
The children are still scared, so I'd like to clear up  
what the Shadows actually are as soon as we can, if possible...  
  
**Saren：**  
But looking back now, we were lucky that the mass-destruction spell  
didn't cause more damage in the end.  
  
**Saren：**  
The farm's recovery is going well,  
and the magical disturbances have started to settle down, too.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Indeed. People are already moving on  
from the initial panic and confusion  
caused by the interference with communication magic.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
For the moment, it feels as if a semblance of peace has returned.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But we can't let our guard down.  
The terror of darkness, the seeds of conflict—  
they're always lurking just below the surface.  
  
**???：**  
Yes, indeed. Peace is but a fleeting illusion...  
A brief respite between the flames of one war and the next.  
  
**Makoto：**  
...?!  
 Why, you...  
You've got some serious nerve showing your face here!  
  
**Octo：**  
Really? What's so wrong with my face?  
Sorry, though, Makoto. I hear you had a pretty tough time.  
  
**Octo：**  
A small word in my defense—I'm a victim too, you know?  
Christina just used me as a handy pawn.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Don't move a muscle!  
You dirty rat, I'll slaughter you!  
  
**Makoto：**  
This whole dang mess is your fault!  
Do you realize just how much trouble you've caused for everyone?!  
  
**Octo：**  
Whoa, doggie, calm down a little, would you?  
You're much cuter when you smile, you know?  
  
**Octo：**  
By the way...  
I'm actually a member of Nightmare these days.  
  
**Octo：**  
I'm technically from a noble family, after all.  
So I'm entitled to take up a position in the palace.  
  
**Octo：**  
To be more specific, I'm filling in for Christina,  
who was imprisoned and then went missing...  
  
**Octo：**  
Which makes me  
the new vice-captain of the Nightmare guild.  
  
**Octo：**  
If you draw your blade against me,  
you're basically picking a fight with the throne.  
So let's try not to do anything hasty, shall we?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Nghh...?!  
That dummy Octo... is the vice-captain of Nightmare?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Wh-why, you...!  
What the hell're you plotting this time?!  
  
**Octo：**  
I'd never plot anything!  
All I want is to recover my stolen treasure.  
  
**Octo：**  
I'll take advantage of monarchs or even gods  
to reclaim that which is mine.  
  
**Octo：**  
By the way, right now...  
I'm here as the representative of our noble captain,  
who's too busy to join you today.  
  
**Octo：**  
Honestly, though...  
Could you not suddenly change the meeting place?  
I had to search all over town.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmmm...  
The captain o' Nightmare, Jun herself,  
is an upstandin' sort, I know...  
  
**Maho：**  
But I don't think I can trust you so easy.  
Not after the way you took advantage of our Makoto.  
  
**Octo：**  
That's her fault for falling for it!  
...Or so I'd say if she wasn't eyeing my throat.  
  
**Octo：**  
Listen, I'm in a tricky position myself.  
A little less open hostility would be nice right now...  
  
**Octo：**  
For starters...  
Would you mind if I joined you for lunch?  
  
**Octo：**  
Come on, try to be friendly!  
At the very least, I don't plan on making enemies of you right now.
