## Subtitle: An Unlikely Pair of Twins
  
### Place: Landosol Plaza
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh! ☆  
This plaza is as full of life as ever!  
Bustling scenes like this get me all excited!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh.  
And since it's almost lunchtime,  
there are tasty scents wafting from restaurants all around!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh, now I'm feeling hungry!  
Hey, guys, why don't we go have a bite to eat?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We did just have a meal at the Orphanage, Miss Pecorine...  
I have been wondering this for a while,  
but is there a sizable leak somewhere in your stomach?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, well, haha...  
You never know what might happen,  
so it's better to be nice and full, right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I think I've mentioned this before,  
but the Royal Equipment I wear  
consumes a lot of calories when I use it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And if I take it off, I lose almost all of my strength.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I suppose you *were* originally a princess...  
This \"Royal Equipment\" must be the reason why you are able  
to fight on the front lines regardless.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I happen to be well trained in battle techniques myself.  
Short of a truly dire crisis, you can count on me for protection.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheh.  
Thanks, though I'd rather not rely on a little kid  
to protect me if I can help it...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh!  
There are stalls selling food, too!  
Do you think I could grab a few snacks?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Do as you wish.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Speaking of street food... Miss Karyl was quite fond of it, as I recall.  
We have not heard from her in quite some time...  
I hope that she is doing well...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
From what you told us, my lord,  
it seemed like she had a close relationship  
with the woman known as Eustiana.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am concerned for her safety.  
I can only pray that she has not come to any serious harm...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We don't have any way of getting in touch with her, either...  
If only she hadn't been so stubborn about giving out contact details...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Since she seems to work at the palace,  
I tried asking Saren if she could track her down...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But apparently she's listed as \"out on a mission\" right now.  
And who knows whether that's true or not... It worries me.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It feels like Karyl is caught up in something big, just like us.  
I just hope someday we can all share a meal together again...

**Yori：**  
Ahh... Aaahhhh...  
 D-did you get them? Are all the monsters gone?  
  
**Akari：**  
Yep!  
They were really weak little things.  
So weak, it's hard to imagine how they got into the city.  
  
`image display end`  
**Yori：**  
Hmmm... I did hear that Nightmare  
hasn't been doing its job very well lately.  
So maybe the city defenses aren't being properly maintained.  
  
**Yori：**  
We managed to take care of them this time,  
but what if really strong monsters had gotten inside?  
  
**Yori：**  
Sheesh...  
Everything seems so unstable lately.  
It's such a pain.  
  
**Akari：**  
Mmm, you're right...  
And when attacks like this happen, it can hurt our reputation too,  
since some people consider demonfolk a type of monster.  
  
**Akari：**  
I mean, those theories are old hat nowadays, but still!  
  
**Yori：**  
Yeah...  
Well, for now, let's get this sticky mess off the street!  
  
**Yori：**  
I'll just get in touch with the cleaning guild... There!  
And we can charge the bill to the local government, right?  
  
**Akari：**  
Ahahah!  
Look at all this lovely clothing-melting slime...  
I think I'll bottle some up as a souvenir!  
  
**Yori：**  
Wh-what are you planning to use that for?!  
Just blast it all into oblivion already!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmmm...  
What was all that commotion about?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm, I see.  
It looks like some monsters managed to get inside the city.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Thankfully they were only weak little things,  
so I guess those two girls took care of them.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wow, their faces look almost identical!  
Do you think they're twins or something?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That's Yori and Akari.  
**Choice: (2)**  Yep, they're twins.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh?  
I suppose this can only mean  
you are already acquainted with these sisters, my lord?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
What's this? You sound awfully well-informed.  
Could it be you are already acquainted with these sisters, my lord?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
This is beginning to get ridiculous.  
Are there any girls in this world you have *not* befriended?  
  
**Akari：**  
Hmm?  
Oh! {player}, it's you!  
  
**Akari：**  
Don't look this way!  
My poor sister's clothes were melted away in a terrible accident!  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh? {player}?!  
Wha... How do you always show up at the most ridiculous times?!  
  
**Yori：**  
Couldn't you have showed up a little sooner,  
when I was actually in trouble?!  
Your bad timing really ticks me off!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, aren't you two a lively pair!  
Are you all right? You're not hurt or anything, are you?  
  
**Akari：**  
Nope...  
The only casualty here was my dear sister's reputation,  
after she bared herself for the world to see!  
  
**Akari：**  
Ohhh, my poor, dearest sister!  
How awful for you!  
  
**Yori：**  
I-it was only a bit of my dress that got melted!  
Don't make it sound like I was parading around stark naked!  
  
**Yori：**  
Urghhh...  
Honestly, what a drag... Today is the worst.  
  
**Akari：**  
Personally, I count myself lucky!  
This kind of classic scenario is way too rare nowadays,  
even in the skeeviest of romcoms!  
  
**Akari：**  
Anyway...  
We've been waiting for you, {player}!  
  
**Akari：**  
You wanted to see Shinobu, right?  
We'll take you right to her! We're in the same guild, you know.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh! You actually came here to see us?  
I guess {player} did say something about  
meeting with some kind of guides in the plaza...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So he was talking about the two of you, huh?  
And \"Shinobu\"... That must be the name  
of the fortune-teller we're looking for, am I right?  
  
**Akari：**  
Yup!  
She's usually out wandering around  
in the back alleys and stuff...  
  
**Akari：**  
So it's not always easy to track her down.  
But if you come with us, we'll make sure you get to see her!  
  
**Akari：**  
She's a bit odd, and it's hard to tell what's going through her head.  
But she does seem to care about  
the rest of us in the guild, at least!  
  
**Yori：**  
Hmph.  
There's a bunch of things we owe you for, {player}...  
So we couldn't turn down a request like this. I hope you're grateful!  
  
**Yori：**  
Okay, follow me.  
We can save the introductions for when we find somewhere to sit down.  
  
**Akari：**  
Ahhhh, wait a minute!  
I still need to scoop up aaaall this lovely slime  
so I can store it away somewhere safe!  
  
**Yori：**  
Th-the only place you should be putting that stuff  
is at the bottom of a ditch!
