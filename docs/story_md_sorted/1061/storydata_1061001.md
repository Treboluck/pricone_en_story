**Narration：**  
The same night after being brought to the Labyrinth hideout by Muimi,  
{player} notices that she is missing.  
  
**Muimi：**  
*sigh*...  
  
**Muimi：**  
...Hm?  
 Oh, it's you.  
Is something up?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I was wondering where you were.  
**Choice: (2)**  I came looking for you.  
`Tag 1`  
**Muimi：**  
And you came searching for me?  
 Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere.  
Not like I've got anywhere else *to* go!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Muimi：**  
Huh? For me?  
 Well, I'm right here!  
I mean, where else would I go?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Muimi：**  
...Hey, were you actually worried about me?  
Well, thanks!  
  
**Muimi：**  
But I'm fine! I'm not some kind of idiot!  
I wouldn't abandon my friends and just wander off!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Really?  
`Tag 4`  
**Muimi：**  
Really! I'm no liar!  
  
**Muimi：**  
You guys have forgotten all about the real world,  
and you don't even know what's wrong with this one yet, do you?  
  
**Muimi：**  
So for now, I've gotta be the one to take the lead  
and figure things out for everyone!  
Which is why you caught me sighing like that.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I mean, I haven't taken charge of a group  
since back when I lived in the facility,  
so I'm still not totally used to it.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Those really were the days! Playing the villain,  
beating up anyone dumb enough to piss me off...  
  
**Muimi：**  
I could use my power freely, so I stole, ravaged, rampaged...  
I just went totally wild!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Oh, sorry, sorry!  
Look at me, talking to myself again!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I want to hear more.  
`Tag 5`  
**Muimi：**  
Really? Then I'll keep on going!  
I like chatting to you, 'cause I don't have to think so much!  
Lessee, what else can I talk about?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Actually, I never told you guys much about myself, did I?  
Well, I guess I really couldn't have.  
Until almost the very end, we were on opposite sides.  
  
**Muimi：**  
And you don't know our real selves at all, do you?  
Though me and Octo dug up a bunch about you guys!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Me and Octo, huh...  
 Right, that can be our topic!  
I'll talk... about what me and Octo got up to!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Octo was... basically a hacker and intel guy.  
He'd use computers... well, you don't have those here.  
He used, uh, *tools* to dig up people's info and secrets!  
  
**Muimi：**  
And as for me... I did whatever!  
Mostly just gaming and experiments.  
They kept analyzing what was in my head.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Let's see... how do I explain my abilities?  
In Astrum terms, I guess...  
 Yeah, magic works.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I was like a mage who could use all sorts of magic.  
In the real world, and here in Astrum.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Sounds like you're pretty amazing.  
`Tag 6`  
**Muimi：**  
Is it really that amazing?  
Being good at sports or math seems more impressive to me.  
  
**Muimi：**  
And I got caught by Mana 'cause I used my abilities too much,  
so towards the end, I couldn't even use them here at all.  
  
**Muimi：**  
So I'm really nothing special.  
I was slapped with the name Muimi, fixed with a tracker,  
and forced to do whatever they wanted from me...  
  
**Muimi：**  
The experiments were boring,  
 but gaming was fun!  
You know, while I was in the game, I could forget all the bad stuff!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Since long before it was made into its current form,  
I've been in this world. As a test player.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I didn't mind the debugging work.  
Debugging means making this world a nicer place!  
  
**Muimi：**  
I still remember all the spots I explored during testing,  
so I can tell exactly how this world's changed since then!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Tell me more!  
`Tag 7`  
**Muimi：**  
You got a map? I'll draw one for you!  
  
**Muimi：**  
...There, that'll do. Man, I really did go all over.  
Fighting against you guys with Octo,  
beating up other players along the way...  
  
**Muimi：**  
By the time I first met you guys, me and Octo  
were already fighting our own battles, along with Minerva...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Oh, it was right here in Astrum that I met Octo, too.  
He was such a massive moaner, he always got on my nerves.  
  
**Muimi：**  
But he'd always do what needed doing, and if I was in trouble,  
he'd complain, but he'd help. He was a good guy.  
  
**Muimi：**  
So I still want to help him out when he needs it,  
and I want him by my side to rely on.  
  
**Muimi：**  
But he's forgotten all about me now, the dumbass...  
...  
I really have gotta snap him out of it soon!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah! Let's do it! You, and me, and everyone together!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  I'm glad you're feeling better.  
`Tag 8`  
**Muimi：**  
I sure am! I'm all pumped up now!  
...Thanks a bunch!  
 You really are a good guy, ain'tcha?  
  
**Muimi：**  
We oughtta head back!  
 If you're gone too long,  
Pecorine and Kokkoro will worry, right?  
  
**Muimi：**  
You really helped get me out of that funk.  
So if you're ever feeling down, I'll come and cheer you right up!  
  
**Muimi：**  
It's a promise!  
  
**Narration：**  
So saying, Muimi treated {player}  
to a massive beaming smile.
