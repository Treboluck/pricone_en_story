## Subtitle: A Strategy to Share
  
**Narration：**  
After narrowly escaping Karyl's all-out attack with their lives,  
{player} and his allies are holding a meeting in another  
hideout, to discuss how they can fight back against the palace.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I think it's time for a break. All right! Let's get some grub, guys!  
No use strategizing on an empty stomach!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hmm? Where's {player}?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Muimi.  
If it is my lord you seek, I believe he went outside.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Outside?  
 Gotcha. I'll go have a look.  
Kokkoro, can you help Shizuru and the others with the food?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I would be happy to. Oh, and, Miss Muimi...  
While I am cooking, please take good care of my lord.  
  
**Muimi：**  
That goes without saying. I've always got your backs, right?  
...  
Now let's see. Where could he have gone?  
  
**Muimi：**  
...Aha! There he is!  
Hey! What's up? Doing a bit of stargazing?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Muimi?  
**Choice: (2)**  What's wrong?  
`Tag 1`  
**Muimi：**  
No, the name's Novem!  
...Just kidding. I don't mind which name you use. Not anymore.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Muimi：**  
Isn't that blatantly obvious?  
I heard you'd gone wandering off alone, so I came looking for you!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Muimi：**  
Kokkoro was worried, you know.  
Pull yourself together, if you're her \"lord\"!  
  
**Muimi：**  
I know it'll take time for you to accept what happened,  
but she's struggling too, right?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Well... Considering you've lost your friends and even have to  
fight against them, I can't blame you for feeling down.  
  
**Muimi：**  
'Course, I got used to that ages ago!  
When me and Octo betrayed the Seven Crowns,  
we even had to act friendly with our real enemies!  
  
**Muimi：**  
I knew that you guys were on the right side,  
and wanted to team up with you,  
but I had to keep playing the villain!  
  
**Muimi：**  
So don't worry! ...  
Well, either way,  
I bet you already know what you're gonna do, right?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I've got to save them both.  
`Tag 4`  
**Muimi：**  
I told you before, right?  
If they put a bounty on your heads,  
going back to the city will be suicide.  
  
**Muimi：**  
How exactly do you plan on saving Pecorine?  
Do you know how tight the palace's defenses are?  
  
**Muimi：**  
And did you say \"both\"?  
 I knew it.  
You still want to save that Karyl girl too, huh.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Just so you know, I won't have time to help you with that.  
I've got to focus on taking down Mana.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I'll defeat Mana and fix this whole twisted world.  
That takes priority over everything else.  
  
**Muimi：**  
But I would like for you and Kokkoro to help us.  
...  
We could really use your Princess Knight power on our side.  
  
**Muimi：**  
You might think that's selfish, but I don't want to mince words.  
Let me be honest while I can.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'd like to work together, too.  
`Tag 5`  
**Muimi：**  
Well, thanks!  
 It's not like I want to abandon Pecorine.  
It's just that I'm not sure how much we can really do...  
  
**Muimi：**  
We don't want you guys getting caught too,  
so I'd rather not let you go off alone...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Isn't there any way at all...?  
`Tag 6`  
**Muimi：**  
Hmmm... I guess it's really just a question of timing...?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Think, Novem, think! If I rack my brains enough,  
like Octo, or {player} back in the day,  
I know I'll find a way!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Both of our targets lie in the palace.  
It'd be a total waste if they made their move  
at any time other than the day of our attack...  
  
**Muimi：**  
...As long as we can stay in contact, it might work.  
Hey, do you guys have any non-magical ways to keep in touch?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Magic is pretty vulnerable to detection,  
but if we have a different way, we can still work together!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Kokkoro has her messenger crows.  
`Tag 7`  
**Muimi：**  
Animals, huh?! Yeah, that's not magical at all!  
It won't trip any magical sensors, either! Nice going, Kokkoro!

**Muimi：**  
It's settled, then!  
You and Kokkoro can head off on your own tomorrow!  
  
**Muimi：**  
You two get close to the palace and scope out the city.  
While you're doing that, we'll prepare an attack plan!  
  
**Muimi：**  
I'll fix up some other methods of contact too,  
so you guys just lay low in the city!  
  
**Muimi：**  
I think it'll actually work better  
if our groups approach this from different angles.  
  
**Muimi：**  
It'll make our movements less predictable,  
so our enemies won't figure out what we're up to!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Is that really how it works?  
`Tag 8`  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah! Trust me, it is!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Besides... You really cheered me up the other night,  
so this time it's my turn to reassure you!  
  
**Muimi：**  
I know how it feels to be separated from the people you care about.  
And an honest guy like you shouldn't have to go through all that.  
  
**Muimi：**  
So don't worry! You've got all of us on your side!  
Kokkoro, Rajraj, Daigo, Masaki, Christina, Rino, Shizuru!  
In this world right now, they're all your allies!  
  
**Muimi：**  
It might not be my place to say this,  
but don't bother worrying about failure!  
  
**Muimi：**  
If things go south, deal with it when it happens.  
For now, just do what you want to do.  
  
**Muimi：**  
And besides, for folks like us, a little stumble or defeat  
won't keep us down for long, right?  
  
**Muimi：**  
For ages, I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again.  
But here we are. So nothing's impossible!  
  
**Muimi：**  
I'll do whatever I can! So you just keep fighting too!  
Mr. Hero!  
Heheh!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Thank you... Novem.  
`Tag 9`  
**Muimi：**  
Yep, you got it!  
 Novem's my name!  
And with that, let's get back to the others and talk strategy!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Come on, {player}!  
  
**Narration：**  
With the fist she had been holding against his chest,  
Muimi grabbed {player}'s arm  
and ran back towards the hideout.
