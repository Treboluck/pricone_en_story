**Narration：**  
A few days after the diner incident,  
Kaya invites {player} to join her for a training session.  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Hahhh!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hmm, it's still not quite the same as that time...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey, what d'you think?  
What will it take for me to unlock my full dragonfolk power again?  
  
**Kaya：**  
During that fight,  
I really did feel an incredible power coming from within myself.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Like my whole body was brimming with energy...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh yeah, almost like I was shining with...  
Wait, what the heck's this light?!  
 Waaahhh!

**Narration：**  
One lazy weekend, {player} heads to the local arcade,  
hunting around for a machine that looks fun to play.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey there!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Ahaha! Did I shock you?  
 Actually, it's a rare day off,  
and you're here on your own? Solo at the arcade...  
Even though you're such a nice guy. What a weirdo!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Sorry, I'm kidding. I mean, just look at me. I'm here alone too.  
I came here 'cause I was bored to death at home,  
but I was just thinking it's not much fun on my own.  
  
**Kaya：**  
I know! Hey, how's this?  
You can take me on at that punching machine!  
  
**Kaya：**  
The loser buys the winner something sweet!  
Well? Let's do it!  
 Ahhhh... Don't tell me you're worried you'll lose?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm game for a challenge.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaya：**  
Aw yeah! Then it's on!  
I didn't know you could be so competitive.  
  
**Kaya：**  
You can take the first hit.  
Good luck! Go, go, macho guy! ♪  
  
**Kaya：**  
\"Lightweight\"...?  
 What's this~?  
Are you feeling okay? Don't tell me you're holding back on me?  
  
**Kaya：**  
No need for any of that!  
Or what, do you want to buy me a treat that bad?

Well then, guess I'm up next.  
At this rate, I'm gonna win for sure... You sure that's cool?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Can you really win, though?  
**Choice: (3)**  Are you okay?  
`Tag 2`  
**Kaya：**  
Hmmm? Are you trying to provoke me?  
I could beat you without trying, but hey, forget that.

**Kaya：**  
Worried about me, huh? What a nice guy you are!  
But that means you're underestimating my strength, right?  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Kaya：**  
If that's how you're gonna be, I'm going all out.  
Too late for regrets!

**Kaya：**  
Now, what should I ask for?  
Ice cream? Cake? A parfait? A crepe?  
 Wait, no... I'll have all of 'em!  
...Don't worry, I'm kidding!  
 C'mon, let's go!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Ahhh, it was so fun playing games with you!  
It's been ages since I threw a good punch!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...When it's a game, I can still do it like always...  
  
**Girl：**  
Kaya...?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Huh?  
  
**Girl：**  
It's been so long! You OK? What're you up to?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Uhhh...  
 Yeah. Well, I'm good. You?  
  
**Girl：**  
Oh, I'm fine! I was worried since you haven't been at the dojo!  
Huh, who's this? Oh... sorry. Could you be on a date?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Ahaha, 'course not.  
 Me and him aren't like that.  
We're just gamer buds. ...Aren't we, {player}?  
  
**Girl：**  
Ahaha, sorry, sorry! Nice to meet you!  
I'm a close friend of Kaya's!  
  
**Girl：**  
I was on my way home from practice,  
but it's so great to run into you! I'm honestly thrilled right now!  
  
**Girl：**  
Hey, Kaya. You should drop by the dojo!  
The instructors all miss you as well!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Yeah... Well, I'll think about it.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Sorry. We've got somewhere to be.  
I'll...  
 see you 'round. Bye-bye now.  
  
**Girl：**  
'Kay! Later, then! Bye-bye~!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Hey, {player}. I think I'll pass on the sweet treats.  
Instead, can you come with me somewhere real quick?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Thanks for agreeing to join me.  
Let's walk a little.  
  
**Kaya：**  
...  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Hey, {player}.  
Sorry 'bout this, but can I tell you a story about myself?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  If it'll take less than an hour.  
**Choice: (6)**  If it won't take till tomorrow.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kaya：**  
It's not gonna be *that* long, so you can relax.  
It's not... something I want to dwell on, either.  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Kaya：**  
C'mon, of course it's not gonna be *that* long!  
...You really are awful at jokes, ain'tcha?  
Still, thanks. That helped a little.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Kaya：**  
That girl just now, she was my karate bud.  
We went to the same dojo since we were kids.  
Always competing with each other.  
  
**Kaya：**  
I originally got into karate  
'cause I hated needing my big bro to protect me.  
I wanted to have my own strength.  
  
**Kaya：**  
But it turned out, unlike my genius brother, I wasn't talented.  
So I trained like crazy instead, till I made it all the way to nationals.  
Amazing, right?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Then in last year's finals, it was me and her, and I won.  
It felt great, of course. I was proud of myself!  
I thought she'd... be happy for me too.  
  
**Kaya：**  
So after we bowed to each other, when I saw her crying ugly tears,  
suddenly that drive I'd always had, the will to get stronger, just...  
disappeared without a trace.  
  
**Kaya：**  
It was far from the first time I'd beaten her,  
and it's not like she hadn't beaten me before too...  
  
**Kaya：**  
But since then, in matches or even just practice,  
as soon as I face an opponent, I can't find the will to fight them.  
  
**Kaya：**  
I ended up quitting karate. Suddenly my life was empty...  
Until one day my therapist suggested Astrum to me.  
Before I knew it, I was hooked. Even converted into a dragongirl.  
  
**Kaya：**  
You know... when we hung out in Astrum,  
I had no trouble punching monsters, or even player-killers, right?  
  
**Kaya：**  
But back in real life, I'm still hopeless. Can't throw a punch at anyone.  
My body just seizes up... It's so dumb, I want to laugh at myself.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Maybe it's 'cause in Astrum, I feel like I'm a whole different person.  
For the heck of it, I gave myself a different hairstyle and stuff.  
Who knows, maybe that's what did it.  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Games are so great. You can fight without anyone getting hurt.  
And it's always possible to become stronger.  
  
**Kaya：**  
In karate, I didn't even have the will to face my friend,  
so if I'd carried on, I doubt I'd have amounted to much.  
  
**Kaya：**  
...I always wanted to become strong enough  
to even defeat my big bro, too...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Anyway... That's my whole life story. I'll head home now.  
You can treat me to that snack another time.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Thanks for hearing me out today. It meant a lot.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  You're such a kind person, Kaya.  
**Choice: (9)**  You just don't like hurting people.  
`Tag 8`  
**Kaya：**  
...Come on.  
This isn't what you call kindness. I'm just too soft.  
  
Jump to tag 10  
`Tag 9`  
**Kaya：**  
Maybe you're right.  
How'm I supposed to fight someone if I'm not ready to hurt them?  
In the end, I'm just too soft.  
  
`Tag 10`  
**Kaya：**  
Then there's you. A total good guy to the core.  
Even willing to spend time with a loser like me  
as I wallow in self-pity.  
  
**Kaya：**  
But I've gotta say, I think you're pretty cool like that.  
...Later.

**Ameth：**  
Aaaand welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You know, when Kaya awakened her dragonfolk powers  
in that brawl the other day, I was honestly scared.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I thought that power might completely consume her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But watching the two of you in the other world,  
I think she might be OK.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Even the reason she's so hooked on fighting here  
must have its roots over there.  
  
**Ameth：**  
If you're with her, she might just be able to control her power.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You'd better be sure to keep a close eye on her.  
Don't forget there's still no telling which way the coin will fall.  
  
**Ameth：**  
...Guess we're out of time.  
Well then, see you later.  
  

---  
  
**Kaya：**  
Mnhh... I fell asleep?  
I think I had another weird dream...  
  
**Kaya：**  
In those dreams... I'm so cowardly and weak, I can't fight anyone.  
If I really ended up like that... Just the thought scares me.  
  
**Choice: (11)**  You can always talk to me.  
**Choice: (12)**  You're strong, Kaya.  
`Tag 11`  
**Kaya：**  
Yeah, you're right. Whatever happens, I've always got you.  
Nothing to worry about, then.  
  
**Kaya：**  
If that time does come, I hope you'll be there to hear me out.  
  
Jump to tag 13  
`Tag 12`  
**Kaya：**  
I'm... strong...  
Well, 'course I am!  
 I'm the city's top pro brawler!  
  
`Tag 13`  
**Kaya：**  
...I feel better now.  
Having a bud like you... I'm a lucky gal.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Now, let's keep training!  
If we're together, I'll be able to unlock even stronger powers!  
I feel sure of it!  
  
**Narration：**  
Tossing aside the fear she had found in dreams of another life,  
Kaya returned with confidence to her quest for strength  
with {player} by her side.
