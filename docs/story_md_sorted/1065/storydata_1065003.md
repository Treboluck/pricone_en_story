**Narration：**  
Today, {player} has brought Kaya a new job  
teaching a lesson to some louts  
who've been causing trouble on a street of honest restaurants.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Now you're going down! Yahhh!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Nguahhh!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Listen up, punk! Don't go extorting tolls from honest people!  
You're a nuisance to all the townsfolk!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Aaaghhh! W-we're sorry!  
We've learned our lesson! P-please don't hurt us!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Don't show your faces on this street again!  
Now pick up your unconscious buddies and scram!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Y-yes, ma'am! We're so sorryyyy!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...There! That should do it.  
Another tally on my unbroken win record!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Nicely done.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaya：**  
You too. You've learned to bring me just the kind of work I like.  
Thanks—I appreciate it!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Now then...  
There's no guild work or gang work right now, so I'm free for the day.  
  
**Kaya：**  
What should I do next?  
You've got a part-time gig,  
 so I can't take up your time either...  
  
**Kaya：**  
...I know!  
Hey, why don't you let me help out with your job?  
  
**Kaya：**  
No, don't be shy!  
You bring me all these great jobs, so it's only fair!  
  
**Kaya：**  
C'mon, let's get moving or we're gonna be late!  
What're you waiting for?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
This is where you're working?  
Just looks like the edge of a regular street...  
  
**Employer：**  
Hi there. Glad you're on time.  
And this girl is...?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey. I'm a friend of his.  
Is this a job I'd be able to lend a hand with?  
  
**Employer：**  
Certainly! Actually, we're a man down today,  
so this is perfect.  
 Here, take this.  
  
**Kaya：**  
And this is...?  
  
**Employer：**  
Your task is to use this counter to measure pedestrian traffic.  
It takes a lot of patience and concentration, but good luck!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Huhhh... Guess jobs come in all shapes and sizes.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Couldn't be more different from my brawler work.  
 Should be interesting!  
I knew I made the right choice coming with you!  
  
**Employer：**  
Well then, let's have both of you...  
 watch this street right here!  
  
**Kaya：**  
OK then. I'll count the people coming from the right,  
so you handle the left.  
 Let's get started, shall we?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hmmm... One, two, three.  
Oh! If we count the kids who just ran past, that makes six...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Heheh. This is perfect for training my eagle eyes!  
It should keep me on my toes!  
  
**Kaya：**  
642, 643...  
 That mother had a baby, too, so 644...  
No, wait. Was it 645...?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Ahhh, geez! Am I keeping this count straight?!  
How'm I supposed to keep this up for hours?!  
 I can't deal!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Actually, how about you? You've been counting this whole time.  
Doesn't it get to you at all?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I can handle it.  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm used to this.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kaya：**  
No way. Where d'you find all that patience?  
I'm about to lose it over here. ...You're amazing.

`Tag 3`  
**Kaya：**  
Holy heck. That's some serious patience.  
I've got new respect for you!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Kaya：**  
If I had to do this every day, I'd go completely crazy...  
  
**Man 1：**  
Hey!  
This spot is where I'm setting up my stall!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Huh? It's a free street, and I got here first.  
Who gave you the right to it?  
  
**Kaya：**  
What's this? An argument?  
  
**Man 1：**  
My family has been trading here for generations.  
You don't get to snatch it just 'cause you showed up early!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Why should I care what your family says?!  
It's a dog-eat-dog world. How about we settle this like men?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Did they just say something about fighting?!  
This is a brawl in the making, right? Right?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...H-hey, listen.  
I think I've got somewhere I need to be, so...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  We've got our own work to do.  
**Choice: (6)**  Control yourself.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kaya：**  
Y-yeah, I know...  
But look, how do you expect a brawler to stay out of a scene like that?!  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Kaya：**  
C'mon! Those two are about to kick it off.  
You can let me step in, right?  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Choice: (8)**  We're almost done.  
`Tag 8`  
**Kaya：**  
I know that, but...!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...No, you're right. Sorry, I'm in the wrong here.  
A job's a job. Gotta see it through.  
  
**Kaya：**  
827... 828...  
Those two haven't settled their score yet, right...?  
  
**Kaya：**  
829...  
 And time's up! Work's over!  
  
**Kaya：**  
I'm gonna head over and check on those two!  
Sorry, but you can report in for me, OK?!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Looks like the sales contest was a dead heat...  
  
**Man 2：**  
Yeah. That does it.  
The only option left is an old-fashioned duel of fists! Fight me!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hold it, you two!  
I'll take on that fight for you!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Huh? And you're... who, exactly?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Name's Kaya. My business is settling scores—I'm a pro brawler.  
I'll gladly take either side in this fight, for the right price.  
  
**Man 2：**  
Those wings... horns and tail...  
Are you that dragongirl brawler from all the rumors?!  
  
**Man 1：**  
What? Seriously?!  
I've got money! Will you fight this guy for me?!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I'll pay twice what he's offering!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Then I'll take the offer he just gave and triple it!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh? Ohhh?!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Final call! How does five times sound?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
It's a deal!  
I'll fight for you to the bitter end, guaranteed!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Kaya, I reported in for you.  
`Tag 9`  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, nice!  
 Thanks to you, I'm making more profit than I thought.  
It's not every day I get offered this much!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Ugh! How did this happen...?! Someone!  
Anyone, please! Fight this girl in my place!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Sorry about this, but a job is a job.  
...Maybe a little patience really is an important thing.  
  
**Kaya：**  
If I'd leapt at this fight right away,  
I wouldn't have made nearly as much.  
A valuable lesson!  
  
**Man 2：**  
...Oh, all right! You two win! I surrender!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Ohhh? Is that right...  
 Huh?  
  
**Man 1：**  
Well said.  
If you ask me, you'd have been wise to back down sooner.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!  
The fun was just getting started!  
 Why're you backing down?!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Well, I won't be able to do business if I get hurt...  
I'll pay half my profits for today! That'll do, won't it?!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Very well. It's you who settled this, brawler girl.  
We'll pay your fee in full from his profits.  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Looks like nobody needed to get hurt!  
`Tag 10`  
**Kaya：**  
This isn't what I signed up for at all!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Well, I didn't get to fight,  
but you did make me a tidy sum today,  
so let's have a nice dinner!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Today's my treat, so eat as much as you like!  
Now let's both dig in! *munch* *munch*  
  
**Kaya：**  
Mm, that's good!  
...  
Would've tasted better after a proper brawl, of course...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Still, I gotta say, when I'm with you,  
I never know what's gonna happen next.  
  
**Kaya：**  
On my own, I'd never have made a profit without fighting.  
That's all thanks to you for teaching me a little patience.  
  
**Kaya：**  
I'm just glad I've made a great bud.  
  
**Choice: (11)**  What's a \"bud\"?  
`Tag 11`  
**Kaya：**  
Huh? Buds are buds.  
 You and me are friends. Aren't we?  
  
**Choice: (12)**  Friends...!  
**Choice: (13)**  Yeah, we're buds!  
`Tag 12`  
**Kaya：**  
Yeah, friends.  
What, did you think we weren't buds already or something?  
If we weren't yet, we can start now.  
  
Jump to tag 14  
`Tag 13`  
**Kaya：**  
You get it! Sharing a tasty meal after a job well done.  
If that's not buds, what is?  
  
`Tag 14`  
**Kaya：**  
I know I can always count on you, bud!  
  
**Narration：**  
Swinging her arm around {player}'s shoulders,  
Kaya grinned with a joy that couldn't possibly  
have come from the day's work alone.
