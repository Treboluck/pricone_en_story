**Narration：**  
After finishing up another of her brawler jobs,  
Kaya is strolling through town with {player}.  
  
**Kaya：**  
I always feel great after a punch-out!  
Thanks a bunch for bringing me that job.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Business has been way better  
since you started finding these jobs for me.  
How do you even track down all these clients?  
  
**Kaya：**  
I know—let's get some food. Tell me your tricks over dinner.  
Then even when I'm on my own, I'll—  
  
**Kaya：**  
Wait, huh? Suddenly it got real bright...  
What's going on here?

**Narration：**  
One day, on his way home from school,  
{player} takes a detour by the local station.  
  
**Delinquent：**  
We went to the same dojo, after all.  
So of course I know you're his little sister.  
You're gonna call him out here for us!  
  
**???：**  
Like I said... I couldn't help even if I wanted to.  
I don't have my bro's number. You want to check my contacts?  
  
**???：**  
Stupid brother... Don't get me mixed up in your mess.  
Ah man, I just wanna get home and play Astrum...  
  
**Delinquent：**  
Shut up and bring him here!  
We've gotta settle this score with him, no matter what!  
  
**???：**  
Shouting isn't gonna make it any more possible.  
Besides which, didn't he kick all your butts already?  
  
**???：**  
Brawling's only gonna get you hurt, so why bother?  
This isn't a match, so there's no prize money or title at stake.  
  
**???：**  
Actually, if you want to beat my bro, you should try debating him.  
...  
No, wait. You seem about as dumb as him, so maybe you'd lose!  
  
**Delinquent：**  
Gahh?! You makin' fun of us?!  
Shut your dumb face if you don't want to get hurt!  
  
**???：**  
Oh, you're mad now? You'd throw a tantrum and punch a girl?  
If that isn't stupid, I don't know what is.  
  
**Delinquent：**  
Wha...?!  
 How dare you, you little...!  
You piss me off, you and your brother both!  
  
**???：**  
Well, you're pissing me off, too. Some idiot I don't know,  
demanding I bring that dumb brother I don't even talk to!  
  
**???：**  
If you've got a problem with my bro, sort it out between yourselves!  
Don't drag me into your dumb fight! Bye, now.  
  
**Delinquent：**  
You're not going anywhere!  
...  
Actually, I heard you quit karate, right?  
If you won't go fetch him, maybe you'll work as a hostage!  
  
**???：**  
You sure that's a good plan?  
Sure, I quit, but that doesn't mean I can't still take you.  
  
**???：**  
...Like heck I can! ...  
Ah, crap. Did I push him too far?  
But I couldn't leave without giving him a piece of my mind...  
  
**???：**  
Why do I have to deal with these idiots to begin with?  
I ought to be home playing Astrum by now...  
  
**???：**  
Idiot bro. Where even is he? It pisses me off.  
Picking the dumbest fights everywhere he goes...  
  
**???：**  
If they do actually hit me, should I fight back?  
It'd count as self-defense...  
 But I guess not.  
Like I could do that when I can't even punch a sparring opponent.  
  
**???：**  
I'm the one who needs to vent...  
Ah man, won't someone help—  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're here for the offline meetup, right?  
**Choice: (2)**  Is this the place for the meetup?  
`Tag 1`  
**???：**  
Huh...? And you're who?  
Offline what? Sorry, I'm totally lost here.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**???：**  
Uhhh...  
 Say what now?  
Why would there be a meetup happening here?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Delinquent：**  
Who're you, punk?! One of *his* gang?!  
Don't get in our way!  
  
**???：**  
Ah—! Dude, are you OK?!  
Ahhh...!  
  
**Delinquent：**  
Hey! Running away?!  
Dammit! Hold it right there!  
  
**???：**  
W-wait a minute! No need to pull me by the arm!  
Quit it, OK?!  
 Actually, are you even listening...?!  
  
**???：**  
...Thanks. I think we should be safe now.  
  
**???：**  
You really should've just left me alone, you know.  
Like, I can see you meant well,  
but can't you see they could've hurt you too?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You looked like you were in real trouble.  
`Tag 4`  
**???：**  
Oh, please. That's all the reason you need?  
Tsubakigaoka really is full of idiots...  
  
**???：**  
...Hang on, \"Tsubakigaoka\"...? It can't be...!  
  
**???：**  
Hey. Let me take a guess at your name!  
You're {player}, right?  
  
**???：**  
Ahaha! You should see the surprise on your face!  
I knew it. What a coincidence!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Who told you my name?  
`Tag 5`  
**???：**  
A friend of mine told me  
there's a guy at Tsubakigaoka  
who loves helping people even more than she does!  
  
**???：**  
It's just like Harusaki said. You're a real do-gooder, ain'tcha?  
  
**???：**  
'Course, from where I'm standing,  
Harusaki herself is as hopeless a goody-two-shoes as you are.  
  
**Kaya：**  
My name's Kaya Kido. A first-year at Seito Academy.  
Nice to meetcha, {player}! ♪  
And thanks for saving me just now!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Thing is, my brother is a well-known tough guy 'round here,  
and they were using me to get to him.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Actually, from what Harusaki told me,  
didn't the two of you meet each other in Astrum?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Here's an idea!  
You should play Astrum with me! You will, right?  
  
**Kaya：**  
I'll friend you on my mimi, so gimme your ID!  
Let's party up with Harusaki  
 and have fun together!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Aaand we're friends.  
 It's a pleasure! ♪  
  
**Kaya：**  
This might surprise you, but I'm a hardcore player.  
Lately I've even been messing around with cheats.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh yeah! Tell me, have you heard of dragonfolk?  
They're a new race coming in the next big Astrum update!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Heheheh. Bet that's news to you!  
It's still in the testing phase,  
so you can only convert if you applied specially!  
  
**Kaya：**  
And I mean, only a handful of lucky people  
even knew about the application process.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Now you're wondering how I know so much, huh?  
That's my little secret. ...  
Oh, but I'm not one of the Seven Crowns.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Anyway, point is, I play Astrum a ton!  
That's how I met Harusaki too!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Man, I hope we can play together soon...  
I know! How does tonight sound?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  ...I'm glad you're feeling better.  
**Choice: (7)**  Looks like you're all right now.  
`Tag 6`  
**Kaya：**  
Aw... You don't need to worry so much about me!  
...  
Yeah. I'm fine. So don't worry, {player}.  
  
Jump to tag 8  
`Tag 7`  
**Kaya：**  
Aww, you're such a worrywart!  
...  
Really, don't worry so much. I'm fine now.  
  
`Tag 8`  
**Kaya：**  
I thought you were a harmless clown at first,  
but you seem pretty reliable. Huh...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Y'know, you're pretty entertaining.  
Thanks for today. See you 'round!  
  
**Kaya：**  
So that's the famous {player}, huh...  
Seems like he'll be fun to play around with!

**Ameth：**  
And welcome back.  
That was...  
 not the most restful of dreams, I suppose.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Kaya seems kind of unsteady over there, huh?  
On the inside. Like she'll vanish if you look away...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Even so, she looked pretty happy talking to you.  
Maybe that was just the encounter she needed.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I was shocked to see that unlike our Kaya, she hates brawls.  
Is that her brother's fault?  
  
**Ameth：**  
But in that case, how did our Kaya end up the way she is...?  
She's not going to be a simple case, that's for sure.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You can hang out with her all you like,  
but there's no telling what will happen. Be careful, OK?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I don't just mean Kaya. Dragonfolk in general  
are a race you should take extra care with.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Though of course, I'm sure you'll forget all this  
once you wake up from the dream.  
I hope you can hang on to some of it, at least...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, whatever. Just do your best like you always do.  
I'll see you around.

**Kaya：**  
Mnhh...  
 Huh? Did I fall asleep out here in the open?  
There's this weird aching in my body...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Still, what a freaky dream.  
Me, not just holding back,  
 but not even being able to fight...?  
  
**Kaya：**  
And then that guy who helped me out...  
He seemed weirdly familiar...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Don't tell me you had that dream too?  
Maybe our bond as buds runs deeper than I thought!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Still, the real me isn't a weak coward like that.  
I mean, look—I can throw punches like crazy!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Ahaha! Did that scare you?  
 Sorry, my bad.  
...I'm feeling kinda hungry now! Let's go get a bite to eat!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Dammit. The weird feeling won't go away.  
Am I that worn-out?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Then I oughtta get some proper rest with my bud!  
 That'll fix it!  
  
**Narration：**  
Kaya chilled out with {player} for the rest of the day,  
but wasn't able to shake the strange sensation for a while.
