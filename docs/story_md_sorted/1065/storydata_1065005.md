# Kaya Episode 5
During a training session, {player} and Kaya are attacked by a monster. Kaya defeats it with little effort, but a pair of adventurers show up, and the discussion turns to the rewards for its defeat. Kaya insists she doesn't need any, since she never took on the job to defeat it, but ultimately accepts the cash as a sign of their gratitude.

**Narration：**  
One day, when {player} is out on a lazy stroll,  
he happens across Kaya in the city streets.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey, if it ain't {player}!  
What brings you to these parts today?  
You just bored, or what?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Here's an idea, then—you can join in with my training!  
I'm pretty free today too. No guild or gang work to take care of.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  \"Gang work\"?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, right. Did I never mention?  
I'm a member of a gangster family.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Don't get me wrong, my brawling work is Guild Association approved,  
and even the gang stuff is mostly just staffing stalls  
and patrolling our turf.  
  
**Kaya：**  
The real shady stuff all gets smoothed over by our boss.  
I hear things got nasty a while back,  
 but we're peaceful nowadays.  
  
**Kaya：**  
So sometimes I have boring days with nothing to do.  
 Like today.  
I tend to use them for brawling practice—  
in other words, training!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Why don't you come too? You're free, right?  
Then follow me! I know a great spot just outside the city!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Yeah... This place'll do for today.  
Nice and spacious, right?  
 Now, let's get started...  
  
**Kaya：**  
...  
Hahh! Yah! Haahhh!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...You'll get bored just watching me.  
How about you train with that sword? Do some practice swings.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Huh... Not bad form, actually.  
You must have a good teacher.  
  
**Kaya：**  
A fishing teacher?  
 Uh, I didn't mean fishing...  
Wait. Do you mean swordplay's like handling a rod?  
...Maybe not.  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Hey, I just had a thought. Wouldn't it be a good idea  
to practice fighting with your bare fists too?  
  
**Kaya：**  
You seem weirdly out of it sometimes,  
so you might get caught without a sword someday.  
 Right?  
  
**Kaya：**  
C'mon, lemme show you the basics.  
 Make a fist like this...  
 That's right.  
Place your feet at shoulder width, and thrust straight forward!  
  
**Kaya：**  
At the end, you gotta tense your fist and give it a twist.  
That puts more force behind it.  
 Go on, try it for yourself.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Your armpits are looking a little loose there.  
If you leave yourself open...  
 Take this!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  That tickles...  
`Tag 2`  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, come on!  
If you can't endure this, how'll you win in a real fight?  
  
**Kaya：**  
What if an enemy tickles you, huh?  
Will you leave yourself at their mercy?  
  
**Kaya：**  
C'mon, don't pay me any mind!  
Keep up the training!  
  
**Kaya：**  
One, two! One, two!  
There! There! Jab... jab!  
  
**Kaya：**  
We're still only getting started here!  
Tickle-tickle-tickle!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I-I can't take any more...  
`Tag 3`  
**Kaya：**  
Ahaha, sorry 'bout that!  
Your reactions were so funny, I couldn't resist.  
  
**Kaya：**  
But you never know what'll happen in a fight.  
Like, what if right now, a monster attacked us out of the blue?  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Huh? A monster?  
Oh, come on! I didn't mean it that literally!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Honestly...  
 What a *massive* pain, huh?!  
A perfect training partner out of nowhere!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You sound like you're... having fun?!  
**Choice: (5)**  Aren't you scared at all?!  
`Tag 4`  
**Kaya：**  
Ahaha! Sorry, is that how it seems?  
That must be 'cause I'm really loving this! Bring it on, beastie!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Kaya：**  
Scared? Why would I be?! If anything, I'm getting excited!  
You can stand back! I'll take this guy one-on-one! Yahhh!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Monster：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Wait, huh?  
 One hit and you're on your last legs?  
Don't tell me this thing was weakened before we started?  
...  
Well, whatever! I'll just finish it in a flash!  
  
**Adventurer 1：**  
You two! Are you all right?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Whoa! Talk about awful timing...  
Hey. Who the heck are you guys?  
  
**Adventurer 2：**  
We're here on a Guild Association job  
to locate and defeat that dangerous monster.  
  
**Adventurer 2：**  
But it got away from us mid-battle.  
So we chased after it and found you two here.  
  
**Adventurer 1：**  
It's a savage beast.  
 We'll fight it with you!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Huh? Hold it right there. I'm the one fighting it right now.  
Are you gonna butt in on a one-on-one brawl?  
'Cause if you are, you'll have to take me down first!  
  
**Adventurer 1：**  
Brawling with a monster?  
...No, it's far too dangerous for that!  
  
**Adventurer 2：**  
But get a load of this girl's aura...  
I almost feel like  
 she can take it!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Adventurer 1：**  
What's the beast doing?  
Don't tell me it's taken a liking to this girl...?  
  
**Kaya：**  
I didn't do this to save you, idiot!  
Don't let your damn guard down!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Kaya：**  
That's all you've got?  
 Ugh, what a drag.  
Didn't even last long enough to give me a good spar.  
  
**Adventurer 2：**  
Defeating it in a single hit...? You really are incredible.  
  
**Adventurer 1：**  
Thank you. This is half the reward we were offered.  
We were given it as an advance, but let us split it with you.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Huh? C'mon, no need for that.  
All I wanted was to get a decent fight out of this...  
  
**Kaya：**  
It was your target to begin with, right?  
Sorry for snatching it.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Hold Kaya back.  
**Choice: (8)**  Poke Kaya in the tummy.  
`Tag 7`  
**Kaya：**  
Aahhh! Don't just grab a girl's waist!  
Ah, geez! You got something you wanna say?  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Kaya：**  
Aahhh! Wh-what was that for?!  
The brawler's code says no sudden ambushes!  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Kaya：**  
Wahhh! H-hey! I said stop that!  
You're just getting back at me for before, aren't you?!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Just accept the money.  
**Choice: (11)**  You've earned it.  
`Tag 10`  
**Kaya：**  
Huhhh? All I did was finish the thing off.  
I mean, if it's what the guys hunting it want, I guess it's their call...  
  
Jump to tag 12  
`Tag 11`  
**Kaya：**  
Uhhh. Is that how it works?  
Well, coincidence or not, I guess it was me that defeated it...  
  
`Tag 12`  
**Kaya：**  
All right. If you're gonna insist, I'll take it.  
Can't say no to a little extra cash.  
  
**Adventurer 1：**  
Yes, you really should have it.  
We owe you for this one.  
  
**Kaya：**  
...I guess... you're welcome.  
  
**Adventurer 2：**  
Well then, we'll be heading back to file a proper report.  
You two take care!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...And they're gone.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Ah man. This feels so awkward.  
It's not like I fought that thing for them, or for the cash...  
  
**Choice: (13)**  But you made them happy.  
**Choice: (14)**  Don't you like doing good deeds?  
`Tag 13`  
**Kaya：**  
Yeah... Even though all I did was have a fun brawl.  
You know, I don't like accepting money for fights like that.  
  
**Kaya：**  
But I guess if I got my fight, and their job got done,  
everybody wins... You seem pretty happy too, after all.  
  
Jump to tag 15  
`Tag 14`  
**Kaya：**  
I wouldn't go that far, but... Did I really do a good thing?  
I mean, I only kicked its ass 'cause I wanted to,  
and those guys must've wanted the full reward.  
  
**Kaya：**  
It's like I stepped in and snatched part of their pay.  
If anything, I feel bad for 'em...  
But you seem real happy, so I guess it can't be all bad.  
  
`Tag 15`  
**Kaya：**  
Well, whatever!  
We're done training, so let's spend this cash and have some fun!  
  
**Narration：**  
And flashing a grin to wipe away her uncertainty,  
Kaya set off with {player} back towards the city.
