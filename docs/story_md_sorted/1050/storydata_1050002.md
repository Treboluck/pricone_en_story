## Subtitle: Adults' Night Out
  
**Narration：**  
While going about his business in town,  
{player} hears a familiar child's voice  
and the sound of high heels.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Ah ha!  
I finally found you, {player}!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Excuse you!  
N-no I don't want any candy!  
Stop treating me like a little kid!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Anyway!  
You need to take responsibility! With a capital \"R\"!  
  
**Misaki：**  
When you saved me, you destroyed my dignity  
  
as an independent adult woman!  
  
**Misaki：**  
What do you mean, you have no idea what I'm talking about?!  
  
**Misaki：**  
All the boys made fun of me again after what happened.  
They said I'm not an adult because I couldn't fight  
that monster!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Argh, I can't stand it! Just thinking about their smug,  
immature faces makes me so mad I could spit nails!  
  
**Misaki：**  
You do know how to take responsibility after you wrong  
an adult woman,  
don't you?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Adults make up for their mistakes by going out to eat  
at fancy restaurants.  
And the man has to pay, of course.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Maybe I'll have you take me shopping after, too.  
I need a brand-name purse. Oh, and new high heels!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Ahh... A real adults' night out on the town.  
Just the thought of it makes my heart do flip-flops!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Heh heh. And you have zero right to refuse, understand?  
I'm holding you accountable for what you did to me.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  A date with a child? I don't think so...  
**Choice: (2)**  Shopping together? I'll be nervous.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misaki：**  
What?!  
Who are you calling a child!  
You need to learn how to treat me properly!  
  
**Misaki：**  
A-and besides, it's not a date, okay?  
Doofus! Creeper!

But don't worry. Follow my lead, and I'll show you  
exactly how grown adults behave when they're—  
  
**Misaki：**  
Huh? Not like that? You'll be nervous about what  
society will think  
when they see you walking around  
with a kid?!

Cut it out!  
Don't call me a kid!

**Misaki：**  
That does it. Now I'm really, really mad!  
You're taking me to a six-star, four-diamond restaurant,

Come on, get going!  
Don't make a woman walk down the street by herself!
