**Narration：**  
Misaki drags {player} along on a shopping trip,  
when they're suddenly bathed in a mysterious light.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Wh-where'd this light come from?  
Wait, this happened before...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Ahh... AIEEEE!  
  

---  
  
**Misaki：**  
Would you cheer up? I was gracious enough to take you  
with me to an \"adult store.\"  
You should be excited!  
  
**Misaki：**  
What's with the weird look?  
I said \"adult store.\"  
Obviously that means a  
clothing boutique!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Why,  
what did you think I meant?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Whatever.  
Let's go in and find the perfect outfit  
for me!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I wanted to get my big sister to take me, but she already  
had plans, so she ditched me.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Since I've got no other option, you get to give me your  
thoughts and opinions instead.  
C'mon, let's go in!

**Misaki：**  
Mm-hmm. Not too shabby!  
  
A tiny bit big, but otherwise...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's really cute.  
**Choice: (2)**  It's too baggy.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misaki：**  
Not cute, pretty!  
Say it shows maturity and class!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Misaki：**  
I-it is not! It's the perfect size for me.  
As an adult, I can wear something like  
this with just a few minor alterations.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Misaki：**  
Ugh, you have absolutely zero taste.  
I brought you along to help me.  
Try to be a little more useful!  
  
**Misaki：**  
What was that?  
Don't forget my budget?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Argh, seriously?  
Don't nitpick every little thing.  
I know I'm on a budget.  
  
**Misaki：**  
I'm gonna pick out the ones I like the best first,  
and then talk price while I'm deciding.  
Promise.  
  
**Misaki：**  
If you're that worried about the budget, you can check the  
prices now.  
It'll make things easier if you add everything up  
before we check out, anyways.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Wh-whoa, why're you panicking?  
The price tag? What about it?  
  
**Misaki：**  
It can't possibly be *that* much.  
Quit freaking out, would you?  
Let's see, it costs...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Eeek!  
Th-this is insanely expensive!  
  
**Misaki：**  
No way. Yikes!  
There's gotta be two extra zeroes on this, at least!  
Am I really wearing something that costs this much?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Take it off, quick.  
**Choice: (5)**  Hurry and put it back.  
`Tag 4`  
**Misaki：**  
H-here? Now?  
Hey, don't pull on it, you creeper!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Misaki：**  
I-I can't!  
An adult lady would never rush to put back a dress  
just because it was a little expensive!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Misaki：**  
I'm gonna play it casual, and return it with dignity and poise.  
  
**Misaki：**  
This isn't the time to worry about appearances?  
Y-yeah, I guess not, but...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hey, stop! Don't pull on it!  
Mind your own business. I'll put it back by myself!  
  
**Staff：**  
Sir, ma'am?  
Please don't be rough with that item, or it might—  
  
**Misaki：**  
Uh-oh.  
That sounded bad.  
  
**Misaki：**  
O-oops,  
I just remembered I have an appointment now!  
I'll let you wrap things up here!

**Ameth：**  
*sigh* What were you gonna do about that torn dress?  
You'd better have been reaching for your wallet.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Yes, you have to pay even if Misaki's the one who tore it!  
Man up. You're the adult!  
  
**Ameth：**  
All that aside, you've put a lot of effort into collecting  
those memory fragments.  
Bravo, bravo!  
Keep putting the same effort into getting along with Misaki!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, that's it for now!

**Misaki：**  
Finally, you're awake!  
You fell asleep right in the middle of the street!  
But to be fair, so did I...  
  
**Misaki：**  
You dreamed we went shopping?  
Really?!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I had the exact same dream...  
Didn't this happen to us before?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Ahh!  
Forget dreams, it's time for shopping!  
We're supposed to be looking at new outfits for me.  
  
**Misaki：**  
I've been stuck waiting for you to wake up this whole time.  
C'mon, get up so we can go to the store!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so Misaki led the way to a fancy woman's clothing boutique,  
just like in their dream.
