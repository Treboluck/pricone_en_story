**Narration：**  
Misaki sits in a fancy cafe with a perturbed look on her face.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hmm. So here, I'm supposed to...  
But then this has to be... But that...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What're you up to?  
`Tag 1`  
**Misaki：**  
Doing my homework.  
I always come out to this cafe terrace to work on it.  
Isn't it totally classy here?  
  
**Misaki：**  
But now I'm stuck on this problem.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Oh, I know!  
You're not busy right now, are you?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Since you've got nothing better to do, I'll allow you  
to solve this one for me.  
  
**Misaki：**  
H-huh?  
What do you mean, cheating is wrong?  
  
**Misaki：**  
It's not like that, you doofus. Obviously I could do it myself,  
but since you've got nothing but time on your hands,  
I'm going to *let* you do it for me.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Can you really not tell the difference between  
cheating and consideration?  
  
That's why you're still a kid.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Anyways, hurry up and get started on that problem.  
I'm gonna go have a caramel honey cafe au lait  
and look stylish while I wait!  
  
**Misaki：**  
So, are you about done?  
Are you kidding me?  
You made so little progress, it's almost comical!  
  
**Misaki：**  
This makes no sense.  
You're older than me, aren't you?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It's probably the amnesia.  
**Choice: (3)**  Sorry, cheating is wrong.  
`Tag 2`  
**Misaki：**  
Oh, yeah.  
I guess that was kinda inconsiderate of me.  
  
**Misaki：**  
I, umm, I hope you get your memories back soon.

`Tag 3`  
**Misaki：**  
I-I told you,  
it's not cheating!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Huh? The truth is you don't know what to do  
because of your amnesia?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Ugh, why didn't you just say so, you dummy?  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Misaki：**  
Still, amnesia or not,  
it must be really hard to not even be  
able to do math this simple.  
  
**Misaki：**  
All right, I guess it's up to me. I can only teach you the  
basics,  
but I'll tutor you, okay?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Aren't I so generous and mature?  
I bet you'll be grateful to me for the rest of your life!  
Hee hee!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Ready?  
We'll start with this formula here.  
You have to...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hey!  
  
I ended up doing every last problem all by myself!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Don't tell me...  
You didn't plan all this from the start, did you?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Argh, adults are such cheaters!
