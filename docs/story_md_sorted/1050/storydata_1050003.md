## Subtitle: Grown-up Palate
  
**Misaki：**  
Hmm. I really wanna check it out,  
but I'm not sure  
about going in by myself.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Something on your mind?  
**Choice: (2)**  There, there. Want a candy?  
`Tag 1`  
**Misaki：**  
Oh, hey.  
Where'd you pop up from?  
  
**Misaki：**  
That was very gentlemanly, showing concern for a lady.  
I suppose I should give credit where it's due.

`Tag 2`  
**Misaki：**  
Yay! Gimme, gimme!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hey, don't treat me like a baby, you jerk!  
Where'd you pop up from,  
anyways?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Misaki：**  
Actually, hang on.  
You came by at the perfect time!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Heh heh. You should be honored.  
I hereby grant you the right to escort me!  
  
**Misaki：**  
See, there's a trendy new sweets shop that just opened up  
in Landosol.  
 It's the new hot spot for couples!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I really want to see what it's like, but when I heard  
it's basically nothing but couples inside,  
I felt uncomfortable going in alone.  
  
**Misaki：**  
But lucky for me, you showed up right as I was  
trying to think of a plan.  
We're heading over to  
get a little treat!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Huh? What am I gonna eat there?  
Ha ha. Obviously,  
I'll be partaking in their most refined, delicate flavors which only  
an adult palate such as mine can appreciate.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Now, take my hand and stand up straight.  
Be the kind of poised, graceful escort  
that a lady  
of my maturity deserves! ♪  
  
**Misaki：**  
Oh, this is it!  
This is the new sweets shop!  
  
**Misaki：**  
\"Tart 'n' Bitter.\" What a name!  
No overly sweet, sugary junk  
in here. Nothing but complex, subtle flavors  
that only  
adults can appreciate!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Especially their number one best seller.  
\"100% Goya Juice Gelatin!\"  
  
**Misaki：**  
I heard it's a completely new fruit that was created  
with advanced selective breeding techniques.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Goya gelatin... It sounds so sophisticated.  
I bet if a little kid ate some, it'd taste so bitter  
they would cry.  
  
**Misaki：**  
But as a cultured adult woman, I expect I'll  
thoroughly enjoy mine!  
  
**Misaki：**  
S-so this is a grown-up treat. Goya gelatin.  
*gag* It... really stinks. Eww...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Don't give me that look!  
I can handle this. Seriously, I can!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Don't force yourself.  
**Choice: (5)**  It looks delicious.  
`Tag 4`  
**Misaki：**  
Don't talk to me like that.  
I-I'm a grown woman,  
not some picky kid!

`Tag 5`  
**Misaki：**  
Huh?! Oh, uhh, indeed.  
I-it sure does. Looks scrumptious.  
  
**Misaki：**  
I'm impressed you can recognize the appeal.  
I see you're a person of culture, as well.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Misaki：**  
W-well, here goes.  
One, two...  
  
**Misaki：**  
*slurp*  
  
**Misaki：**  
...  
...  
...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Yuck... It's so bitter...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Umm, I mean, how should I put this?  
I-it has a nice hint of bitterness to it.  
Definitely a dessert for an adult's palate.  
  
**Misaki：**  
I-I'm not faking it!  
I am an adult woman with refined tastes!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I'll show you. I'll eat the whole bowl!  
It's only... gelatin...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Ungh. The taste is rising back up from the depths  
of my stomach. Bleh...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Huh? What'd you say?  
You'll  
split it with me?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Oh yeah, it does look like the couples around us  
are sharing a single bowl.  
  
**Misaki：**  
I guess we should try to fit in, shouldn't we?  
 So be it.  
I'm actually full anyway, so you can eat the rest of it!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hey, wipe that smirk off your face.  
Hurry up and eat your dessert, you big dummy!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Urk! Yelling made the taste come back up again...  
*gag*  
  
**Misaki：**  
Growing up is bittersweet, isn't it...
