**Narration：**  
Far from town, a lone child finds herself in a dilemma.  
  
**???：**  
Argh!  
What am I gonna do?  
  
**???：**  
I shouldn't have bragged so much over something like this...  
  
**???：**  
Then again, I hate when they treat me like a little kid!  
  
**???：**  
But if I fight a monster, and the unthinkable happens...  
Ugh, what am I gonna do?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Everything all right?  
**Choice: (2)**  It's dangerous for kids to be out here.  
`Tag 1`  
**???：**  
Eep!  
  
**???：**  
Wh-what's wrong with you? Don't startle me like that.  
Who are you, anyway?!  
  
**???：**  
At least you're a gentleman, stepping in to ask a lady  
in distress if she's all right...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**???：**  
Eep!  
Wh-who are you?  
  
**???：**  
Never mind. Don't treat me like a kid! That was very rude,  
talking to me out of the blue like that.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**???：**  
Really, who are you?  
Are you trying to hit on me?  
  
**???：**  
Heh heh. When you're as ladylike as me, you release them  
all over the place.  
  
**???：**  
Huh? Release what?  
Pheromones, obviously.  
The undeniable, inescapable charms of a mature adult woman!  
  
**???：**  
Hey! What's with the shifty eyes?  
  
**???：**  
Excuse me?! It's almost five o'clock, and I should run  
on home?!  
How dare you! Don't treat me like a child!  
  
**???：**  
For the record, I'm not going anywhere.  
I've gotta take down a monster before I leave.  
  
**???：**  
Wh-why?  
Umm, because...  
  
**???：**  
Hmph!  
Because of those stupid boys.  
They refuse to admit that I'm a grown woman!  
  
**???：**  
They just made fun of me and said if I was a grown-up,  
I should be able to beat a monster.  
  
**???：**  
What a bunch of immature jerks.  
  
**???：**  
To be fair, I'm not scared of monsters one bit.  
I can defeat the ones out here without breaking a sweat.  
  
**???：**  
H-huh?  
What do you mean, my legs are trembling?  
They so are not! You need to get your eyes checked.  
  
**???：**  
Fine. If you're going to treat me like a kid too,  
I'll prove it!  
  
**???：**  
I'm going to take down the very next monster I see  
with grace, poise, and dignity.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**???：**  
*AIEEEE!*  
*MONSTER!*  
  
**???：**  
Wh-what do I do?  
It's way bigger than I thought it'd be!  
  
**???：**  
But if I don't figure something out, the boys  
will  
keep making fun of m—  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**???：**  
*EEEEEEEEK!*  
  
**???：**  
It's not fair!  
I'm gonna get devoured because  
of those stupid buttheads!  
  
**???：**  
What the—  
What're you doing?  
Why are you grabbing my hand?  
  
**???：**  
Run away?! Are you out of your mind?  
As a mature, adult woman,  
I would never—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**???：**  
AAAAAHHH!  
Run, run, RUN!  
Escort me out of here this instant!  
  
**???：**  
What?  
Don't stare at me like that.  
  
**???：**  
Hurt?  
Of course I'm not hurt.  
If anything,  
my wrist is a little sore from you squeezing it  
too tight.  
  
**???：**  
Geez. Why did you have to make such a fuss?  
I'm a confident, capable woman, and I could've beaten  
that monster in an instant with the poise and grace of a—  
  
**???：**  
N-nuh-uh!  
When was I acting scared?!  
  
**???：**  
Actually, wait! Never mind!  
You don't need to get into the specifics.  
  
**???：**  
Argh, you big, stupid oaf!  
You completely ruined my whole day!  
  
**???：**  
But, well... Umm...  
Hmph!  
  
**???：**  
What's your name?  
Why am I asking?  
Ugh, just answer me!  
  
**Misaki：**  
{player}, you said?  
Got it.  
I guess should give you my name in return.  
I'm Misaki.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Anyway, umm...  
Th-thank you for helping me.  
  
**Misaki：**  
In situations like these, I'm supposed to introduce myself  
and show my gratitude, or else my mom will yell at me!  
So I... I appreciate what you did for me.  
  
**Misaki：**  
But for the record, I didn't need your help!  
I don't want there to be any misunderstanding about that.  
Adults such as myself can handle our own affairs.
