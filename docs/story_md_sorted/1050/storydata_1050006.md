## Subtitle: A Little Wedding
  
**Narration：**  
Misaki paces back and forth in front of a certain building.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Well, what would happen if I went in by myself?  
People would definitely give me funny looks.  
  
**Misaki：**  
But as a mature, adult lady, I really want to go in and see  
everything for myself. There's no guarantee I'll have  
someone to go in with me for real at some point.  
Hmm...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Oh?  
{player}'s over there.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Of course! He's my answer.  
If he's with me...  
Plus, he's not bad-looking, either.  
I could do a lot worse!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hey, over here.  
You're not busy, are you?  
I know you. You're totally free.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Come on, you're coming with me for a while.  
  
**Misaki：**  
You and I are going to tour a wedding venue!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Whoa.  
Why is your jaw hanging open like that?  
  
**Misaki：**  
H-huh? You don't remember signing a marriage registration?  
A-are you out of your mind?!  
Who said I was gonna marry you?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Don't get the wrong idea. The only thing I registered for  
was a contest to win a tour of the venue, and it just so  
happens that I won.  
  
**Misaki：**  
I mean, a classy, refined lady like myself  
could get  
proposed to at any moment!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I'm just doing my research.  
And plus, I've always wanted  
to see  
what a real wedding venue looks like.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Should I really go with you?  
**Choice: (2)**  I've got plans.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misaki：**  
It's, you know, one of those things.  
There are lots of men  
who'd love to accompany me,  
but unfortunately I can't  
seem to pull any of them away today.  
  
**Misaki：**  
But if you're with me, I, umm...  
I guess I'd say you're a tiny bit better than the rest.  
Like, you're not the worst choice...  
  
**Misaki：**  
A-anyways, even though we're going in together,  
don't get any funny ideas!

`Tag 2`  
**Misaki：**  
They're canceled!  
I'm inviting you to come with me.  
Show some gratitude and get moving!

**Misaki：**  
Ooh, wow!  
I didn't know I got to wear a wedding dress, too!  
  
**Misaki：**  
The flowers are all so pretty, and the stained glass is  
beautiful.  
Ahh, weddings are so glamorous!  
  
**Misaki：**  
And this venue's just the right size.  
I'm gonna invite at least a hundred...  
No, two hundred people to mine!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hey, if you were getting married, what kinda wedding would  
you wanna have?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  A huge gala with everyone I know.  
**Choice: (5)**  A small, intimate service with just family.  
`Tag 4`  
**Misaki：**  
Hee hee. I'm with you on that one.  
My dream is to invite all of my friends and throw a big,  
lavish extravaganza!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Oh, but your future wife's gonna have a tough time.  
  
**Misaki：**  
You're pretty popular with the ladies, right?  
Almost all of the people you invite will end up being girls.  
*sigh* The poor bride...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Actually, why *are* you so popular with girls?  
It's uncanny.

`Tag 5`  
**Misaki：**  
I see. I guess that's got its merits, too.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Actually, keeping it to just your family and the people who  
mean the most to you is very grown-up. I like that.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Misaki：**  
Either way, I think weddings are magical.  
I love everything about them.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hey, can you come over here and stand next to me  
for a minute?  
  
**Misaki：**  
We're gonna do a dry run.  
A stunning lady like me could have to tie the knot at any time,  
so I can't be too prepared!  
  
**Misaki：**  
First, we exchange rings.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Then,  
s-seal it with a kiss...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Ack!  
Wh-why're you moving in like it's for real?!  
  
**Misaki：**  
You big, brainless dummy!  
Rehearsal over, rehearsal over!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Ahh...  
Even if it was just pretend, a boy's lips  
were that close...  
  
**Misaki：**  
I-I didn't say anything!  
We're leaving, you doofus!
