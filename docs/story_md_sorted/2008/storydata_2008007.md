**Kyoka：**  
Hmmm...  
Mmmmhhh...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Hey, Kyoka, why're you making those funny noises?  
Do you have a hurty tummy?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Poor Kyoka...  
Eheheh, I'll rub your tummy all better, okay? ♪  
  
**Misogi：**  
I'll help too! ☆  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Hey—what are you doing?!  
I'm trying to scan the area around here with my magic!  
That way, I should be able to find a way home!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ooh, really?  
Wooow! You're so cool, Kyoka!  
What a good girl! Patty-pat! ♪  
  
**Misogi：**  
I wanna pat her head too!  
Kyoka's hair is so soft and silky, it feels great!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
K-keep your hands off me, OK?!  
I'm trying to concentrate here!  
Really, can't you both calm down for a moment?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahh! Kyoka got all mad...  
I'm sorry... We'll leave you alone now.  
Come on, let's play over there, Misogi! ♪  
  
**Misogi：**  
All right, then!  
Hey look, Mimi! There's flowers growing down here!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Wow, you're right!  
They're not like the ones I've seen near Landosol. What a nice color!  
Eheheh... Maybe getting lost isn't so bad after all!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Don't get too distracted...  
I think I've searched the area enough to find a way home.  
We should go soon, before it gets too dark or monsters show up.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh! Nice work, Kyoka! Good girl!  
It's a great thing you were here!  
What would we have done if we couldn't get home?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Yeah... I thought I might never see Mommy and Daddy again...  
You're amazing, Kyoka!  
What a good girl! Patty-pat! ♪  
  
**Kyoka：**  
H-hahah!  
Well, this is nothing for me, really.  
Eheheh...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Actually though, I'm so relieved to have found a way home,  
it's taken the breath out of me.  
I'm worn out from all that magic, too, so can we rest for a moment?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Sure!  
You worked pretty hard, so I'll give you a shoulder rub!  
And as a prize, you can have this bug shell I just found!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I'll pass on the bug shell...  
Ahh, wow, I really am tired...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Without {player} around to help,  
even simple magic takes so much out of me...  
He may be hopeless, but I kind of wish he was here...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
No matter the time, no matter how bad things get,  
he always stays calm...  
So it's kind of comforting when he's around...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Eheheh.  
I guess you love Mr. Nice Guy too, Kyoka! ♪  
  
**Kyoka：**  
L-\"love\" doesn't factor into it!  
It's not like that!  
  
**Misogi：**  
I love Mister {player} a whole bunch!  
Wonder what he's up to right now? It'd be great to see him!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Who knows?  
At this time of day, he's probably getting up and eating breakfast.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahh... I'm pretty hungry too...  
I wish my mommy was here to cook breakfast...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh! I brought some snacks!  
Here, have this, Mimi!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ooh, thank you!  
  
**Mimi：**  
But... there aren't many snacks, and if I take them all,  
you two won't have anything to eat...  
We should split them up together! ♪  
  
**Misogi：**  
Yeah!  
*munch munch...*  
Mmmmm! That sugar's giving me tons of energy!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
You're always full of energy, Misogi...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Still... Even if they can be annoying,  
I really am glad to have these two with me.  
If I was here on my own, I'd have panicked for sure.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I have to wonder, though... How did this happen to begin with?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I remember yesterday, we were just playing together normally.  
The three of us, playing at being a grown-up guild as usual.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Then I think we found some parked carriages...  
And we thought we'd pretend to be dungeon explorers,  
so we all snuck into the back of one of the carts...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Then Misogi was all, \"Look at this treasure!\"  
and opened one of the boxes among the luggage...  
And some kind of weird smoke poured out from inside.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I think we must have breathed it in,  
because I remember suddenly feeling really sleepy...  
I guess we fell asleep right then and there.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
That box must have held some kind of enchantment  
to make people sleepy. I've heard that grown-ups  
have to use things like that sometimes.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
So I guess we fell asleep, and the cart set off with us inside...  
That would explain how we all ended up so far away from Landosol.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
When the owners noticed that we'd snuck inside without permission,  
did they get mad and throw us out? Or maybe we fell out by ourselves  
because of the rocking of the carriage?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Whichever it is, I guess it's all our own fault...  
*sigh*... Oh well. At least it looks like we'll get back in the end.  
But from now on, we should try to be a bit more careful.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Kyoka looks like she's thinking really hard...  
She always gets mad if people distract her, so I'll leave her alone.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Wahh?  
Huh...? What's this... thing here?  
  
**Misogi：**  
What's up, Mimi?  
What're you looking at?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Umm...?  
Look down here. There's something flicking back and forth...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ah!  
Mimi, no!  
Isn't that the tail of a monster?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Wh-whaaa?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Whoa! You're right!  
It's a big one, too!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Actually...  
Wahhh! This little thicket is totally surrounded by them!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wh-wh-wh... what now?!  
What should we even do?! I'm scared!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Calm down, Kyoka!  
I don't think the big monsters have noticed us...  
If we're really quiet, I think we might be OK!
