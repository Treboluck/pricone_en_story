# Chapter 8 Episode 9
Muimi explains to {player} and the others that the world they are living in is actually a game, and everyone is trapped in something like a dream. What's more, almost everyone has been stripped of their original memories.
  
## Subtitle: The Truth of the World
  
**Muimi：**  
Where should I start explaining...?  
Sorry, this might be hard to follow, but bear with me.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Have any of you ever felt like something's strange about this world?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Unnatural terrain, social systems, history...  
Bizarrely advanced systems of weapons, equipment and attack magic...  
If you start listing them off, there are too many oddities to count.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well... I suppose I cannot deny you are correct on that point.  
I quite agree.  
 This world seems strangely unsuited  
to ordinary day-to-day life.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
When it comes to the basic necessities that everyone requires,  
it feels as though they have been hurriedly prepared  
only in the most recent of times.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Up until then, how did people go about their lives?  
At times I have found myself questioning  
how our forebears could have survived at all.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The only supplies that are plentiful are those related directly to combat.  
It is as though until recently, everyone lived for war,  
or devoted their lives to dangerous adventures.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And yet, there aren't any signs of that in our history.  
Hmm, I see. That does seem a bit strange.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But somehow, nobody seems to question it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
In fact... Even when I think back on it myself,  
whenever I've wondered about those things,  
I always got distracted, or my train of thought just... cut off.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Something's obviously strange.  
But whenever I think about it, it's like my brain makes excuses  
and I just end up accepting it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"It's just the way things are, so why question it?\"  
In the end, that's the only conclusion I reach. Why could that be?  
It's like someone's interfering with my thoughts. How creepy...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Even right now, I keep on thinking,  
\"Aren't there more important things to talk about?\" and stuff...  
Like my brain is trying its best to subtly evade the subject.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed. I keep noticing and dwelling upon the fact  
that my lord is looking a little sleepy after our heavy meal.  
Almost like an infant... Ah, my lord... How adorable...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
\"Oh, I should prepare a bed for him at once!\"  
I find myself thinking, again and again.  
But this is hardly the time to be attending to such things.  
  
**Muimi：**  
That's right.  
Right now, I need you to think about this world's terrible secret.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I'm not sure if this explanation will be clear enough...  
But all of us—just about everyone living in this whole world—  
are having something like a mass hallucination.  
  
**Muimi：**  
No...  
More like we're sharing the same twisted dream together.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A dream...?  
Ehm, I'm not sure I follow.  
  
**Muimi：**  
That figures. Actually, it's not a dream, but rather something called  
a \"game world.\" But calling it that would just be more confusing...  
Yeah, let's keep things nice and simple and call it a dream.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Ahhh... I really am awful at explanations like this.  
If only Octo was here... He's always been a smooth talker,  
so I could leave all this to him.  
  
**Muimi：**  
But right now, I don't have him to lean on.  
So I'll just have to do the best I can on my own.

**Muimi：**  
Lessee... Right now, we're all basically dreaming.  
In fact, we're stuck inside the dream, unable to wake up.  
All of us come from a different world—our real \"reality.\"  
  
**Muimi：**  
I remember Labyrista mentioning this a few times, but...  
Have any of you ever had any unusual dreams?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Dreams of a world that's nothing like the one we know,  
and yet somehow it feels nostalgic...  
Where we live mundane lives full of happy and sad moments alike?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Actually, that does sound familiar.  
Although, being dreams, my memories of them are vague...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In those dreams, I had another, slightly different name and appearance...  
Yet I was able to accept them as my own without question.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Can it be that those dreams...  
That other world... is in fact our true reality?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That this world where we live,  
or at least we think we do, is the real dream?  
And the visions we believed were dreams are actually the real world?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
C-can such a bizarre notion really be true?  
Ahh, my head hurts just thinking about it...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But for some reason, it does feel like it makes sense.  
I've had dreams like that in the past, as well...  
And I feel like I was more at home there than I am in this reality.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I remember feeling a sense of certainty  
that \"this is the real world—this is my real self.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I always thought I felt that way because in the real world,  
my whole identity's been snatched away from me...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But if this was never the real world to begin with,  
that would explain it even better.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Yes. Hold on to that feeling.  
I know it may seem crazy, but trust me, it's the truth.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Though I don't have any proof to show you...  
And I can't expect you to just believe these far-out ideas  
that sound like a kid's made-up fantasies.  
  
**Muimi：**  
See, I've got superpowers... Uhh... like a special sort of magic, I guess.  
I used those unique powers that only I possess to protect my own  
memories, at the moment when everything changed.  
  
**Muimi：**  
It was all so sudden, I didn't have time to help anyone else...  
I really regret that now, and I wish I could've done more.  
But at the time, I had no idea all this would happen.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Muimi...  
Do you mean to say you still remember our \"original reality\"?

`image display end`  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah. All of a sudden, this crazy power assaulted the whole world.  
Even I couldn't block it completely,  
so there are still gaps I'm missing in my memory...  
  
**Muimi：**  
But I held onto almost everything.  
My precious memories that I'd never want to lose.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Only thing is, it looks like I'm pretty much the only one who did.  
Whenever I try to tell people the truth,  
I just look like some crazy kid spouting wild fantasies.  
  
**Muimi：**  
But there are a few people out there who retained fragments  
of their memories, or recalled them after the fact.  
People like our guildmaster, Labyrista of Labyrinth.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I've been working with those people  
to try and find some kind of way to repair this broken world.  
We can't just leave things like this. Someone's gotta put an end to it.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I don't want Octo, the only partner I've ever needed,  
to think I'm a stranger forever.
