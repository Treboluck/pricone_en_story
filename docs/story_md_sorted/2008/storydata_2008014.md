**Karyl：**  
You have had your minute to consider.  
Now, allow me to confirm one last time.  
  
**Karyl：**  
May I safely assume that you have no intention to surrender?  
If you turn yourselves in, we are willing to graciously spare  
your lives for the time being.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Her Majesty requires a great deal of magical and vital energy  
to awaken from her prolonged slumber.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You will be subdued, connected to a magical apparatus,  
and become a source of nourishment for Her Majesty's revival.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl...  
Please, tell me what's happened to you.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
When you disappeared for a while,  
we were all really worried about you, you know?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Why are you acting like some kind of evil villain,  
threatening us and looking down on us like insects?  
Aren't we supposed to be friends who've shared good times together?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
C'mon, Karyl... Our sweet and easily-embarrassed Karyl...  
You're only acting cold and distant  
to hide your real feelings like usual, right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Beneath all those nasty words, you still care about us, don't you?  
  
**Karyl：**  
...I hear no words of surrender.  
Then as promised, we will commence your extermination.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Knights of Nightmare, advance!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Monsters, rip and tear their flesh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl...!  
Please! Say you don't mean it! Say it's a joke!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine, please calm yourself.  
It seems quite clear that something is not right with Miss Karyl.  
That is not the Miss Karyl that we know and love.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Urgh...  
 Actually, there's something different  
about her appearance, too.  
Why is she wearing that creepy-looking mask?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You don't think... It's because of that mask  
that she's not acting like herself?  
Could it be some kind of brainwashing device?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's got to be it.  
The Karyl I know would never say all those horrible things.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Even when I make a total idiot of myself,  
she's never gotten more than a little snappy at me!  
Not once, this whole time!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We've joked around, laughed and smiled together,  
like the very best of friends!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This isn't her. Someone's using that mask  
to control her against her will!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And that \"someone\" must be the one she calls \"Her Majesty\"!  
Our greatest enemy!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eustiana! No, \"Mana Senri,\" was that your real name?  
Was stealing my name and my life not enough?  
Do you have to steal my friends as well?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What right could you have, and what reason,  
to do all these horrible things?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah... Miss Pecorine?!  
Please stop! Try to restrain yourself!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We are surrounded by monsters and enemy knights!  
If you charge in there alone, you will be surrounded and slaughtered!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But look! I have to tear off that awful mask!  
I have to get our Karyl back! To rescue her...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please, calm down. You are not acting in a rational manner.  
If you lose sight of your surroundings, you really will get yourself killed!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord! Help me to stop Miss Pecorine!  
Then we can flee to somewhere—  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Look out!  
Not sure we have time to be worrying about others!  
The enemy's all attacking at once!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Rino!  
I can't dodge attacks from outside my field of vision!  
Try to take out the archers and mages first!  
  
**Rino：**  
R-right!  
Urghh... I don't think I can handle this many of them, though!  
  
**Daigo：**  
Huarghhh!  
Get outta my way, you weak-ass cronies!  
  
**Masaki：**  
Don't try to fight them at random, young Daigo!  
We must stand back-to-back in a complementary formation  
and break through their ranks with pinpoint precision!  
  
**Christina：**  
Heavens above... I feel like an apple on the verge of  
being peeled down to the core.  
 While I do enjoy conflict,  
  
being unilaterally overwhelmed is hardly to my tastes.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Guys, over here! I'm gonna summon my  
Spiresbane Blade and carve a path through them!  
Let's make our escape now! Quick!  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Everyone, try to gather close to me!  
If worst comes to worst, I will make one final attempt  
to transport you all to safety!  
  
**Muimi：**  
You'll kill yourself, dumbass!  
At least wait till we get away from them  
to an area that isn't completely covered in magical traps!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
W-wait one moment, please!  
Miss Pecorine has charged deep into enemy ranks!  
We must bring her back first!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We cannot abandon her to save ourselves!  
  
**Christina：**  
If it comes to that, you will need to consider leaving her behind.  
Cruel though it may seem, it's better than losing all of our lives.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Never...!  
I cannot support such a course of action!  
Don't you agree, my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...My lord?  
Why are you staring off into the distance?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh no, oh no, oh no! Get away from me!  
Get back!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Look! It's Mister {player}!  
Help us out here!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Waaaahhh! We keep running and running,  
but the monsters don't stop coming! I'm scared!  
Help me, Mr. Nice Guy!  
  
**Masaki：**  
Who are those children?  
What brings them to a place like this?  
  
**Masaki：**  
Is this a devious enemy trap? No, surely not...  
Then did they stumble upon this battlefield by sheer bad luck?  
How incredibly unfortunate!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's the Little Lyrical girls!  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh?  
My lord, you are acquainted with those young ladies?  
\"Little Lyrical,\" you say...?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I've got to save them!  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes. We cannot leave them to their fate.  
Thankfully, they are not such a great distance away.  
We should be able to reach them if we defeat a few more monsters!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord!  
I will endeavor to open up a path for you.  
Leave the monsters to me, and hurry to those children's aid!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hahhh...!  
Almighty Lady Ameth, please bestow your protection  
upon your faithful servant Kokkoro!
