# Chapter 8 Episode 10
Muimi explains that it was Eustiana who twisted the world, and that it needs to be restored to its natural state. Pecorine and Kokkoro gradually begin to appreciate what Muimi is saying, but just then, an alarm sounds in the hideout.
  
## Subtitle: Aftermath of Tragedy
  
**Muimi：**  
Anyway.  
There was a single terrible event that switched our dreams with reality.  
Since that moment, this world has been utterly changed.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Everything from the terrain to people's memories and identities was  
totally rewritten, reconstructing the world we live in. Dreams became  
reality, and reality mere dreams. And it's been that way ever since.  
  
**Muimi：**  
But the thing is, this state is completely unnatural.  
  
**Muimi：**  
It seems to be causing issues all over the place.  
Those phenomena people are calling the \"Lost\" and \"Shadows\"  
are like bugs caused by the world's twisted state.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Bugs\"...?  
You mean, like insects?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Ah right. You wouldn't understand that, huh?  
 Well, it's like  
the world's rules have been twisted  almost to the breaking point.  
If we leave it like this, who knows what might happen.  
  
**Muimi：**  
So we have to fix what's been broken.  
This whole world needs to be restored to its proper state.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Only then will we be able to go home to our true reality.  
That's what I believe.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Labyrista was helping me out with all this,  
but I won't force you guys to work with me.  
For some people, their old reality might not be such an appealing place...  
  
**Muimi：**  
But we can't run away and lose ourselves in dreams forever.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm...  
Your claims are most unusual, and difficult to accept without question.  
But if true, this is quite the crisis, so I must think this over carefully.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Still, what could have caused such a bizarre situation?  
You say there was a single \"terrible event,\"  
but what exactly does that entail...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Who could twist the world itself, like some kind of deity,  
and for what reason? Or was it a form of natural disaster?  
  
**Muimi：**  
No... I think this situation was caused by the will  
of a single malicious individual.  
  
**Muimi：**  
In the old world, there was a being  
who had the godlike power to grant people's wishes.  
I think she must have granted a certain someone's terrible wish.  
  
**Muimi：**  
That wish was what caused dreams to replace reality.  
I wasn't actually there to see the wish itself being granted,  
so this is only my speculation...  
  
**Muimi：**  
But I'm pretty sure I'm right.  
The people who were fighting to grant their pure wishes full of hope  
must have been utterly defeated,  
 and a horrible villain stood victorious.  
  
**Muimi：**  
To fulfill their desires, that villain made a wish that changed the world.  
This world we're living in now is just the aftermath of a story  
that ended in the worst kind of tragedy.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Would that villain you mentioned happen to be  
the same one who's currently going by the name of Eustiana?  
That awful person who stole everything from me...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm pretty sure, if this world really has been reconstructed,  
that false Eustiana has gained more from it than anyone.  
Could it be her wish that created it to begin with?  
  
**Muimi：**  
I think you're right on the mark there. The real name of the person  
currently going by \"Eustiana\" is Mana Senri.  
 One of the Seven Crowns,  
who wrought havoc and chaos as the Omniscient Kaiser.  
  
**Muimi：**  
{player}...  
You and your companions, as well as my own,  
fought to stop the Kaiser's ambitions from coming to fruition.  
  
**Muimi：**  
And I'm pretty sure we must have lost that battle.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
{player}...?  
You mean, he was like a real hero out of a story?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Haha... That actually sort of makes sense!  
He's always seemed to be at the center of things...  
And he does do some super cool stuff occasionally!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh.  
I don't suppose I happened to be one of  
those companions who fought alongside him, did I?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
After all, right now, in this reconstructed world,  
we get along like the best of buddies!  
  
**Muimi：**  
No... Sorry to say this, but I don't know you at all.  
I met you for the first time after the world was twisted out of shape.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Same goes for your other friend, Kokkoro.  
In the old world, {player} was fighting together with a  
totally different group of girls, and a sort of fairy called Fio.  
  
**Muimi：**  
To be honest, I find it hard to understand  
how he ended up in a guild with you guys instead of them.  
I always thought the bonds they shared could never be broken.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eh...?  
I... I see. All right.  
That's a little... no, a pretty big shame.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But well, I guess it's not anyone's fault...  
I should count myself lucky that we managed to  
meet each other in this new world!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Even if the precious companions he used to have  
might not be thrilled to see him with us instead...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Even if it's like we stole him from the people  
he was really meant to be with...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's no use thinking like that, I guess.  
I'm just making myself depressed.  
  
**Muimi：**  
This world may be twisted out of shape...  
But that doesn't make the bonds you've formed here  
any less real or important.  
  
**Muimi：**  
It may not be much, but that's all I can say right now.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heheh.  
No, I'm sorry I dragged the mood down like that.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I just thought it would be really nice  
if even after the whole world had changed around us,  
we'd managed to find each other again, like some kind of fairy tale.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I always loved romantic stories like that.  
Eheheh...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, Miss Pecorine...  
Hm?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hold on a moment.  
Was that a shaking sensation just now?  
  
**Muimi：**  
...You're right.  
Something's set off the alarms we set up outside the base, too.  
Aw, man... I was so caught up in explaining, I almost didn't notice!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Rajraj, can you use your Spatial Leap to take a quick look outside?  
  
**Rajraj：**  
As you wish.  
I will return as quickly as I can.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wh-what's going on?  
  
**Muimi：**  
I don't know. I hope it's just some kind of false alarm or mistake...  
But given our situation, that kind of peaceful outcome  
seems like wishful thinking.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Everyone, I need you to get yourselves ready for anything.  
There's all sorts of stuff I still wanted to talk about,  
but it looks like we might not have time for that.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Shizuru, Rino, leave those dishes for later and get over here!  
Everyone assemble! We gotta be ready to run at a moment's notice  
if things go downhill fast!
