## Subtitle: The Spiresbane Blade
  
### Place: Underground Cave
  
**Shizuru：**  
Bueghh!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
*cough* *cough*... Urgh... Maybe we should have  
maintained our escape route a little better...  
I can't believe how dusty it was! My clothes are all dirty...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
*sniff sniff*... With how little cash we have,  
even cleaning the base was stretching our funds...  
  
**Rino：**  
Less complaining and more moving, Big Sis!  
The enemy won't expect us to come through these caves,  
so we should be able to make it past them to safety!  
  
**Christina：**  
...Alas, I fear this may not be quite so simple.  
Observe—this cave, too, is swarming with monsters.  
  
**Christina：**  
Whether it is a trap or a wild infestation, I cannot say...  
But they certainly do not seem friendly,  
so I don't think we're getting through without a fight.  
  
**Christina：**  
Although, if lowly monsters of this caliber  
think they can stand in the way of Christina Morgan,  
they are laughably mistaken.  
  
**Christina：**  
Big boy... Why don't we have ourselves a contest  
to see who can slay the most?  
  
**Daigo：**  
Is this really the time to be playin' around like that?  
Those knights could rush the hideout any minute,  
and when they find it empty, they're gonna start lookin' for us.  
  
**Daigo：**  
If there's really that many of 'em, they could cover this whole area  
pretty quick. Waste too much time on these monsters,  
and they'll have us cornered before we know it!  
  
**Christina：**  
Wow... You're smarter than you look, big boy.  
I'm actually a little impressed.  
  
**Daigo：**  
Hah. I'm a brawler—fightin' nasty folk's what I do!  
Times tables maybe ain't my strong point,  
but when it comes to battle, I know my stuff!  
  
**Christina：**  
...You don't know your multiplication tables?  
Are you all right? Do you need me to tutor you?  
  
**Daigo：**  
It's a figure of speech!  
I can do my damn times tables! Whaddaya take me for?!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Ahahah.  
It's great you two get along, but we don't have time to waste.  
We gotta bust through these beasts as quick as we physically can.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I think I'll handle this myself!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Whoa! Novem, does that mean  
you're going to use the you-know-what?  
  
**Rino：**  
Wahey! I've been waiting for this!  
Let's see how cool you can really be, Novem!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whatever could they be talking about, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I don't know.  
**Choice: (2)**  I've got a pretty good idea.  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Right, of course...  
Hmm... They certainly sound super excited about something!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh, do you really?  
You're more knowledgeable than I thought!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Wait, now you're looking all blank and confused.  
If you don't actually know, why did you say you did?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Maybe that was your old memories of \"reality,\" the ones we've  
all supposedly forgotten, shining through for a moment...  
From the world before it was reconstructed.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
If you like, I can amp up the output of my Royal Equipment  
and take down those monsters in a jiffy!  
Though I might be too hungry to move afterwards...  
  
**Muimi：**  
No worries, no worries.  
Leave this one to me.  
  
It's too soon to be breaking out our last resorts.  
  
**Muimi：**  
We've still gotta make it all the way to a safe location,  
so you'd better hold on to your stamina.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Everyone, get back for a second!  
I'm gonna go all out!  
  
**Muimi：**  
This is the Spiresbane Blade.  
The signature weapon I used to use in this world before it changed.  
Heheh. I tweaked its stats to turn it into a cheat-level ultra item!  
  
**Muimi：**  
My real Spiresbane Blade didn't make it into this world,  
thanks to some kind of system error during the reconstruction...  
  
**Muimi：**  
But our Labyrista used her special ability  
to create this replica for me to use.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Usually it's tucked away in a pocket dimension,  
but I can call it out whenever I need it!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Sadly, its stats aren't quite as OP as the original.  
But that's where my skills, experience,  
and of course, sheer guts come in!  
  
**Muimi：**  
In the old world, I wasn't great at wielding it.  
But I've grown enough that those days are behind me!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hey, monsters!  
If you value your lives, step aside!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Though of course, since you're made of nothing but data,  
I guess you can't deviate from your programmed patterns!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Data has no life or soul!  
You're not real creatures!  
So I can slice you up without hesitation!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Feast your eyes!  
The swordsmanship of the world's greatest villain  
is the last sight you'll ever see!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hiyaaaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh!  
Wh-wha...?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eek! Just the shockwave almost knocked me clean off my feet!  
How crazy is that?!  
  
**Masaki：**  
Ahh...  
 How beautiful...  
You shine like the sun itself!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hahah. All in a day's work!  
  
**Muimi：**  
The path's wide open!  
We've got a clear route straight through the monster swarm!  
So let's move!  
  
**Muimi：**  
If the stragglers try anything, I'll slice 'em to smithereens,  
so you guys face forward and focus on running!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Everyone ready?! Then follow my lead and charge!
