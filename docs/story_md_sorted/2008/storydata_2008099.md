In the interlude world in between stories, Ameth explains to {player} that the enemy has begun their assault in earnest, and that while Pecorine is still alive, their peaceful life may not be returning any time soon.
  
## Subtitle: Interlude 9
  
**Ameth：**  
Wh-wh-what happened?!  
What's going on out there?!  
  
**Ameth：**  
{player}!  
Can you hear my voice?!  
If you can, then answer me!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Urghh... What's going on?  
Why did I suddenly lose sight of {player}?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Don't tell me... he was actually killed by her?  
No, unless his whole being was wiped from existence,  
my connection would still survive!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Then is something blocking me?  
Could somebody have used some kind of magic  
to temporarily sever my link with {player}?  
  
**Ameth：**  
But wait, is that even possible?  
Nothing like that has happened before now!  
  
**Ameth：**  
No... It's not as though I'm really a god.  
I'm still bound by this world's rules, by its programming.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Did somebody become aware of my presence  
and try to interfere with my magical link to {player}?  
It's the only explanation I can think of... Aaargh!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Lady Ameth!  
`Tag 1`  
**Ameth：**  
...Ahhh?!  
Oh! {player}!  
So you are all right! Thank goodness...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Wait, since when do you call me \"Lady\"?  
I don't need worship from you.  
Aren't we supposed to be buddies? Let's stick to first-name terms!  
  
**Ameth：**  
All that aside...  
What the heck just happened back there?  
You've got to fill me in on your situation right now!  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm sorry.  
For some reason, I lost all contact with you for a while.  
So I have no idea what's going on!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Explain what happened.  
`Tag 2`  
**Ameth：**  
Hmmm... I see...  
  
**Ameth：**  
So Muimi gave you a whole bunch of information,  
and you finally started closing in on the world's secrets.  
That, at least, sounds like very good news.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But before she could finish explaining, Karyl showed up  
acting strangely and attacked you with knights and monsters,  
so you've found yourself in a life-or-death crisis...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hmmm.  
And you were even prevented from escaping with Spatial Leap...  
It sounds like the enemy is taking you more seriously than ever before.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I think they must have even noticed my presence giving you advice,  
and actively blocked me from doing anything to help.  
  
**Ameth：**  
They totally played us for fools.  
Looks like they're trying to take you out, no matter what it takes.  
  
**Ameth：**  
We're lucky that you even made it out of there alive,  
but from here on out, things are only going to get more difficult.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hmm...  
It looks like Pecorine, sadly enough,  
has been captured by the enemy.  
  
**Ameth：**  
They were trying to take her alive,  
so I don't think she'll be killed right away...  
But we should assume the worst.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Thanks to little Muimi and the others,  
it looks like the rest of you escaped to safety...  
But your enemies aren't going to just give up the chase.  
  
**Ameth：**  
For the moment, I guess it's goodbye to your peaceful life.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Still, you mustn't give up hope.  
Our enemy... Eustiana, or Mana Senri, isn't a god either.  
Her magic and resources are by no means unlimited.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Lay low for the moment, and find an opportunity to strike back.  
That's all the advice I can give right now...  
I'm sorry, {player}.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm so weak... I couldn't protect you...  
I feel horribly ashamed of myself.  
  
**Ameth：**  
...But no. This isn't the time to wallow in misery.  
I'll just do whatever is in my power.  
I swear I'll find a way to come to your aid.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So please...  
Don't give up either. Just do your best.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Don't let them beat you.  
And try to remember I'm always on your side.
