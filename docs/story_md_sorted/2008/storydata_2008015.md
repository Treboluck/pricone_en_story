## Subtitle: The One Thing I Can't Accept
  
**Christina：**  
The chaos continues to spread...  
  
**Christina：**  
Our situation is only becoming worse.  
I have no dislike for turmoil and disorder,  
but if we do not establish a clear course of action soon, we're done for.  
  
**Christina：**  
The biggest problem is Tiana's blind charge at the enemy.  
She is a fine rival. I would hate to lose her to a careless blunder.  
  
**Christina：**  
Princess Tiana!  
If you are royalty, lend an ear to your subjects once in a while!  
Cease your foolhardy struggle and return to our side!  
  
**Christina：**  
Together, we can still overcome this trial!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It makes me happy to hear you use my real name...  
But I'm sorry, I can't turn back now!  
This is my own decision! I won't drag you down with me!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If worst comes to worst,  
leave me behind and make your escape without me!  
  
**Octo：**  
Wow,  
 very bold and dashing.  
But you could probably use a little more caution.  
  
**Octo：**  
Knights of Nightmare, slice her up a little and pin her to the ground!  
Her Majesty wants that one alive, so try not to kill her, mm?  
  
**Christina：**  
...Hmm?  
Tell me, boy. Why are you ordering the royal knights around?  
  
**Christina：**  
I recognize some of their number as my own former subordinates...  
What glamor did you enchant them with?  
  
**Octo：**  
Well, ah... I used authority, not magic.  
  
**Octo：**  
After you were thrown behind bars, you see,  
Nightmare needed someone to fill your old station.  
And who else to take the fall but little old me?  
  
**Octo：**  
I have a duty to my noble blood, so I couldn't turn down the offer...  
Well, I'm basically cleaning up the mess that you left behind,  
so you could try showing a little gratitude.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hah! So you of all people are the new vice-captain  
of Nightmare? That's quite the promotion!  
I'm terribly proud of you, my dear little Octo!  
  
**Octo：**  
Well, thanks!  
Maybe you could show your gratitude  
by coming along quietly for once in your life.  
  
**Octo：**  
I get the impression Her Majesty was always quite fond of you...  
If you hand over your new Labyrinth pals as a gift,  
she might even overlook your jailbreaking antics!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hah! I wouldn't dream of it!  
What kind of buffoon would happily serve a woman  
who tried to take her life?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Save your breath, boy!  
Any more, and I'll be tempted to slit your pretty throat!  
  
**Octo：**  
Yes, yes, I'll shut up now.  
To be quite honest, this nasty little job  
is the last thing I want to be doing.  
  
**Octo：**  
Just so you know, I'm not feeling terribly motivated.  
But as a new employee, I can't really talk back to my boss.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Octo... Are you really OK with this? Bowing down  
to the whims of authority?! A villain only answers to  
his own desires or a trusty partner, isn't that right?!  
  
**Octo：**  
...What would you know about my values, little Muimi?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Waaaahhh! Help me, mister!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Mister {player}! I'm scared!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
{player}...  
You really braved all of that danger to save us.  
I'm a little impressed.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
B-but I'm quite all right.  
Please help Mimi and Misogi—  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hug her.  
`Tag 1`

**Kyoka：**  
Waaahhh! What do you think you're doing?!  
P-put me down at once!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Masterfully done, my lord!  
Now quickly, bring those girls over here!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah!  
Make it quick, {player}!  
I've carved a little hole in the enemy ranks! Follow me!  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Look! It seems our foes' formation is centered around  
that girl named Karyl. The farther from her we get,  
the less danger we will be in. Let us run in the opposite direction.

**Christina：**  
...Come to think of it, Karyl does have the power to control monsters.  
If we retreat to a distance where her influence is weaker,  
the monsters, at least, will be easier to deal with.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wh-what do you mean by that?  
I do not recall Miss Karyl demonstrating any abilities of that nature...  
  
**Christina：**  
Then she didn't want you to know, did she?  
I don't know all the details myself,  
but that girl's circumstances are far from simple.  
  
**Daigo：**  
All right! I've taken down every monster that's in reach of us!  
That's how it's DONE!  
  
**Masaki：**  
This is our chance!  
Miss Pecorine, return to our side!  
The time is ripe to make our escape!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm sorry!  
I'm so close now... I have to reach Karyl!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I admit I am surprised that you managed to reach me.  
But I am Her Majesty's representative.  
You would do well not to underestimate me.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Die where you stand, outlaw!  
My magic will reduce your very bones to ash!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Nghh...?!  
Karyl! I'm begging you, come back to your senses!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ugh... Dodging my spell at this range?!  
But even you can't keep that up forever!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh... I cannot believe my eyes.  
This is the worst of all possible outcomes...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine...  
After an attack like that at point-blank range,  
she must have suffered terrible injuries!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please, let her still be alive...  
Ahhh, we must rescue her quickly!  
  
**Christina：**  
All of you!  
We're out of time! I'm sorry, but you'll have to give up on Tiana!  
It's our own lives on the line now! Follow me!  
  
**Christina：**  
Waste another second, and they'll wipe us all out!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But...  
But look... Miss Pecorine is...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Too bad for you.  
I don't know what you were assuming,  
but this mask is nothing more than a magic amplifier.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Even without its support,  
I have enough magic of my own to unleash a simple attack spell.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Target insurgent secured.  
Restrain her and transport her to the palace dungeons.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Now apprehend the remaining targets.  
Not one of you will escape, foolish traitors to the throne!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahhh, Your Majesty...  
I'll purge this world of filth, exterminate all of these vermin,  
and see that your authority is made absolute!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Please allow me to use my life to make your ideals a reality!  
  
**Karyl：**  
And in your grace, allow me to live as a blessed citizen  
in the kingdom you will build on this soil.  
That's all I can ask for. Everything I was born to do!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Haha... Hahaha... Ahahahahahah...! ♪
