**Daigo：**  
Huaaarrrghh!

**Christina：**  
Ahahah!  
You're a rough fellow all over!  
Try to strike with a little more finesse!  
  
**Christina：**  
With your muscles, I'm sure you can take down most foes  
with a single punch, but that's no use if you can't land it!  
  
**Christina：**  
Come on, try to use your head!  
Your brain isn't made of muscle, is it?  
Try a little harder to entertain me, you big, dumb lunk!  
  
**Daigo：**  
Gahhh, you piss me off!  
Today's the day I'm gonna put a dent in that smug face of yours!  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh? How cruel...  
Daigo, you'd punch a girl in the face?  
  
**Daigo：**  
Ehhhh?! I mean, this is combat practice!  
You're the one who told me not to hold back!  
And heck, it's a bit of a stretch calling you a \"girl\"!  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh, you'll regret those words.  
Time to die.  
  
**Daigo：**  
Whoaaaa?!  
Don't swing that sword around! I'm unarmed here, see?!  
That thing really could murder someone!  
  
**Christina：**  
Don't you worry, big boy!  
I'm just going to slice that impudent tongue clean out of your mouth!  
Ahahahahahah! ☆

**Muimi：**  
Hey...  
You might want to settle down a bit, you two.  
  
**Muimi：**  
This Labyrinth base of ours  
was created using that mysterious  
\"object manipulation\" ability that Labyrista uses...  
  
**Muimi：**  
But right now, she's out for the count, so we can't repair any damage.  
There's no telling when that ability of hers might wear off  
and bring this whole place crashing down around us, either.  
  
**Christina：**  
Well, well.  
Good morning, Muimi!  
  
**Daigo：**  
She ain't Muimi, she's Novem!  
Didn't she already ask you to use her proper name?!  
  
**Daigo：**  
Quit doing stuff just 'cause it pisses people off!  
You're not gonna make any friends that way.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hahah! There's no changing the personality I was born with, I'm afraid.  
But I suppose that was a little impolite of me.  
My apologies... Novem!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Oh, I don't really mind.  
I'm used to it now.  
Besides, it's true that \"Muimi\" is actually my real name.  
  
**Muimi：**  
It's just... it doesn't bring back the best memories...  
And it sounds like I'm \"meaningless,\" which doesn't sit well,  
so I prefer being called Novem, that's all.  
  
**Muimi：**  
At any rate, you two, it's almost time for breakfast,  
so you oughtta finish up and head to the cafeteria.  
I'll head over once I've introduced these two to Labyrista.  
  
**Daigo：**  
Ooh, breakfast? That sounds great!  
This old lady's deadly training gauntlet has left me totally starved!  
  
**Christina：**  
What did you just call me? Say those words one more time,  
and it'll be your head we're serving for breakfast.  
Have a little more respect for your elders, brute.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Ahahah.  
Y'know, I'm actually kinda relieved to see you two getting along.  
It's like I thought—you're both good guys at heart.  
  
**Christina：**  
What would you know about my heart?  
  
**Christina：**  
But ah well... You rescued me from that dingy cell,  
and even brought me to this safe new home. For the moment,  
I'll show a little deference out of gratitude for all your help.  
  
**Christina：**  
After all, with this big brute around to toy with,  
I have enough to keep myself amused.  
  
**Daigo：**  
Ehhh?  
I didn't come here to be turned into your plaything.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Heheh. Not that I mind, but it'd be great if you could do your  
training somewhere else. Labyrista's asleep just through here.  
We wouldn't want anyone accidentally harming her.  
  
**Christina：**  
I hear excessive sleep kills off brain cells,  
so I was actually hoping I could wake her up with the commotion.  
Besides, in this tiny hideout, there aren't many other places to train.  
  
**Daigo：**  
And we're under orders not to go outside, too.  
Ah man, I thought my days in that stuffy old dungeon were over.  
But here I am, stuck in another hole in the ground.  
  
**Christina：**  
Well, I expect the two of us have been put on all the wanted lists,  
with jailbreaking added to our list of crimes.  
Best to lay low awhile, at least until they give up on the chase.  
  
**Christina：**  
Let's accept the hand we've been dealt  
and do our best to enjoy it, big boy!  
  
**Daigo：**  
Yeah, yeah.  
Wish I could enjoy life as much as you do.  
Seriously, I mean that.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Heheh. It feels kinda weird, seeing these two together.  
And then there's Rajraj and Labyrista living under the same roof too...  
I could never have imagined this in the old days.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Ah well, whatever.  
You two, come with me.  
I'll introduce you to Labyrista like I said.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Go along with her.  
**Choice: (2)**  Stay right where you are.  
`Tag 1`  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah, right this way!  
Thanks to Christina's so-called \"training exercises,\"  
there's rubble all over the floor, so watch where you step, okay?  
  
**Muimi：**  
You're an important piece of this puzzle,  
so we can't have you getting injured.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Muimi：**  
Huh? Why're you being all rebellious?  
Going through a phase?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Well, I guess we were enemies, once upon a time.  
Even without your memories, you might still be wary of me  
on some deeper level.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hm? That's not it?  
Christina's training was such a crazy sight,  
you're too shocked to move right now?  
  
**Muimi：**  
You can't let yourself get spooked that easily.  
Those two were just messing around, after all.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Are you really gonna be all right?  
You're worrying me now.  
Pull yourself together, Mr. Hero.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ehmm... The name has come up a number of times now,  
but who exactly is this Labyrista? I don't recall seeing her  
around anywhere when we arrived last night, either.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Ahh... Well, she's the leader of our secret society.  
I'm sure she'll prove to be pretty important for you guys too,  
so you should at least learn her face.  
  
**Muimi：**  
To be honest, I'm not sure how much of \"Akira\" is really in there...  
Hard to tell just how much of the old world she remembers,  
or what she's really trying to achieve here...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
\"Akira\"...?  
That's a name I remember seeing before.  
Isn't she one of the Seven Crowns?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Ohhh...?  
So you already learned about the Seven Crowns too, did you?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Well, here in this world, they are a big deal, after all.  
There's no way you could just ignore them.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Ah, whatever. Like I mentioned, Labyrista isn't conscious right now,  
so you won't be able to talk. Let's just take a look at her face,  
then go eat breakfast.  
  
**Muimi：**  
As for the details, I'll fill you in on all that later.
