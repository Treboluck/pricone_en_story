**Pecorine：**  
Thanks for the meal! ☆  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, it was my pleasure!  
Nothing makes me happier than seeing everyone enjoy my food!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm totally stuffed.  
**Choice: (2)**  It was delicious, Big Sis!  
`Tag 1`  
**Shizuru：**  
Yes, you certainly did eat a lot!  
You're a growing lad, after all!  
You need plenty of nutrition to grow into a real gentleman!

`Tag 2`  
**Shizuru：**  
Uwaaaaahhh...?!  
Y-you totally made me squeal! Don't surprise me like that!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But thank you so much, {player}!  
As long as you're happy to have me,  
I'll always be the world's greatest big sister, just for you! ☆  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rino：**  
Hey, guys!  
 We're going to wash the dishes now,  
so can you pass them all over here?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, that's so nice of you! You're waiting on us like royalty!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhh boy... I've had my fill and then some!  
The after-dinner tea was great too!  
 Life is good! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed.  
But if I may ask out of curiosity,  
where did you obtain all of the ingredients?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We are located far from the city,  
so I imagine obtaining supplies would be quite a challenge...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Rajraj always uses his Spatial Leap to drop us off right near the city.  
Who needs to use a carriage when you can jump straight there?  
Honestly, it's really convenient.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Haha.  
I am glad I could be of assistance.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm... That convenience is probably why  
the palace has been monopolizing teleportation magic  
and restricting its use by the general public.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If you used it for conflict, it could provide a huge military advantage...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah. You could send your elite forces behind enemy lines in an instant.  
Or even sneak into bank vaults and steal whatever you please.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Well, there are other forms of magic that can obstruct teleportation,  
or trap people when they try to intrude, so it's not completely foolproof.  
  
**Masaki：**  
Yes... Which is why rescuing Mistress Neneka from the royal palace  
will be challenging even with our advantage.  
Ah, so deeply frustrating... However should we proceed?  
  
**Rajraj：**  
I am terribly sorry I cannot be of more assistance.  
  
**Masaki：**  
No need for apologies, my dear Rajraj.  
  
**Masaki：**  
It is I who failed to keep our attackers at bay,  
and could do nothing to prevent them from taking my mistress.  
Ah, I am so ashamed of my ineptitude!  
  
**Christina：**  
Tell me, though, what *is* our plan?  
It seems highly likely that this Neneka girl is imprisoned in the same  
underground prison where the two of us were once held.  
  
**Christina：**  
A high-security facility designed to hold enemies of the state.  
It will not be easy to penetrate its walls.  
Even I could see no way to escape of my own accord.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah. I've been working on some ideas, so don't worry.  
It'd be a lot easier if Labyrista could wake up and help out...  
But I guess we can't ask her to do everything.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Still, we do have Christina and Rajraj,  
who are members of the Seven Crowns just like Labyrista.  
Nothing's impossible in this world, so let's try to keep our hope alive!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ehm... Could you perhaps elaborate a little  
on the nature of these \"Seven Crowns\"?  
Somehow, I find myself overcome with curiosity on the subject.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
For some reason, my own father's name  
was listed among their number  
in some ancient documents, after all.  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh, is that right?  
Hmmm... I did sense before that there was something unique about you.  
So that's why.  
  
**Christina：**  
Your father is a special individual like myself...  
Very intriguing!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh...  
Please do not stare at me so intently...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Umm, Christina...  
Could I ask you not to scare our little Kokkoro?  
  
**Christina：**  
I must confess, I was hoping her fear might spur her to make  
an attempt on my life.  
 Though of course, I would be just  
as thrilled to cross blades with you again... Princess Tiana!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ummm... I've been wondering this since we first met,  
but why is it that you seem to know my real name?  
Even in the palace, not even my family remembered who I was...  
  
**Christina：**  
I was told by Her Majesty.  
Hmph... Though after her attempt on my life,  
I suppose I should stop addressing her with such terms of respect.  
  
**Christina：**  
Let me rephrase that.  
I was told of your existence by the despicable Eustiana.  
  
**Christina：**  
That pitiful wench who fancies herself a princess, of all things,  
and has taken the name of Eustiana for herself.  
  
**Christina：**  
She requested that I eradicate your bothersome existence,  
which is how we found ourselves at odds the other day.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Um, you do know she's only an impostor,  
and I'm the real Eustiana, right?  
  
**Christina：**  
Well, yes.  
I had already presumed as much.  
  
**Christina：**  
I can only assume she sent me after you  
to eliminate the \"original\" whose place she had stolen.  
Though her deeper intentions are less than clear.  
  
**Christina：**  
Her sheer ambition seemed boundless. I do not doubt  
she will stop at nothing to protect her false claim to the throne.  
To be quite frank, I found that ruthlessness most appealing.  
  
**Christina：**  
But I do not care for her enough to remain blithely loyal  
in the face of betrayal. Though I am not so simple-minded  
that I can easily turn my sentiments to outright loathing, either.  
  
**Daigo：**  
Old lady...  
I don't really get it, but cheer up, OK?  
This ain't like you at all.  
  
**Christina：**  
How many times must you make me reiterate  
that I am no \"old lady\"? Do you have a death wish?  
  
**Christina：**  
Still, your kind concerns are noted.  
Thank you, big boy.  
  
**Christina：**  
At any rate, it seems painfully clear  
that this world is plagued by a terrible conspiracy.  
  
**Christina：**  
It would stain my pride and dignity to be led blindly to my doom,  
so I would like to learn as much as possible.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Right. That's why I brought us all here  
to share whatever information we've learned.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I haven't explained this properly  
even to the likes of Christina, Daigo, Rajraj and Masaki yet,  
but it's about time I came fully clean about our situation.  
  
**Muimi：**  
The things I'm about to tell you will probably seem  
pretty difficult to believe at first. I can't rule out the possibility  
that I'm wrong on some of the details, either.  
  
**Muimi：**  
But for starters, I'd like you all to listen and consider what I have to say.  
Once you do, we can all start thinking properly about what we're  
gonna do with our lives in this cruel and twisted world.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Right now, this world is stained by the touch of a malicious power.  
  
**Muimi：**  
If we just accept it, it's not going to lead us to any happy endings.  
In the worst case, we could lose everything, and find our lives snuffed out in despair.
