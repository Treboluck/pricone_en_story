## Subtitle: Suddenly Surrounded
  
**Rajraj：**  
I have returned from my reconnaissance.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Rajraj!  
You were gone for a while—did something happen?  
Did things look bad outside?  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Indeed.  
This is an emergency, Novem.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Just outside of the Labyrinth hideout,  
dangerous monsters are roaming in great number.  
Along with an armed force that looks like knights from Nightmare.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
It seems we find ourselves entirely surrounded by hostile forces.  
They outnumber us many times over.  
Unless we retreat with the greatest haste, we will surely be annihilated.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Monsters and an army? You've gotta be kidding!  
I knew we wouldn't be able to hide out here forever,  
but I didn't think they'd find us this soon.  
  
**Muimi：**  
If those knights really are from Nightmare,  
that means it's the royal palace we're up against.  
They really don't give up easily, do they?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Did they come for the fugitives we broke out of jail?  
Or to take down Labyrinth for opposing the government?  
Whichever it is, we're way past the point where talking'll solve anything.  
  
**Muimi：**  
But it's not like we weren't prepared for this.  
Let's pack up our things and get outta here.  
  
**Muimi：**  
{player}, you guys should come too.  
We'll have to finish our talk another time.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Got it.  
**Choice: (2)**  I wish we could've talked for longer.  
`Tag 1`  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah, I'm glad you're so easy to deal with these days.  
Before you lost your memories, you were more of a rebellious type.  
Though of course, it didn't help that we were enemies too.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah... I'd've liked to talk more, too.  
Sorry I wound up just dumping all this on you at once  
without giving you any chance to sit and think things over.  
  
**Muimi：**  
It'd be great if our enemies were the type who'd wait around  
till we'd talked to our hearts' content,  
like the villains from some story for kids...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Aw, man. These peaceful moments never seem to last!  
There might be fighting ahead of us, so let's do a few quick stretches.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ehm... Can we not escape by using Mr. Rajraj's Spatial Leap ability?  
It would seem like the most simple solution,  
unless there is some problem?  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Sadly, there is indeed a problem.  
I must apologize.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
It seems that this entire area around us has been covered  
in a web of magical traps... When I ventured outside to investigate,  
I sustained some rather serious damage.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Not so serious as to endanger my life,  
but another leap is beyond me for now.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Urgh... I guess they were bound to figure it out sooner or later.  
Rajraj's ability is so handy, we might've relied on it a little bit *too* much.  
  
**Muimi：**  
But Rajraj is one of the Seven Crowns. He's seriously special.  
They'll never be able to neutralize his powers completely.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Let's give him a chance to heal up  
while we break through the enemy lines and get to safety.  
  
**Muimi：**  
We find a spot where he can use his ability, then all leap from there  
to another Labyrinth hideout. That oughtta do it.  
  
**Daigo：**  
Whoa, whoa, what's all this now?  
I ain't a big fan of running like a coward.  
  
**Daigo：**  
If the enemy's not too strong, isn't there a chance  
we can take 'em all out? They're gonna keep chasing us  
wherever we go, so better to kick their asses now!  
  
**Rajraj：**  
That would be most difficult.  
We are vastly outnumbered,  
and they have even brought monsters the size of buildings.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
All the evidence, including how efficiently they sealed my ability,  
seems to suggest that they have taken care to bring sufficient forces  
to overwhelm us.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
It would be foolish to face them head-on.  
I cannot recommend it.  
  
**Muimi：**  
And we've got guests to protect, too.  
We don't wanna fight if we can avoid it.  
Running isn't pretty, but retreat is our best option right now.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I hope you can understand that, Daigo.  
  
**Daigo：**  
Geez, all right, all right...  
But if we're hightailin' it outta here, we've gotta take  
Labyrista too, right? I'll head over to her room and grab her!  
  
**Christina：**  
I should think so. Labyrista is this guild's cornerstone;  
a piece we cannot afford to lose.  
  
**Christina：**  
...And though I am not sure why,  
the thought of her being killed or injured  
displeases me personally, as well.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Ahaha.  
You two did seem like pretty good friends back in the old world.  
Maybe your memories aren't completely gone after all.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm. I'm afraid all this talk of another life  
still doesn't feel quite real.  
  
**Christina：**  
But no matter.  
We've talked enough. Let's make our escape.  
  
**Christina：**  
Rajraj, or whatever they call you—can you walk?  
If you're really struggling, I suppose I could carry you in my arms!  
  
**Rajraj：**  
No need for that.  
Ordinary movement is quite within my power.  
  
**Masaki：**  
Urgh. It pains me deeply to turn tail and flee  
from the very foes who snatched Mistress Neneka away,  
but alas, 'twould be a still greater folly to throw my life at their feet.  
  
**Masaki：**  
I cannot afford to die today.  
Until such time as Mistress Neneka is safe,  
I must bear my shame and live on.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Everyone, are you all ready to leave?  
We've got a secret escape route just over here,  
so let your big sis lead the way!  
  
**Rino：**  
Right through here! C'mon, quickly!  
If we're quicker, we'll move like butter!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Um... do you mean \"the quicker we move the better\"?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
All righty!  
Let's get ourselves to safety, {player}!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Yeah, let's hurry.  
`Tag 4`  
**Pecorine：**  
Right! Kokkoro, it would be great if you could stay behind me.  
I'll shield you from harm with my own body if I have to!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm not about to lose the precious friends  
I finally found after I thought I'd lost everything!
