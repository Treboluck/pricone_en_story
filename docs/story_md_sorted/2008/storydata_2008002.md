## Subtitle: A Sisterly Reunion
  
### Place: Labyrinth Hideout
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah...!  
A good morning to you, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Whyever did you awaken with such a sudden jolt?  
Did you have some kind of terrible nightmare, perhaps?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I felt like someone called my name...  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm...  
I did not hear any such thing, myself.  
Perhaps you were still half-asleep, my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh.  
Whatever would you do without me?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
More to the point, ah... Ahem.

**Kokkoro：**  
Young ladies of Labyrinth,  
my lord appears to be in some discomfort,  
so if possible, I would like you to extract yourselves from his bed.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I don't think I can!  
I haven't seen {player} in way too long!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
{player}! {player}!  
I've been dying to see you!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Every day I can't see my li'l bro's face, can't hug you tight,  
my poor heart almost explodes with pain!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But now! Despite all that stood in our way!  
Finally, the two of us are joined together!  
This is our happy ending, eheheheheheh...  
  
**Rino：**  
Stop talking like a crazy person  
and actually get out of the bed now, okay?  
Honestly, I can't take the prize off you for second place!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
That's \"can't take my eyes off you for a second,\" Rino!  
  
**Rino：**  
Really, though.  
It doesn't look like Big Bro's memories  
have come back at all yet.  
  
**Rino：**  
Who knows what'll happen if you throw yourself all over him?  
It might make his head explode!  
  
**Rino：**  
This whole time I've been dying to throw myself at Big Bro,  
but I've held myself back...  
 So you can do the same, Sis!

**Shizuru：**  
Aaaahhh! Don't tear me apart from my {player}!  
You bully!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
{player} and his big sis will never be apart!  
We're joined by bonds of blood that can never be broken!  
  
**Rino：**  
You're not related to him any more than I am, Sis...  
And with our guildmaster unconscious, we can't deal with any  
emergencies, so it really is high time you controlled yourself.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Urghh...  
But I was so lonely...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
While he was having fun with dozens of other girls,  
I was stuck doing mountains of office work and dying of stress...  
  
**Rino：**  
And I'm telling you, so was I!  
Labyrinth *is* supposed to be a secret society, after all.  
  
**Rino：**  
When you've got to keep things secret,  
of course you're going to end up  
doing lots of boring work in the background.  
  
**Rino：**  
But at any rate, I'm just glad everyone's okay!  
This hideout should be a pretty safe place to stay,  
so you can kick back and relax a little.  
  
**Rino：**  
C'mon, Big Sis. I'm sure the others will be waking up soon,  
so we ought to go make some breakfast.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Urgh... All right, fine!  
 This is only the beginning of our exciting  
life under the same roof! There'll be plenty more opportunities!  
Big Sis just needs to think positive!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You just wait, {player}!  
I'll soon make you appreciate your big sister's affection!  
You'll see that life without a big sister isn't really living at all!  
  
**Rino：**  
Yes, yes. Stop blabbering and get a move on.  
...  
Well then,  
 we'll see you two in a bit!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Hmm. I do not know what to make of them,  
but they were certainly a rowdy pair.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  They're not bad girls, really.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Of course. When it comes to Labyrinth, they did not leave the  
most favorable first impression...  
 They attacked us all of a sudden,  
so I could not help but see them as a dangerous group.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But now I see you are well acquainted with their members...  
Even treating one another as siblings...  
I have to admit, they do not seem like bad people.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Of course, we should not let our guard down entirely.  
Their true nature is still a mystery, after all.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  ...  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh.  
What is it now, my lord?  
Your face still seems unusually blank.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Could it be you are struggling to recall our situation?  
If so, I will be happy to jog your memory.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yesterday, in order to meet Neneka, one of the Seven Crowns,  
we made an attempt to visit her hidden laboratory underground.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But alas, the laboratory exploded, leaving our efforts wasted.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In the process, we had the good fortune of running into Miss Muimi,  
who brought us to a Labyrinth base to rest for the moment.  
You remember up to this point, I hope?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As a secret society, Labyrinth does not have the largest of hideouts.  
It would be awkward for too many of us to intrude, so Miss Shinobu  
and her friends chose to go elsewhere for the time being.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Perhaps that is for the best.  
It would pain me to trouble them more than necessary  
with the problems we face.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And they for their part seemed keen to perform a more  
thorough investigation of the destroyed laboratory.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
They were kind enough to say that we should stay in touch  
and continue to share information.  
Eerie though they may be, I must admit they are fine folk.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Their guild name does sound villainous, though.  
**Choice: (5)**  I hope we can hang out again soon!  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh... What's that? \"Diabolos\"? I did not realize Shinobu and  
the others belonged to such an ominous-sounding guild.  
I must apologize for my ignorance.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Still, for a group calling themselves demons,  
they are remarkably agreeable and friendly people.  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed. Though I would hesitate to refer to  
our escapades yesterday as merely \"hanging out\"...  
It is true that spending time with them raised my spirits somewhat.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It would please me greatly to forge a friendly relationship  
and support one another as fellow inhabitants of this world.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Muimi：**  
Hey!, {player} you awake?  
We've got a lot of stuff to talk about,  
so come on over to the cafeteria!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Wait, huh?  
You two sleep in the same bed?  
You sure are close.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, no...  
My lord's slumber showed no sign of ending,  
so I was helping to jog him awake.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We are not such ill-mannered guests  
as to behave inappropriately in another's residence.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Is it that big a deal? I don't think anyone'd mind.  
Long as you're not doing anything nasty, it's your own business!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Anyway, let's head to the cafeteria.  
We've got talking to do.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Actually, there's still time before breakfast's served,  
so I'll introduce you to Labyrista on the way there.  
Well, not that you'll be able to talk, since she's asleep and all.
