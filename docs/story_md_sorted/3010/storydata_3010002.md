As Nozomi and Chika train, Tsumugi offers support from the sidelines. Nozomi announces their debut performance, causing the shy Chika to panic. Tsumugi is busy with preparations while Nozomi readies her own surprise.
  
## Subtitle: It's Practice Time
  
**Narration：**  
On a day like any other, the members of Carmina  
gather outside the city to practice.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Okay, stop! Chika, you've gotta match my steps.  
We're a group, which means you're not the only one on stage.  
Imagine the chaos when we add proper choreography.  
  
**Chika：**  
I'm sorry.  
It's just, I've never danced in rhythm with anyone before...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You match movements with others in a battle, right?  
I'm sure this idol training will come in handy during a fight.  
  
**Chika：**  
You might be right.  
I never imagined we'd have to be so perfectly in sync.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Not only do we have to be in sync,  
but we've gotta sing our parts as well.  
How about we take a short break.  
Is that okay, Tsumugi?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
No problem.  
You've met your practice quota for now.  
Good job, both of you.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Thanks. Personally, I've still got plenty of energy.  
Oh yeah! While we're resting,  
I guess we should let Chika know.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Right. Especially now that everything's been decided.  
  
**Chika：**  
Let me know... what?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Well, you'll just have to see it for yourself ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Today, we have an important announcement for you, Chika!  
  
**Chika：**  
Huh? Uh, um...  
What kind of announcement?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ta-da! Take a look!  
This poster was just finished this morning!  
  
**Chika：**  
Let's see.  
\"Carmina—Debut Concert\"...?  
  
**Chika：**  
Concert?! We're gonna sing that song in front of an audience?  
I haven't heard anything about this!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Yeah.  
I mean, if we told you, we knew you'd be totally against it.  
Right, Tsumugi?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Right. That's why we've been secretly moving things along.  
Just to make sure,  
are you against performing  
on stage, Chika?  
  
**Chika：**  
Of course I am!  
My singing and my Song Summoning are meant for protecting,  
not for putting on a concert.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Why not use it to perform on top of protecting others?  
Don't you think entertaining people with music also has value?  
I mean, they're both about making everybody happy, right?  
  
**Chika：**  
Y-you might be right, but...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hold on,  
do you have stage fright?  
  
**Chika：**  
...I do.  
Am I really going to sing that song? In front of lots of people?  
I... I don't think I can...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Don't worry about it.  
I'll be singing with you.  
That's why we need to work on dancing in rhythm,  
so the two of us can sing together!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
By the way, there's no backing out now.  
We've already secured the venue and taken on a sponsor.  
On top of that, we've hired staff to operate the equipment.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
If we pull out now,  
it'll cause trouble for a lot of people.  
I mean, our sponsor is none other than Akino's guild!  
  
**Chika：**  
You've already done all of that?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It's all thanks to Tsumugi!  
She really managed to get things rolling!  
We lucked out and got ourselves an incredible manager!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
If we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it right.  
Besides, I'm the one making the costumes.  
So it's gotta be a show that brings out their full potential!  
  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Those fluttering skirts... I can't get enough of 'em!  
  
**Chika：**  
Miss Tsumugi's passion for clothes is something else.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Yeah, that's some real enthusiasm.  
Wish she could share the love and join in  
on the actual performance!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Wh-what the heck are you talking about?  
I only agreed to help out backstage.  
I'll leave the performing to the two of you.  
  
**Chika：**  
Umm. In that case, I'd also like to be backstage...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
No way! You're already billed as a performer on the poster!  
Don't bail on me now, Chika.  
You'll let all your practice go to waste.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I need to remember to switch out the poster  
with one that has Tsumugi's name on it too. ♪  
  
**Chika：**  
*sigh* Very well.  
It’d be wrong for me to go back on the promise I made  
when we formed our guild.  
I'll do the best I can.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Yay!  
That means our debut concert is official!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
All righty then, let the training begin!  
We'll start by running to improve our endurance!  
The three of us are gonna race to the peak of that mountain!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
What? Right now?  
And why am I included?  
I am *not* gonna be performing on that stage!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Even stagehands have gotta be in shape, right?  
So you're running with us! Ready, set,  
go!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Yeesss!  
Looks like I'm first!  
  
**Chika：**  
*huff huff*  
Miss Nozomi... You're not even...  
a little... out of...  
breath...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Is that all you've got, Chika?  
Being an idol is non-stop singing and dancing.  
How're you gonna survive that, if you're already outta breath?  
  
**Chika：**  
I'll do my best to overtake you on the way back.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Heheh! Now that's the spirit!  
Right then, let's get started.  
Ready, set, go!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
*huff puff*  
I've finally... made it...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Wait! You two are already heading back?  
Ho-hold on second... I need a break!  
  
**Chika：**  
*huff huff huff*  
How... was that?  
I won this time!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I can't believe I lost...  
Chika, you're not half bad!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Okay! Next, we're running all the way back into town!  
And, judging by how you look,  
this time I've got the advantage.  
  
**Chika：**  
We'll see about that.  
I've also put in my fair share of practice.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Right then, our training continues!  
Let's see who gets back to town first!  
  
**Chika：**  
Very well.  
Challenge accepted.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
*huff puff* F-finally, I've caught up...  
Wait... please... Just let me rest for a second...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
First across the finish line. ♪  
My heart was pounding when you almost  
caught up with me near the end.  
  
**Chika：**  
*huff* Oh,  
I was so close!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...  
  
**Chika：**  
Miss Tsumugi,  
are you angry at us?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Is it because we ran off and left you behind?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Since you two appear to have more than enough energy leftover,  
we might as well go over the choreography today.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
And, no, I'm not upset.  
Just super exhausted.  
Come on then, there aren't many days left until the concert.  
I'll give feedback as well, so let's see it from start to finish.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Um, okay.  
I've already come up with the choreography for the ending.  
Let me show you...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Right, that's it.  
This is what I've come up with so far.  
Chika, wanna give it a try?  
First, you go like this,  
do a quick spin,  
and then point towards the audience!  
  
**Chika：**  
Umm...  
Like... this?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Good! Really good!  
You know, Chika, you've got real talent as a dancer!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Hold on a second!  
Your moves just now did nothing to complement your costume!  
You need to dance in a way that lets your inner self shine!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Also, the next steps are coming up, so move with purpose.  
Focus on the tips of your fingers and extend them with grace!  
That alone will transform your appearance!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh, come *on*!  
Nozomi, your choreography alone just doesn't  
fully capture your potentials!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Uh, um...  
Miss Tsumugi?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Fine then, it looks like I'll have to step in!  
And I'll be making major revisions regarding the choreography!  
Understand, you two?  
  
**Chika：**  
I'm starting to think  
Miss Tsumugi is the one who's most enthusiastic about all of this.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ye-yeah.  
She's even giving me a run for my money.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh dear! I let myself get too worked up.  
N-no, you don't understand!  
This is all for the sake of the costumes...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Well, anyways,  
the three of us should discuss things  
and come up with the choreography together.  
  
**Chika：**  
All right.  
Miss Nozomi, whether it's singing or dancing...  
I won't lose to you!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hehehe.  
You really think you can beat  
an experienced idol like me?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Chika is a fast learner, so I'm sure your debut performance  
will be amazing.  
 I'm getting excited just thinking about it!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Even you look excited, Chika!  
  
**Chika：**  
M-me? \"Excited?\"  
Is it... showing on my face?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You looked positively ecstatic when we were racing back there!  
...All jokes aside, isn't this thrilling? Practicing together,  
coming up with ideas,  
and working towards the same goals?  
  
**Chika：**  
It is. I've spent all my time in battles up until now.  
But this, I...  
like it.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Heheh. Well, you better get ready then.  
'Cause when we get up on stage,  
things are gonna get even more exciting!  
  
**Narration：**  
Although confused by the unfamiliar feelings bubbling up within her,  
Chika experienced new and exciting levels of joy that day.
