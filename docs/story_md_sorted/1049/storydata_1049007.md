## Subtitle: A Sister's Duty
  
**Shizuru：**  
{player}!  
Yoohoo! It's me, your big sis!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Fancy meeting you here!  
Are you doing some shopping?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Wow, me too!  
Gosh, siblings really are a lot alike!  
We even do all the same things! Heehee! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yep...  
This is all a coincidence.  
We just happened upon each other, so it's fine.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I didn't mean to bump into him—  
it just happened!  
If anyone asks, that's what I'll say.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I know I've been told repeatedly  
that I'm supposed to keep away from him.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But I also know something else.  
And that's that every rule has a loophole or three!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
So I monitored {player}'s everyday activities...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
And I made sure I'd have little errands  
in the same places he likes to go.  
Just by coincidence, of course.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
If my boss ever gets mad at me,  
I can reasonably say it was all an accident.  
It's perfect, I say. Perfect!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I wasn't sure if he'd actually show up or not,  
but luck was on my side today.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Obviously, I'm not gonna go crazy out here.  
I just wanted to see him, maybe get a little chat in,  
and be on my way.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Because we really don't know what might happen  
if someone accidentally sets him off.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Even Rino is doing a good job of being patient  
and staying away.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
So I do feel a little bad about  
going behind her back on this one.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hm?  
Oh, sorry.  
I was just lost in thought.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I know it's hard to believe,  
but I have stuff I worry about, too.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I know, you're still a kid and all.  
These kinds of things are hard to understand for you.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Do you wanna talk about it?  
**Choice: (2)**  What are you shopping for?  
`Tag 1`  
**Shizuru：**  
Awww, are you worried about me?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Thank you! You are such a sweetheart, {player}!  
Heehee. I'm so proud to call you my little brother.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But don't worry!  
I got to see you today,  
so my whole day is ultra happy now! ♪

`Tag 2`  
**Shizuru：**  
Yep. I finally found a nice place to live,  
so I've been living on my own for a while now.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
So I kinda need to buy some furniture, toiletries,  
and other necessities.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It does take a bit to find something nice at a decent price,  
so it's been kind of an ordeal.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Anytime I find something nice,  
I look at the price tag and balk.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But... if I just remember to take extra good care of them  
and fill my house with nice things, bit by bit...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I dunno, I just think it'd be really nice.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shizuru：**  
What about you?  
What are you shopping for?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Will you be okay on your own?  
Do you need me to stick around  
and give you advice?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
We-heh-hell. I'll have you know I do all my shopping  
around here, so I know a lot about every store.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You want me to show you around?  
It'll be just like old times.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
When we were little,  
I would always take you by the hand  
and show you around all sorts of places.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I know.  
You probably don't remember.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
And I know you're a boy,  
so you never were the biggest fan  
of shopping and stuff like that.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But you never complained.  
You just came along regardless.  
It made me happy. So, so happy.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You bought me a ring back then.  
It was a really cheap, toy ring.  
But I still have it, and I treasure it even now.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Even after I moved,  
I couldn't bear to part with it.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I-I'm sorry.  
I don't know why I'm crying all of a sudden.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Heehee.  
Some dust must've gotten in my eye or something.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I'm okay. You don't need to worry about me.  
Your big sister is super strong.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I have to be, or I couldn't protect my sweet,  
sensitive little brother.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Whoa!  
Why are you hugging me?  
You big ol' softy. ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You don't know why either?  
Well, it's okay with me because I'm your sister,  
but you can't go around hugging girls on a whim, got it?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Whoa there.  
That was a close one!  
I almost headbutted you.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It's a habit of mine.  
I'm always resorting to violence.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
That's why one day,  
my parents got mad and yelled at me  
not to lay a finger on the other kids again.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
So naturally, I went with headbutting instead.  
I mean, I wasn't laying a finger on them anymore, right?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Honestly, I could be such a brat back then.  
All the while, I'd pretend I was the wise  
and all-knowing big sister.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Why couldn't I just open up? Why didn't I give up the facade  
and let myself cry? Maybe then, I could've gotten what I  
wanted...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I'm such an idiot.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Haha.  
Sorry. I'm just talking to myself.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
All right,  
I think your sister's gonna head home.  
I'm kinda feeling a little off.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Watch where you step, okay?  
Oh, and be careful not to get lost, either.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Haha. You think I'm worrying too much? That I shouldn't treat  
you like a kid?  
Look at you, talking back!  
It's so cute! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But listen. It's a big sister's job to worry about her brother  
and look after him.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
*giggle* If anything ever happens,  
you can call me any time.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
If you needed me,  
I'd crawl through the very depths of hell to...!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Actually, maybe that's too much.  
But no matter what, I'll always be by your side.
