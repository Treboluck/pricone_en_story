# Shizuru Episode 5
While looking for a place to live, Shizuru suggests that she and {player} live together. She daydreams about what their life would be like, when suddenly Kokkoro's name comes up, and Shizuru's over-protective side takes over.
  
## Subtitle: A Room for Two
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hmm... I'm really not seeing anything that looks good...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Not to mention,  
literally everything in Landosol costs a fortune.  
But it's the capital, so what did I expect?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Like, the price of land around the palace  
is enough to make your eyes pop.  
Even if I were renting, it doesn't sound doable.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
On the other hand, it'd be inconvenient  
to live far from the central district.  
I've heard it isn't safe these days, either.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Especially as a woman living alone.  
I reeeally don't want to think about it.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
And yet.  
I can't just laze about at my relatives' place  
forever now, can I?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I think they're starting to catch onto me  
and my work with Labyrinth.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
*sigh* Maybe I'll just ask my boss.  
She's got that crazy object manipulation skill.  
Maybe she can make me a house with it.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Just look at how hard I've been working!  
I think I deserve a little reward.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
...Hm? Oh,  
{player}!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hello hello! ☆  
Fancy running into you!  
What brings you here?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, let me guess.  
You sensed your sister was near,  
and were helplessly drawn to my side, right?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Looks like you and I  
are bound by the red string of fate!  
Just like I thought!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Not to worry!  
I love you too!  
More than anyone in the whoooole universe! ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Don't hug me so suddenly...  
**Choice: (2)**  Who might you be?  
`Tag 1`  
**Shizuru：**  
Heehee, no need to get all bashful on me!  
It's too cute!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I see how it is.  
You don't want your sis embarrassing you in public.  
I guess you are at that age!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It's fine, though. What's a little PDA between siblings?  
Squeeeze! ♪

`Tag 2`  
**Shizuru：**  
What?!  
Don't say that! Even as a joke, it's not funny!  
It's me! Your big sister, Shizuru!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh...  
Thank goodness. You remember me now?  
Ugh, you're such a tease!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
For a moment,  
I really thought you'd forgotten me again...  
The shock almost brought my heart to a stop!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shizuru：**  
Anyway, what are you doing here?  
Are you trying to find a realtor?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Right.  
This place will show you available apartments and houses  
in the area.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It's run by a guild that takes care of  
all the real estate in town.  
So if you need a new home, you come here.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
See, up until now,  
I've been living with some of my relatives.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I said I'd just be there until this job was over.  
But it looks like that won't be for a while.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I don't wanna be a burden on them,  
so I figured I'd get an apartment  
and give living on my own a try.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Buuut... My search for a good place  
isn't going so well.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hey, {player},  
where do you live?  
With your parents?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I see. Maybe I should move into your neighborhood.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
That way, I can come look after you every day!  
Heehee! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh? You're just going from hotel to hotel?  
Geez, that sounds awfully expensive...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Come to think of it,  
that makes sense, given your circumstances.  
You poor thing. Having no real home must be hard.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh... So you're looking for a cheap place  
where you might be able to settle down,  
and that's what brought you here. Am I right?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I see, I see. Veeery interesting! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
In that case...  
Why don't you and I find a place to share?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It'd cost half as much,  
and we'd get to live together, too!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Then every day, I could come wake you up  
and give you a taste of my home cooking,  
chock full of love!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
We're family, so it's only natural we'd live together!  
Oooh, it would be a dream come true! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
So hey, how about it?  
Let's pick out a place together!  
We'll look just like newlyweds!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, what about this place?  
It's too big for just one person,  
but perfect for the two of us!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It's small, but it has a yard,  
so we could even have a little vegetable garden!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
We can put the beds in here,  
and if you get lonely, you can come sleep in mine!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
This little room can be our storage room...  
And if you and I decide to consummate our love,  
we can turn it into a nursery, too.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh? Hey, what's wrong, {player}?  
Don't ignore me!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
C'mon,  
let's come up with more ideas  
for our perfect new life together!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
What? Kokkoro's calling for you, so you have to go?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
And just who might that be?  
I don't think I've met anyone by that name.  
You wanna introduce us?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Mmhmm. I'm a very reasonable sister,  
so I won't tell you who you can be friends with.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But, you know, as your sister,  
I'd at least like to say hello.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
What?  
This strange \"Kokkoro\" person  
is living in the hotel with you?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You're kidding, right?  
Explain this to me!  
This Kokkoro's a girl, isn't she?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You can't! To live in such sinful cohabitation...  
It's just indecent!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I won't allow it!  
I didn't raise you to be such a shameless degenerate!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hey, where are you going?  
Wait up!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I'm still talking to you!  
I'm sorry! Really, I am!  
Was I being too pushy?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I'm sorry, but still!  
I'm just trying to do what's best for you!
