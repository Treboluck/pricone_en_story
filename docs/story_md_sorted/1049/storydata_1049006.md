# Shizuru Episode 6
Shizuru's boss tells her to avoid contact with {player}. She knows it's for the best, but watching the town children play, she is reminded of the days when they were like a real family.
  
## Subtitle: The Way We Were
  
**Shizuru：**  
*sigh* I miss {player}...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But... my boss said  
I really do need to avoid  
casually interacting with him.  
And in no uncertain terms, either.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Who does she think she is?  
I'm really upset,  
but I don't have much of a choice but to listen.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It sounds like it isn't just amnesia now. There's something  
mysterious about him. Or so my boss says.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
If we disturb him in any way,  
we don't know what might happen.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
If I ever want to go back  
to being the happy family we were...  
I just have to put up with this.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I have to cut off contact  
and endure for however long it takes.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ugh, but I can't stand it...  
I'm getting {player} withdrawals...  
I'm seeing his face on every last passerby.  
  
**Boy：**  
Greeeen light...  
Red light!  
  
**Girl：**  
Haha!  
Heehee!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, looks like the neighborhood kids are out.  
Must be nice being a kid.  
They look so happy  
and carefree.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It reminds me  
of the way things used to be.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I think we were about the same age as those two.  
That was when {player} and I  
had our fateful meeting.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
He was living in my neighborhood, and...  
Oh, I remember it like it was yesterday!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
My parents were always so busy,  
so I was always all alone.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Being {player}'s big sister  
helped me deal with that loneliness.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
We really were just like brother and sister.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
No...  
We weren't just \"like\" siblings.  
Blood or no blood, he's family to me.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I really hoped that he felt the same way.  
I was so happy when I saw him again after all these years.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But right now, {player}...  
has forgotten everything.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
All because of some irregularity I barely even understand.  
It's not fair. Life can be so cruel.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
We aren't blood-related,  
so our memories were all we had to keep us together.  
And now they're all gone.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Even when he gets his memories back...  
It might turn out he really did just forget me  
because it's been so long.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Since he was so little, he might've just forgotten about that  
nice girl in his neighborhood.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But even then,  
as long as his memories haven't been stolen away,  
he might still be able to remember me.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
In fact,  
I could even befriend him again,  
and we could make even more memories than before.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But in this situation,  
I can't even do that...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Because even if we make new memories together,  
if {player} does get his memories back,  
they might overwrite his current memories.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I don't want to make friends  
only to be forgotten again...  
It's probably for the best that I stay away.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It'll just hurt even worse otherwise.  
The boss is right.  
I know she is.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hm? W-wait...  
{player}?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It's really you, isn't it?  
You're not another hallucination, right?  
Oh, I missed you so much!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Wait, wait, wait.  
I'm not supposed to see him!  
I need to stay away!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, but I'm so glad he's here!  
It's fine! I don't care if it hurts later!  
Right now, I'm so happy I could die! ☆  
  
**Shizuru：**  
{player}! *hic*  
It's been way too long! I've missed you sooo much!  
  
**Girl：**  
Oh!  
You just moved, Mister!  
  
**Boy：**  
Whatcha doin'?  
Oooh, is that pretty lady your girlfriend?  
You gonna KISS her? ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Um... Do you know these kids, {player}?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Actually,  
hold on,  
were you playing with them?  
  
**Girl：**  
He sure was!  
I don't think he does any work.  
He's just been wandering around all afternoon.  
  
**Girl：**  
So we invited him to come play with us!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
{player}...  
So you're playing with the neighborhood kids.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I guess that's amnesia for you.  
Even kiddie games like this must be new  
and exciting for you.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You wanna play too?  
**Choice: (2)**  You look sad. Are you okay?  
`Tag 1`  
**Shizuru：**  
No, I think I'm just a bit too old to enjoy  
Red Light, Green Light.  
I'm not a little kid anymore.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I think I'd rather play  
in a much more age-appropriate way.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You wanna know what I mean by that?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Uh... I don't think you're quite ready to hear about it.  
I'll, uh, tell you when you're older.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh?  
Omigosh... Omigosh!  
You're worried about me!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You must love your big sis so much!  
Oh, I love you too, {player}!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
...Yes, I'm okay.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
In my mind, as long as you're happy and healthy...  
then that's all I could ever ask for.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yeah. It's just selfish  
to want any more than that.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shizuru：**  
Heehee.  
Sorry. I know you guys were having fun,  
and I just barged in on you.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I've got some things I need to do,  
so I'm gonna go.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
After all, I'm not supposed to spend time with him.  
It hurts, but I just have to hold out.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh? W-what is it, {player}?  
Why are you grabbing my skirt like that?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You're worried I'm gonna go somewhere far away?  
Would that make you sad?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh dear...  
You can be so spoiled sometimes.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Okay. Then just for a bit...  
I guess we could play together!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I know you don't remember it.  
But this is just like when we were little.
