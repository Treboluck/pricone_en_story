**Shizuru：**  
*sigh*  
Well, this is depressing.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I don't feel like a member of a secret society at all.  
Like, I'm basically just a run-of-the-mill  
part-timer right now.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I go to work, get enough for my basic living expenses...  
and before I know it, the day's already over.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
And since I just moved here,  
things have been ridiculously hectic with my daytime act.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Maybe our boss knows how busy I've been,  
and that's why she's not giving me any real work?  
  
At least, I hope that's it...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I do wonder, does she really know what she's doing?  
She hasn't forgotten what Labyrinth's actual mission is, has she?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I just don't know...  
Maybe I should start taking the initiative  
and do some investigating of my own...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I mean, even just recently,  
when she holed herself up in her room working on something,  
 it turned out she was just making new crepe recipes.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It's like she has no drive at all.  
I mean, I suppose there's not much use being hasty...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But I just don't know what to do.  
Like, will this really bring me and my brother together again?  
She couldn't just be using me out of convenience, could she?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Even today, when she said she needed my help,  
I was so sure she meant it.  
So I dropped everything and came running.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But she just went,  
\"Watch over the crepe stand for me, would you?\"  
Not exactly what I'd call an important mission.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But I guess while Rino and I are looking after the stand,  
it frees her up to research the world's secrets...  
I think.  
I mean, she does generally bring us new info afterward.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I'll just hold out hope and be patient.  
Stress is bad for your health,  
so I've gotta take it easy.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hm?  
Why, hello there! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Wait, what?  
{player}!  
Thank you for stopping by our humble crepe stand, Labyrinth!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You are such a sight for sore eyes!  
You see, I was really starting to get down on myself there.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, you make me feel alive again!  
Just being around you is so good for my heart and soul!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Heehee.  
Sorry, I shouldn't have just hugged you like that.  
That wasn't appropriate, huh?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  
Oh yeah!  
That's right, I did give you a flyer for here, didn't I?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
So you came by to use up that coupon, did you?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ooh, I'm so glad I was working today!  
I might have missed you otherwise!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Now go on, order up!  
I'll make it extra special, just for you! ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  One crepe, please.  
**Choice: (2)**  One Shizuru, please.  
`Tag 1`  
**Shizuru：**  
Okay!  
 The boss is out right now,  
but I make a mean crepe too, so don't you worry!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Just hold tight for a bit.  
I'll make you the best crepe you've ever had!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
And as a special treat,  
you can have whatever toppings you want for free.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Our boss has some really bizarre fixations...  
To start with, she was all like, \"Red is the best!\"  
and wouldn't let us use anything but strawberry sauce.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But I worked hard to convince her,  
and now we have a huge variety of toppings!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You wanna just leave it up to me?  
 Okay!  
Then let's do chocolate, banana, vanilla ice cream, aaand...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Last but not least,  
the most important topping of all!  
One heaping helping of my love for you! ♪

`Tag 2`  
**Shizuru：**  
Sure thing,  
go ahead and take me!  
I'm all yours to gobble up! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Just kidding.  
Sadly, I'm not actually for sale.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I'd love it if you'd buy an actual crepe, though.  
We haven't had many customers,  
so we've got way more food than we know what to do with.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
And besides, why would you need to order me?  
I'm already yours.  
Your one and only adoring big sister!

**Shizuru：**  
Here you are.  
One crepe, just for you!  
Your big sister's extra special, sweet-as-honey crepe!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Heehee.  
You always did make any food you ate look delicious.  
Looks like that hasn't changed at all.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hm?  
Yeah...  
I'm sure right now, you don't remember any of that.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But I've been your big sis for a long, long time now.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I know, it probably sounds ridiculous to you.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You probably think I'm just some crazy lady.  
And this might scare you off.  
You might never want to see me again after this.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But I want to say it.  
No matter what happens...  
No matter if the world is destroyed or changed forever...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I will always be your big sister.  
That's one thing that will never, ever change.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
So please, just for me...  
Remember that, if nothing else.
