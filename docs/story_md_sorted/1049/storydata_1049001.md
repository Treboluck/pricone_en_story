**Shizuru：**  
Hmm... Oh geez,  
this isn't good.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Landosol is just so big and crowded...  
I have no idea where the heck anything is.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh no. I think I might be lost...  
My map must be outdated or something.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It barely has any street or building names on it,  
so it's no wonder I'm confused.  
Hmm... Oh...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I just moved here,  
so I barely know anyone.  
I don't really have anyone I can call to show me the way.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I guess I'm out of luck...  
I knew moving was gonna cost a lot,  
but it looks like I'll have to shell out for a new map too.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I mean, it would be a real pain to get lost every time I  
stepped out.  
I'll just call it insurance! Nobody can  
fault me for that. ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Now, let's see...  
Well, huh.  
Not a lot of shops around here, are there?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I must've hit a residential area.  
It certainly looks that way.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Man...  
I guess I'm stuck trying to find my way back to the  
shopping district, huh?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ooh, is that an information board over there?  
If so, I might be able to figure out where I am!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Now let's see here...  
Shoot...  
I don't see any maps here.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
These postings all look like requests for help.  
Maybe Landosol isn't very well organized?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Whoa!  
Sorry!  
I didn't mean to get in your way.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Wait... Wait, what?!  
No way...  
Is it really you, {player}?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I-It IS you!  
Oh my gosh,  
look at how big you've gotten!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, I'm so glad!  
And just look at your handsome little face!  
I can't believe it!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
So, do you remember me?  
Heehee.  
It's me—your big sister, Shizuru!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Who are you?  
**Choice: (2)**  My big sister?  
`Tag 1`  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh?  
W-wait.  
You really don't remember me?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Shizuru：**  
That's right!  
I'm your big sister!  
It's been so long, {player}!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hm? Hey, earth to {player}!  
You haven't forgotten who I am, have you?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, I see...  
So you have amnesia, then.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yeah, I did hear something about that.  
So you've forgotten nearly everything from your past, right?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Wow... It's a bit of a shock, seeing it first-hand...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hm? You want to know if I know you?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Of course I do!  
What kind of big sister would I be if I didn't?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
In fact,  
I know more about you than anyone in the world!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Everything from your favorite foods  
to the age you stopped wetting the bed! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
That's right!  
I'll fill you in on all sorts of things.  
Eheh! Your sister is here to help! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hmm... I know Rino and I agreed  
we wouldn't go behind each other's backs...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But what's the harm?  
I just happened to run into {player}, that's all.  
I wasn't going behind her back to meet him.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
In other words,  
us meeting here was basically destiny!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
The red string of fate, wrapped around our little fingers,  
brought us together because it was meant to be!  
I'm sure of it!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Heehee! We'll get so much talking in,  
and I'll really work my magic.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
That way, he'll have to remember  
all about his favorite sister! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, but... before I do that...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hey, so...  
Just wondering, but...  
Do you happen to know where we are?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
This isn't exactly my finest moment,  
but your big sister went and got herself lost!  
Heehee. ♪
