## Subtitle: Sisterly Love
  
**Shizuru：**  
{player}!  
Never thought I'd see you here! It's me, your favorite sister!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Squeeeze! *giggle* I caught you! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, you really came at a great time, too.  
I'm not letting you go today.  
You're gonna come play with me. Forever, and ever, and ever!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oooh! It's been so long since I felt you!  
And so long since I've smelled you!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, you make me feel alive again!  
Thank you, li'l bro!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I'm just so exhausted from everything I've had to do since  
I started my life here.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, I've been *so* busy lately.  
I mean, I just moved here,  
so there's so much to do.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I've got so much studying to get the licenses I need,  
and I've still gotta keep up with my guild work, too.  
Honestly, I can feel my hair getting grayer by the second.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
So thank you for letting me soak in these positive,  
happy {player} vibes for a bit.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
*giggle*  
Y'know, the old you would've been  
sooo embarrassed right about now.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
In fact, the fact that you're not resisting at all  
kinda makes me worry you don't like me anymore.  
Being a big sister can be so tough sometimes.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Anyway.  
What brings you here today?  
Just doing some shopping?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I see.  
So you're just out and about  
stocking up on your necessities again?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Well, how about I show you some nice, inexpensive shops?  
I'll even haggle for you, if you want.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Just let me take care of you, okay?  
After all, that's what us big sisters are for!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
...?! Uh, {player}?!  
You're glowing! What's happening to you?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh? What's going on?  
I've never seen anything like this!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Actually, I've never even *heard* of anything like this.  
Does that mean it's something my boss doesn't even know about?

**Shizuru：**  
Good morning, {player}!  
And what a beautiful morning it is! ☆  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Your favorite, ever-so-generous big sister  
is here to get you out of bed, sleepyhead!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
If you don't get your butt outta bed,  
you're gonna be late for...  
school! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
*giggle* Geez, you're really dead asleep, aren't you?  
It takes talent to sleep through all this noise I'm making.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You leave me no choice.  
I'll have to use force.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
One strike to the head,  
and you'll be awake as...  
ever! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But before I do that... *staaaaare...*  
I could gaze for hours at this adorable,  
helpless little face of yours.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Squee! Oh, you are just *so* cute! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I wish I could let you sleep a little longer...  
I wanna pamper the snot outta you...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But I mustn't!  
I must be strong and wake you up!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
After all, your parents are counting on me!  
They said, \"Oh, Shizuru, would you be a doll and come wake our  
precious {player} up while we're away?\"  
  
**Shizuru：**  
That's right. For the sake of being like a real big sister,  
I worked hard to get in your parents' good books!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
They really like me, you know.  
Enough to give me a copy of your house key. ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You have nowhere to run from me now,  
{player}... ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Eep! Don't just spring awake on me  
like that, {player}!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Owie... I had my face so close to yours,  
you slammed right into me when you brought your head up!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ooh, I've got a nosebleed...  
I'm so proud of you!  
You've grown enough to headbutt me back!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
*giggle*  
I guess you're even stronger than your sister now!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Good morning.  
**Choice: (2)**  Here's a tissue.  
`Tag 1`  
**Shizuru：**  
Yep! It sure is!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Heehee!  
Look at you!  
So polite, first thing in the morning!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Though, it feels weird having you be so formal with me...  
Are you feeling all right, {player}?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Uhhh, did you have a scary dream?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You poor baby...  
I know what'll cheer you up! A hug from your big sis!  
Squeeeze! ♪  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Shizuru：**  
Hm? Oh, a tissue for me?  
So I can clean up my nosebleed?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Well, thank you!  
You are just the sweetest little thing! ♪  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shizuru：**  
Heehee. Your parents told you  
I was coming to wake you up, right?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, thank goodness!  
Otherwise, it would totally look like  
I was breaking and entering, huh?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You'd've thought I was a real creep...  
Just a regular neighborhood predator!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I couldn't bear it if you hated me...  
I'd have nothing left to live for!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Right.  
Now let's get you all washed up  
and changed for school.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I'd help, but... you probably don't need that, huh?  
You're a big, strong, independent high schooler now.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
*giggle* Just look at how much you've matured.  
Kids just grow up so fast.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But it's for the best, really.  
All I really want is for you to grow strong and healthy.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I'll go get breakfast ready for us,  
so just come to the dining room  
when you're done getting ready.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hm? Thank you? For what?  
It's fine! You don't have to thank me.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But it makes me happy that you'd want to anyway!  
You are always welcome,  
{player}. ♪  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
...Y'know, I've been wondering,  
but the two of you aren't actually related, are you?  
  
**Ameth：**  
So why the heck is she, like,  
all over you like that?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh right, your guess is as good as mine, huh?  
Still, she's even clingier than real sisters are,  
so there's gotta be more to this whole thing.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Sisters, huh...  
I wonder what Nebbia and the other fairies  
are up to these days.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I just hope they weren't turned to mist when the  
reconstruction happened, unlike me.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh dear.  
Sorry, just talking to myself.  
  
**Ameth：**  
All right, let me explain.  
Though,  
you always forget this stuff anyway.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ahem. What you just saw was something like a dream.  
When you wake up, you'll forget most of the details.  
  
**Ameth：**  
For now,  
it's nothing you really need to worry about.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Once I see you've grown a bit more,  
I'll explain it again.  
  
**Ameth：**  
However,  
even if it is just a dream,  
the feelings that remain when you wake up are real.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's why I'm going through all this trouble  
to show it to you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I want you to put in the effort to make that really sink in, so  
you don't forget the important things.  
  
**Ameth：**  
For this dream...  
When you wake up,  
be good to your sister, okay?  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's working so hard to take care of you.  
You've got to repay that favor at some point, right?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Good. In that case, I'd say we're done here now.  
Bye-bye. See you next time. ♪

**Shizuru：**  
Like I said!  
{player} just started glowing  
and conked out on me!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
What's happening to him, Boss?!  
Please, just tell me! Is he gonna be okay?!  
It's not some horrible, deadly disease, right?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
What?! It's \"Fio's intervention\"?  
What the heck is a Fio?!  
That's not even a real word, is it?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Eep!  
Oh, {player}, you're awake!  
Um... Well...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Sorry Boss, I need to cut off the connection now!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I'll be headed your way later,  
so you'd better tell me what's going on!  
See you then. Bye.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ugh...  
So, um... {player}?  
Are you okay? Do you feel sick?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Something really strange just happened to you,  
so I was really worried!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh? Oh, right.  
We were talking about going shopping, weren't we?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But, er...  
Now doesn't really feel like the time anymore...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh? You want to buy me something?  
Anything I want?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
B-but why? What brought this on?  
I mean, of course it makes me insanely happy, but...!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You want to thank me for always looking after you?  
  
H-have I really been doing that?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I've actually been trying to stay away from you  
when possible.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But...  
I'm thrilled that you feel that way.  
Heehee. I might even cry.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Well then, let's buy a matching pair of mugs!  
Like the ones newlyweds get!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Then, if we make a habit of using them...  
No matter how far apart we may be,  
they'll remind me of you.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It'll be like you're just across the table.  
And no matter the distance,  
we can know that our family is there for us.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Would that creep you out too badly?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It wouldn't?  
Then, let's find the best mugs in town!  
We'll search every nook and cranny together!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Heehee.  
You said something that made me really happy today,  
so this can be a new Li'l Bro Commemoration Day!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
That's just one more Li'l Bro Commemoration Day  
on your big sister's personal calendar!
