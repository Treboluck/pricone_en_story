# Shizuru Episode 2
Shizuru runs into {player} and uses a survey from her guild's new crepe stand as a chance to learn more about him. He answers each question with care, and she is relieved to see he's the same as he ever was.
  
## Subtitle: What's Your Type?
  
**Shizuru：**  
Excuse me!  
Do you have a moment to answer some questions?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Participants will receive a coupon for the crepe stand, Labyrinth!  
So please, help us out if you can! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ugh...  
Look, I don't wanna be here any more than you all do.  
Why'd I have to get stuck handing out surveys, anyway?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But I do need the extra cash right now,  
since I just moved here and everything...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
The real question is whether the boss is gonna pay us or not...  
She's not exactly what you'd call careful with money...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Like, it's hard to tell if she's lazy,  
or if she just doesn't care about the little things.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But no.  
I shouldn't think like that. I have to believe in her.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
This is all so I can finally see my sweet baby brother again.  
After all, as they say, good things come to those who wait!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
That's right. If Labyrinth becomes well-known as a crepe stand,  
nobody will suspect our true nature.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
This will make it so much easier for us to work.  
It's the perfect front.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
That's the point of all this.  
That's why the boss asked me to come and help out  
at the crepe stand, right?  
Right.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yup. She's definitely not doing this  
just because she likes making crepes... right?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
There's no way she's forgotten why we're here, right?  
Tell me I'm right!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh geez. Didn't mean to get lost in thought there.  
I've got surveys to pass out!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I'm with the crepe stand, Labyrinth!  
Do you have a moment to answer some questions? ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hm? Hey, if it isn't  
{player}!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
What a coincidence!  
What are you up to? Out for a walk?  
Well, I'm out here working! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yeah. See, the crepe stand I work at  
is in kind of an out-of-the-way place.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
There just aren't a lot of people passing by, you know?  
So we made a bunch of flyers with a map showing  
how to get to us.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
And while I'm passing these out,  
I'm also doing a survey!  
Just asking what kind of crepes people like and whatnot.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Just honest, everyday business as usual. ♪  
Here, you can have a flyer too,  
{player}.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
There you go!  
If you're interested,  
we'd love it if you'd stop by for a bite sometime.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, I almost forgot...  
If you have time,  
would you mind answering our survey?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You'll do it?  
Woohoo! Thank you so much!  
You always have been the sweetest boy.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
That's my little bro!  
You could never abandon someone in need!  
I'm just so glad you grew up to be so kind-hearted!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Okay, I'm going to ask a few questions.  
Don't think too hard—  
just go with what your heart says.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Do you have any restaurants you like to frequent?  
How often do you go to them?  
Tell me, what's your favorite food?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Heehee. Just look at him!  
He's answering them so earnestly!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
He really is the sweetest boy.  
Oh, I just wanna squeeze him 'til he pops!  
But I can't! Not behind Rino's back!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, but I do wish I could get closer to him here.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Unfortunately, the boss said we can't do anything that might  
be too much for him.  
As much as I hate it, I'll just have to resist.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Buuut...  
A couple of teensy-weensy extra questions couldn't hurt,  
now could they?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I just want to know more about my little bro! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
We've been apart for so, so long.  
He's become so different  
from the sweet baby brother I used to know.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I just hope that he's not a completely different person now.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, but I want to see what I've missed!  
I'm his big sister!  
I should know everything about him!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Besides, finding out more about him  
would help with our guild's objective too, right?  
Yeah! That's a solid rebuttal if there ever was one! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Heehee.  
Okay, let's move on to the next question.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
What kind of girl would you be most interested in?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Someone nice.  
**Choice: (2)**  Someone like you.  
`Tag 1`  
**Shizuru：**  
Wow, that's kind of a stock answer!  
After all, niceness doesn't require any special skills.  
You could call any girl nice and make them happy.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I so get it!  
You're totally right.  
Nice girls are so much better than mean ones.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Though, I should warn you.  
Some girls are only pretending to be nice  
so they can manipulate sweet, innocent young men.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Just be sure you have a discerning eye for who's really nice  
and who's not-so-nice. Okay?

`Tag 2`  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, you little sweet-talker!  
Aww, you're such a cutie-pie! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
If that was really how you felt,  
it would make me the happiest girl in the world.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But if you're just be saying it to be nice...  
I'm not gonna lie, it would kinda sting.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shizuru：**  
Anyway, thank you for your answers!  
I see... Very interesting!  
I had no idea, heehee!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
For the moment, I've found out you're honest enough  
to give a serious answer to even the oddest of questions...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
And it's such a relief to see that,  
because that's exactly how I remember you!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Heehee.  
Now, let's do a few more questions!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I want to know every last bit about you! ♪
