**Narration：**  
While out on a shopping trip, {player} and Io  
are suddenly engulfed by a peculiar light.  
  
**Io：**  
Huh? Hey!  
What's this light?  
GAHHHH!

**Io：**  
What's wrong, {player}?  
Your eyes are glazing over.  
  
**Io：**  
There are no classes today, so the school is empty.  
Maybe that's making you a little anxious?  
  
**Io：**  
Huh? My outfit?  
Well, it's just the two of us today,  
so I thought I might as well be comfortable and wear  
something casual.  
  
**Io：**  
I appreciate the compliment, but now that we've finally got  
some time with just the two of us,  
you need to focus, okay?  
  
**Io：**  
It's all right.  
I'll go over every little detail, no matter how small.  
Take a deep breath and relax.  
  
**Io：**  
Now, let's get started.  
Take out your language arts book.  
  
**Io：**  
You're always bailing me out of all kinds of trouble,  
but I can at least repay you a little by helping you with your  
studies. I'll do the best job I can for you!  
  
**Io：**  
So, does that passage make sense?  
  
**Io：**  
Hmm? Something the matter?  
You're supposed to look at the book, not me.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Your, umm, chest...  
**Choice: (2)**  Just thinking that you're really cute.  
`Tag 1`  
**Io：**  
My chest? What, is something on my blouse?  
  
**Io：**  
Never mind?  
A-are you sure there wasn't something?  
Okay...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Io：**  
Wh-whaaaat?!  
Where did that come from?  
Don't tease your teacher.  
  
**Io：**  
Although, I've never had a boy call me cute before,  
so that did make me kind of happy...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Io：**  
But our eyes need to be on the textbook, okay?  
Focus like a laser!  
  
**Io：**  
Look at this comprehension question, {player}.  
\"Describe what the character is feeling.\"  
You got this wrong on the last test.  
  
**Io：**  
Uh, you're looking at me again. Out of willpower already?  
  
**Io：**  
All right, I understand.  
Let's take a breather.

**Io：**  
I've got tea and a few sweets to go with it.  
Let's have a little snack and chat a bit!  
  
**Io：**  
Hee hee. This is a lot of fun, isn't it?  
I've always loved the idea of friends doing study  
sessions together.  
  
**Io：**  
Teaming up to figure out the answers,  
taking snack breaks, going off on tangents about  
love interests...  
  
**Io：**  
Ooh, let's do that!  
{player}, is there a girl you have a crush on?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Nope.  
**Choice: (5)**  Yup. She's right before my eyes.  
`Tag 4`  
**Io：**  
Aww, that's too bad.  
But maybe a bit of a relief.  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Io：**  
Before your eyes? What does that mean?  
Oh, I get it! You're so smitten, she's always on your mind?  
How romantic!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Io：**  
Huh? What's my type?  
Heh heh, that's my little secret.  
Maybe you'll figure it out eventually?  
  
**Io：**  
Wow, this is the real thing! Talking about crushes and  
who we like and stuff!  
Thanks, {player}!  
You made one of my old dreams come true!  
  
**Io：**  
Now, ready to crack the books again?  
No? Still can't focus?  
  
**Io：**  
Wait, I know. All right, {player}.  
If you work really hard for the rest of the study session,  
I'll give you an extra-special lesson as a reward.  
  
**Io：**  
It'll be such a rush, your heart will be pounding.  
But I promise to go slow and be thorough while I'm teaching.  
  
**Io：**  
Hee hee. I'm happy to see you're motivated again! ♪  
I'll do my best to teach you all the material.

**Ameth：**  
Well, what'd you think of my present?  
Did you enjoy your dream?  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just saw was a dream I crafted based off Io's and your  
memory fragments. How did it feel?  
A little nostalgic?  
Nah, probably too soon for that.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'll show you another dream once you've gathered enough  
memory fragments.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Having lots of these dreams with lots of different girls...  
That's your path to learning the truth about this world.  
So do your best, okay?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, that's it for now!

**Io：**  
Mm, mmph...  
Where am I?  
  
**Io：**  
Huh? We were shopping together...  
Then I just fell asleep.  
  
**Io：**  
I dreamt you and I were studying together.  
  
**Io：**  
Huh?!  
{player}, you had the exact same dream?  
That's so weird!  
  
**Io：**  
What is it?  
Something about the dream bothering you?  
  
**Io：**  
Huh? What was the extra-special lesson?  
Heh heh. It would've knocked your socks off.  
  
**Io：**  
I was going to tell you all about my favorite romance novels!  
They're so well-written, they make my heart pound  
from beginning to end!
