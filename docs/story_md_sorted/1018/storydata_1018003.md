## Subtitle: A Dream Date
  
**Narration：**  
Classes have ended for the day at Lucent Academy.  
Io and {player} are walking home.  
  
**Io：**  
So, are you used to class now, {player}?  
  
**Io：**  
Remember, if you ever have trouble understanding something,  
just ask me. I'll always be there to—  
  
**Girlfriend：**  
C'mon, c'mon!  
I wanna get an ice cream cone!  
  
**Boyfriend：**  
All right, all right.  
We'll split one, okay?  
  
**Io：**  
...  
  
**Io：**  
Oops, sorry!  
I kinda spaced out there for a second.  
  
**Io：**  
I was just a little envious of that couple back there.  
  
**Io：**  
I went to an all demonfolk girls school, so I've always  
felt like I never got the full school experience.  
  
**Io：**  
When I think back on it, I wish I'd taken the opportunity  
to have more fun.  
  
**Io：**  
I always loved the idea of things like grabbing a bite  
after school, or going on dates with boys. I wish I could've  
done some of those things.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's not too late.  
`Tag 1`  
**Io：**  
Huh? What do you mean? Are you saying you'll take me on  
an after-school date?  
  
**Io：**  
You know what? I think I'll take you up on that.  
I'll even treat you to something to say thanks.  
If there's anything in particular you're craving, say the word.  
  
**Io：**  
Oh, how about that ice cream shop? They make ultra-premium  
ice cream with really high milk-fat content. It's the richest,  
tastiest ice cream around here.  
  
**Io：**  
Great, I'll go buy us some.  
  
**Io：**  
I'm back!  
Here's yours, {player}!  
Hee hee hee!  
  
**Io：**  
Hmm? What is it?  
I really look like I'm enjoying myself?  
  
**Io：**  
You can tell, huh?  
Well, we *are* grabbing a bite  
after school, just like I always wanted!  
  
**Io：**  
Thanks, {player}.  
You made one of my old dreams come true.  
  
**Io：**  
And this ice cream is a token of my appreciation.  
Let's hurry and eat them before they mel—  
  
**Io：**  
Eeek!  
C-cold!  
Looks like mine's already melting.  
  
**Io：**  
Nnnh!  
It's dripping onto my chest!  
  
**Io：**  
Aww...  
Now I'm going to be all sticky.  
  
**Io：**  
{player}, can you mop me up?  
Please, wipe this ice cream off before it runs down  
into my clothes.  
  
**Io：**  
My hands are full holding both our cones.  
I can't wipe it up myself!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Gladly!  
**Choice: (3)**  But it's on your chest.  
`Tag 2`  
**Io：**  
Gladly?  
I don't see what there is to be glad about, but...  
Please.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Io：**  
That's the problem!  
Please, hurry and wipe it off!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Io：**  
Hee... Hee hee!  
That tickles.  
Ooh!  
  
**Io：**  
Ah, are you all done?  
Thanks a lot.  
That would've made a big mess.  
  
**Io：**  
Okay, let's try that again!  
Here's your cone.  
  
**Io：**  
What's that? I could've handed you your cone, and cleaned  
myself up?  
  
**Io：**  
Now that you mention it, that's true.  
I guess I lost my head.  
  
**Schoolboy 1：**  
{player}, you little... Whattaya think you're doing?!  
  
**Io：**  
Hmm?  
Oh, it's more friends from our class.  
  
**Schoolboy 2：**  
You dare put your hands on the m-m-magic orbs of our  
beloved Io?!  
  
**Schoolboy 1：**  
I sentence you to death!  
Get him!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Run for it.  
`Tag 5`  
**Schoolboy 2：**  
Don't let him get away!  
After him!  
  
**Io：**  
Ha ha ha. Looks like {player}'s already made lots of friends!  
I love to see healthy, growing boys horsing around.
