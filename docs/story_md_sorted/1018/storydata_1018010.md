# Io Episode 10
Io is upset that she's the only one who doesn't have a boyfriend, unlike all of her old classmates. A few days later, she takes part in a street food stamp event with {player}, and his attempt to cheer her up feels like an invitation to a real date. This brightens her up as they collect the stamps together.
  
## Subtitle: Lucky Stamp Event
  
**Narration：**  
A food event is being held in the shopping district.  
{player} pushes through the crowd  
toward the waiting spot he and Io had agreed upon, calling out to her.  
  
**Io：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sorry for the wait!  
`Tag 1`  
**Io：**  
...Ah,  
good morning!  
  
**Io：**  
Sorry, I was just thinking about something.  
Was I that zoned out?  
  
**Io：**  
Don't worry.  
Today, I want to return you the favor for helping out at Parents' Day,  
so let's have fun.  
  
**Io：**  
Hanging out with you might take my mind off it.  
...Oh, never mind!  
  
**Event Staff：**  
Gather around, everyone!  
Do you want to participate in our Street Food Stamp Event?  
  
**Event Staff：**  
Collect the stamps from the food you eat,  
and you can exchange them for wonderful gifts! Here are the stamp cards!  
  
**Io：**  
Hm? Do you want to join this stamp event?  
Well, I guess it couldn't hurt to give it a go.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Eating a lot will cheer you up!  
`Tag 2`  
**Io：**  
Hehe,  
did I worry you?  
I'm really okay.  
All right, gotta pull myself together and have fun!  
  
**Shop Staff 1：**  
Here, one stamp!  
Thank you!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Let's eat!  
`Tag 3`  
**Io：**  
It looks so good!  
I'll dig in too.  
*munch munch*...  
  
**Io：**  
*munch*...  
  
**Io：**  
...*gulp*  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You don't like it?  
**Choice: (5)**  You're not hungry?  
`Tag 4`  
`Tag 5`  
**Io：**  
Ah! No, I'm fine!  
It's nothing...  
  
**Io：**  
...Well, they say you feel better when you share your worries,  
so maybe I should tell you.  
Since you're the only one I can tell this to, anyway.  
  
**Io：**  
You see, I had a class reunion after inviting you to this event.  
It had been a while since I saw the others,  
but everyone has a boyfriend now, and they always go on dates.  
  
**Io：**  
I was so envious seeing how happy they looked.  
I thought it would be nice if someday I could have a boyfriend  
who I could tell people about like that.  
  
**Io：**  
Since then, I just keep thinking about it,  
and because of that, it seems like I'm zoning out a lot.  
  
**Io：**  
I'm so sorry I brought this up!  
I was trying to return the favor to you today,  
but I guess I just made you worried.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  If you want, I', always available to hang out.  
`Tag 6`  
**Io：**  
Are you asking me out on a date...?  
No, we're teacher and student. That's just crazy.  
  
**Io：**  
But I guess you're a boy too...  
Wait, that's like something out of a girls' manga!  
No no no, we can't!  
  
**Event Staff：**  
The event will be ending shortly!  
Those of you who have collected your stamps,  
hurry up and come exchange your gifts!  
  
**Io：**  
Oh no!  
We've barely gathered any stamps! Let's hurry!  
  
**Shop Staff 2：**  
Hey, you guys!  
Seems like you two are struggling, eh?  
  
**Io：**  
Yes. There wasn't much point in us participating at this rate...  
  
**Shop Staff 2：**  
Hehehe...  
Let's solve your problem with our takoyaki!  
  
**Io：**  
How do we do that?  
  
**Shop Staff 2：**  
Well!  
Just between us, we actually have a lot of ingredients left...  
  
**Shop Staff 2：**  
So if I make enough takoyaki to cover the stamps you need  
and offer them as a bargain set, will you promise to buy them all?  
...  
We should help each other, right?  
  
**Io：**  
*gobble* *munch munch*  
  
**Io：**  
Ahh, it's so hot and gooey inside!  
I'm gonna get burned!  
  
**Shop Staff 2：**  
As expected, you really have a big appetite!  
Here, I'll add the stamps for the ones you ate!  
  
**Io：**  
Mmm, I can't eat anymore...  
Feels like takoyaki's going to burst out of my stomach...  
How about you...?  
  
**Io：**  
Wow! You finished them all!  
You don't have to say anything.  
You have K.O. written all over your face.  
  
**Io：**  
And here is my last one.  
With this, we'll have all the stamps.  
  
**Io：**  
It's not like this is a date with a boyfriend,  
but we did hang out alone today.  
  
**Io：**  
And yet, I've done nothing but make you worry...  
I'll have to finish this last one,  
and go get our rewards!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I'll eat it.  
`Tag 7`  
**Io：**  
Huh? But...  
are you sure you're okay?  
  
**Io：**  
Then...  
  
**Io：**  
All right, say \"ah.\"  
  
**Io：**  
Hehe,  
you're too nice.  
Dutifully opening your mouth so wide, even though it's so silly...  
You're always so helpful.  
  
**Shop Staff 2：**  
Oh! What a scene!  
Here—this is your last stamp! Congratulations!  
  
**Io：**  
Yay!  
Hey, is your stomach really okay?  
  
**Io：**  
Well, you're a growing boy.  
I wonder if you're going to grow even more reliable?  
  
**Shop Staff 2：**  
Heeey, mister.  
These two over here finished gathering the stamps!  
  
**Event Staff：**  
Oh! Okay, let's redeem your gifts.  
All right, here you go.  
  
**Io：**  
Wow!  
What is it? Let's open it right away!  
  
**Io：**  
...This is... a pair of matching mugs?  
  
**Shop Staff 2：**  
It's the perfect gift for you two!  
Hope you can use them together!  
  
**Io：**  
Oh, we're not like that.  
Right now we're just a teacher and a student. Okay?  
  
**Narration：**  
That night, Io started using the mug right away  
while thinking about {player}.
