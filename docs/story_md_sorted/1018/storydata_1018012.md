**Narration：**  
{player} is walking around the city for his part-time delivery job.  
  
**Io：**  
Oh my, {player}.  
What are you doing?  
  
**Io：**  
Ah, it seems like you're working hard for your part-time job.  
Balancing education and work is very admirable!  
  
**Io：**  
As for me, I'm visiting my students' homes.  
It's a lot of work going from place to place.  
  
**Io：**  
In order to lose to you as a teacher,  
I need to work hard with my home visits!  
Well then, take care!  
  
**???：**  
I'll be right there!  
  
**Female Student：**  
Ah, it's Io's boyfriend from the cooking session the other day!  
Are you doing part-time delivery work?  
 You must be tired!  
  
**Female Student：**  
Oh, right!  
Actually, just now, Io came to visit my home...  
  
**Female Student：**  
On the way to the next student's house,  
there's a place rumored to have monsters appearing recently!  
  
**Female Student：**  
I haven't heard about any attacks,  
and Io said she'll be fine,  
but I'm really worried!  
  
**Female Student：**  
You're Io's boyfriend, right?  
I don't want her to get hurt!  
Please go and save her!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Okay!  
`Tag 1`  
**???：**  
Ahhh!  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Io：**  
Hold on! Wait a minute!  
Stop!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's run!  
`Tag 2`  
**Io：**  
Huh, {player}?!  
What are you doing here... Ahhh!  
  
**Io：**  
*pant* *pant*  
Why did you suddenly run?  
  
**???：**  
Myuuun... Myuuun...  
  
**Io：**  
S-stop for a moment!  
Did you hear it too? That crying sound just now.  
  
**Io：**  
Yes. Right, it's the cry of a small monster.  
I need to check it out!  
  
**Io：**  
Are you coming with me because it's dangerous?  
Thank you.  
But I think I'll be okay...  
  
**Io：**  
I knew it—you're stuck in a trap!  
Hold on,  I'll get you out right away.  
Ughh!  
  
**Io：**  
...*pant* *pant*  
I can't—I'm not strong enough...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Why are you helping it?  
`Tag 3`  
**Io：**  
Well, it seems like it's in pain! I can't just leave it!  
  
**Io：**  
I must do something...! I'll try again...!  
Ughh!  
  
**Io：**  
Huh?  
My strength...!  
  
**Io：**  
Yay! I got it out!  
  
**Little Monster：**  
Myuuun! Myuuun!  
  
**Io：**  
Ahh!  
It...it leaped right into my chest!  
That tickles!  
Hahaha,  
I'm glad you're doing okay.  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRAAAAGGHHHHH!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Io, watch out!  
`Tag 4`  
**Io：**  
{player}, wait...!  
  
**Monsters：**  
Myuuun! Myuuun!  
  
**Io：**  
Ahhhh! That tickles!  
  
**Io：**  
Everyone, you're licking too much!  
N-no, not there!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Io...?  
**Choice: (6)**  I'm going to lick too!  
`Tag 5`  
**Io：**  
Haha,  
everyone, please wait!  
I need to explain this to {player}!  
Wait!  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Io：**  
Huh? Why are you licking too?!  
Hahaha,  
are you trying to tease me?  
Hey, stop!  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Io：**  
{player}, listen...  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRAAAAGGHHHHH!  
  
**Io：**  
Huh? Why are you making such scary noises suddenly?  
This didn't happen when I was alone.  
  
**Io：**  
Is it because you're cautious with strangers?  
He's a good person, so don't worry.  
  
**Io：**  
Oh no...  
They're so excited, they're not even listening.  
I guess I have no choice...  
  

---  
  
**Io：**  
Hey, here's your teacher's whip of love!  
Everyone, calm down!  
  
**Io：**  
Not even listening to your teacher? Since when are you all so naughty?  
It's good to be energetic, but you can't cause trouble for others, okay?  
  
**Io：**  
It's okay—he's a good person.  
He's kind, and reliable...  
He's always helping me.  
  
**Io：**  
It's even thanks to him that  
I was able to save you all!  
  
**Monsters：**  
Myuu, myuuuuuun... ♪  
  
**Io：**  
Do you understand what I'm saying now...?  
Let me talk to him. Okay?  
  
**Monsters：**  
Myuun. ♪ Myuun. ♪  
  
**Io：**  
Oh good, everyone's behaving again.  
Now can you give him a friendly handshake?  
  
**Monsters：**  
Myumyuuuuun. ♪  
  
**Io：**  
Seeing that you're making more friends  
makes me really happy too.  
  

---  
  
**Io：**  
Hehe, you're surprised, right?  
But I guess it's only normal since you're being surrounded by so many monsters.  
  
**Io：**  
Do you remember when those people in town  
were trying to exterminate a monster I saved?  
  
**Io：**  
At that time, you were on my side, and you helped me, right?  
I was really moved by your reliable figure.  
  
**Io：**  
And also, you've grown so much since we met.  
Even your test scores are improving, right?  
  
**Io：**  
Though I'm the teacher, you're always the one helping me.  
It makes me want to help others too,  
so I decided to help these injured monsters.  
  
**Io：**  
It would be so awful if these traps made them hate people and  
start attacking them!  
Lots of kids walk through here on the way to  
school, and if anything were to happen to one of my students...  
  
**Little Monster：**  
Myuuun!  
  
**Io：**  
See?  
If you face them one by one, they're all good kids, right?  
This one is Garu,  
and these are Goh and Kiipon!  
  
**Garu and others (monsters)：**  
Gaugau!  
Gufugufu!  
Ukiki!  
  
**Io：**  
When you came by earlier, I was playing with these little ones.  
Although they were injured at first,  
they're all so full of energy now.  
  
**Io：**  
Back then, you grabbed me and ran off,  
so I think maybe they mistook you for a bad guy.  
  
**Io：**  
But I guess it's also thanks to you  
that I was able to save them so quickly.  
Once again, I'm being helped by you...  
  
**Io：**  
Wait, aren't you in the middle of your part-time job?  
Why are you here?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Earlier when I was making my delivery...  
`Tag 8`  
**Io：**  
Uh-huh...  
So you were at my student's place, huh.  
And then you tried to chase after me.  
  
**Io：**  
What?!  
She thought you were my boyfriend too?  
  
**Io：**  
Why didn't you deny it?  
Is it because you're thinking the same thing...?  
  
**Io：**  
I can't believe they think you're my boyfriend when you're my student.  
Well, I guess for a first boyfriend, I do want someone reliable and kind like you...  
  
**Io：**  
I see, if you...  
become my first... then...  
  
**Io：**  
H-hey.  
Next weekend, are you free?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Of course!  
`Tag 9`  
**Io：**  
Really?  
Well...  
do you wanna go out?  
  
**Io：**  
Not just going shopping like before,  
but a real date... like couples go on...  
  
**Io：**  
Really?  
Yay!  
Then I guess we're done with the practice questions.  
  
**Io：**  
Hehe,  
I never thought  
asking someone out would be so nerve-racking. It's so embarrassing.  
  
**Io：**  
Well then, I need to get back to visiting my students.  
You too—take care at your part-time job!  
  
**Io：**  
Ahhh!  
  
**Io：**  
Ahhhh!  
I'm stuck in Kuru's tail! Help me!  
  
**Narration：**  
After a while, Io's new monster friends  
became famous guardians for the students from Lucent Academy,  
and even the people of the neighborhood began to accept them.
