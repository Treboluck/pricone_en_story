**Ameth：**  
{player}!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Are you all right?!  
Ahhhh, thank goodness... You're still here...  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Do you remember what happened?  
You were knocked out by the blast from that crazy magical attack!  
That's how you ended up here, talking to me in your dreams.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But if we can talk, that means you're at least still alive...  
You can't have been evaporated by that spell of mass destruction... Right?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm so sorry.  
I watched it all happen, but I can't interact with this world...  
Even in a situation like that, there's nothing I can do.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's so frustrating...  
It's supposed to be my duty to act as the last line of defense  
between you and the forces of evil...  
  
**Ameth：**  
...But no.  
I shouldn't get all riled up when I still have a job to do.  
  
**Ameth：**  
My role right now is to give you what little advice I can.  
It's not much, but it's the only thing I have at the moment.  
  
**Ameth：**  
At any rate...  
Today, you finally came face to face with your greatest enemy.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's right.  
We can finally put a name and face to the mysterious \"Majesty\"  
who's been orchestrating things from the shadows.  
  
**Ameth：**  
In this timeline, it looks like she's calling herself Eustiana.  
  
**Ameth：**  
\"Eustiana\"... Hmm. That's an interesting role for her to take up.  
I suppose it would only confuse you if I explained the details,  
so I won't go into the specifics of her identity right now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Things like gender, age and race don't mean a whole lot  
to a monster like her, anyway.  
In this world, her power is essentially that of a god.  
  
**Ameth：**  
In the public eye, she's positioned herself as the rightful ruler,  
claiming the throne and all the authority that comes with it.  
Strength, magic, political power, finances... She has it all.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you need to know is, she almost destroyed this world once.  
And you were the hero who fought to stop that happening.  
  
**Ameth：**  
With your memories lost, I can't expect you to recall...  
But you must have noticed her calling you a \"hero.\"  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, that's exactly what you were.  
Like the hero of a story, you fought to protect the world  
and confronted her as your ultimate foe—your \"final boss.\"  
  
**Ameth：**  
With the help of many comrades and friends, of course.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And among the people who supported you in that quest  
was the woman who brought you to this world in the first place.  
The woman you just met again today—Labyrista.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Not her real name, of course, but it's the one she's using now.  
I don't know exactly what she's after, but it looks like she's  
using the secret society Labyrinth to pursue the world's secrets.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So her goal is the same as ours.  
I don't know if we can trust her completely,  
but we at least seem to share a common objective.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So if you ever have the opportunity, I'd recommend  
getting in touch with Labyrinth and sharing information.  
I'm sure they'll have some of the answers you're looking for.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I would tell you myself, but we can only talk in these dreams.  
And you can barely retain any of the information you learn here.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So it's best if you uncover the truth yourself, in the real world.  
If the only explanation you had was \"I heard it in a dream,\"  
people would probably think you crazy anyhow.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And you need as much help from your friends as you can get.  
So I'm asking you to unravel these mysteries for yourself.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Only then will you be able to foil your dark nemesis's plans  
and truly save this world, with your friends by your side.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That said, do try to hurry.  
I'm afraid it looks like we have less time to waste than I'd hoped.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And your enemy seems to have already recognized you  
as a threat to her evil ambitions.  
So she'll surely use all the powers at her disposal to eliminate you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
To be frank, she almost managed that already.  
She was this close to destroying you, along with most of this  
world's major players, before you could do anything against her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Presumably thanks to some kind of trick of Labyrista's,  
you seem to have made it out alive this time,  
but this could all too easily have been the end of the line.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You had a lucky break this once.  
But there's no guarantee that will happen a second time.  
So you'll need to be more careful than ever in the days ahead.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It'll probably be hard. You'll have to face sadness and suffering.  
And all I'll be able to do is watch as the tragedy unfolds.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But I'll be praying for you.  
Believing that you won't give in. That you'll bring us a miracle.  
  
**Ameth：**  
If anyone can do it, it’s you, {player}.  
Because this is your story. You're the hero who everyone loves.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So, good luck.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And don't worry...  
As long as you're alive, I'm sure things will work out.
