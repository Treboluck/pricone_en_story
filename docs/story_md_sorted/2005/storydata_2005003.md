### Place: Labyrinth Hideout
  
**Muimi：**  
*sigh...*  
  
**Muimi：**  
How long has it been now  
since I was thrown into this cell?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Something like a week now, I guess?  
Ughhh... How did I let this happen?  
  
**Muimi：**  
I mean, they haven't done anything to harm me so far...  
And they've given me warm meals and a place to sleep.  
  
**Muimi：**  
As captors go, they're not bad.  
But I still don't know what they're actually after,  
so I'm worried sick.  
  
**Muimi：**  
From what I can tell, these "Labyrinth" people  
seem to have questions they want to ask me.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I could give them answers,  
but I feel like that might be a bad move.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Until they manage to get all the information they need out of me,  
they'll need to keep me safe from harm.  
  
**Muimi：**  
But of course,  
if I refuse to say anything at all,  
they might resort to torture...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Sure, they've been acting all nice and friendly so far,  
but they did knock me out and abduct me. They're dangerous.  
Once they've got what they want, they might dispose of me.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I need to make them think I still have valuable information  
that I'm not ready to share...  
  
**Muimi：**  
But also keep them happy enough to buy some time,  
while I look for a way to escape.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Urghh...  
Balancing acts like this really aren't my strong point.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I always used to leave this kind of crafty scheming stuff  
to Octo, after all.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Oh, Octo...  
I wish he was here.  
I always feel safer with him around.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Of course, right now,  
he doesn't remember a thing about me.  
Even so, I wish he was here...  
  
**Muimi：**  
I don't want to be alone anymore...  
  
**Muimi：**  
...?!  
Wh-what was that?  
An explosion?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Some kind of accident? Or could it be an enemy attack?!  
Could Octo have come to break me out of here?!  
  
**Muimi：**  
No... There's no way he'd rescue me.  
Heck, he was trying to capture me just like these guys were.  
Dammit, Octo... I'll give you an earful when your memories come back!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Anyway...  
What's actually going on?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hey, guys!  
What's with the ruckus?!  
Is anyone out there?!  
  
**Muimi：**  
We've gotta be in some kind of cave here, right?  
You can't go blowing things up in a place like this!  
If the ceiling caves in, we'll be buried alive!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Huh? There's no response!  
Isn't there anyone else here?!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Uhhh... Shizuru, was it? And Rino, right?  
Any of you Labyrinth guys! Where are you?!  
C'mon!  
  
**Muimi：**  
This is weird...  
I was sure they'd have someone standing guard  
to make sure I don't escape or anything...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Did they leave me all alone?  
Or have they been taken out by...  
whoever set that thing off?  
  
**Muimi：**  
All right!  
Maybe this is my chance to escape!  
  
**Muimi：**  
If nobody's standing guard,  
these bars are all that stand between me and freedom!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Nghhhh...!  
Guehh... I guess I'm not gonna break them bare-handed...  
Ugh! If only I had my Spiresbane Blade...!

**???：**  
Hmm...?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Uhhh? That's not much of a reaction...  
Oh, right. Maybe \"here\" you're not a professor at all.  
No point using titles from the \"other side,\" huh.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hang on, uhhh, what *was* your real name?  
I think it was... Raj... Raj...?  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Rajraj?  
Is that the name I am called by?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Uh, yeah...  
From the look on your face,  
I guess you must've forgotten everything too.  
  
**Muimi：**  
But wait, weren't you under Minerva's control when...?  
Gahhh! I don't know what to think!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Well, whatever! I can figure this stuff out later!  
For the moment, can you give me a hand?!  
  
**Muimi：**  
I need you to do something about these bars!  
I'm being held captive by some bad guys!  
  
**Muimi：**  
C'mon, please!  
I'm sure you don't remember any of this...  
  
**Muimi：**  
But back in Eternal Society,  
I helped you out with a bunch of things, didn't I?!  
  
**Rajraj：**  
\"Eternal Society\"...?  
I am afraid I do not understand your meaning.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
It seems my memories are in a rather muddled state.  
I am not even sure who I am myself.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
I do seem to have some vague recollections of you, though.  
You are... Novem, are you not?  
Is that right?  
  
`image display end`  
**Muimi：**  
Wha...?!  
Hey, did you just call me \"Novem\"?!  
Nobody but me has remembered that name before!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Thank goodness...  
I... I was actually pretty scared...  
  
**Muimi：**  
I was starting to think it really was all just in my head!  
That I might have gone crazy and made everything up!  
  
**Muimi：**  
But you... You remember me, don't you, Rajraj?  
So it wasn't all a dream or a delusion, was it?  
That's... That's the one thing I couldn't bear to think about!  
  
**Rajraj：**  
I am afraid I do not understand.  
I must apologize.  
But you *are* Novem, are you not?  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Has your hair grown out somewhat?  
It does not quite match my memories. Hmm.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Also, is Octo not with you?  
  
The two of you were always together...  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Or at least, that is how I seem to recall it.  
With my memories in this state, it is difficult to say for sure.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah... Yeah!  
We *were* always together!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Well, I didn't actually know you for that long, but still...  
We were guildmates!  
Even if nobody remembers it anymore...  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Guildmates...  
Then I suppose I had better grant your wish.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
In any case, there is a strange impulse within me  
to grant the wishes of others.  
Where it comes from, I could not say...  
  
**Muimi：**  
To grant wishes?  
Hmmm... Could it be that there's  
a fragment of Minerva still inside you somewhere?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Granting wishes was the whole point of her system, right?  
Uhhh, not that I really know the details.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Hmm. It seems I would do well  
to discuss these matters with you further and at length.  
To fill the gaps in my mind, and to fulfill my impulses.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
You wish for me  
to remove these bars by force?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah, if you could!  
  

---  
  
**Muimi：**  
Ahhhh... This is such a weird feeling!  
I never thought *you'd* come to my rescue!  
  
**Muimi：**  
But it makes me happy! Real happy!  
Thanks a bunch, Rajraj!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Octo's forgotten everything about me...  
And I don't know where Daigo or the others have gotten to...  
I was all on my own for so long.  
  
**Muimi：**  
So... meeting you is the best thing  
that's happened to me in ages!  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Is that so.  
I do not fully understand,  
but that smile suits you very well... Novem.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Now, please stand back for a moment.  
My body is not in the best condition,  
so it is difficult for me to control the output.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Right!  
Ahahah! Though it's just the two of us right now,  
I guess Eternal Society is back in business!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Now, let's mount our counterattack!  
We're gonna take down this world full of lies!
