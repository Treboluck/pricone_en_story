Eustiana teleports outside of the palace alongside {player} and attempts to finish off everyone in the vicinity, including Pecorine and Muimi. But just as she prepares to attack, Labyrista, the leader of Labyrinth, appears.
  
## Subtitle: One Final Reunion
  
**Narration：**  
Enveloped in a magical light,  
{player} loses consciousness for an instant.  
  
**Narration：**  
And moments later, when he opens his eyes again,  
the scene surrounding him could not be more different.  
  
**Narration：**  
Below him, rolling mountains. Around him, the open sky.  
Suddenly seized by the clutch of gravity, he begins to plummet.

**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
Are you all right, {player}?  
You're not hurt, are you?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heheh...  
I guess I should say sorry  
for carrying you in my arms like a princess.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This is all backwards, isn't it?  
Honestly, what am I going to do with you?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
There, there!  
I'm just happy you're okay!  
Ahaha, did I feel a little tremble there?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Were you scared?  
Of course you were!  
Who wouldn't be, falling from a height like that?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But it's all right! You're nice and safe now with me.  
Even boys will get tired if they try to act cool all the time!  
Sometimes you need to let yourself tremble and cry a little.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll pat you on the head and make you feel better.  
There there... Good boy!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Once you feel better, get up on your own two feet,  
and try to come to my rescue too sometime!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
'Cause I guess it wouldn't do wonders for your self-esteem  
if you're always the one getting saved by the princess!

### Place: Mt. Ural
  
**Christina：**  
Your sickly-sweet flirtations are all very well...  
But don't let your guard down.  
Someone's headed right this way.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, I wouldn't let my guard down!  
Not with a dangerous individual like you right nearby!  
  
**Christina：**  
How very wise.  
Who is that, though? They're coming from the Labyrinth hideout...  
Hmmm, something about them seems familiar...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hm?! Hold on a second, Rajraj!  
There's someone ahead of us! Be on your guard!  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Of course.  
If you wish me to stop, then stop I shall.  
I have decided to follow your orders for the time being.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
...But be careful with these people, Novem.  
I feel an unsettling presence.  
The scent of a wild beast...  
  
**Christina：**  
A beast, you say? What a rude way of putting it.  
I'd rather think of myself as the beauty!  
  
**Christina：**  
And you are... ahhh... who again, exactly?  
How very strange...  
I usually find my memory quite reliable.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Hmm.  
Can I take it that you have met me before?  
  
**Rajraj：**  
I must apologize. My memories are rather muddled right now.  
Novem... Might I ask if you recognize these people?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Huh?  
Ahhhh! Christina!  
What the heck are you doing here?!  
  
**Christina：**  
...Hmm?  
You know me by name, now, do you?  
I didn't realize I had become so famous.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Oh... I guess, from that reaction...  
You must not remember me either, huh.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmmm?  
Sorry to disappoint, but I can't recall us having met.  
Should I know you from somewhere, little miss?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Oh well...  
Sorry—if you don't remember, that's fine.  
Well, it's not fine, but there's no time to explain right now.  
  
**Muimi：**  
...Hmm? {player}! You're here as well?  
What kind of gathering is this?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  And you are...?  
**Choice: (2)**  Muimi! I'm happy you're safe!  
`Tag 1`  
**Muimi：**  
Say what?! If that's a joke, it's not funny!  
It's me! You know me!  
D-don't tell me you've... forgotten?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Grrr... You need to work on your memory!  
My name's Muimi! Or Novem! Whichever!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Oh... Great, looks like you do remember!  
Was that your idea of a joke, then?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Huh. That amnesia of yours might've actually improved your memory.  
Wiping the slate clean must've left plenty of room in your head  
to keep track of new information!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Muimi：**  
Ahahah! I'm getting used to the name now,  
but I've gotta say that tone is a new one.  
It's kind of embarrassing!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Did you always act so... guileless?  
You seem more childish than I remember...  
Maybe it's the amnesia.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Muimi：**  
Well, whatever!  
What matters is, you're here now!  
It's good to see you're okay, {player}!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Things were a real mess the last time I saw you,  
so I was kind of worried, you know?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I was worried about you too.  
`Tag 4`  
**Muimi：**  
You were, huh?  
Yeah, I guess you would be.  
That's the kind of guy you are.  
  
**Muimi：**  
But you don't need to worry about me!  
I was being held captive in those Labyrinth guys' hideout,  
but Rajraj here just broke me outta there!  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Novem, be quiet for a moment.  
  
...Direct your gaze upward. Something dangerous lurks above us.  
  
**???：**  
...  
  
**Christina：**  
Is that... Her Majesty?  
What's she doing outside the palace?  
And what in the world is that outfit?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wait, isn't that...?!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Hahahah...  
\"Regina Geas\" Christina is here, of course...  
But is that \"Leaping King\" Rajnikanth as well?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Akira should be somewhere nearby too...  
Add in me, and that's an awful lot of the Seven Crowns.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Then we have Novem, and you, {player}...  
Ahh, it's almost like a class reunion! All these familiar faces!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
I know I was the one who set this up,  
but still, it's quite the remarkable sight.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Eheh...  
A good day to you all, my dears!  
I am Eustiana, the ruler of this land!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Eustiana\"?  
How dare you! You'll be sorry you met me here!  
I'm going to take back everything you stole from me!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Oh, dear.  
 Haha.  
Whyever are *you* here as well?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
You're not high on my list of priorities,  
 \"Your Highness.\"  
But you are a minor nuisance, so I suppose this works out.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
It would be tiresome if you resisted, so I'll just let you all know...  
In the mountains around this location,  
I've assembled a number of mages from all across the land.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Once I have them cast a barrier, nobody will be able to leave.  
The \"Leaping King\" doesn't seem to be in the best of sorts,  
so with me obstructing him, even he won't be able to escape.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
You're trapped in a spider's web...  
 No, an antlion's pit...  
Actually, let's just call it a graveyard.  
This is where you're all going to meet your end.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
I'm about to consume my vast reserves of magical energy  
to unleash a battalion-class offensive spell on this location.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Not that I suppose this analogy will mean anything to you,  
but it has similar potency to a nuclear weapon.  
You'll be annihilated down to the last scrap of flesh.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
All these irritating pests who may have interfered with my work  
will be neatly wiped off the board for good!  
Oh, it does feel wonderful when things go according to plan.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
I'd love to read you all your last rites,  
but I'm afraid I'm only really familiar with Shinto.  
I don't know the first thing about this land's religions.  
  
**Christina：**  
What's all this about?  
I get that you're intending to slaughter  
every last person in this area, myself included...  
  
**Christina：**  
But tell me then, is that why you sent me on this mission?  
To lure me into the maw of the beast and be done with me?  
  
**Christina：**  
Your Majesty... No, \"Eustiana.\"  
I'd like to hear a proper explanation.  
  
**Christina：**  
If it pleases me, you'll have my applause.  
If it doesn't, I'll slay you where you stand!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Slay me?  
Oh, please. As if mere humans such as yourselves  
could hope to slay a god.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
I'm going to rule over this wonderful new world as its deity!  
And I'm afraid you're all in the way of that goal.  
So it's time for you to leave.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
This is it for a good half of the Seven Crowns,  
along with Labyrinth, who are too curious for their own good,  
and as a bonus, one silly little princess.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
As for you, {player}, you've told me all I need to hear,  
so I'm done with you too.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
To cast my spell of mass destruction,  
I needed to transport myself to this location at any rate.  
So I brought you along for the ride.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Oh, how lovely this will be!  
Finally I'll be able to proceed to the next phase of my plans!  
  
**???：**  
And what plans are those, exactly?  
Please do tell! I'm dying to hear the details!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Well, well! Finally you show yourself, Akira!  
Or should I call you \"Labyrista\"?  
That's your name as the leader of Labyrinth, yes?  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Sure is!  
Still, you sure made a mess of that hideout  
I worked so hard to build, didn't you?  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Sending a whole army charging in there!  
You gave me a nasty shock!  
Haha! My life flashed before my eyes!  
  
**Labyrista：**  
But you know, object manipulation is kind of my specialty.  
So naturally I had an escape route prepared.  
With a little luck, Shizuru and the rest should make it out fine.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
You should have escaped along with them.  
But you just had to come along  
and see for yourself, didn't you?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
You never have been able to resist the pull of your own curiosity.  
I'd call that your greatest weakness.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Hmmm. You talk like we're old friends or something, but...  
Remind me, who are you again?  
  
**Labyrista：**  
So sorry, I guess I forgot ya!  
Weird thing. I'm usually pretty good with names and faces!  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Since I'm a fan of \"people,\" you know.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Oh...? I suppose that's the one thing...  
But no. You and I  
have never seen eye to eye on anything, have we?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Well, no matter!  
We've stood around prattling enough.  
Time for you all to evaporate!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
My new world has no need for a merry cast of characters.  
All it needs is me!  
So I'm afraid for the rest of you, this is game over!  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Nobody should let anyone but themselves  
decide when their life is over.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
So... What now?  
If we all stand around gaping like idiots,  
she really will kill us all.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
I'm sure you're all wondering who the heck I am,  
but could you trust me this once?  
  
**Labyrista：**  
If we're all willing to work together,  
we should at least be able to escape with our lives.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
And I don't know about you, but I'd rather not die today.  
Not when I have something important to deliver.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Actually, it's Mr. {player} over there  
who I was hoping to deliver it to.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  A delivery? For me?  
`Tag 5`  
**Labyrista：**  
But hey, that can wait until we've, y'know, not died.  
So shall we skip over the introductions for now  
and work on living to see another day?  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Oh me, oh my!  
Life always is such a struggle!
