### Place: Esterella Road
  
**Narration：**  
Forced to retreat from the ruins of Elizabeth Park, the guild's  
members have all made it safely to the base of the mountain.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
One, two, three...  
Yep, looks like we've got everyone here, animals an' all!  
  
**Rin：**  
Whew... I sure am glad to be out of *that* mess...  
My feet are aching like heck from that rush down the mountain...  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey Shiorin, can you give my feet a little massage?  
A nice, gentle one?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Of course.  
You know, Rin...  
You talk like an old granny sometimes, don't you?  
  
**Lima：**  
No need to pamper her, Shiori—  
really, there isn't.  
  
**Lima：**  
Halfway down the mountain, Rin was already yelling  
\"I can't walk any further!\"  
 like a little child,  
so I wound up carrying her most of the way.  
  
**Lima：**  
Honestly, I swear...  
I was actually a little impressed by her efforts back there,  
but I suppose Rin will always be Rin.  
  
**Lima：**  
She's reverted back to her lazy old self in no time!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Eheheh...  
It's unnerving to see Rin working hard,  
so I'm actually relieved to see her slacking off again.  
  
**Rin：**  
Heheh!  
That's what I like to hear!  
Keep the rain of compliments coming!  
  
**Shiori：**  
I didn't exactly mean it as a compliment...  
But I really am relieved.  
It looks like barely anyone was injured in the end.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Even if the farm buildings back at Elizabeth Park  
are in a pretty awful state...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
So what if they are? Buildings ain't so hard to repair!  
Heck, we're totally insured against monster attacks!  
So this'll actually be the perfect chance to renovate!  
  
**Shiori：**  
You have a very tough spirit, Mahiru.  
I admire that about you.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Aw, shucks!  
But... I do feel bad that y'all had to go through this.  
Let's hope this is the first and last time.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
What the heck coulda gotten  
those monsters all riled up in the first place?  
That frenzy sure wasn't normal.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Those people from Nightmare  
said they'd look into that for us, didn't they?  
  
**Shiori：**  
They sent so many people over,  
and even escorted us all the way down here...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Haha...  
Nightmare has never been the kindest guild to beastfolk,  
so I didn't have a good impression of them before...  
  
**Shiori：**  
But they've been so good to us here.  
Perhaps they're not such bad people after all.  
  
**Rin：**  
You sure about that? For a rescue team thrown together  
on such short notice, they seemed weirdly well-prepared  
for the whole thing.  
Smells a bit fishy, if you ask me.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha...  
Do I hear a note of dissatisfaction with our efforts?  
My dear ladies of Elizabeth Park.  
  
**Rin：**  
Naw, you're hearing things.  
Thanks a bunch for escorting us and stuff.  
  
**Rin：**  
But while you're here, where are we s'posed to sleep tonight?  
Are you gonna rent us accommodations or something?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmmm...  
Humans and beastfolk are one thing,  
but with all these animals to account for as well...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Finding lodgings immediately may prove difficult.  
I'm afraid you may need to camp outdoors for tonight.  
  
**Tomo：**  
We will of course provide whatever supplies we can find  
in the way of tents and so forth.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Well, ain't that good news!  
I'm totally pooped.  
The sooner I can get some shut-eye, the better.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
By the way, you're, uh...  
Tomo from the Nightmare guild, is that right?  
A kid like you workin' so late... I'm mighty impressed!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Well, it is my sworn duty.  
  
**Tomo：**  
...And, ah... I apologize if this seems rude,  
but should I assume you are older than me?  
It feels odd to be talked down to by someone of your stature.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Y'uh-huh, I'm a good twenty years of age!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But point is, it's gettin' close to all our bedtimes.  
I can see a Little Miss Somebody is already dozin' off...  
So maybe it's time the lot of us called it a night, whaddaya say?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...Unhhh...  
...I'm not sleepy... I'm totally... awake...  
  
**Tomo：**  
It's okay, Matsuri, you can go back to sleep.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
No, no, no!  
I'm a member of Nightmare too, you know!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I can't just blow off work when my boss is working hard!  
No way!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Are you tellin' me this kid's in Nightmare too?  
I heard you've been short on new recruits...  
But are you really gettin' little squirts like this to do your work?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ah, no, this girl is more of a sort of apprentice...  
It's more like I've been forced to babysit her.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I was intending to leave her behind at the guard station,  
but she insisted on coming along.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Urghh... You can't just leave me out of this stuff!  
Hero's Code, Rule the Seventh!  
\"When evil looms, all heroes must assemble as one!\"  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hmm... I'd gotten it into my head  
that Nightmare wasn't on the best of terms with beastfolk,  
but doesn't this kid kinda look like a...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ahh! Aaahhhh!  
Don't finish that sentence!  
A hero's identity is meant to be secret! Secret, all right?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
...Well, ah... Setting that aside.  
Do you know where I might find a fellow  
named {player}?  
  
**Tomo：**  
He's been issued a direct summons from Her Majesty.  
So if possible, I'd like him to head to the palace  
at his earliest convenience.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
{player}?  
I'm pretty sure he went gallivantin' back up the mountain,  
lookin' for that Pecorine girl who's still missing.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I told him it's dangerous,  
and he oughtta stick with us for the time being...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But he ran off, saying he'd meet up with us back here,  
whether he finds that Pecorine girl or not.  
So if you stick around, you'll see him sooner or later.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Still, \"Her Majesty,\" though? You mean the ruler of Landosol?  
Whatever could a bigshot like that  
be wantin' with a fella like {player}?  
  
**Tomo：**  
I couldn't say. I'm afraid I'm just the messenger.  
But I do have some things to ask {player} myself,  
so I was hoping I'd be able to see him promptly...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Zzzzzz...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh, dear.  
It looks like Matsuri couldn't stay awake after all.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'd better go and take her back home.  
If {player} returns while I'm away,  
could you tell him to wait for me?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Sure, no problem!  
You take care o' yourself out there too!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Mmmmm...  
And that's the end of that! ...Is what I'd like to say,  
But I feel like there's still somethin' nasty in the air.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I only hope I'm wrong.  
Why can't the world just stay nice and peaceful?
