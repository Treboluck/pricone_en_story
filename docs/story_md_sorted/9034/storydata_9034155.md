**Pecorine：**  
Oh! Look at all this, Kokkoro, Karyl!  
There are beautiful flowers blooming all around us!  
How crazy is that?! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
You, getting excited about something other than food? Now that's rare.  
So you like pretty flowers too?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl! Miss Pecorine is a refined young woman.  
It is only natural that she would appreciate the beauty of nature.  
  
**Karyl：**  
No, wait! Don't let her fool you, Koro!  
You can't underestimate this girl's appetite!  
She thinks everything she sets eyes on belongs in her belly!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh! I knew it—these flowers are the kind that grow beans!  
Just look at all these juicy little morsels! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, Miss Pecorine...  
  
**Karyl：**  
What did I tell you?!  
Her nose for edible matter would make a dog's jaw drop!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? What's all this about doggies?  
Anyway, we should all sit down and eat!  
Thethe beanth are really goodhh! *munch munch* ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine, you should really empty your mouth before you speak.  
Also, consuming wild plants uncooked can lead to indigestion.  
I will prepare them once we get home, so please put those down for—  
  
**Pecorine：**  
W-w-wahh!  
 S-somebody heeeelp!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Pecorine!  
Wh-what's this? She's suddenly tangled up in vines!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl, take a look over there!  
At the other end of the vines...  
I believe  
 it appears to be a floral monster.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I-is it mad that I ate those beans without permission?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
No, I suspect it was using the beautiful flowers around us  
to lure in prey like a carnivorous plant.  
I never knew such monsters existed...  
 This is most enlightening.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't admire it!  
 The other pioneers  
have been exploring this area lately, so we should take it out!  
Come on! How long are you gonna stay all vined up?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
S-sorry about that, Karyl...  
Hnnngh... Yahhh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whew, I finally made it out! ☆  
Now, you guys, let's harvest some monster beans!
