## Subtitle: The Little Sisters' Secret Plan
  
**Shiori：**  
So this is the Tower of Luna...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Even the books I read rarely feel quite so mysterious.  
Can his memories really be hidden here...?  
  
**Rino：**  
Now listen up, Shiori!  
We can't breathe a word of this to Big Bro!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Of course, Rino.  
I understand the plan.  
Today's adventure is to be our secret,  
 at least from him.  
  
**Rino：**  
We're gonna find all his lost memories, the two of us together,  
and give him a big surprise!  
I call it Operation: Big Bro Memory Surprise!  
  
**Shiori：**  
V... very descriptive.  
Still, I'm feeling better than usual today,  
so if this will really help him, I'll do my best.  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, Big Bro, you just wait!  
We're gonna burn your world up the ground!  
  
**Shiori：**  
...Burn... his world?  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Huh?  
  
**Shiori：**  
...Could it be she actually said \"turn your world upside down\"...?  
I must have misheard, I suppose...?  
  
**Rino：**  
Heheh. I can't wait to see the look on his face!  
Right, Shio—  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What are you two up to?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rino：**  
Uwaaghh?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
...Ahh!  
  
**Rino：**  
Wahhh! Wait, Shiori, calm down, okay?!  
It's Big Bro! Just Big Bro, see?  
You can lower the bow and arrow now!  
  
**Shiori：**  
O-oh, I'm sorry! When I sensed danger, I reacted on instinct...!  
I was this close to letting a shot fly...  
  
**Rino：**  
Talk about reflexes...  
Those were the movements of a true hunter!  
  
**Shiori：**  
A-anyway, um...  
What brings you out here, {player}?  
  
**Rino：**  
Yes, what's this all about?!  
I wanted to surprise *you*, not get surprised *by* you!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I thought I smelled something good...  
`Tag 2`  
**Rino：**  
You... smelled something?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh... Could you possibly mean this?  
I brought a packed lunch to eat along the way...  
  
**Rino：**  
Whaaaa?!  
You followed the tasty smell of food all the way here?!  
I mean, I did think it smelled good too, but...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Are you... feeling hungry?  
It's a little early for lunch, but would you like some?  
  
**Rino：**  
...Wow, he's really wolfing it down.  
Just how hungry were you, Big Bro?  
  
**Shiori：**  
There's honestly no need to rush like that.  
Ohhh, now he looks strained... Do you need water?  
There's plenty here, so please try to pace yourself.  
  
**Rino：**  
Big Bro can be a bit of a rascal sometimes, huh?  
Though that's just another one of his charms... ♪  
  
**Choice: (3)**  How do you two know each other, anyway?  
`Tag 3`  
**Shiori：**  
Me and Rino, you mean?  
I met her a while ago at Elizabeth Park...  
  
**Rino：**  
Yep, on my shopping trip!  
We get some of our crepe ingredients from Elizabeth Park, you know.  
  
**Rino：**  
So we ended up chatting whenever I visit, right?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes. Both of us are archers,  
so we started out giving each other tips...  
And as we talked, it, um... turned out she knew you as well.  
  
**Rino：**  
Honestly, Big Bro, how do you know so many girls everywhere?  
  
**Rino：**  
Hmmm. Well, since you've found us,  
 no point hiding it.  
You'll just have to come along with us!  
  
**Rino：**  
Operation: Big Bro Memory Surprise is go go go!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Is that really an operation the \"big bro\" himself  
should be playing an active part in...?  
  
**Rino：**  
Let's not worry too much about that, Shiori!  
It'll be more fun with three of us, anyway!  
  
**Shiori：**  
I supposethat is quite true.  
It's... nice to be working with you, {player}.  
  
**Narration：**  
And so, with their bellies filled,  
the party of three set out to explore the Tower of Luna.
