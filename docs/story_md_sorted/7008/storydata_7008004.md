**Rino：**  
Hey, Shiori, are you OK?  
Your face is looking a little bit pale to me...  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm all right.  
I think I just overexerted myself a little bit...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Sorry to make you worry.  
Just let me catch my breath, and I'll be fine, I promise...!  
  
**Rino：**  
OK, let's take a quick break!  
 Or so I'd like to say...  
But I can still sense monsters around here...

Y-you're carrying me on your shoulders...?  
But won't that be an awful burden...?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm light, so it's fine?  
O-oh, I see...  
 Well, I suppose I'll accept the gesture, then...

A piggyback ride from Big Bro...  
 I'm a little bit jealous...  
N-no, no, no! He's only doing this for Shiori's sake!  
  
**Shiori：**  
U-um... After a little while,  
 could Rino trade places with me, maybe?  
  
**Rino：**  
R-Really?! You're sure, Shiori?!

I'm so high up, I can see for miles around!  
Shiori, thanks a bunch for trading places!
