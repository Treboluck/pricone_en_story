**Kokkoro：**  
The beast lies vanquished for now,  
but undead monsters do tend to reanimate.  
We may need to defeat it regularly from now on.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, it's not getting up for a while, right?  
Still, the heat here is killing me...  
I'm not built for this climate, so I'm starting to feel dizzy...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ah! Karyl, watch out! There's a cliff behind you!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Waaghh! That was close!  
Almost took a one-way dive into lava...  
 I guess I should say thanks.  
...Hey, you can quit it with the bear-hug now!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aw, why?! You're so cuddly, I don't ever want to let go!  
Why don't we take a dip in the hot springs next?  
  
**Karyl：**  
All right, all right, just let GO!
