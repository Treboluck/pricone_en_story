**Narration：**  
Having enjoyed their Halloween dance party until morning,  
the satisfied spirits finally depart the world of the living.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Now, we should clean up before we leave.  
I shouldn't rest until we're all done...  
But I'm feeling... well...  
 more than a little sleepy...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Ohh... Where could this strange light be coming from?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
It's really quite bright... Aaahhh!

**Shinobu：**  
So when someone asks me \"Trick or treat?\"  
I should respond \"Happy Halloween\"?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
And then I hand them some candy...  
 All right, then.  
Don't worry, I'm not having a hard time.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I just want to make sure I enjoy this Halloween event properly,  
since you so kindly invited me...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I'm not sure if I'll be able do it right...  
 But I'll do my best.  
  
**Girl：**  
Hey, lady! Trick or treat!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
That was fast...  
 Th-this is a little embarrassing, but...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Umm... Happy... Halloween.  
Here, have some candy.  
  
**Girl：**  
Yaaay! Thanks, lady!  
You too, Mr. Skull!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh, um... Y-you're very welcome...  
Father, did she just give you a head rub?  
  
**Boy：**  
Trick or treat!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh... H-Happy Halloween!  
  
**Boy：**  
Yaaay! Thanks!  
Hey, lady, can I touch your cool skull?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Huh?  
 Sure, if you like.  
  
**Boy：**  
Awesome!  
 Ahaha, it's all smooth!  
Thanks again!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...Hee hee.  
This is actually rather nice. It feels somehow comforting.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
And the children are so accepting of my father.  
It makes me happy.  
  
**Boy：**  
Whoa. What's this? The trees are shaking...  
  
**Girl：**  
Huh?! There's not even any wind!  
What's going on?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Hee hee. The spirits are getting up to their little tricks.  
They must have been drawn here by the Halloween excitement.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I'm afraid I can't give you candy,  
but I wish you all a happy Halloween as well.  
  
**Girl：**  
Hey, lady! Is it OK if I touch your skull again?  
  
**Boy：**  
If anyone can stop those trees shaking, it's Mr. Skull!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Ummm...  
\"Leave it to me. I'll stop 'em in their tracks!\"  
...That's what he's saying.  
  
**Boy：**  
Really?! All right, let's see it then! Rub rub rub...  
  
**Girl：**  
Wowww! You're amazing, Mr. Skull!  
Thanks for helping!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
And off the children go again.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Hee hee.  
Thank you, spirits, for letting my father have his special moment.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
\"That's my natural charisma at work\"?  
Hee hee. Maybe it is.  
I must say, Father, you're very popular today.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  He went viral on social media lately.  
**Choice: (2)**  The kids seemed to love him.  
`Tag 1`  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh? I had no idea...  
Father, it sounds like you're a real celebrity.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Hmmm?  
\"So the world's finally recognized my greatness!\" he says.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Shinobu：**  
Umm...  
\"Looks like even the brat's realized how great I am!  
That's the ticket!\" he says.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Hee hee. This is such an entertaining day.  
I'm having a whole lot of fun.  
  
`Tag 3`  
`image display end`  
**Shinobu：**  
Sorry to keep you waiting. The changing rooms were busy...  
Now, shall we head back?  
  
**???：**  
Ahhhh! That's her, no doubt about it!  
She's got the skull and everything!  
  
**Man：**  
Excuse me, miss! I'm from a TV station,  
and I was hoping for a quick interview! That's cool, right?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Huh?  
 U-um, I'm not sure I really—  
  
**Man：**  
We can film the whole thing right here! I'll set up the camera...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I-I'm sorry, I don't want any footage—  
  
**Man：**  
And we're rolling!  
I gotta say, it took forever to find you!  
The one and only spirit girl with the crystal skull!  
  
**Man：**  
The whole internet's been talking about you for a while now!  
Any comments you'd like to share with them?  
  
**Man：**  
Wait, wha... Did that skull just give off a flash?  
Ah! H-hey! My camera stopped working! What's going on?!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Let's run while we have the chance.  
`Tag 4`  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh... Y-yes, of course!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
*pant* *pant* *pant*...  
I think we must have lost him by now.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Thank you very much for leading me by the hand...  
Hmm? The hand...?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh! I-I can't believe I'm still holding your hand so tightly...  
I-I'm very sorry!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Huh? You were impressed by my father's magic?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh, it wasn't him who did all that.  
All he really did was give off a flash.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
It was the other spirits that stepped in to save us.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
\"Me and the guys, saving the day like an expert team!\"  
is how Father puts it.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Thank you all for your help.  
Happy Halloween.

**Ameth：**  
How was that? A little present from me!  
Did you have a nice dream?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I put it together based on your shared memories with Shinobu,  
  
but it was interesting how you acted this time.  
  
**Ameth：**  
A real paranormal experience on the night of Halloween...  
Hanging around Shinobu has its perks!  
I had lots of fun watching, too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, I'll see you around!  
  

---  
  
**Shinobu：**  
M-mnhh...  
 Huh?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh, I see... It was a dream.  
You were dreaming with me, were you, {player}?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Huh? What kind of dream was it, you ask? Well, let's see...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I distinctly remember holding his hand,  
but I'd feel awkward  
 explaining that...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Umm... It... it was a very happy dream...  
  
**Skullfather：**  
You were dreaming too, eh? In my dream, I was super popular!  
The kids all loved me to death!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
That said, brat! Even to help her escape,  
how dare you grab my Shinobu's hand?! Unforgivable!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...Father. I think you need to shut your mouth.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Aaargh! My daughter's a demon!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
U-um... It was only a dream... so don't dwell on it too much!  
W-well then, I should go!  
  
**Narration：**  
And with her face a little flushed from embarrassment,  
Shinobu quickly fled the scene.
