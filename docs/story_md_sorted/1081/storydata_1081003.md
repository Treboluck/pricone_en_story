## Subtitle: A Handmade Party
  
**Narration：**  
The citizens have gathered in the city for Halloween  
to throw a big dance party.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
What? You want to party and dance as well? I see...  
Yes, of course you do.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
That's right.  
The lingering spirits are watching the humans' dance party enviously...  
They seem a little lonely and forlorn.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I could offer to let them possess me like the couple before,  
but then only one of them could dance at a time...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I would love to help them somehow,  
but I'm not sure of the best way...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Huh? Let's go and find a place where they can dance?  
All right, then. I think I know just the spot.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
This is a spiritual hotspot that not many in my trade know about.  
It should be quite ideal for the spirits' purposes.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Good thinking, Shinobu! Nobody'll wander by here,  
and it's got plenty of open space for dancing!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Hmm... That said, we can't call it much of a party  
with only a few spirits.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Yes...  
 I suppose you're right.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
I reckon we oughtta put up a sign to advertise the party!  
One that'll get spirits flocking here!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
A sign?  
 Um... Let's see...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I'll try making some jack-o'-lanterns.  
They are the symbol of Halloween, after all.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
What's more, they attract benevolent spirits  
and repel those with evil intentions.  
They'll make the space much more agreeable.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I want to help!  
`Tag 1`  
**Shinobu：**  
Thank you, {player}.  
Well then, shall we visit a nearby farm?  
We need to find some pumpkins to work with.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
They were kind enough to provide us with  
a whole pile of pumpkins that were too bruised to sell.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I've never actually made a jack-o'-lantern before,  
but I'll see what I can do.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Mm... All right. Like this... and this, I suppose? There!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
How does it look?  
That should do for a first attempt.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It's scary!  
**Choice: (3)**  It's prettier than your dad.  
`Tag 2`  
**Shinobu：**  
Haha. I suppose I'll take that as a compliment.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I thought an impactful appearance  
might make its protective qualities more potent.  
So I made it nice and creepy.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Skullfather：**  
Better looking than me? It can't be... Er, I mean...  
Th-that's my daughter! A fine jack-o'-lantern indeed!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Hang on though, brat. Are you saying you think I'm \"pretty\"?!  
Blech! That's so creepy! Stay away from me!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Haha... Father seems rather pleased. Isn't that nice?  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Shinobu：**  
I do have a fair amount of experience with carving.  
I often have to craft cursed totems for work, you see.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
But don't worry. I didn't lay any curses on this pumpkin.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...Oh, I see now.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
No, it's nothing really. I just realized...  
I don't think I've crafted anything in this state of mind before.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
All I can think about is how happy I want the spirits to be...  
Carving with such purely positive intentions may be a first for me.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I do hope we manage to gather a lot of spirits for this party.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I want them to really be able to enjoy this special occasion...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
All right, let's get back to work.  
We still have lots of jack-o'-lanterns to make.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Phew... Looks like we finished in time.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I'll just go and light all the jack-o'-lanterns now.  
  

---  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Good evening, everyone.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I'm very happy to welcome you all  
to this special Halloween dance party.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
{player}, are you able to see  
the spirits that have gathered?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Clear as day.  
`Tag 5`  
**Shinobu：**  
Wonderful... The light of the jack-o'-lanterns  
is helping to manifest them in this world.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
So many spirits, gathered in one place...  
 It's beautiful.  
  
**Male Spirit：**  
Wooow! I never thought I'd find a party like this!  
It's almost as if I'm alive again!  
  
**Male Spirit：**  
Are you the ones who organized this event?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Yes, that's us.  
  
**Male Spirit：**  
You've given us a Halloween to remember! Thank you!  
  
**Female Spirit：**  
Oh...? Are you Mr. Skull?  
That couple who recently passed on told me all about you.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Wh-whoooaaa... T-talk about a hottie!  
  
**Female Spirit：**  
Would you care to dance with me?  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Oh! Oh yeahhhh! Would I ever!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Ahhhh... Tonight is Halloween! Happy Halloween!  
Now, let's dance the night away! The world's all ours tonight!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Just look at Father... Getting all excited... Hee hee.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I'm so glad... Everyone seems to be having a wonderful time.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
So, ah... Shall we join in with the dancing?  
It seems a shame not to.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Listen... I'd never have enjoyed this Halloween so much  
if it weren't for your help, {player}.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I never knew this season could be such a happy  
and heartwarming time of year.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I almost want to dance all night until the sun comes up...  
It's such a happy feeling.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Huh? You'd be happy to dance all night?  
Oh, wonderful. That means a lot.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Thank you for making this Halloween a truly magical time.  
  
**Narration：**  
Her cheeks tinged with pink as she took {player}'s hand,  
Shinobu joined the spirits in enjoying the party.
