# The First Battle of Love and Hope
Kasumi and Shiori have borrowed {player}'s power in order to transform into Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi and Magical Huntress Purely★Shiori. Conventional attacks won't work against the Antibeast, so they load their magic with the power of love and hope, and blow the monster to smithereens.
  
## Subtitle: The First Battle of Love and Hope
  
**Narration：**  
Kasumi and Shiori have transformed into magical girls.  
Clad in brand-new outfits, they face off against the assailing Antibeast.  
  
**Mora：**  
Congratulations on your transformations, you two!  
  
**Mora：**  
Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi!  
Magical Huntress Purely★Shiori!  
  
**Mora：**  
Two new magical girls are born!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
What's there to congratulate?!  
Why do we look like this?!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
You make us chant strange spells!  
You make us take on strange names!  
You make us wear strange clothes!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
So this is a magical girl's dress.  
It's so frilly and soft...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
It's embarrassing, but... kind of cute.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Shiori...?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Huh?  
Ah! Um... I didn't say anything...!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You both look cute.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Ahhh!  
A-avert your gaze, my faithful assistant...!  
Y-you're making it awkward...!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
I agree... Even though it's just you, {player},  
if you look at us for too long, then...  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Mora：**  
Ah!  
Get ready, the Antibeast is coming!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Eh? Er...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Look out, Kasumi!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Ah, oh,  
thank you, my dear Shiori...!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
My pleasure.  
I feel amazing since we transformed. Even if I become dizzy and collapse,  
I feel like I'll be able to get right back on my feet...!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
A-ahhh...  
Best not to fall over at all, wouldn't you agree...?  
  
**Mora：**  
Listen up—Shiori, Kasumi!  
The source of a magical girl's power is her love and hope!  
Use them to fight!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
There's just no logic, is there?!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
I'll give it a try...!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
You're in high spirits like never before!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
This shot is filled with love!  
Purely Arrow!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Purely Arrow?!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GGRRRRUOOOGHHHH...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
It's working...!  
  
**Mora：**  
Fantastic!  
Now it's your turn, Kasumi!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Y-you say that, but...!  
How do you expect me to move around dressed like this? It's futile...!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
It's all so new to me—I can't get my bearings...!  
Being a detective is what makes me who I am,  
but now I'm a magical girl?  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
I strive to be a great detective, hence why I always dress like one.  
But this magical girl facade...  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Wh-what am I... supposed to do...?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Do your best, Misty★Kasumi!  
`Tag 2`  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Ahhh!  
My dear assistant, I told you not to look at me!  
...It's far too embarrassing...!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
?!  
This is bad! My dear assistant!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
I-I have to protect him...!  
Misty Bullet!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GGRRRRUOOOGHHHH...  
  
**Mora：**  
Wahey!  
Look,  
the Antibeast is no more!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Somehow...  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...we did it, I think...  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Wh-what a relief... It was over much faster than I expected...  
Anyway, I'm already growing weary of this whole magical girl thing...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Oh.  
Kasumi, if you say that... the flow of the story...  
  
**Mora：**  
What are you talking about?!  
The battle has only just begun!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...Pardon?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...will  
go like that.  
  
**Mora：**  
The Antibeast you just fought wasn't even in its final form.  
It was surely testing you!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  What even is an Antibeast?  
`Tag 3`  
**Mora：**  
They appear in all sorts of places and spread misfortune.  
They came to my country and caused utter chaos.  
  
**Mora：**  
What they're after is... the power of love.  
They show up to take love away. So because one of them appeared here,  
it means that the city of Landosol is next!  
  
**Mora：**  
Kasumi! Shiori!  
I'm going to ask you one more time!  
  
**Mora：**  
Will you be the saviors this world needs  
and take on the mantle of fighting magical girls?!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Ah, uh...  
If you ask like that...  
we can't refuse, can we...?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
I want to do it.  
Because I like the city of Landosol.  
If I can be of use... then I'll fight.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Shiori...  
F-fine!  
Turning a blind eye to an ongoing case is a disgrace to the title of  
detective! I'll give it a shot.  
In fact,  
I'll show you how it's done!  
  
**Mora：**  
Thank you, both of you!  
And you... Sir Knight!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Point at yourself.  
**Choice: (5)**  Look behind yourself.  
`Tag 4`  
**Mora：**  
That's right! The fine sword at your waist; the dignified armor protecting  
your body! All with the gallant figure of one who has single-handedly  
rent many a battlefield!  
  
**Mora：**  
You are worthy of the title of Sir Knight!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...I sense a fair bit of exaggeration in that statement...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
He looks totally bewildered, doesn't he?  
...But I wouldn't say it's a lie.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
P-perhaps?  
...No, you're right. If one were to summarize his exploits in epic poetry,  
  
it could sound like that...

`Tag 5`  
**Mora：**  
Wow! Such modesty! You're a knight, all right!  
Never conceited; never arrogant; always willing to risk your life for the  
good of the people!  
  
**Mora：**  
You are worthy of the title of Sir Knight!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Heheh. You look embarrassed.  
But I don't think it's wrong.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
You persevere in the face of danger. Such a spirit is definitely  
worthy of being called knightly.  
...But don't you forget that first and  
foremost, you are my trusted assistant.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Mora：**  
With the ability to bestow power upon these magical girls,  
you, Sir Knight, are to us an indispensable ally!  
  
**Mora：**  
Please,  
lend us your strength!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  You don't even have to ask.  
**Choice: (8)**  Can I transform too?  
`Tag 7`  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
That was fast.  
I'm so glad we'll get to fight alongside you. I'll use my newfound  
magical girl power to ensure your protection in return.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Er... That means you'll be with us all the time, right...?  
J-just don't look at me so much...  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
My dear assistant! What are you saying?!  
I-I can't believe you're into this...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Well, I think it's good to be true to yourself...!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Shiori?!  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Mora：**  
Thank you, Sir Knight!  
  
**Mora：**  
Then it's settled!  
Using magical girl power, we will protect the peace in this city!  
  
**Both：**  
Wahey!  
  
**Narration：**  
Two magical girls and one heroic knight  
stood up for the peace of Landosol!  
Fight,Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi, Magical Huntress Purely★Shiori!
