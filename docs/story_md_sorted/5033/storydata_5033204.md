The air... feels heavy around here.  
I would usually get dizzy and collapse in a place like this.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
I see. Are you all right?  
Do you need me to hold your hand?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
No, I'm totally fine in this form.  
Thank you though, Kasumi.  
Sometimes, you're kind of like a big sister to me.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
N-no need for that, now.  
It's natural to worry about your friends.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Big sister... It doesn't have a bad ring to it.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
It looks like we're entering Antibeast territory.  
It's hard to tell what's up ahead, so we should proceed carefully.  
Vigilance is the foundation of hunting!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
R-right.  
...It feels like you're the bold one in this duo.
