# A Meeting of Love and Hope
Kasumi and Shiori face off against Shizuru, who controls the Antibeast. However, her overwhelming love pushes the girls into a corner, and things start to look dire. But when all seems lost, the townspeople's passionate support encourages them to stand back up, and bring about the battle's conclusion.
  
## Subtitle: A Meeting of Love and Hope
  
**Narration：**  
Kasumi and Shiori are weakened since Mora was snatched away.  
The power of Shizuru's love has made the Antibeast much stronger.  
The magical girls have been driven into a corner.  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
Now move out of the way,  
you magical nuisances.  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
My little brother needs his big sister.  
I have to protect him with my love.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...Something's wrong with Shizuru.  
Are her emotions getting out of control?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Could it be the oversized Antibeast's influence...?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Either way, we have to stop it.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Hmmm. You're not wrong, but...  
To be honest, the situation isn't exactly favorable.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Not at all. Since Shizuru snatched Mora from us...  
our power has been draining away bit by bit...  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
And in addition...  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
That thing is feeding off Shizuru's and Mora's energy and powering up.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
As things are... we don't stand a chance.  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
Then why not just give up?  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Wahhh?!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Aaahhh?!  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
You see?  
The difference in our power is already obvious.  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
Just do as you're told and hand over my little brother.  
He'll be totally fine.  
Big Sis just wants to take care of him.  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
It's not like I've been smashing up streets and injuring people, have I?  
  
**Mora：**  
No, you can't...!  
The more filled with love she is,  
the more powerful the Antibeast gets...!  
  
**Mora：**  
And that would be bad news for the city...!  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
Honestly! Stop talking about me as if I'm bad.  
You'll make me angry.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I want you to return Mora.  
**Choice: (3)**  Antibeasts are dangerous.  
`Tag 2`  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
Even if it's you asking, I can't do it.  
If I give it back, it will just get in my way again, won't it?  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
Not at all.  
When we're together, I feel like I can do anything.  
They're helping me to spread my love. They're good little pets.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
...*sigh*  
Why are you so unwilling to accept my love?  
You're gonna hurt my feelings.  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
Is it because of those magical girls?  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
My dear assistant—  
Urgh!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Look out—  
Ahhh!  
  

---  
  
**Mora：**  
Girls.. your transformations...!  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
And that's the end of the magical girls.  
They can't transform without this rabbit's power, can they?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Is this the end...?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
*pant, pant*... We can't... lose now...!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Escape while you can, my dear assistant.  
If you get caught, it truly will be all over.  
  
**Shiori：**  
...Even if our attacks don't reach,  
we can still buy you some time.  
Please try to escape...!  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
So you still want to stand in my way.  
...Fine!  
I'll show you both how much I love my little brother!  
  
**Both：**  
...?!  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
If I use their power, I'm sure I'll be able to  
share my love with everyone. ♪  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
And maybe one day, I'll share my love  
with all the people of Landosol... ♪  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Oh no you won't.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kasumi：**  
My faithful assistant!  
It's futile. You must flee... Flee!  
  
**Shiori：**  
I want to protect you...!  
But I don't have the power anymore...!  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
Come here, Little Brother. ♪  
And then let's share my love for you with everyone. ☆  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Mora：**  
Oh no...!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
That's not happening!  
Hyaaahhhh!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GROOAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Shiori：**  
The Antibeast stopped dead in its tracks...!  
And that voice...  
Hatsune?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hatsune is here! Sha-shing! ☆  
Anytime or any place, when my sister's in trouble, I'll be on the case!  
  
**Saren：**  
Is everyone all right?!  
  
**Saren：**  
The fact that {player} is here with you means that  
you two are those magical girls, right?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...  
I didn't realize that could give us away...!  
More importantly, Saren, what are you doing here?!  
  
**Saren：**  
We heard there was a huge monster rampaging around town.  
...The children insisted on coming to investigate.  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Where are those magical girls?  
  
**Girl 2：**  
A monster like that wouldn't stand a chance against them!  
  
**Saren：**  
Hey, don't get too close!  
You promised to keep a safe distance!  
  
**Saren：**  
...The children believe in you.  
They're utterly convinced they'll witness a magical girl rescue.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
And so they shall!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
No matter how strong the enemy, I will not yield!  
Should I be knocked down even a million times, I shall stand back up!  
That is what magical girls do!  
  
**Both：**  
Master?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ohohoh! If you want screen time, you've got to make it!  
Magical Girl Nanaka, dropping in to exceed your expectations!  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Huuuh? Something's off.  
  
**Girl 2：**  
I prefer the other two from last time.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
...Oh. I see. So it's like that...  
  
**Saren：**  
S-sorry about the children.  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
Heheh.  
It doesn't matter how many of you assemble.  
My little pet can only be defeated by magical girls!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wahhh! It's too strong!  
I don't think I can hold it back much longer!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Kasumin, Shiorin!  
After this, I have a favor to ask!  
  
**Shiori：**  
B-but... we can't transform anymore...!  
  
**Saren：**  
...You haven't given up, have you?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Shape up, my disciples!  
Have you forgotten everything I taught you?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Don't hang your heads!  
No matter what, always smile!  
Sha-shing! ☆  
  
**Choice: (6)**  ...What's that noise?  
`Tag 6`  
**Kasumi：**  
Eh...?  
  
**Man 1：**  
Hey, look, there it is!  
It's the enemy from the other day...!  
  
**Man 2：**  
The one that deflected all our attacks?!  
But it's nothing to worry about!  
Those girls will be here before long, for sure!  
  
**Man 3：**  
No doubt! Those magical girls are the protectors of the city!  
We'll do their job until they show up!

The townsfolk...?!

Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi!

We're waiting for you!

I can sense...  
immense love and hope emanating from them both...!

The power of your love is outstanding!  
You've both blown past my expectations!  
As a magical creature, I couldn't be any more proud!

...So you're all getting in my way then?  
Honestly! How arrogant of you to defy the Sister of Darkness!  
  
`image display end`  
**Mora：**  
The Antibeast is no more...!  
You did it! Talk about a resounding victory!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...*sigh*  
We won, my dear Shiori.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
We did...!  
Using our own power, we protected the peace in Landosol...!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Shiorin!  
I mean, Purely★Shiori! Misty★Kasumi!  
Congrats!

What a splendid display, magical girls!  
Thank you for protecting the city!

You were so cool, Purely★Shiori!  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Let's play again sometime, Misty★Kasumi!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Yes. The students have become the masters... Ladies, I've nothing left to  
teach you.  
Oh, by the way, are there any magical girl slots still available?  
I know just the woman for the job! Let's talk about it in more detail later!  
  
**Townspeople：**  
Thank you,  
Purely★Shiori, Misty★Kasumi!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
This is rather awkward.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
But it's not embarrassing... anymore.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...Indeed.  
  
**Mora：**  
You're both...  
already wonderful magical girls.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Mora, did you say something?  
  
**Mora：**  
No, nothing!  
I was just thinking how much I appreciate you both!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Don't just think it—say it.  
That's a much better way to communicate.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ungh... Guh...!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Catch her.  
`Tag 8`  
**Shizuru：**  
...H-huh?  
Little Bro...?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
What... am I doing here...?  
I had the weirdest dream.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Do you think... Shizuru doesn't remember?  
  
**Mora：**  
Her emotions were messed up by the Antibeast.  
Maybe it affected her memories too.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Urghhh. There won't be any aftereffects, will there?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Well, whatever. ♪  
Waking up in your arms is like a dream in itself. ♪  
Little Brother, you're my prince. ☆  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...It doesn't seem to have had any effect on her.

...  
Right.  
  
**Man 1：**  
Oh yeah, I came here to get the magical girls' autographs!

Whoaaa?!  
Things have taken a turn for the worse, Shiori! Let's get out of here!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Understood...!  
I'm right behind you!  
{player}! Mora! Let's go!

The duo defeated a formidable foe and fulfilled their roles as magical  
girls. Thank you, Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi, Magical Huntress  
Purely★Shiori. And...
