## Subtitle: Apprentice Magical Girls
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
We've gotten rather used to battling Antibeasts.  
I used to struggle with the rough stuff,  
but with magical girl power,  
even I can get it done.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Eh? My signature pose is cute?  
Wh-what the blazes are you trying to say?! It's not that I want to do it  
or anything, you know! My body just moves on its own...  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Hey, listen to me when I'm talking to you!  
Don't you dare try to run away!  
You can't escape from the Magical Detective!
