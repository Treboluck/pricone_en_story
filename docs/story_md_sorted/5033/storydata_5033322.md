**Purely★Shiori：**  
We did it!  
The Antibeast is starting to lose it, Kasumi!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
All right! Let's roast it while we can...  
Wait just a minute, Shiori!  
Something just appeared!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Are they Shadows...?  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Shiori's Shadow... And mine?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Right when we had the perfect chance...!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Obstacles are part and parcel of being a magical girl.  
We have to overcome them to grow.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
You're right! And magical girl doppelgängers...  
They're also featured a lot in the stories...!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
For some reason, you seem to be excited by all this...  
Well, an improved morale is surely a good thing.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
All right. Prepare yourself, Antibeast!  
We're coming for you...!
