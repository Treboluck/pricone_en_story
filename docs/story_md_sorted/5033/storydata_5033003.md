## Subtitle: Imbued with Love and Hope
  
**Narration：**  
Several days have passed since Hatsune's special training.  
Kasumi and Shiori have encountered an Antibeast while on patrol.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Misty, Theory, Truly!  
Magical Ribbon: Spiral!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Pure Heart Lock-On!  
Magical Arrow: Critical!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi.  
With a wave of my wand, I'm on the case!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Magical Huntress Purely★Shiori.  
My arrows of love won't miss your heart!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Mora：**  
Kasumi, Shiori!  
Take this sucker down!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
You don't have to tell us!  
Shiori, I'll stop it dead in its tracks!  
You can deal the final blow!—  
Misty Bullet!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Thank you, Kasumi!  
It's much easier to target now...!  
I'll take it out in one shot!—Purely Arrow!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GGRRRRUOOOGHHHH...  
  
**Mora：**  
Right on! Bull's-eye!  
You're both really getting the hang of this!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Yes.  
All thanks to Hatsune's special training.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
I'm not so sure that's something to be happy about.  
But actually, I'm not as embarrassed as before...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Stare at Kasumi.  
**Choice: (2)**  Sha-shing! ☆  
`Tag 1`  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
C-cut that out...  
I'm still not used to being gawked at...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
I agree.  
Um, especially when it's you—more than anyone else, it feels kind of...  
awkward when you look at us like that...

**Shiori & Kasumi：**  
Sha-shing! ☆  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Ah!  
...A conditioned reflex!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Our reactions have started to become natural...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mora：**  
I'm glad to see that your growth as magical girls is strong and steady!  
But there's still something you both lack.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
You really ask a lot, don't you...?  
What are we lacking?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
We're doing a good job with the Antibeasts,  
so what could it be that we still don't have...?  
  
**Mora：**  
The essence of the magical girl!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...Did you say \"essence\"...?  
  
**Mora：**  
Watching you both battle just now made me realize that your way of  
fighting is  
—how should I put this...?  
It's a bit like a well-coordinated hunt.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
And that's supposed to be a bad thing? It *is* battle after all.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Yes...  
Kasumi detects the enemy's weak point and makes an opening,  
which I take advantage of to turn its insides out...  
  
I think it's the perfect balance.  
  
**Mora：**  
If it's *just* fighting, then yeah, great.  
But... what we're talking about is *magical girl* fighting!  
  
**Shiori & Kasumi：**  
?!  
  
**Mora：**  
Sir Knight!  
Remind us what the source of a magical girl's power is, would you?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Love and hope.  
`Tag 4`  
**Mora：**  
Bingo!  
The source of a magical girl's power is love and hope!  
So imbue your magic with the everlasting power of love, and stand firm  
against your foes with the light of hope in your hearts!  
  
**Mora：**  
But all I can feel from you both currently when you fight  
is the intent to  
murder.  
Are you magical girls, or are you... barbarians?  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Why would you say that about a normal fight?!  
  
**Mora：**  
But it's really important.  
If you don't fight the way a magical girl should so that your spectators  
can feel your love and hope, then I can't call you qualified!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
He's right. When I read Magical Girl Bella-Lou,  
I only ever experience excitement when she fights.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Yes, that might be the case for mass-market children's entertainment...  
But I have an inkling that I can't win this argument.  
  
**Saren：**  
You two over there, do you have a minute?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Y-yes?  
You mean us, right...?  
  
**Saren：**  
Yes, you two.  
You're the magical girl duo that's become the talk of the town, correct?  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
The talk of the town...?  
Well, it's to be expected, looking like this...  
  
**Mora：**  
Our exploits are becoming well-known!  
That's a good thing!  
  
**Saren：**  
...Huh? {player}?  
Are you with them?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'm helping them.  
**Choice: (6)**  I'm a magical girl.  
`Tag 5`  
**Saren：**  
Heheh. As always, you're helping others.  
That's just like you.

`Tag 6`  
**Saren：**  
What?! Really?!  
I mean... it's a joke, right? You're not a girl, are you?  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Saren：**  
But if {player} is working with you,  
we might be able to conclude this matter quickly...  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Hmm. By the looks of it, there's something you'd like to ask of us.  
Am I correct?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Is there something troubling you...?  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh no, nothing's troubling me.  
But I do have a request for you magical girls.  
Do you think you could possibly...  
  
**Saren：**  
...pay a visit to the children at the orphanage?!  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Wooow!  
Real magical girls!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Uh, nice... to meet you.  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Your clothes are so cute!  
So this is the real thing!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
U-urgh... Regardless of whether this is the place that's taking care of  
my dear assistant,  
th-this is a bit too much...!  
  
**Mora：**  
Come on ladies, remember to smile!  
This is your chance!  
It's a great opportunity to acquire what we talked about earlier—  
the essence of the magical girl!  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Hey, hey!  
How exactly do magical girls fight?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Huh? Uhhh...  
With this bow, I target the vitals...  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Vitals...?  
Y-you're kinda scary...  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Miss, you're looking at the ground an awful lot.  
Are you feeling unwell?  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
What? Uh, n-not  
particularly...  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Then you're doing it all wrong—  
magical girls need to smile more!  
  
**Saren：**  
Wonderful! Everyone looks happy.  
...Thank you for accepting my request.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  I did it for love and hope.  
`Tag 8`  
**Saren：**  
...R-right.  
I don't know much about being a magical girl, but it must be tough.  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Miss magical girl, show us some magic!  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Miss magical girl, strike a pose for us!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Uh, um, magic is a bit too dangerous...  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Striking poses  
is still traumatic for me...  
  
**Mora：**  
I knew it.  
They still have a lot of homework to do.  
  
**Saren：**  
...I don't dare ask, but what in the world is that creature?  
  
**Saren：**  
But still... magical girls, huh?  
I've read books about them to the children before,  
but I didn't expect they actually existed.  
  
**Saren：**  
I wonder if I could... become one as well.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Do you want to?  
`Tag 9`  
**Saren：**  
Wh— You heard that?!  
No, don't misunderstand! It's not that I want to become one.  
I just thought that maybe it would make the children happy if I did...  
  
**Girls：**  
Eeeeeek!  
  
**Saren：**  
?!  
What?! What happened?!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Mora：**  
It's an Antibeast!  
You two, transform— Oh wait, we can skip that part!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
My dear Shiori, shall we?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
We shall, Kasumi!  
  
**Saren：**  
That weird thing is your enemy?!  
Wait a minute—the children are too close...!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Wahhh! Mama Saren!  
  
**Girl 2：**  
I'm scared stiff! I-I can't move...!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
This is bad.  
We have to do something about the children first!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
But everyone's in such a panic!  
At this rate—  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Remember the essence of the magical girl!  
`Tag 10`  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
My dear assistant...?!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
The essence of the magical girl, you say...?!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
E-everybody!  
Please...  
look at me!  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
I am the Magical Huntress, Purely★Shiori!  
And now, using my magical powers, I will do away with that big, scary  
monster!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
With this arrow filled with love!  
Take this—Purely Arrow! ♪  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GGRRRRUOOOGHHHH...  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Wooow!  
Purely★Shiori, you're amazing!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Shiori...!  
I can't let you have all the fun now, can I?!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Pay attention, children!  
It's Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi's mystery show!  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Mystery...?  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Precisely.  
Now, watch carefully. That big, scary monster?  
Elementary! This Magical Detective sees right through it!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
The fiend's weak spot is  
right here!  
Hopeful penetrator of mysteries: Misty Bullet!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GGRRRRUOOOGHHHH...  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Misty★Kasumi is so cool!  
She destroyed the monster in zero seconds flat...!  
  
**Saren：**  
...What a splendid battle, ladies!  
I can't believe you can make children smile while you're fighting.  
  
**Saren：**  
So that... is what a magical girl is.  
  
**Mora：**  
Yep, yep!  
This time I felt so much more love and hope than before!  
Slowly but surely, they're growing into true magical girls...!  
  
**Saren：**  
...I don't dare bring it up,  
but I feel like this little creature doesn't really do much.  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Hey, hey, Purely★Shiori!  
Show us some more magic!  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Misty★Kasumi!  
Let us see your victory pose!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Eheheh. Okay, but you have to stand back.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
I-I can't say no, can I...?  
How about this? You like it?  
  
**Narration：**  
Through connecting with the children, the magical girl duo learned about  
love and hope. Soon they would surely go mainstream!  
Shine brightly, Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi, Magical Huntress Purely★Shiori!
