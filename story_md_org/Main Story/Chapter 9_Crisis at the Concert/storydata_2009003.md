**Jun：**  
That concludes my report.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Good work.  
Continue to keep this information under control.  
  
**Karyl：**  
The recent large-scale mobilization of our forces, including Nightmare...  
  
**Karyl：**  
...was all for the purpose of exterminating monsters  
that spread a deadly disease.  
  
**Karyl：**  
These monsters were controlled by the terrorist group, Labyrinth.  
We thus dispatched our royal forces  
to eliminate monsters and criminals alike.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Spread this story well, and make the public believe it.  
At the scene, I left evidence that will back it up,  
so I doubt there will be any problem.  
  
**Karyl：**  
The citizens of Landosol rarely leave the city walls.  
There should be next to no witnesses.  
So why should they doubt the words of their ruling class?  
  
**Karyl：**  
And any doubts they do have will soon be forgotten.  
  
**Karyl：**  
After all, before falling into her slumber,  
Her Majesty had already planted magical devices throughout the city  
to bend the people's thoughts to our wishes.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Unquestioning, undoubting, the people will go on  
simply living their peaceful lives.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That said, we do need to act quickly.  
Only Her Majesty can power those devices.  
So now, without her to support them, they'll grind to a halt before long.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Before then, we must eliminate all Her Majesty's enemies.  
The bodies of the Labyrinth rebels have yet to be found...  
It's still possible they escaped alive.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Scour every acre.  
If necessary, put a bounty on their heads.  
Just see that you capture them.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Worst case, you can even kill them.  
Seeds of disaster should be nipped in the bud early.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I leave the search and capture or extermination of the rebels  
in the hands of Nightmare.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Use all the military forces this country commands.  
This is what we pay your hefty maintenance fees for.  
  
**Jun：**  
I see a few clear problems.  
In fact, there may be nothing *but* problems.  
  
**Jun：**  
Certainly, Labyrinth and that young ma—  
er, their associates...  
may be reprehensible enemies of the throne.  
  
**Jun：**  
We have yet to find any proof of their criminal activities,  
yet somehow I feel sure. Sure that this is justice...  
Still, that fact aside...  
  
**Jun：**  
It seems to me rather unwise  
to dedicate a large proportion of Nightmare's forces  
to capturing them at this time.  
  
**Jun：**  
At this time, so soon after Christina's sudden defection,  
Nightmare's military might is depleted.  
  
**Jun：**  
When we first apprehended her, she put up quite the wild fight,  
and many are still injured.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Did I not provide reinforcements?  
  
**Jun：**  
Yes—greenhorn soldiers with no experience.  
Right now, and to be frank, for some time,  
they will be of little use in battle.  
  
**Jun：**  
And we also have many injured  
from the more recent confrontation with Labyrinth.  
  
**Jun：**  
Outside the city, we can make use  
of the monsters you control, Your Majesty,  
but it would hardly be prudent to let them roam the city streets.  
  
**Jun：**  
As a rule, monsters represent evil and terror.  
The other day, just a small monster invading the city  
caused quite the panic, yes? A monster army would be far worse.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmph...  
For starters, I am only a regent representing the monarch,  
so do not call me \"Your Majesty.\"  
  
**Jun：**  
Ah, my apologies, Madam Regent.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Very good.  
 You're right, monsters do seem like a bad choice.  
I'll assign the monsters I control  
to hunt for Labyrinth members outside the city walls instead.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Inside the city, you should rely mainly  
upon Nightmare's elite knights who you have personally trained.  
You do still have some reliable fighters, don't you?  
  
**Jun：**  
A few, yes.  
However, our movement will be limited, I'm afraid.  
The weekend after next, there is to be a great festival held in the city.  
  
**Jun：**  
It has been held every year since the nation's founding.  
We can hardly cancel it, and the preparations  
and required security will keep us very busy.  
  
**Jun：**  
We will have next to no manpower to spare for a search operation.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Tch, I'd forgotten all about that...  
No wonder the city seems so noisy lately.  
A festival... I'd love to simply cancel or delay the blasted thing.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But these seasonal events are quite popular.  
The people look forward to them. Canceling it too hastily  
would sow seeds of doubt and resentment towards the palace.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Besides, Her Majesty has already seen fit to invite  
a number of esteemed visitors from foreign lands.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Come to think of it,  
Her Majesty seemed surprisingly fond of festivals and ceremonies.  
  
**Karyl：**  
The city is one thing, but even Her Majesty's power  
can't cover other countries... If we start acting strangely,  
the guests will notice and begin to doubt us.  
  
**Karyl：**  
To an outsider, the unusual state of Landosol's affairs  
will be all too apparent.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'd rather not invite suspicion,  
so I suppose the festival will have to be held as planned.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Showing weakness as a nation is never a wise move politically.
