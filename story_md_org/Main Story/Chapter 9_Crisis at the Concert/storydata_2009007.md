## Subtitle: A Quiet Homecoming
  
### Place: Landosol Plaza
  
**Narration：**  
As a result of their strategy meeting,  
{player} and Kokkoro have decided to operate  
separately from the members of Labyrinth.  
  
**Narration：**  
By approaching the situation from different angles,  
the hope is that they will have a greater chance of uncovering  
a means to oppose the might of the palace.  
  
**Narration：**  
To that end, and since they have nowhere else to go,  
they find themselves once more on the streets of Landosol.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. Well, we have returned to Landosol without issue,  
but how should we proceed from here, my lord?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What do you want to do?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well...  
I suppose my personal suggestion  
would be to first secure the basic necessities.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Since we stand in opposition to the palace,  
we may be listed as wanted criminals...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It would not be wise to return  
to the Sarendia Orphanage at present.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I would hate to disturb those kind people's peaceful lives  
with such awfully dangerous concerns.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
However, given Miss Saren's personality,  
I expect she will be very worried about us,  
so I would like to covertly deliver a letter to her when possible.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
\"Due to certain circumstances, we cannot return at present.  
If anyone from the palace asks after us, please ignore them.  
There is no need to worry.\" ...That should suffice, I think.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If I use my messenger crows,  
delivering it should not be a difficult task.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
At any rate,  
since we cannot use the Orphanage,  
we will need to find somewhere else to stay.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I could certainly handle camping outdoors if necessary,  
but I would like to provide  
as healthy and civilized a life for you as possible, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Let us at least find a roof over our heads...  
and a soft bed for you to sleep upon.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Do you have any ideas for a suitable location, my lord?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  We could stay at a hotel?  
**Choice: (3)**  We could stay at the guildhouse?  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm...  
Just like when we first arrived in the city,  
the hotel life is one viable option, yes.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I suppose it is the obvious choice... But our faces would be  
seen by the hotel staff, and we would leave records.  
Besides which, hotel accommodation does not come cheap.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We must be careful with our finances.  
We may have amassed some savings,  
but the bank where they are stored is a state institution.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If we are wanted as criminals,  
simply trying to withdraw funds may get us arrested.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As such... I would much prefer  
to make efficient use of the cash we have on hand.  
We will spend where we must, but let us avoid unnecessary expenses.

`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, yes...  
 True enough, the Gourmet Guild guildhouse  
is always open to us, and equipped with beds.  
It may be the perfect spot for us to hide out for a while.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Though all guildhouses  
are managed by the Guild Association, a state-run service.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As we are now enemies of the palace,  
we should try to avoid relying upon such public institutions.  
We would not want to leap headfirst into our enemies' waiting arms.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And as a member of the Gourmet Guild herself,  
Miss Karyl is certainly aware of its location.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Sadly enough, she is among our enemies now,  
so it would be dangerous to take refuge there.  
We should find a safer location that is known only to us.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Hmm.  
I have considered various options, but I feel we are at an impasse.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This situation... Being enemies of the palace itself  
is more troublesome than I realized.  
To be frank, all our options seem perilous.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I must admit, I find myself at a loss for how to proceed.  
As your guide, sworn to show you the way, this makes me feel  
so helplessly ashamed...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Pat Kokkoro on the head.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh...  
Again you strive to comfort me, my lord...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh.  
You are right. There is no use in being despondent.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine...  
 Our precious companion  
is being held captive by the enemy.  
No matter what it takes, we must rescue her.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And I am also most concerned about Miss Karyl's situation.  
To begin with, let us seek out a base of operations,  
and investigate however we can in order to devise a strategy.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thankfully enough, we are not alone in this world.  
The members of Labyrinth are working towards the same goal.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Although I understand  
they are taking care not to stay in one place for too long...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So it will sadly be difficult for us to get in contact  
with them directly.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Haha. Many struggles lie ahead,  
but we must stay strong in the face of them.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I may not be as reliable a guide as you deserve...  
But I swear I will always do everything in my power to aid you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Or rather...  
I will always stand by your side, my lord.
