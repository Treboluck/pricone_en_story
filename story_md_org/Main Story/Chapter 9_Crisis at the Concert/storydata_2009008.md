## Subtitle: An Unexpected Encounter
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...?  
There seems to be some kind of commotion nearby.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What could it be? This is quite the crowd of people.  
And also... I think I hear the sound of musical instruments?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Is somebody putting on some manner of performance in the plaza?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I know this song. It's Carmina.  
**Choice: (2)**  You want to go and check it out?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
C... \"Carmina\"?  
What does that refer to?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ehmm...  
So some friends of yours may be playing those instruments?  
Out here in the plaza? But... for what purpose?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. I do feel somewhat curious,  
but since we find ourselves on the run...  
It may be better to avoid such heavily populated locations.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Matsuri：**  
...Ahh! There he is!  
Over here, Tomo! I just spotted {player}!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh!  
 Very nicely done.  
You have a nose for these things, Matsuri.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Heheh, that's my beastgirl—  
Uh! I mean!  
I've always had a pretty strong sense of smell, that's all!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
This skill has gotta be pretty valuable  
for a member of Nightmare, right?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Yes. Thanks to you,  
we were able to find {player} much sooner than I expected!

**Kokkoro：**  
...?!  
Both of you... are knights of Nightmare, yes?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
How terrible!  
We should flee, my lord!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahh...  
H-hold on a minute!  
  
**Tomo：**  
I think you're misunderstanding us.  
We're not here to capture you or anything.  
Honest, I swear! You can trust me!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I gotta say, Tomo, you're sounding real suspicious there...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord! Follow me!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
While we stand in opposition to the palace,  
Nightmare, Defenders of the Throne,  
represent a dangerous threat that we must avoid at all costs!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Who can say what they may subject us to?!  
If we value our lives, we must flee at once!  
  
`image display end`  
**Tomo：**  
Oh boy. We're really not inspiring much trust, are we?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Well, I can't blame you for reacting this way.  
If what the Little Lyrical girls said is true,  
you may indeed be mortal enemies of the guild we call home.  
  
**Tomo：**  
So I guess this really is a lot to ask, but...  
Please trust us.  
Matsuri and I, at least, aren't your enemies.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
That's right!  
{player} is a precious friend to me!  
He understands me like nobody else!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Friend, you say? What nerve.  
If you want our trust, first release our *real* friend...  
Return Miss Pecorine to us at once!  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'm afraid that's not quite so easy.  
Thing is, the palace itself is in a really bizarre state...  
Nobody there seems to be quite themselves right now.  
  
**Tomo：**  
And at our lowly ranks, we can't even set foot in the palace.  
Releasing your friend Pecorine from whatever cell is holding her  
is far beyond our abilities.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In that case, we have even less reason to exchange words with you!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Wow, we're unpopular.  
So... what now? We *could* take them by force...  
  
**Tomo：**  
But causing a scene here  
might draw the attention of other knights of Nightmare.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Maybe it's best to withdraw,  
and try to get in contact later in a different way.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? We're not gonna go after them?  
It looks like they're planning to lose us in that huge crowd!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
If we wanna catch 'em, we gotta move fast before they disappear!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmm...  
What exactly is all this commotion?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ah...  
Looks like those \"idols\" who've been the talk of the town  
may be putting on a concert?
