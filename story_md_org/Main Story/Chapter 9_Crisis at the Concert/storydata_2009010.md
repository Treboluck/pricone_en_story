**Chika：**  
...?!  
Oh... Oh no!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wh-what's wrong?  
You seem to be kind of losing your focus there... Chika?  
I know it's the first day... Are your nerves getting to you?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'll bet Mr. Knight did something inappropriate to distract her.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Like blowing a kiss...  
He does do the most ridiculous things when you least expect it.  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh—ah, no... {player} seems to have vanished  
into the crowd again, I think...  
But listen, everyone. There's an emergency.  
  
**Chika：**  
I had noticed the spirits were becoming restless, but...  
Oh, this is terrible!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hm? What's this about, Chika?  
You've gone white as a sheet!

**Chika：**  
L-look, over there!  
Beyond the crowd of fans, next to Landosol's main gate...  
There's something very unsettling.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Huh? Whoa... there's some kind of massive creature!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
What is that? A monster?  
I've never seen anything like it!  
  
**Chika：**  
Th-the monster is heading directly towards the stage!  
This is bad! We have to evacuate the fans!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You're right...  
Urgh... I don't want to call off the first concert of our tour...  
But safety comes first! We can't put our fans at risk!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Let's try to avoid a panic situation  
and lead them calmly to safety!

**Nozomi：**  
Hey, guys!  
 Listen to me!  
We need you all to slowly turn and look behind you!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You see that big monster over there?  
It looks nasty,  
 so keep calm and follow our staff to safety!  
The concert will have to wait!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Don't worry—we'll start back up once everything's safe!  
But for now,  
 stay calm and evacuate for us, OK?  
Be careful not to push or shove anyone on the way out!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...? A monster?  
Ohhh... That really does look like a huge beast.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Whyever did none of us notice it until now?  
Were we so entranced by the idols' performance  
that it was able to sneak up undetected?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I feel so ashamed.  
What should we do, my lord?  
For the moment, shall we do as they say and evacuate?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
H-h-h-hey, Tomo! It's a monster!  
And look! That thing sure doesn't look like a pushover!  
  
**Tomo：**  
...I know.  
I suppose our search for {player} will have to wait.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Matsuri.  
Can you hurry to the Nightmare guard station  
and report this emergency as quickly as possible?  
  
**Tomo：**  
I doubt we can defeat a monster that size without backup.  
I know that Nightmare has been acting very strangely of late...  
  
**Tomo：**  
But let's hope the others haven't lost sight  
of their duty to protect the people, at least.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Until backup arrives, I'll try to buy time by distracting the monster.  
I'm counting on you, Matsuri. Now go on! Get moving!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wait! No! I'll help you fight!  
With a monster that size in the city, it'll have been reported already...  
There'll be help on the way for sure!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmm...  
I was hoping to avoid putting you on the front lines...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Urgh...  
Apprentice or otherwise, I'm a member of Nightmare!  
I want to join the fight to protect everyone!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahhh...  
Well, if that's what you really want, I guess I can't stop you.  
  
**Tomo：**  
But please don't be reckless.  
Getting yourself killed won't help anyone,  
and I don't know what I'd tell your parents if you got hurt.  
  
**Tomo：**  
That said, well... There's no time to stand around talking.  
Let's engage that monster like our lives depend on it.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I am Tomo, Knight of Nightmare!  
In the name of justice, I stand and fight!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Whoa, talk about a fearless charge!  
You're the coolest, Tomo!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Right, now it's my turn...  
 Huh?  
  
**Chika：**  
La la la laaaa~♪  
  
**Matsuri：**  
U-uh, lady?  
What're you doing? The concert's off, remember?!  
It's dangerous here! You gotta evacuate too!  
  
**Chika：**  
You're the one who should get to safety.  
Please don't worry about us.  
We're actually quite accustomed to defeating monsters.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Yeah!  
We're Carmina, the all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting idol guild!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
If that monster thinks it can gate-crash our concert,  
we'll just have to teach it a lesson!
