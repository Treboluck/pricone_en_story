**Christina：**  
Hmm. A little explaining may be in order.  
  
**Christina：**  
I was actually born in a nation far across the waves.  
I call this land home now, but I am not native to it.  
  
**Christina：**  
I earned a peerage here through services to the state,  
which allowed me to join Nightmare as a noble...  
But in essence, I am a mere foreigner.  
  
**Christina：**  
And as luck would have it,  
there's an influential private foundation in my homeland  
with which I have, let's say, certain connections.  
  
**Christina：**  
So I contacted them, and was able to secure some funds.  
Using this capital, along with all my cunning wiles,  
I secured a position as Carmina's producer.  
  
**Christina：**  
That said, it's a temporary contract for the duration of this tour.  
Mentoring idols does have its appeal...  
  
**Christina：**  
But as an escaped convict, I can't make myself too conspicuous.  
And my true calling lies, as ever, on the field of battle.  
  
**Christina：**  
The idol industry may be a battlefield in its own way,  
but steel upon steel and the scent of fresh blood are more my style.  
Anyway, that aside...

**Christina：**  
I didn't take this position  
out of some kind of mad whim or fancy.  
  
**Christina：**  
Naturally, since I have taken it on,  
I have every intention of making Carmina's tour a great success...  
  
**Christina：**  
But my true purpose here lies elsewhere.  
  
**Christina：**  
The weekend after next, when the Landosol Festival begins,  
the secret society Labyrinth will strike.  
My task is to set the stage for them.  
  
**Christina：**  
The details of the plan won't be set in stone until the last minute,  
so I'll just lay out the basics.  
On the day of the festival, Labyrinth will attack the palace.  
  
**Christina：**  
Their ultimate goal  
is to assassinate or capture their greatest nemesis, Eustiana...  
  
**Christina：**  
But at minimum, they mean to destroy the brainwashing apparatus  
that she has concealed within its walls.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  \"Brainwashing apparatus\"?  
`Tag 1`  
**Christina：**  
Yes.  
A magical device that apparently lies within the palace.  
  
**Christina：**  
It seems that Karyl and the members of Nightmare  
are being controlled by its influence.  
  
**Christina：**  
If Labyrinth can destroy it, the enemy's might will be decimated.  
After all, magical persuasion is the only thing securing that tyrant,  
Eustiana, the support she needs.  
  
**Christina：**  
With the spell broken, her forces will rebel.  
Eustiana will be left defenseless...  
  
**Christina：**  
Ideally, until that day,  
she will remain unconscious like our friend Labyrista.  
If so, assassinating her should prove most simple.  
  
**Christina：**  
Personally, I would prefer  
to hear her scream and beg for her life at my feet...  
  
**Christina：**  
But our foe is the head of a nation.  
I should not let myself get too greedy.  
  
**Christina：**  
It seems that Masaki, who is currently taking refuge with Labyrinth,  
was contacted by a duplicate of his mistress, Neneka.  
  
**Christina：**  
How she did it, I cannot say,  
but despite being imprisoned in the palace,  
she found a way to make contact.  
  
**Christina：**  
Based on the intel she provided,  
Labyrinth made the call to take action at the festival.  
  
**Christina：**  
I currently find myself allied with Labyrinth,  
and I owe them for saving me from the dungeon.  
Our interests also align, so I will do what I can to aid them.  
  
**Christina：**  
If you are willing, your help would be welcome also.  
  
**Christina：**  
The day of Labyrinth's attack on the palace  
will also be the perfect opportunity  
to rescue Tiana—your friend Pecorine—from her plight.  
  
**Christina：**  
Labyrinth will prioritize eliminating the enemy  
and destroying the apparatus above all else.  
They may not have time to rescue Pecorine as well.  
  
**Christina：**  
Which is why that role falls to you.  
  
**Christina：**  
Prepare yourselves as best you can,  
and when the time comes, join Labyrinth's attack on the palace,  
and strive to rescue your captive guildmate.  
  
**Christina：**  
Whether you act or you don't,  
Labyrinth's attack will go ahead as planned.  
It's entirely up to the two of you whether you take action.  
  
**Christina：**  
But personally, I'd like to see Pecorine go free.  
She's always a fun one to play with.  
And of course, she's committed no actual crime, has she?  
  
**Christina：**  
A girl like her doesn't deserve  
to rot away in a dingy underground cell.  
  
**Christina：**  
...For now, that's about all I can tell you.  
I'll be in touch, or our other allies will, in the days to come.  
  
**Christina：**  
Let's exchange what information we have,  
and do our best to support one another's efforts.  
  
**Christina：**  
Though until this girl... Kokkoro, was it?  
Until she opens her eyes, I suppose you can do little but worry.  
  
**Christina：**  
...By the way, I'm afraid we know very little  
about the monster that attacked her.  
It seemed to be a high-level beast that is rarely sighted in these parts...  
  
**Christina：**  
I suspect Karyl, with her authority over monsters,  
may have sent an order to all the beasts she could reach  
to mount the attack upon you specifically.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ordinary monsters will have been turned back  
by the guards at the city entrances...  
But perhaps that beast was strong enough to penetrate their defenses.  
  
**Christina：**  
And so it came for you.  
Carmina and the others were simply caught in the fray.  
  
**Christina：**  
To be clear, this is Karyl's fault,  
so there's no reason for you to blame yourself.  
  
**Christina：**  
Regardless... you may be safe in here, but leave the city walls,  
and chances are high you'll be attacked by monsters again.  
  
**Christina：**  
Unless you have good reason,  
I would advise against venturing out for now.  
You'd surely die. You aren't exactly a fighter, are you?  
  
**Christina：**  
And right now, even your loyal guardian Kokkoro  
isn't here to protect you.  
  
**Christina：**  
I do hope she makes a swift recovery.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You're actually worried about us?  
**Choice: (3)**  You're very kind.  
`Tag 2`  
![200901301.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/200901301.webp)  
**Christina：**  
What do you take me for?  
A bloodthirsty demon with no trace of human emotion?  
The sight of a little girl in pain is nothing less than a tragedy.  
  
**Christina：**  
I know I'm hardly the benevolent type,  
and I enjoy carnage more than most...  
But it's not as though I have any great love for undeserved suffering.  
  
**Christina：**  
If everyone can live in happiness, of course that's best.

`Tag 3`  
![200901301.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/200901301.webp)  
**Christina：**  
That may be the first time anyone's told me that.  
  
**Christina：**  
You're a strange one, boy.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Christina：**  
Ah well.  
I'm on the run as well, so I shouldn't stay too long.  
  
**Christina：**  
I'll meet up with Carmina  
and slip along through the warp gate to another nation.  
  
**Christina：**  
While I'm abroad, beyond the reach of the palace,  
I'll continue my preparations for the coming conflict.  
I don't enjoy running and hiding, but for now, it will do.  
  
**Christina：**  
Until the fruit of revenge is ripe, I'll lick my lips and have patience.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahh, but that day will be so sweet!  
When it comes, this whole nation will be reborn!
