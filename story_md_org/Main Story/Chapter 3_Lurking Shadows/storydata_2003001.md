## Subtitle: Our Humble Abode
  
### Place: Sarendia Orphanage
  
**Saren：**  
I'm home!  
Have we all been good boys and girls?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ahhhh!  
W-w-welcome back,  
 Mama Saren!  
  
**Saren：**  
Please don't call me "Mama"... I've told you enough times.  
I'm still only seventeen years old, you know?  
  
**Saren：**  
Anyway, I'm afraid I'm absolutely starved right now...  
There aren't any leftovers from dinner around, are there?  
Otherwise, I suppose I'll order takeout...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh, y-you don't have to do that!  
Big Sis Suzume said she'd be coming back late  
because she had work to do today...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
So she made a whole bunch of food for us this morning...  
So, so, um...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Th-there's still some left to eat!  
I-I'll go heat it up for you right now!  
 ...Wahhh?!  
  
**Saren：**  
Careful now!  
There's really no need to rush, Kurumi!  
  
**Saren：**  
Actually, I can heat up the food myself...  
It's getting rather late, so you should hurry along to bed.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ahhh! B-but...  
I don't wanna go sleep when you've come home for once...  
I-I wanna stay up and talk... Ahhhh...  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh... Well, sure!  
Let's sort out the food together, shall we? We can chat while we do.  
I'm sorry I've been so busy lately. Were you lonely?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Umm... E-everyone misses you a bunch...  
  
**Saren：**  
I see...  
Don't worry, though, it's only for a little while longer.  
  
**Saren：**  
Well, I got caught up in a real spot of trouble today,  
so I can't say anything for sure...  
But you know nothing is more important to me than you kids!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Awahhh?!  
Mama Saren, don't suddenly hug me like that!  
Th-that's really tight!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ummm...  
Should we perhaps go somewhere else?  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh! I'm sorry.  
I didn't mean to leave our guests waiting in the hall...  
  
**Saren：**  
Let's see.  
We have a few empty rooms to spare, so I'll show you to them.  
  
**Saren：**  
Go ahead and carry your luggage inside.  
I'm sorry for the trouble, but could you make the beds yourselves?  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm afraid it won't exactly be a first-class hotel suite...  
But you'll be safe from the elements, at least.  
I'm sure you must both be very tired, so do get some rest.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, and I almost forgot my manners!  
As the lady of the house, I should give our guests a proper greeting.  
Welcome to our humble abode, the Sarendia Orphanage!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm.  
Since we left the hotel today,  
we've been swept along through all sorts of events, haven't we?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You must be tired, my lord.  
I have prepared the bed for you,  
so please lay yourself down.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Worry not.  
I will bring our belongings over from the hotel tomorrow,  
so for the time being, just rest and recover your energy.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's nice of them to let us stay here.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed. Miss Saren is a kind young woman,  
so we could hardly turn down her offer  
to let us stay at the Sarendia Orphanage.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And it was getting rather late  
for us to travel back to the hotel at any rate.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Besides, we cannot keep sleeping at hotels forever.  
It is far too expensive a lifestyle for our meager assets.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If Miss Saren is willing to provide us with accommodation  
for next to no rent at all, we could scarcely ask for more.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
She said it was the least she could do to apologize  
for getting us mixed up in all that trouble, but...  
Well, let us take her up on her offer, at least for tonight.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Though she said we could stay for as long as it takes  
for us to get our affairs in better order...  
I'm not sure it would be right to impose on her to that extent.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And we do not yet know the people here well enough  
to be certain they can be trusted, either.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Saren's a trustworthy person.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well, I will not question your judgment, my lord.  
Please, do as you will.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
No matter what happens,  
I will always be by your side, ready to protect you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Although right now... I must confess,  
I too am rather tired from all we have been through.  
I should probably get some rest myself.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Good night, and sweet dreams, my lord...

**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm?  
Is something the matter, Miss Suzume?  
  
**Suzume：**  
W-well, of course something's the matter!  
Maybe you're not that old yet, but still,  
a young man and woman, sleeping under the same sheets?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ahhh...  
Don't tell me... you're in *that* kind of relationship?!  
  
`image display end`  
**Kokkoro：**  
What kind of relationship would that be?  
As you can see, my lord and I  
are a perfectly ordinary master and retainer.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Naturally, my lord is defenseless while he sleeps,  
so I take the liberty of accompanying him to bed,  
the better to protect him from harm.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The sooner I can react to danger, the better.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Also, as my body temperature is above average,  
my lord tells me that it comforts him to have me close.  
Just like  
 a big hot-water bottle, he says.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So, ah... Is there something wrong with that?  
  
**Suzume：**  
There's everything wrong with that!  
It's not like the two of you are family or anything, right?!  
It's positively scandalous! What if the children were to see you?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
We've prepared a separate room for you, Kokkoro,  
so please sleep in your own bed!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Come along, now!  
Quickly, before the children see anything!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm.  
I am not sure why you have become so flustered,  
Miss Suzume...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord and I have always slept in the same room since we met.  
It would have doubled our hotel costs to rent separate rooms.  
And we have had no trouble thus far...  
  
**Suzume：**  
That sounds like nothing *but* trouble!  
Honestly, you two could do with a little common sense...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Sorry...  
`Tag 3`  
**Suzume：**  
Well, it's nothing to apologize for, I guess...  
Come to think of it,  
you said you have amnesia, didn't you?  
  
**Suzume：**  
That must be why you've forgotten these basic things.  
I suppose there's no helping it under your circumstances.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Still, I can't let the two of you sleep in the same bed here...  
Kokkoro, your room is just across the hall.  
So please, could you sleep there tonight?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Must I really?  
I would rather not leave my lord's side if at all possible...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Please don't be childish about this.  
I can see how you might feel lonely, but...  
If you need company, I could stay in your room instead!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm.  
Why is staying with my lord such a problem,  
but not with you, Miss Suzume?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I'm afraid I do not follow.  
Though I appreciate the offer,  
it is my lord whom I must protect, not you...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, this is ridiculous...  
I don't even know how I should begin to explain...!  
Whatever am I to do?  
  
**Suzume：**  
At any rate!  
Milady is waiting for you in the dining hall,  
so you should head down and have a bite to eat.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Though I suppose you can go straight to bed if you prefer.  
You're both going to be staying at the Sarendia Orphanage  
for a little while, right?  
  
**Suzume：**  
So I'm sure we'll all have plenty of opportunity  
to chat together in the days ahead!
