**Saren：**  
The city where we live, Landosol,  
is the capital of the nation that has ruled this land,  
the continent of Astraea, for many years.  
  
**Saren：**  
It's a very old-fashioned nation, ruled by a traditional monarchy,  
so the royal family is in charge of pretty much everything.  
  
**Saren：**  
The royals live in the palace at the city's center.  
Everything is administrated from there, from national politics  
to public services and the Tower of Sol.  
  
**Saren：**  
You've probably heard of Princess Knight—  
that's what we call the guilds that serve the royal family.  
  
**Saren：**  
The postal service, police, fire service, flood protection...  
All those kinds of services that exist for the citizens' benefit  
are run by guilds under the Princess Knight banner.

**Suzume：**  
Come to think of it,  
where does the name \"Princess Knight\"  
actually come from, anyway?  
  
**Suzume：**  
When we met that girl Muimi...  
 or Novem, I guess...  
She had a really weird reaction to that name...  
  
**Saren：**  
Hmm, where indeed? I think it came from some kind of old legend.  
If you're interested, you could try looking it up at the library.  
I could probably get you access, even to the restricted sections.  
  
**Saren：**  
That Novem girl, though... I'm worried about her, too.  
She was abducted by a group calling themselves Labyrinth, right?  
Perhaps I should see what information I can dig up about them.  
  
**Saren：**  
But let's get back on topic.  
Nightmare, Defenders of the Throne, is one of those guilds  
under the Princess Knight banner...  
  
**Saren：**  
And as the name suggests, their main role is to protect the palace.  
Like an elite guard for the royal family.  
  
**Saren：**  
You could call them the monarchy's main military asset.  
They haven't had much to do lately, with the world at peace,  
but in times of war, they're the ones on the front lines.  
  
**Suzume：**  
So they really are like an army...  
That's so scary...  
  
![200200201.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/200200201.webp)  
**Suzume：**  
That extravagant lady who led the attack on Caon  
seemed really strong, and fierce too.  
If she's a soldier, I guess that makes sense...  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, you mean Christina.  
There's actually a lot we don't know about her background...  
  
**Saren：**  
But, well, Nightmare is a venerable guild,  
full of royals and nobility.  
So I'm sure her credentials must be respectable enough.  
  
`image display end`  
**Saren：**  
At any rate, though crime rates have been a little high lately,  
there hasn't been a real war in Astraea for a long time now.  
We're lucky enough to live in a peaceful age.  
  
**Saren：**  
So naturally, there hasn't been an awful lot  
for military forces like Nightmare to do.  
They've had some real issues with budget cuts and downsizing.  
  
**Saren：**  
That's probably what's got Christina worked up  
to the point that she wants to start a conflict herself.  
  
**Saren：**  
If war were to break out,  
Nightmare would be the first to benefit.  
Their scope would be expanded for sure.  
  
**Saren：**  
They'd be able to seize back all the power they've lost,  
taking them from their current position as a declining guild  
straight back to their former glory.  
  
**Saren：**  
I imagine that's what Christina is trying to achieve.  
Though it's only speculation on my part.  
There could be some kind of deeper reason I'm not aware of.  
  
**Saren：**  
By the way, due to our historical position and demographics,  
this country has always been dominated by humanfolk.  
Other races, like beastfolk, elves and demonfolk, are clear minorities.  
  
**Saren：**  
In other areas of the world,  
I hear there are countries ruled mostly by other races...  
  
**Saren：**  
But here in Landosol, at least,  
those races can have a tough time getting by.  
  
**Saren：**  
So among those minority populations,  
there are those who bear resentment towards humanfolk.  
  
**Saren：**  
If one of those factions were to get wind of this incident,  
there's a danger it could incite them to violence.  
  
**Saren：**  
And that would be bad news for sure.  
Once it's race against race, we could have a civil war on our hands.  
  
**Saren：**  
There's no telling how hellish it could get.  
If other countries started to get involved,  
the whole world could descend into the flames of conflict.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wha...?! S-surely there's not going to be an actual war?!  
I don't know anyone who thinks of other races as enemies...  
Haven't we always all got along?!  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm just talking about the worst-case scenario here.  
Tensions aren't high enough that it's inevitable or anything.  
  
**Saren：**  
And there hasn't been much in the way of overt discrimination  
against other races in recent times.  
  
**Saren：**  
My own elvish family was even able to earn a noble title, after all.  
Though that's mostly thanks to my father flashing his money around.  
  
**Saren：**  
Still... Whenever you have differences in culture or religion,  
different ideologies coexisting, there's always the danger of war.  
I'm afraid human history makes that all too clear.  
  
**Saren：**  
So in my opinion,  
it's best to always be prepared for the worst possible outcome.  
  
**Saren：**  
At any rate, when Nightmare launched an attack on Caon,  
a guild belonging to the Menagerie,  
who represent beastfolk interests...  
  
**Saren：**  
They set up a clear conflict between beastfolk and humans.  
Exactly the kind of spark that can lead to war.  
  
**Saren：**  
If they learn that their fellows have been wronged...  
Not only the Menagerie, but also beastfolk from other regions  
could start to rise up in protest.  
  
**Saren：**  
If it goes too far, war is a real possibility.  
That's why I want to settle this matter before it comes to that.  
  
**Saren：**  
If this goes no further than a guild conflict, so much the better.  
But we can't change the fact that the attack took place.  
If I can help smooth things out, staying up all night is a small price to pay.  
  
**Saren：**  
Because when war breaks out, the weak are the first to suffer.  
Women, the sick, the elderly, children...  
I don't want to risk innocent people being ravaged by bloodshed.  
  
**Saren：**  
Honestly... If it was going to come to this,  
maybe I should never have resigned from my position  
in Nightmare to begin with.  
  
**Saren：**  
If I was still around,  
I would never have let Christina pull a stunt like this.

**Suzume：**  
Milady...  
You've hardly touched your food. Eat up before it gets cold, OK?  
Here—say \"aah\"!  
  
**Saren：**  
S-Suzume! Stop that! You're embarrassing me!  
Honestly... I was trying to have a serious discussion...  
  
**Suzume：**  
You always forget to eat when you get too heated up, milady.  
So I need to make sure you get your fill!  
You should eat up too, {player}! Say \"aah\"!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Aah!  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzume：**  
Wow... Not a moment's hesitation!  
I thought you'd act a bit more embarrassed...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  More, please!  
**Choice: (3)**  Did you [i]want[/i] me to get embarrassed?  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzume：**  
Go ahead, eat up as much as you like!  
Though my cooking isn't, um, anything special...  
  
**Saren：**  
You really don't have much confidence there, do you, Suzume?  
Do you want me to give you some cooking tips?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ahhh...  
It's just a little weakness of mine. It always has been...  
I have been doing my best to improve, but...  
  
**Saren：**  
Ahaha...  
You tend to get flustered when you try too hard, don't you?  
Maybe you'd improve more quickly if you took it easy!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Suzume：**  
Well, it's not like I was trying to tease you...  
But when I think about it for a second,  
it's a bit weird to be feeding a guy who's older than me.  
  
**Suzume：**  
There's just something about you, {player}!  
Something that gives me the urge to take care of you!  
  
`Tag 4`  
`image display end`  
**Suzume：**  
Oopsie, I guess I took the conversation off topic...  
You probably don't know about this,  
so I was thinking I should explain, but...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Before she came here,  
milady was actually a member of Nightmare.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Because they're a military guild,  
Nightmare use the title \"Captain\" for their guildmaster...  
And milady was the vice-captain—their second in command!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Wow, Saren, you're a real bigshot!  
`Tag 5`  
**Saren：**  
Oh, not really. I just inherited my father's position.  
  
![200300301.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/200300301.webp)  
**Saren：**  
The thing about Nightmare is,  
they have a policy of hiring nobles to fill their important roles.  
And nouveau riche though we are, my family does have noble status.  
  
**Saren：**  
With all the people they'd had to let go,  
Nightmare was running really short on viable candidates.  
  
**Saren：**  
So that's how I ended up as vice-captain.  
There just wasn't anyone else for the job.  
  
**Saren：**  
But really, in this peaceful age, what's the use in a military position?  
There wasn't really anything for me to do there,  
so I came up with an excuse to resign.  
  
**Saren：**  
Like I said before,  
the Princess Knight guild alliance  
includes all sorts of different official public services.  
  
**Saren：**  
That includes charitable institutions,  
such as a guild responsible for taking care of war orphans.  
  
`image display end`  
**Saren：**  
In recent years, that guild had only existed on paper,  
and wasn't assigned any funding at all.  
  
**Saren：**  
But I took it upon myself to restore it, naming it the  
Sarendia Orphanage, and running its operations myself.  
It's a better use of my time than lazing about in the palace, right?  
  
**Saren：**  
Recently, there's been a mysterious phenomenon known as \"Lost\"  
where people's relatives seem to vanish off the face of the earth.  
Many children with Lost parents have been left with nowhere to turn.  
  
**Saren：**  
Perhaps you knew this already, since Kurumi's one of the victims...  
But I've been taking in those children and looking after them.  
  
**Saren：**  
I want to give them a chance at happiness,  
the opportunity to make a worthwhile life for themselves.  
That's the aim of this guild, the Sarendia Orphanage.  
  
**Saren：**  
Personally, I'm quite proud of the job I chose.  
It's a worthy cause.  
One I'd be happy to devote my life to pursuing.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  You're incredible, Saren.  
`Tag 6`  
**Saren：**  
Thank you.  
 But to be honest, I'm really not all that.  
For all my ideals, I haven't managed  
to achieve half of what I'd like to.  
  
**Saren：**  
Still, to protect and raise these children...  
I'll do anything that's in my power.  
  
**Saren：**  
First of all, I'd better go and give those warmongering idiots  
  
a proper talking-to!  
I can't let anyone stain our children's futures with bloodshed.
