**Suzume：**  
If you don't remember what happened that day...  
Then you're not milady at all!  
  
**Suzume：**  
The milady who told me my embarrassing nosedive  
had helped her to relax and focus on her speech...  
Who said my klutziness always made her smile...  
  
**Suzume：**  
The milady I respect and serve  
would never forget how she smiled at me that day!
