# Chapter 2 Episode 4
Suzume's employer Saren intervenes in Christina's rampage. In deference to her own predecessor as Nightmare's vice-captain, Christina halts her attack and retreats. All-out war between beastfolk and humanfolk has been averted.
  
## Subtitle: Festivities' End
  
**Christina：**  
Oh? Already you've adapted to my abilities?!  
What wonderful opponents you are! Keep it up!  
I should hope this dance is just getting started!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah! An opening!  
Now is our chance! Excuse me, if you will!  
  

---  
  
**Christina：**  
...Whoa?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
She's lost her balance! We can't let this chance slide!  
Let's finish her, Kaori!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'm with you!  
This is the end of the line! Get ready for your punishment! ☆  
  
**Christina：**  
Nghh...  
Tch... What's this?  
My Absolute Offense and Absolute Defense are failing me?!  
  
**Christina：**  
I can't avoid all their attacks... I have to block!  
How irritating... I'm rather fond of this outfit, you know!  
  
**Christina：**  
What happened?  
That runt... Did she throw a spear from the back lines?  
  
**Christina：**  
In ordinary circumstances,  
I should be able to evade a sneak attack like that without issue...  
Was I having so much fun that I slipped up?  
  
**Christina：**  
Or is there something else...?  
Something special about you?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh?!  
What is that glint in her eyes?  
Th... those are not the eyes of a sane individual!  
  
**Christina：**  
This is what it is to be human.  
The greediest of creatures, slaves to their own desires.  
  
**Christina：**  
But how intriguing...  
 You look like just an ordinary girl, yet...  
Can it be that you are \"special\" like myself and Her Majesty?  
  
**Christina：**  
Or was this mere coincidence?  
Perhaps I just let my guard down for a moment,  
and that was why your attack succeeded.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah well... The truth will not be difficult to uncover.  
You, girl. Come with me.  
  
**Christina：**  
I will examine you at my own leisure.  
Once I dissect your every organ, no secrets will remain!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Stand in front of Kokkoro.  
**Choice: (2)**  Lend Kokkoro your power.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
M-my lord?  
Are you trying to protect me?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You must not!  
You possess hardly any combat abilities of your own...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If you draw the attention of such a dangerous woman,  
you will surely not survive!  
You will be d-dissected! Or worse! It does not bear thinking of!  
  
**Christina：**  
How rude. What do you take me for?  
It's almost as though you think me some kind of villain.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh?!  
Y-you are providing me with energy to fight, my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I... I am most grateful.  
To tell the truth, I was on the verge of collapse...  
But now I feel ready to face any opponent.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Do your worst, villain!  
As long as I have my lord's blessing, I shall not lose!  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh? A villain, am I?  
You're getting feisty all of a sudden, girl.  
  
**Christina：**  
You seem to have quite the soft spot for that boy...  
Hahaha... Is this what they call the power of love?  
A force that can give even the puniest bunny a lion's fangs!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
L-love is not what drives me!  
No... This is the strength of my loyalty, as my lord's retainer!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hahah...  
No need to be embarrassed! Life is short, and love a rare jewel!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Makoto：**  
Hey, where the hell do you think you're looking?!  
Your opponents are right here!  
  
**Christina：**  
Tch... I seem to be surrounded. How tiresome.  
Perhaps I should call my subordinates around the building  
and have them charge in and storm the place?

**Saren：**  
With all due respect, I must intervene!  
Cease this petty feud at once!  
It's the middle of the night! You'll wake the neighbors!  
  
**Suzume：**  
M-m-m-milady?!  
  
**Saren：**  
Suzume, are you all right?  
I heard Caon had taken you into their custody,  
so I came rushing as soon as I could!  
  
**Saren：**  
Now, what exactly is going on here?!  
Are you safe?  
You're not hurt, are you?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Oh, it's Saren.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Another of your acquaintances, I take it.  
I fear my surprise has been exhausted at this point, my lord.  
  
`image display end`  
**Christina：**  
Well, hello there, Miss Saren.  
Or should I call you \"former vice-captain\"?  
  
**Saren：**  
Christina... As I passed through,  
the other Nightmare members filled me in on the basics  
of what you came here to do.  
  
**Saren：**  
I hear the captain is most displeased with your unauthorized actions.  
Perhaps you would be so kind as to withdraw for the moment?  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh, if I must.  
While I can hardly claim my appetite has been sated...  
  
**Christina：**  
I suppose I did achieve my basic objective here.  
The idea of defying you and striking down everyone in this room  
is still quite tempting…  
  
**Christina：**  
But the fact of the matter is,  
I'm quite fond of my current position within Nightmare.  
I'd rather hold on to it if I can afford to.  
  
**Christina：**  
And if I were to lay a finger on you,  
I'm sure the other members would never speak to me again.  
You were quite popular, weren't you, \"former\" vice-captain?  
  
**Christina：**  
So, for the sake of future festivities...  
I suppose there are times when we must exercise self-control.  
  
**Christina：**  
Yes, you win. I'll withdraw for tonight.  
I have an intriguing new concern to investigate now, anyway.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh...?!  
  
**Saren：**  
Hey!  
Don't glare at the poor little girl like that.  
  
**Saren：**  
Just so you know, I'll be reporting your conduct.  
The upper echelons of Princess Knight will hear of this.  
You're not above the law, and I won't let you do as you please.  
  
**Christina：**  
I'll keep that in mind, my dear.  
Now if it's all right with you, I'll take my leave.  
  
**Christina：**  
Tonight was more fun than I've had in a long time!  
Let's play again sometime, my pretties!  
  
**Christina：**  
Until then...  
Adieu!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey! Hold it!  
After the royal mess you've made here,  
you think you can just happily stroll out?!  
  
**Maho：**  
Makoto. Let's not push our luck.  
She's leavin' us alone for now, so we should count our blessings.  
  
**Maho：**  
More to the point, let me see where you've been hurt.  
I'll fix you up in a jiffy. Come along, Kaori, you too!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Coming!  
Although I'm not really scratched up too bad!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I get the feeling that woman was holding back on us...  
If she was really serious, both me and Makoto  
would be wandering spirits in Nirai Kanai right now!  
  
**Makoto：**  
You serious? That wasn't even her full strength?  
Dammitall... What does she take us for?!  
  
**Maho：**  
It was kind of freaky how strong she was, wasn't it?  
Facin' down the both of you with one hand behind her back...  
Somethin' doesn't seem quite right there.  
  
**Maho：**  
I don't suppose our new visitor has any insights, hmm?  
'Cause it sure did sound like you've got your own history  
with those Nightmare folks.  
  
**Saren：**  
Don't worry, I'll explain everything soon enough.  
But before I do...  
  
**Saren：**  
Thank goodness you're all right, Suzume!  
I was worried out of my mind for a while back there!  
  
**Suzume：**  
M-miladyyy!  
I... I... I was so scared!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I feel like today,  
I've been through enough trouble for a whole lifetime!  
I-I thought my head was going to explode!  
  
**Saren：**  
There there, you poor thing.  
I'm sorry I couldn't show up sooner.  
  
**Saren：**  
Honestly, though.  
I'm not sure what it is, but there's something nasty in the air lately.  
Signs of conflict everywhere, just when the world seemed peaceful.  
  
**Saren：**  
I only hope it clears up soon.  
I'd rather not see any dark clouds over our children's futures...
