The guild Nightmare attacks the Caon guildhouse. Their battle-crazy vice-captain, Christina, has mounted an offensive under the pretense of saving Suzume, a fellow member of a Princess Knight-allied guild.
  
## Subtitle: Let the Banquet Begin
  
**Suzume：**  
Wh-what's going on?  
Why's everyone looking so scary all of a sudden?  
  
**Maho：**  
Shh...  
Keep your voice down, please.  
We've got ourselves a little emergency.  
  
**Maho：**  
This might turn into a battle,  
so y'all had probably best be keepin' your distance.  
  
**Maho：**  
Mmm... Not good. I tried a little threat-detection spell,  
and it looks like the guildhouse is totally surrounded.  
Any sudden movements, and they'll probably strike...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh? Huh?!  
Wh-wh-what's all this about?!  
  
**Maho：**  
Well, it's an enemy attack, o' course.  
Though I'd like to think us Caon folk  
are a pretty peaceful bunch on the whole...  
  
**Maho：**  
Whoever could it be that's after us?  
I can't see how we coulda provoked this.  
...Hmm?  
  
**Kaori：**  
I can hear footsteps!  
They're coming in right through the front gates!  
All righty then, I'll show them what's what!  
  
**Makoto：**  
H-hold it! Hold it!  
It's me!  
 Don't go on the attack!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ohhh?  
Makoto! Talk about bad timing!  
You were almost on the receiving end of my karate moves!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ahaha...  
Well, I'm glad to see you're all ready and itching for battle.  
If you were lazing about like usual, they'd wipe out the lot of you.  
  
**Maho：**  
And which \"they\" are we talkin' about, exactly?  
We're still not sure just what's goin' on here.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Well, ahh...  
I'm not sure we really have much time for explanations.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Let's just say this whole thing is totally my fault!  
I'm real sorry!  
If only I hadn't been so rash... Ugh, I'm such an idiot!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What do you mean?  
`Tag 1`  
**Maho：**  
I'm not sure I follow, but don't blame yourself, darlin'.  
Us Caon folks always stick together.  
We ain't gonna hold it against you if you messed up a little.  
  
**Maho：**  
What's your problem is our problem.  
So let's all see what we can do to help.  
Could you start by explaining? The short version is fine.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Uh-huh.  
 Well, something didn't seem right with Octo.  
So I was giving him a proper grilling, you know?  
And, well... I think I figured out what's really going on.  
  
**Makoto：**  
It looks like Octo...  
Well, he wasn't lying about trying to capture that girl  
called Muimi or Novem or whatever...  
  
**Makoto：**  
But the whole thing was more complicated than he was letting on.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I did think he was going a bit far to capture a single girl.  
Setting up those magical mines, and bringing all those goons...  
I should've realized something was up from the start.  
  
**Makoto：**  
And I mean, sure, me and Octo knew each other,  
but we'd never been close enough that he'd come to me for help.  
Not under normal circumstances.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Point is, there was someone else pulling the strings.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Octo was just a means to an end for the real mastermind.  
And they sure seem to have had him wrapped around their finger.  
Must've had some dirt on him or something, I guess?  
  
**Makoto：**  
'Cause that whole attack on the carriage...  
It was a crazy thing to do, even for Octo.

**Makoto：**  
Whoaah?!  
Coming in through the wall?! Was that really necessary?!  
This lady... She's from Nightmare, right?!  
  
**???：**  
Oh, I suppose I should introduce myself, shouldn't I?  
I'm not usually much for fancy etiquette,  
even if they do call us \"royal knights.\"  
  
**???：**  
But since you're all about to die,  
I suppose you deserve to hear the name of your executioner.  
  
**Christina：**  
I am Christina Morgan.  
The gallant and beautiful vice-captain  
of Nightmare, Defenders of the Throne.  
  
**Christina：**  
Tonight,  
I am here to exterminate a pack of mangy beasts  
who have been besmirching our streets.  
  
**Christina：**  
Now, who wants to be the first to die?  
I'm a kind woman, so I'll let you choose the nature of your demise!  
Ahahahahah! ☆  
  
`image display end`  
**Makoto：**  
Where do you think you get off, you pig?!  
You've got a lot of nerve, mounting an attack on our guildhouse!  
Trying to start a war, are you?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Well, if it's a fight you want, I'll give you one!  
Bring it on!  
  
**Maho：**  
Calm yourself down a little, Makoto.  
You mustn't fight her. That's just what she wants.  
If you do, we really will have a war on our hands.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Don't try to stop me, Princess!  
You think words are gonna stop this maniac?!  
Look at all the minions she's brought, armed to the teeth!  
  
**Makoto：**  
They're not gonna hold anything back!  
If we don't take 'em down, we're done for!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hahah!  
You certainly seem eager, mongrel.  
 Hoping to die first, are you?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Say what?!  
You sure think a lot of yourself, don't you?  
Go ahead and try to kill me, if you dare!  
  
**Maho：**  
D-do you really gotta rise to every little provocation?  
Makoto, can you not try to cool your head for once?  
  
**Maho：**  
Ahhh... Miss Christina?  
As the Guildmaster of Caon,  
I'd very much like to hear your business here.  
  
**Maho：**  
I trust you have an explanation for all this?  
Bursting into another guild's private territory so brashly...  
I'd think someone of your standin' would know better.  
  
**Maho：**  
Now, I know you Nightmare folks  
are in direct service to the royal family...  
But that doesn't mean you can just do whatever you please.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ohhh...  
Ahahah, you're a feisty one!  
  
**Christina：**  
I'll give you credit for facing me down without fear,  
but you should show a little more respect!  
When you spit at the heavens, you only dirty your own face!  
  
**Christina：**  
As you just said yourself...  
We have the monarch of this land behind us! The backing of royalty!  
Nightmare, Defenders of the Throne, are justice incarnate!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Don't bother, Princess.  
There's no point trying to negotiate.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Like I was saying, they set us up good.  
You know that, uh, maid girl over there?  
We should never have attacked that carriage with her inside.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh?!  
A-are you talking about me?  
I'm sorry! This isn't my fault, is it?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
No, I wouldn't pin any blame on you.  
The problem is the guild you belong to.  
  
**Makoto：**  
You're a member of a guild  
that belongs to the Princess Knight alliance, aren't you?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Um, yes...  
I'm a member of the Sarendia Orphanage guild...  
And we are affiliated with Princess Knight...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Though really, it's only on paper...  
We don't really have much to do with them in practice.  
  
**Makoto：**  
These guys don't really care how strong your affiliations are.  
What matters to them is that the attack on the carriage  
was carried out mostly by us—by members of Caon.  
  
**Makoto：**  
And like most beastfolk guilds,  
Caon's allegiances lie with the Menagerie.  
You're aware of that much, right?  
  
**Makoto：**  
The real issue here is that there's nothing but bad blood  
between the Menagerie and Princess Knight.  
We've had plenty of run-ins with them in the past.  
  
**Makoto：**  
With tensions running high, this was all the excuse they needed.  
We went and lit the fuse  
for an explosion waiting to happen.  
  
**Makoto：**  
As far as they're concerned, the attack on that carriage  
was a direct attempt by the Menagerie  
on the life of a Princess Knight guild member.  
  
**Makoto：**  
In other words...  
They don't need to start a war.  
Because we've already gone and started one!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Whaaa?!  
But it was just a coincidence that I was on that carriage...  
And you weren't trying to hurt me or anything, were you?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Of course not. But do you think they care about the truth?  
All they needed was an excuse, so they set one up.  
That attack was part of their dirty plans from the beginning.  
  
**Makoto：**  
If anyone tries to call Nightmare out  
for attacking our guildhouse like this... They can just say  
they're avenging their wronged comrade.  
  
**Makoto：**  
And as far as society is concerned, they'll be in the right.  
  
**Christina：**  
Beautifully explained! What a smart little doggie.  
I almost want to give you a pat on the head and a treat.  
  
**Christina：**  
To be frank, any excuse would have done.  
But Octo's situation was so perfectly suited to our needs...  
How could we not take advantage?  
  
**Christina：**  
Personally, I was just sick to death of this tedious peace.  
War is more my style,  
so I laid the seeds of conflict!  
  
**Christina：**  
Honestly, though, I thought it would be more difficult.  
Even I'm amazed how perfectly everything worked out!  
Ahahahah! ☆  
  
**Christina：**  
I guess whatever gods are in charge of this world  
must be aching to see  
 some proper blood and carnage, too!  
  
**Christina：**  
Destiny is on my side! So it's time you all gave up!  
Let's have ourselves a grand old battle to the death!  
  
**Christina：**  
Or if you don't want to fight back,  
 I'll make it a slaughter!  
I can dance the night away whether my partner is willing or not!  
  
**Christina：**  
Now, follow me, my fellow Nightmare knights!  
Let us release the tensions that have festered in this accursed peace!  
Tonight we will toast with goblets of beastfolk blood!  
  
**Christina：**  
Let the festivities commence, and the banquet begin!  
Ahahahah! ☆
