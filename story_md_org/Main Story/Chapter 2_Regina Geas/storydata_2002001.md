**Narration：**  
A few hours later...  
  
**Narration：**  
Having escaped from the chaos, {player} and his companions

where they are currently resting up.

**Choice: (1)**  Thank you, Maho!  
`Tag 1`  
**Maho：**  
Aw, please, you really oughtta call me Princess Maho, ya know!  
That's what all my pals usually call me.  
  
**Maho：**  
Anyways, no need to thank me.  
I'd be the one feelin' awful if I left you high and dry.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wooow, it doesn't even sting anymore!  
Even my clothes look all fixed up...  
Actually, they look better than before they were damaged?  
  
**Maho：**  
Truth is, I'm better at fixin' up clothes than people.  
So I thought I might as well do the whole kit and caboodle!  
I'm ever so sorry if it was a bother.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, not at all, it's a great help!  
Milady would be worried if I came back with torn clothes...  
So I really appreciate you doing all this!  
  
**Maho：**  
Aw shucks, didn't I just say not to thank me?  
After all, looks like our Makoto caused you a fair bit of trouble.  
Y'all must've been so scared, you poor things...  
  
**Maho：**  
So please, let me do what I can to make up for it.  
You poor, poor things...

**Kokkoro：**  
Th-there is really no need to pat my head so much.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It seems to be quite clear now  
that none of you at Caon bore us any ill will in that incident.  
Little damage was done, so please do not worry so.  
  
**Maho：**  
You say that, but we did get in the way of your errand...  
I'd feel ever so guilty if I didn't make that up to y'all.  
Right now, we're tryin' to procure a new carriage for you to use.  
  
**Maho：**  
From what I hear, the one you were usin' was blown to bits.  
Thankfully, the driver did make it outta there in one piece...  
But he was pretty shaken up, so we took him to a proper clinic.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Th-that's good to hear.  
With everything that happened back there,  
it's a miracle there weren't any casualties...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Though that little girl... Muimi, right? Or was it Novem?  
It looked like in the end,  
she did get taken away by those "Labyrinth" people...  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh, we've got people out lookin' for her too, o' course.  
All the resources us at Caon can muster.  
  
**Maho：**  
But I wouldn't get your hopes up just yet...  
Those Labyrinth folks seem like a real tricky bunch to find.  
From what I hear, even canine beastfolk can't pick up their trail.  
  
**Maho：**  
I don't know how things got into such a mess...  
But it's definitely us that went and got you mixed up in it.  
So we'll do what we can to help.  
  
**Maho：**  
Do be sure to ask if you need anythin', all right?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We appreciate your consideration.  
Personally, my greatest concern is the delay we have caused  
to the job we accepted from Miss Suzume...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Protecting the carriage was one of our responsibilities...  
Yet we failed at that task completely.  
I cannot apologize enough.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, please, don't say that!  
It's not your fault at all.  
It was all an accident really, so let's not go assigning blame!  
  
**Suzume：**  
And anyway, it looks like these kind Caon people  
are going to provide a new carriage for us!  
So let's just head off to the mansion once everything's ready!  
  
**Maho：**  
It's getting awful late for that, though...  
I wouldn't want you traveling the roads after sundown.  
The monsters get pretty nasty after dark. It's real dangerous.  
  
**Maho：**  
Why don't you stay at our guildhouse for tonight?  
O' course, we won't ask for a rupie of payment!  
  
**Maho：**  
If anything, we're the ones who oughtta be payin' you.  
The least we at Caon can do is pay a little compensation  
for your luggage that went up in flames.  
  
**Suzume：**  
No, really, don't worry!  
All we had was empty boxes ready to put luggage into.  
So it's no big deal, really.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm more worried about milady...  
She's going to be beside herself with worry right now,  
  
wondering why we still haven't shown up.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Would you be able to help us get in contact with her?  
Communication magic isn't really my specialty...  
  
**Maho：**  
Ah yeah, it's pretty fiddly stuff with all the calculatin' coordinates.  
To be honest, I'm not much for that sort of precision magic either.  
  
**Maho：**  
Now, Kasumi—she's another member of Caon, ya know—  
that kinda fiddly magic is right up her alley.  
Only thing is, she's not here right now.  
  
**Maho：**  
What was she off doin' again?  
Investigating an incident, I think she said.  
Somethin' about a "Shadow" on the loose.  
  
**Maho：**  
And Makoto's busy right now too. I think she's still questioning  
that Octo fella who started this whole mess.  
So till things clear up…  
 You'll have to make do with little old me! Right, my prince?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
..."Prince"?  
  
**Maho：**  
That fella right there.  
He's my prince in shining armor!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Might you be referring to my lord?  
Ehm... You are the guildmaster of Caon,  
Miss Maho, yes?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Am I to take it that you are another of my lord's acquaintances?  
  
**Maho：**  
Well, sure I know him!  
It was destiny that brought me and my prince together!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see.  
You certainly have ingratiated yourself to a remarkable  
number of young ladies in a short space of time, my lord.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm glad to have made all these friends!  
**Choice: (3)**  Um... I'm sorry...  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see. Very well, then.  
So you deny that you had any ulterior motives  
for befriending so many attractive young women.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If that is true, then I cannot fault you.  
It would hardly be my place to judge your actions, at any rate.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Well, there is no need to apologize.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I suppose your actions are most appropriate.  
They do say that heroism and romance go hand in hand.  
  
`Tag 4`

**Kaori：**  
Haitai, everyone! I'm back! ☆  
While I was out patrolling,  
I went and sorted out that carriage you wanted!  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh, Kaori! Welcome back, darlin'.  
You must be awful tired. Sit yourself down and get some rest.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Nah, I'm not tired at all! I'm chock-full of energy like always!  
Ahahah!  
  

---  
  
`image display end`  
**Kaori：**  
Ooh, if it isn’t {player}!  
I didn't think I'd see you here! Did you drop by to visit?  
Ahaha! C'mon, let's sing and dance the night away!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  You really are a bundle of energy, Kaori.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kaori：**  
You said it! That's what I'm all about!  
But you know, even a reserved fella like you  
could do with cutting loose once in a while.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh...?  
This Miss Kaori seems to be yet another friend of my lord's...  
I am beginning to doubt that this can all be mere coincidence.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm...  
This must be what Lady Ameth foretold.  
My lord is caught up in a most curious current of fate.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hmmm?  
That girl's got a pretty weird frown on her face...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Don't look so down!  
Good luck comes to those who smile, y'know!  
What's the matter? You feeling hungry?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Actually, when I was taking care of Makoto's patrol just now,  
I had to go running 'round the whole city!  
So I'm pretty starving for some food, too!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Why don't we make some sweet treats in the guildhouse kitchen?  
I can cook up a mean sata andagi!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A mean...  
 sata... what, exactly?  
Personally, I am a light eater, so I have little need of snacks.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But as it happens, we have not eaten anything since lunch.  
If you would be so kind as to prepare food for us all,  
we would be most grateful.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh!  
I could help out with the cooking too, if you like!  
  
**Kaori：**  
No, no, we couldn't trouble our guests like that!  
Just you wait! I'll make sure you have a proper feast!  
Well, I guess for a *proper* feast, I'd need a few more ingredients...  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh, in that case...  
Shall I see if Makoto can't fetch us some supplies  
while she's on her way back?  
  
**Maho：**  
Though communication magic ain't my strongest skill...  
I'm pretty used to fixin' up a line to Makoto.  
And she shouldn't be too far off, either.  
  
**Maho：**  
She's probably still havin' it out with that Octo fella...  
So let's make it a simple magical message.  
The kind she can open up when she's got a moment.  
  
**Maho：**  
Miracle Mahorin, twinkle twinkle hoy!♪  
  

---  
  
**Maho：**  
Huh...?  
That's weird... I couldn't seem to get through.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmmm... Am I really that bad at this?  
No... It's more like somethin' got in the way of the message...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hmm? It's rare for you to mess up a spell, Maho...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Umm... Is something the matter?  
  
**Maho：**  
Well... this is probably just me bein' paranoid, but...  
Kaori?  
You didn't notice anythin' weird on your way here, did ya?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Anything weird?  
Well, I guess it was pretty quiet around the guildhouse...  
Kind of like there was something heavy in the air...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Our guild's pretty popular with the local wildlife,  
so usually it gets pretty noisy with all their cooing and meowing.  
But today, it was like they'd all gone deathly calm.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Do you think something's up?  
Should I go have another quick looksie 'round outside?  
  
**Maho：**  
No... You don't need to do that.  
I shoulda noticed somethin' wasn't right...  
  
**Maho：**  
Silly ol' me... Whyever didn't I notice it sooner?  
There's a nasty ol' presence drawing closer and closer.  
  
**Maho：**  
Kaori, I'm gonna need you ready for combat.  
Everyone else, fall back behind me, okay?  
...Looks like we're about to have ourselves some uninvited guests.
