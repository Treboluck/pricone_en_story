## Subtitle: Interlude 3
  
**Ameth：**  
So, we meet again, {player}.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Welcome back to the interlude between stories.  
Let's try to enjoy this brief time we have together.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Still, you do seem to have a knack for finding trouble, don't you?  
It seems to follow wherever you go.  
 Ah, the woes of being a hero.  
  
**Ameth：**  
At any rate...  
This time, it was Christina who caused all sorts of chaos.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But I suppose it's only natural for her to attract attention.  
She's a pretty important player in this world as well, you know.  
  
**Ameth：**  
A key person like yourself.  
And wherever the key players in the story gather,  
that's where things start to move in unpredictable ways.  
  
**Ameth：**  
This time, you were just caught up in that greater context.  
Swept along by the currents of fate.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway,  
you might have trouble understanding these latest events  
if you're not clear on the concept of guilds.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I expect someone else has already told you the details,  
so I'd advise you to work on recovering those memories of yours.  
But for now, I'll fill you in on the basics.  
  
**Ameth：**  
In the city of Landosol where you're currently living,  
every citizen is officially required  
to belong to an organization called a guild.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The guild registry doubles up as the registry of citizens,  
so if you don't belong to a guild, you don't have full citizenship.  
Which would mean being excluded from various public benefits.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Finding work would be more difficult, too.  
Though of course, this system is specific to Landosol,  
so exceptions are sometimes made for travelers and the like.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But right now, Landosol is the main stage  
for the story you've become a part of.  
So you'd best familiarize yourself with their guild culture.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Another thing you should know about Landosol  
is that its government takes the form of an absolute monarchy.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's ruled by a royal family, that lives in the royal palace,  
where the royal throne acts as a symbol of their status.  
  
**Ameth：**  
As a result of all this, terms like \"the Palace\" or \"the Throne\"  
are sometimes used as a shorthand  
for the governing powers themselves.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And those guilds that serve the Palace directly  
together form an special alliance called Princess Knight.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Government ministries, the police, the fire service, the courts...  
All these sorts of official institutions  
are registered as Princess Knight guilds.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Really, it just means they're like public servants.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That nasty old Christina lady  
who burst in and attacked you just now...  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's also a member of a Princess Knight guild  
called Nightmare, Defenders of the Throne.  
  
**Ameth：**  
As the name suggests, they're basically the royal military.  
Like an army and police force rolled into one.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Though since the world has been at peace for a while now,  
it looks like they've been downsized a little lately.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Even so, Nightmare is an official institution  
representing justice in this country.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So it's not great that they seem to have a problem with you.  
Well, it looks like Christina was mostly acting alone this time,  
but still, it's like you just got cornered by the police.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Even if you managed to get away this time,  
you can see how that's not the greatest look.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You should be careful how you deal with the fallout from this.  
Try not to forget that you're dealing with this country's police.  
With the government forces of Princess Knight.  
  
**Ameth：**  
...Actually, you might want to pay attention  
to the term \"Princess Knight\" itself, too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Remember...  
That Muimi girl who holds the key to this world's secrets  
reacted quite strongly when she heard it, didn't she?  
  
**Ameth：**  
You probably don't remember the reasons why,  
but believe me, it's an important title.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway.  
You've had a long and tiring day,  
so you'll be glad to hear there's a safe haven awaiting you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's a place called Sarendia Orphanage,  
and it's going to be like a home to you from now on.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Actually, it's the base of operations  
of the guild your maid friend Suzume belongs to.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's right—you're going to be under the protection  
of Suzume's employer, Saren.  
  
**Ameth：**  
At least for tonight,  
she's going to provide you a place to get some rest.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Finally, you'll have a chance to relax,  
settle down in a warm bed, and have a good night's sleep...  
Or at least, that's what I'd like to say.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But oh dear, oh dear.  
It looks like this long day of yours still isn't over.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm afraid there's another dark shadow lurking in your path.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So perhaps you shouldn't let your guard down just yet.  
I suppose there really is no rest for heroes like yourself,  
{player}.
