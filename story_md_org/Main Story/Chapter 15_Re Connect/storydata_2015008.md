**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Allies for me to turn to...?  
 I believe I do have just one.  
Well? Don't I, now?  
Karyl...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh...?  
Wh-wha...?!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Karyl!  
I'll grant you a pardon!  
Just this once, I'm willing to forgive your high treason.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
So for once in your life, make yourself useful!  
Or are you not my one and only Princess Knight?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Your Majesty...!  
Why... why now, of all...?!  
A... aaaghhh...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl!  
Please, do not let her words sway you!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Karyl!  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
That's right, Karyl!  
You can't listen to a word that villain says!  
You'll just get hurt all over again!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You guys...  
But...  
But...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Now, Karyl!  
Come have a meal.  
Not with those buffoons, but with me!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Your Majesty!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl... No, you mustn't!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Ah, you have chosen well, Karyl!  
In my hour of need, you came to my rescue.  
For the first time since we met, I'm grateful to you...  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Do you really mean it, Your Majesty?  
Up until now, you've never done that even once...  
Do you really want to share a meal with me...?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Oh, of course I do.  
I'm so sorry for making you wait all this time.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Your Majesty...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Well then...  
Why don't we begin...  
  

---  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Aurghh?!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...by making a meal of you?! Karyl!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh!  
Miss Karyl has been captured by the enemy...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Nghh...  
Urnghhh...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Thank you ever so much for coming like a fool, Karyl!  
Your idiocy is the one thing I can rely on!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
At this point, I can't expect you yourself to be of use.  
But if I can extract your magic and life energy...  
I can at least recover a little of the damage they've dealt!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I...  
...I knew it...  
  
**Karyl：**  
You really... don't remember it at all, do you...?  
That pickled plum rice ball...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
The time... we ate it together...  
Th-that moment was my one happy memory...  
The one thing I'd shared with you...  
  
**Karyl：**  
But to you, I guess i-it wasn't even  
w-worth the effort to commit to memory...  
Just like me, it didn't mean a thing to you...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
What?  
What are you talking about...  
 Nghh?!

**Karyl：**  
You can have it back, Your Majesty!  
The Princess Knight power that you granted me!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Nghh...!  
A-aaaaghhh...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Urgh!  
It hurts... A... aaaghhhhh!  
  
**Jun：**  
An incredible volume of energy is flooding between the two of them!  
What in the world...?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I do not know what is happening...  
But that torrent of magic is beyond any human's ability to withstand!  
Miss Karyl...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
What is this?!  
It's more than just the Princess Knight power I gave her...  
Something else is flowing into me!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Something that's rejecting my magic...  
 and sending it berserk!  
Ahhh... So that's it!  
This power...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
This is... {player}'s power, isn't it, Karyl?!  
Along with your own, you're also sending  
the Princess Knight power he lends you flooding into me...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Nghh!  
Ngaahhhh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I know I'm an idiot! A hopeless traitor!  
Your words just now...  
I can't deny they even made me a little happy!  
 But...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
As I thought... you never saw me as anything more than a tool!  
You're not like them!  
That's why...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm taking the life you gave me... and giving it right back to you!  
Die, Your Majesty!  
Right here with me!  
  
**Neneka：**  
Does that girl mean to sacrifice herself...?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No way...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Stupid girl!  
The meager life of a hopeless doll like you  
isn't worth a single hair on my head!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
And you think you can trade that life for mine?!  
I'll seize your arrogant head...  
and I'll reduce it  
 to the dust it deserves to be!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Karyl!  
`Tag 2`  
`image display end`  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord!  
Lend us your strength!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm coming for you, Karyl!  
Yaahhhhh!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Tch...!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Everyone, this way!  
`Tag 3`  
**Karyl：**  
Y-you guys...!  
But why...?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You tell us, Karyl! Why?!  
Why would you try to throw your life away like that?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I... I just thought... If there was any way...  
I could begin to make things up to you...  
That's why I...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You idiot!  
`Tag 4`  
**Karyl：**  
Aurgh!  
...I... I never thought *I'd* hear that from *you*...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, but truly... My own feelings are just the same as my lord's.  
Please do not say such awful things, Miss Karyl...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Even if sacrificing your life would allow us to defeat the Kaiser...  
what meaning could such a victory possibly hold?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's right!  
Don't you remember, Karyl?!  
What's the goal of the Gourmet Guild?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?!  
Umm... To eat... lots of tasty food together...?  
Or something like that...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes! That's right!  
And how are we gonna do that if you go and sacrifice yourself?!  
That was the worst decision you could make!  
  
**Karyl：**  
U-unghh... That does make sense in a way,  
but coming from the girl who always rushes  
headfirst into danger, it kinda pisses me off...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Karyl...  
`Tag 5`  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-what now?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Let's stay together forever.  
`Tag 6`  
**Karyl：**  
...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Ahah...  
Aha... ahahaha...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Did you hear that, Your Majesty? Makes you laugh, right?  
After all the hopeless things I've done...  
These idiots keep refusing to let me go!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Karyl...  
You turn on your owner, kick sand in my face, bite my ankle...  
and finally, even refuse to become my food...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I've had enough!  
Even if it destroys this body, I'll unleash all my remaining energy...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...and make absolutely sure that all of you perish!  
  
**Kaori：**  
She's gathering a huge amount of energy into a single point!  
  
**Makoto：**  
This energy!  
It's the most intense we've seen yet...!  
  
**Jun：**  
Is it rage? Or perhaps sheer desperation?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Now... begone!  
Not even Regina Geas or the Metamorph Monarch  
can dodge an attack of this scale!  
  

---  
  
**Neneka：**  
Aaaaaaghhh!  
  
**Christina：**  
Nguaahhhh!  
  

---  
  
**Kaori：**  
Makoto, can you move?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
A little, yeah...  
But with these wounds, I can't lift my arms!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'm not much different.  
Well, then...!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yeah!  
The rest's up to you, Gourmet Guild!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh...?!  
  

---  
  
**Makoto & Kaori：**  
Aaaaaghhhh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The two of them... shielded us from harm...?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Don't worry!  
Beastfolk bodies are tougher than you'd think!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Yeah!  
So don't worry about us... Just take the villain down!  
  

---  
  
**Jun：**  
Caon...!  
Allow me to join you in this final act of resistance!  
  

---  
  
**Jun：**  
...Aaaahhhh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Jun as well?!  
  
**Jun：**  
I have... a debt to repay for harming you!  
And above all... to defend the royal family  
is a knight of Nightmare's duty!  
  

---  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...!  
  
**Rei & Hiyori：**  
...Nghhhh...!  
  
**Yui：**  
Rei...! Hiyori...!  
  
**Rei：**  
...Just go, Yui!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Go and fight for us!  
  
**Yui：**  
O-  
okay...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...*pant*... *pant*...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Unbelievable...  
Some of them are still moving!  
They would  
 stand before a god...?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes!  
Because everyone was kind enough to help us!  
  
**Yui：**  
Because everyone showed us the way forward!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Ngh...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Your Majesty!  
With that body, and your remaining magic...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You won't be able to fire another blast like that!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
So what if I can't?!  
I'm not so far gone that I can't dispose of five measly stragglers!  
Just like I did to {player}, I'll rip holes in your bodies!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  This is the real final showdown!  
`Tag 7`  
**Yui：**  
To protect all our friends!  
  
**Karyl：**  
To atone for my sins!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
To take back everything you stole from me!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Let us go forth, my lord!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Your Majesty!  
It's time you paid for your sins too!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Fools!  
A divine being does not possess the capacity for sin!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We will not surrender to you!  
As long as my lord is with us...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Lowly servant!  
Know your place and kneel! You should serve me!  
  
**Yui：**  
Omniscient Kaiser!  
We'll stop you, no matter what...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Oh, Yui Kusano... So, so ignorant...  
 How can you bear it?!  
Just the sight of you makes my skin crawl!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This is the end, Omniscient Kaiser.  
For everyone in Landosol,  
and for the delicious meals of tomorrow!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Full power!  
Princess Strike!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Is that the only trick you know, princess?!  
I don't need my Astral Insight to see through that attack!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
B-but...! I'm just the distraction!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...What?!  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight!  
  
**Karyl：**  
{player}...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord!  
  

---  
  
**All：**  
Go for it!

I should have known  
 it would be you.  
{player}...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Ahhh... No matter how many times I taste defeat...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I'll always hate... falling... to my knees...
