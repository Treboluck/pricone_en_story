# Chapter 15 Episode 9
With the battle over, peace is restored to Landosol. The various guilds get to work, and slowly but surely they restore the damaged city. Yet even as a bright new day dawns, the true world-controlling threat of whom the Omniscient Kaiser had spoken begins to stir in the shadows...
  
## Subtitle: A Moment's Peace and Stirring Shadows
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thus it was that our long struggle with the Omniscient Kaiser  
finally came to a close.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The monsters that had swarmed the city streets and surrounded its walls  
were finally eradicated in their entirety.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Kyu-pi-ping~! ☆  
Magical Girl Nanaka is victorious!  
 A bright future awaits! Ready... go!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Heh... Mere child's play!  
With the members of Twilight Caravan on the case,  
no second-rate evildoers could hope to go unchecked!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Even my love has achieved his heart's desire.  
Ah, I should expect no less from my soulmate...! ♪  
  
**Ruka：**  
It wasn't exactly an easy task...  
But we didn't lose anyone, so I'd say this is a happy ending.  
Though someone does seem to be twitching in agony over there...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ahh... Ahhhh... From in front, the monsters...  
From behind, the Twilight Caravan members' stray magical blasts...  
Gueheheh... What an intense ordeal I've been subjected to! ♪  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Hahaha...  
 Miss Kuka, I think it was?  
I'll be happy to nurse your body back to health.  
Of course, the medicine may have a *few* side effects... ♪  
  
**Monika：**  
Yes, this seems like a job well done!  
Everyone, thank you for your cross-guild cooperation!  
  
**Eriko：**  
So, this should conclude our mission for Weissflügel... should it not?  
  
**Monika：**  
Urk...!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Yep, yep! This is Mission Complete! ☆  
So it's time to hear the Twilight City deets you've got for us!  
  
**Monika：**  
Y-yes... W-well now, let's see!  
First, I think, I should go and check up on  
the state of our Landosol Branch guildhouse! ...Farewell!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Dear me... She certainly ran off like a spooked animal.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Wha—?!  
Hey now! Don't you run!  
Hold it right theeeere!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The damage to the city was certainly most severe...  
But thanks to the efforts of Nightmare and other volunteering guilds,  
the number of actual lives lost was thankfully small.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ahhh...  
I thought I was dead for sure!  
  
**Chika：**  
When the Carmina airship was hit by one of the Kaiser's attacks,  
it really did seem like we wouldn't survive...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
We can't thank you enough, members of Diabolos.  
If it weren't for those levitation spells you cast,  
we wouldn't have made it.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
No need to thank us...  
After your aerial support for {player},  
it would have been too cruel to leave you to your fates.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shi-no-bu!  
We do need thankings!  
One hundred puddings is enough!  
  
**Akari：**  
Ohhh, but... *sigh*...  
I'm so worn out from using all that magic...  
  
**Yori：**  
Uh-huh... Same here.  
I can't wait to have a shower...  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmm...  
I cannot claim I feel nothing for the state of the city...  
But in the end, we are all outsiders here.  
  
**Illya：**  
The humans are strong.  
Strong enough to defeat the Omniscient Kaiser who overpowered me.  
I do not doubt they will recover from this crisis without us.  
  
**Illya：**  
Yes...  
Let us return. To the dwelling we all call home!  
  
**Yori & Akari：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Pudd-in-g!  
Where are Miyako's pudding rewards?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A few days after the conflict's end, the citizens who had  
evacuated to Elizabeth Park and neighboring villages  
began to return to their homes in Landosol.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh dear...  
Looks like the Sarendia Orphanage building  
has suffered quite a bit of structural damage...  
  
**Ayane：**  
But hey, if we all work together, we can fix it in no time!  
Isn't that right, Mama Saren?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Since you helped us, we'll pitch in with pranks—  
I mean, uh,  
 helping and stuff, too!  
Right, Mimi, Kyoka?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...I think so.  
My teachers have always told me it's important to repay debts.  
And Mimi's parents turned out to be OK in the end, too.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Yep! ♪  
I'm so happy my mommy and daddy and all my friends are safe!  
Oh, and now I've made friends with Kurumi and her friends too! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Eheheh... Thank you, Mimi.  
Let's all work together to make the Orphanage as good as new! ♪  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, you kids...! ♪  
Haha. You've gotten so strong.  
  
**Akino：**  
Saren!  
You're back, I see!  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh—Akino! It's good to see you're all right too.  
Haha...  
 Well, I know your guild is full of reliable people,  
so I wasn't all that worried...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyothing is OK!  
Thanks to that furbrained plan we used, nyow I'm scared of heights!  
Until I get over it, I'm a failure as a cat!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Tamaki's right! Nothing about this is OK in the slightest!  
We even blew up our precious airship...  
It's stained our guild's finances bloodred!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Let's not forget our clients' shops  
and storehouses in the city are in ruins!  
Ohhhh, who knows if the Mercurius Foundation can survive this!  
  
**Akino：**  
Ohohoho! ♪  
　Worry yourselves not, dear Yukari, dear Mifuyu!  
As long as we work together,  
there's no crisis our guild cannot overcome! ♪  
  
**Yukari：**  
W-well...  
It was a huge mess, but I'm glad everyone came out of it alive...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Even if our wallets are as dead as a doornail...  
This calls for a restoration business!  
Let's turn this disaster into profit efficiently!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Finally, after a week or so, the confusion died down,  
and the city could begin to recover in earnest.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Heave-ho!  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord...  
Volunteering to clear debris is a virtuous act indeed.  
However... please try not to push yourself too hard.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You are still recovering from our harsh battle,  
in which you were forced to wield greater power than ever before.  
  

---  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Your slightly different former self from before you lost your memories...  
If you unleash his powers as you are now,  
I can't say what might happen to the \"new\" you.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
It's possible that those slight differences  
could cause the \"key\" to shatter into pieces.  
Or worse, they could trigger a rebound and shatter the user's body.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
In the very worst case, an irresolvable error could occur,  
prompting this world to erase you from existence.  
  

---  
  
**Choice: (2)**  ...  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord... My lord...?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Yeah...?  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord... Are you really quite all right?  
Your face seems decidedly pale to me...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  ...I'm OK.  
**Choice: (5)**  (I do feel a little woozy...  
`Tag 4`  
`Tag 5`  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, I must implore you.  
Try to rest awhile and recover your health.  
In the meantime,  
 I will gladly work in your stead.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  But the city...  
`Tag 6`  
**Pecorine：**  
This seems like a job for me!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine!  
And Miss Karyl!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heyas~! ☆  
It's been a little while, Kokkoro!  
Eheheh, and {player} too... ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am glad to see that you are both well.  
At the end of the battle, you seemed so thoroughly exhausted...  
I was worried for you both.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh! ♪  
 I slept lots and ate a ton, and now I'm good as new!  
Plus everyone at the palace  
remembers that I'm the real Princess Eustiana now... ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
As for me... For now, I'm still awaiting judgment.  
The palace is in a mess, so there's been no time for a trial.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But, well, I was working for the villain herself...  
so I'm sure it'll be a guilty verdict.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh no...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But listen! Even if the judges and nobles  
try to give Karyl a nasty punishment...  
I'm not planning to let them get away with it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
After all, if it wasn't for Karyl's help,  
we'd never have defeated the Kaiser in the end!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Your Majesty...

**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Ahhh... No matter how many times I taste defeat...  
I'll always hate... falling... to my knees...  
  
`image display end`  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I suppose I must accept it...  
You people have... beaten me.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
*pant*...!  
*pant*... *pant*...  
  
**Jun：**  
Although she's still conscious...  
her magical resources seem entirely depleted.  
Let's take her into custody.  
  
**Octo：**  
Huuuh?  
Come on, wouldn't it be a better plan to finish her off?  
Mercy's only gonna expose us to more danger...  
  
**Christina：**  
Now, now.  
I'm sorry, but this villain's life is mine alone to take.  
If you try to steal it from me, I won't hold back.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Urgh... Mana really is dangerous, but right now she's helpless...  
But if she recovers, she'll strike back for sure...  
Urrrghhh...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
W-wait a minute, everyone!  
First of all, I'd like to hear a little more from the Kaiser.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Ha... haha...  
Not going to end me?  
You perfect princess... The real Eustiana...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
As a reward for landing that blow on me...  
...*cough*...  
I'll tell you one little thing...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
By defeating me... you people  
have made it past one tipping point.  
...However...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
The real terror lies ahead...  
Sooner or later, you'll have to face it.  
The one I meant to defeat... This world's...  
 true villain...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Ngh...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Your Majesty...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
After that, the Kaiser lost consciousness...  
and was taken away by Nightmare.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Right now, she's being held in the palace's pocket-dimension vault.  
With Neneka's help, we set up a machine to keep her magic drained,  
so I can't see her escaping.  
  
**Neneka：**  
...In truth, I was planning to seize a more decisive victory of my own...  
But no matter. I'm too depleted to battle  
{player} and his friends at present.  
  
**Neneka：**  
For now, let's say the feat of capturing Mana alive  
is enough of a result to work with.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Her Majesty...  
Even if she wakes up, she'll be a prisoner in that dimension.  
Probably forever...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Yes.  
There's still plenty of interrogating left to do, as well...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Those words she left us with at the very end...  
What kind of greater evil could the Kaiser have been planning to face?  
A being even she, with all her power, saw as a threat...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm afraid I don't have the slightest clue either...  
But I suppose when the Kaiser does wake up,  
that's one more thing we can ask!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
For now, I think it's best put aside.  
Not much point dwelling on cryptic threats  
when we've got so much to take care of in the here and now!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...That's true.  
You're officially the Princess of this whole kingdom now.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Heck, the only reason I'm not stuck in a cell right now  
is because you insisted on making me your personal attendant.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, um, that's just a temporary solution.  
I don't want to take away your freedom either, Karyl.  
I just needed some kind of excuse to satisfy the bigwigs for now...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, but hey!  
 If you did happen to want the job,  
I'd happily hire you as an advisor-slash-retainer-slash-maid for real!  
It's a job for life with bed and board included! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
A job for life...? That's because with the national secrets I'd be learning,  
you couldn't let me leave if I wanted to, right?!  
Forget it!  
 And did you say \"maid\"...?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Awww, that's no fun...  
I'm sure you'd look so great  
 in a real maid outfit...! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Still, if you are restored to your full royal status...  
will this have to be the end of the Gourmet Guild, I wonder?  
Miss Pecorine... No, Lady Eustiana.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, don't do that, Kokkoro!  
Please keep calling me Pecorine, like always.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Besides... Of course we can't let our guild end here.After all...
