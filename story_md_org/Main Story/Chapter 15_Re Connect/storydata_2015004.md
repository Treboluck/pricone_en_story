**Pecorine：**  
{player}...  
{player}...!  
Please! You can't leave us now...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord!  
Please, you must hold on!  
I will use my healing magic at once...!  
  
**Yui：**  
We'll heal you up soon, Mr. Knight!  
...Spirits of light! Grant us your healing glow!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Grant us the blessings of light...!  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My... lord...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Mr. Knight!  
  
**Rei：**  
{player}...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, {player}...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
If you die, I'm gonna kill you, you hear?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Li'l Bro, hang in there!  
  
**Rino：**  
Big Bro, you can do it!  
  
**Yui：**  
*pant*... *pant*...!

**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Well, little Yui?  
Is your precious healing magic restoring life to his body?  
  
**Yui：**  
A... a... aahhhh...!  
Mr. Knight... Mr. Knight... Open your eyes...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Yui...!  
You must not lose concentration!  
I know he can still be saved!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Oh, it's no use.  
No matter how much magic you pump into him now,  
a life once lost can't be recovered! ♪  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
That's a hard rule.  
Just like how gods only take and never share with others,  
it's simply the way of this world.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
So? How do you feel now, princess...?  
Having yet another treasure snatched away?!  
Haha... Ahahahahah...! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
N-no... It can't be...  
Because of me... {player}, you...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...So distressed, you can't even hear me?  
I was looking forward to hearing how you'd curse me, too.  
Haha... How very boring. ♪  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ahhh... Up till now, we were full of the energy  
Mr. Knight lends us, but...  
It's all completely vanished...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Ah, Hiyori. How about you?  
I recall you were spouting some nonsense about wanting to help me too.  
Can you still say that after I've taken his life?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...!  
I... I... just...  
 But...  
  
**Rei：**  
Don't listen to her, Hiyori.  
Nothing's changed.  
She remains a dangerous enemy that we must defeat.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Rei...  
  
**Rei：**  
Even if...  
 Yes...  
Even if we can't rely on {player}'s support.  
  
**Rei：**  
...Ah, but...  
Did this blade... always feel so heavy in my hands...?  
  
**Makoto：**  
...{player}... You've gotta be kidding me...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Makoto...  
You need to stand.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Kaori...  
 Are you fine with all this?!  
With him... with him dying on us?!  
  
**Kaori：**  
How could I be fine?!  
But... right now we're still  
 in the middle of a battle for everyone's lives!  
If we start crying now, she'll take all of us out too!  
  
**Makoto：**  
...!  
Yeah... of course you're damn right... Dammitall...!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I'm sorry, Li'l Bro... I couldn't protect you.  
I'm sorry I'm such a bad big sister...  
...But at least...  
  
**Rino：**  
If nothing else... we'll be the ones to avenge you...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Haha... Ahahahah!  
Your abilities are still too pitiful to entertain me, but...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Those quavering lips.  
The gnashing of teeth.  
And all those eyes stained with sorrow...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Tedious though you are, this sight is to my tastes.  
Now... come to me.  
By a god's hands, you will soon be sent to see your late friend!  
  
**All：**  
Aaaaghhhh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...My... lord...  
  
**Yui：**  
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry, Mr. Knight...  
All my magic wasn't enough...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*sniff*... *sniff*...  
If only you hadn't protected the likes of me...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
If only I'd stopped Her Majesty sooner...!  
  
**Rei & Hiyori：**  
Aaaahhhh!  
  
**Yui：**  
Rei...! Hiyori...!  
A-at this rate, they'll both be...  
I'm sorry, Mr. Knight! I'll be right back!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Everyone is fighting on so furiously...  
But against the Kaiser, without my lord's strength...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Waaaahhhh!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Aaaaaghhhhh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Ahhh...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
One... after another... they are wounded and fall...  
Already, some among them are unable to stand unaided...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Ah, just look at... how powerless I truly am.  
Far from having the strength to aid my friends,  
I could not even guide my lord to the end...

**Kokkoro：**  
...My lord...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, my lord... *sniff*...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Why will you not open your eyes for me, my lord?  
Did I do something to displease you most terribly...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I cannot bear the thought of leaving you now.  
I swore a most solemn vow to stay by your side always!  
I cannot let this be the end of my journey as your guide...

**Kokkoro：**  
Please, just open your eyes.  
Kindly raise your hand and pat my head as you always do.  
If it would grant that wish...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I would gladly offer every last fragment of my being...  
So please... please...
