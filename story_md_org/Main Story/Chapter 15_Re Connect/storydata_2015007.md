**Rino：**  
I... I think it's really working!  
We're wearing her down!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But we mustn't relent!  
It's a miracle that any of us are still standing...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Still...!  
We won't... give up... till it's over!  
  
**Rei：**  
We'll fight to defend this city... and this entire world!  
  
**Yui：**  
Yeah!  
Together with Mr. Knight!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Ahhh...  
 This really is the absolute worst.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I feel sick to my stomach.  
With each wound you deal me, each spell I'm forced to waste...  
the paradise I seek, my new world, slips further away...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Your Majesty...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I don't understand it.  
How can you people be so dense and so oblivious?  
Doesn't this twisted reality concern any of you, even a little?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Protect this world?  
You're like slaves glorifying their own chains.  
I can hardly bear to watch!  
  
**Rei：**  
Wha...  
 Uwaghh!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ngh...  
To think you still have such strength...!  
I'm impressed, Majesty!  
  
**Masaki：**  
Yes... However!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Unghh... *cough*...!  
*cough* *cough*  
  
**Yui：**  
That last attack she fired looked like it hurt her  
 more than us...  
  
**Kaori：**  
I get it...!  
Thanks to all the damage we've dealt...  
her body's lost the strength to take the recoil from her own spells!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Please... just stop this!  
Why must you go so far...?!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Oh, you utter dolt, Karyl!  
Haven't I... explained enough times?!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
This is for my wish!  
To create a new world that is worthy of my rule!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Your Majesty...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Is that truly what you desire?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh...?  
Kokkoro?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Koro...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Omniscient Kaiser.  
If the creation of a new world truly is your deepest desire,  
then why...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Why did you steal the throne from Miss Pecorine?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...  
A little child like you may not be able to understand this...  
But the ruler of a nation holds resources beyond compare.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
All this nation's riches. Classified intel, and the power to suppress it.  
And soldiers who obey my every whim.  
On the path to my goal... all of these assets had their uses.  
  
**Jun：**  
Why, you...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...I suppose you are not wrong.  
By taking the throne, you may have gained many advantages.  
But at the same time...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
No matter how capable the ruler or how ruthless the tyrant,  
the responsibility of maintaining a kingdom must be a great burden.  
Would you not agree, Miss Pecorine?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh?  
W-well, I suppose...  
It's true that Mother and Father always seemed awfully busy...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In which case... your choice seems rather strange.  
Why delay the pursuit of your heart's desire  
to attend to such an arduous and unnecessary task?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I suppose it needs no saying at this point,  
but my own wish is to guide my lord, attend to his needs,  
and remain close by his side as long as I live.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Just now, when my lord's life seemed lost,  
I keenly felt just how deeply essential  
and how precious that wish truly is to me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Omniscient Kaiser.  
Just as I do, you too must hold a deep and fervent wish...  
This seems most certain to me now.  
 And yet...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The fortune you gained from the throne, the authority, the resources...  
I cannot help but feel that you had no need for these things.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Look at you now. You have the power  
to face all of us with your own strength alone.  
That is why I find myself wondering...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...That's enough...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Might there not be some other reason why you desired  
to take Miss Pecorine's position...?  
For instance...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Silence, I say!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
For instance... Oh!  
Could it be you just wanted to be a princess?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Ahh...!  
Of all the ridiculous ideas!  
Do you think I would do all this for such a childish reason...?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Oh... I see now...  
Finally it all comes together.  
This was one last memory I'd been struggling to recall.  
  
**Neneka：**  
...Mana.  
Pecorine's words just now aren't far from the mark, are they?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Uweh?  
It really was about being a princess?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...!  
No!  
I don't...!  
  
**Neneka：**  
It had been bothering me.  
Not long ago, Mana, I do believe you told Yui...  
 that you envied her.  
  
**Yui：**  
Sh-she did say that...  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh, and I think...  
She also said it was as though she'd become an evil queen...  
I wasn't sure what she meant by any of that, but...  
  
**Neneka：**  
Yes. And that she had grown \"too old to indulge  
in a world of dreams and adventure.\"  
  
**Neneka：**  
...Mana.  
You assembled the Seven Crowns and created Astrum...  
  
**Neneka：**  
...because you longed for an adventure right out of a fairy tale.  
You longed to be a princess with a gallant knight to protect her.  
  
**Neneka：**  
A perfect fairy-tale princess who everyone would love.  
...Isn't that right?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...  
...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...*sigh*...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...All right.  
...I suppose I may have harbored such ridiculous dreams.  
Once upon a time.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
But what does any of that matter?  
When you're all about to die right here at my hand?!  
What difference does it make what I might have wished for?!  
  
**Jun：**  
Yes, true enough.  
Whatever your personal reasons,  
there can be no pardon for the things you've done.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...I think I finally understand why you looked so bored.  
If your real wish was to become a princess in the truest sense,  
just pretending to be me couldn't be enough to satisfy you.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But... even so, I have to defeat you no matter what.  
I know we're all so close to our limits, things look crazy bad...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But the Kaiser herself is also devoid of allies to turn to  
and any means of recovery.  
We can surely defeat her!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Oh...? Are you sure about that?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Allies for me to turn to...?  
 I believe I do have just one.  
Well? Don't I, now?  
Karyl...!
