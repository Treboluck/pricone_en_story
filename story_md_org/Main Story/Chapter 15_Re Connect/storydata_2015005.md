{player} finds himself awakened in Ameth's world of dreams. Sparing not a thought for his own predicament, he attempts to return to help his allies who are still fighting, but just then, Labyrista appears before him. She heals his wounds, and offers him an important choice.
  
## Subtitle: The World You Wish For
  
**Choice: (1)**  ...Is this...  
`Tag 1`  
**Choice: (2)**  ...a dream...?  
`Tag 2`  
**Ameth：**  
Of course it's not a dream! Well, it is, but...!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Just... listen, are you okay?!  
Hey, are you in pain? Does your body hurt?!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Yes.  
`Tag 3`  
**Ameth：**  
I see. That's... good news.  
 Your soul was about to  
leave your body and disappear when I used my usual ability  
to drag it over here instead... I guess I made it just in time.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You're...  
`Tag 4`  
**Ameth：**  
Ah, yes...  
It's been a while, {player}.  
Though I'm sure you don't remember me, just like always...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  You look... really familiar somehow...  
`Tag 5`  
**Ameth：**  
Huh? You actually remember me?  
And usually in these dreams, I just talk while you listen,  
but are you actually responding to me?  
  
**Ameth：**  
...I see.  
Could this be because, unlike your usual dreams with those girls,  
your soul and mind are both completely on this side?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Or maybe after so many of those conversations,  
bit by tiny bit, I've actually succeeded  
in leaving a mark somewhere deep in your subconscious...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Wait!  
None of that is what matters right now!  
More to the point, do you realize you're almost dead?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  ...Actually, now you mention it...  
`Tag 6`  
**Ameth：**  
Yes. Like you always do, you protected Pecorine from the Kaiser...  
and you suffered a fatal wound.  
She gouged a hole right through your body.  
  
**Ameth：**  
In the last instant before your consciousness... your soul disappeared,  
I managed to tie it down to this world for now...  
  
**Ameth：**  
But that's the limit of what I can do.  
I don't have the power to intervene in that world right now...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  \"That world\"...  
`Tag 7`  
**Ameth：**  
Do you remember?  
...Hey!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Wait right there!  
There's no point running off all of a sudden like that!  
This plane doesn't even share the same concept of distance or time!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  My friends are still fighting!  
`Tag 8`  
**Ameth：**  
...Indeed. They all... think you've lost your life.  
Consumed by a whirlwind of anger and sadness,  
they're swinging their weapons.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ahhh, my little Kokkoro is crying...!  
I want to give her a great big hug and tell her it's OK!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  I have to get back, right now!  
`Tag 9`  
**Ameth：**  
H-hold on!  
Did you not hear a word I just said?!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Normally, waking up from the dream  
would send you back to your original body...  
But right now, you've barely got a body left to return to!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  But I have to stop the Kaiser...!  
`Tag 10`  
**Ameth：**  
That's impossible!  
If you go back, you'll die!  
Even at full strength, you were no match for her...  
 And besides!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Just look at that hole in your stomach!  
In this dreamworld, it's frozen without any bleeding...  
but if you go back like that, you'll be dead within seconds!  
  
**Choice: (11)**  But everyone's still...!  
`Tag 11`  
**Ameth：**  
H... hold on!  
Even if he's healed, won't the Kaiser  
just slaughter him all over again...?!  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Young {player}. Through Karyl, I restored to you  
your original Princess Knight powers.  
As the \"key\" to help you survive this battle.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
...But right now, that key isn't letting you  
unlock the full extent of your abilities.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
I fitted it with a safety lock, you see.  
If you release that,  
and unleash your Princess Knight powers to their fullest...  
  
**Labyrista：**  
And if the bonds you've built  
with your allies out there are true, it's possible...  
Together, you may be a match for Mana Senri.  
  
**Ameth：**  
H-hold on... Why did you restrict his powers?!  
You knew this was the final battle!  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Believe me, I didn't do it just to spite him.  
It's called a safety lock for a reason.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
The Princess Knight abilities I restored to you...  
It's true that they're your own power, {player}.  
But the \"you\" they belong to is the \"old you.\"  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Your slightly different former self from before you lost your memories...  
If you unleash his powers as you are now,  
I can't say what might happen to the \"new\" you.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
It's possible that those slight differences  
could cause the \"key\" to shatter into pieces.  
Or worse, they could trigger a rebound and shatter the user's body.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
In the very worst case, an irresolvable error could occur,  
prompting this world to erase you from existence.  
  
**Ameth：**  
N-no way...  
  
**Labyrista：**  
That's why I placed this safety lock.  
Simply removing it wouldn't guarantee you could beat Mana...  
And besides...  
  
**Choice: (14)**  Besides...?  
`Tag 14`  
**Labyrista：**  
I have to wonder if it's necessary to stake so much on this.  
  
**Choice: (15)**  What do you mean?  
`Tag 15`  
**Labyrista：**  
It's true that Mana Senri has unfathomable strength.  
But even that strength isn't infinite.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Mana is prideful, intent on remaining superior,  
 and thus utterly alone...  
Not the kind of person who can surpass their limits.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
That's why Mana Senri's wish won't come true.  
That's why Mana Senri will always lose.  
Without changing the world's rules, there can be no victory.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Yes, even if you don't stand and fight... Mana will soon be defeated.  
  
**Ameth：**  
B-but then!  
What about Kokkoro and the others...?  
  
**Labyrista：**  
...True. As a result...  
I'm sorry to say the bonds your current self has built  
will be lost to you forever.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
But those bonds are something you can build again.  
Just as long as you remain yourself.  
  
**Choice: (16)**  ...  
`Tag 16`  
**Labyrista：**  
Do you see? Beside this painful path where victory is far from certain  
lies another path you can still choose.  
A path where you can survive to fight another day.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Which will it be, young {player}?  
Will you stake your entire being to protect your current bonds?  
Or will you close your eyes and start your journey anew?  
  
**Labyrista：**  
I'm afraid all I can do  
is explain the two paths stretching out before you.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
...I'm sorry.  
This is my fault for getting you mixed up in all this.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Akira... {player}...  
  
**Choice: (17)**  I'll protect my current bonds.  
**Choice: (18)**  I'll close my eyes.  
`Tag 17`  
`Tag 18`  
**Labyrista：**  
...OK. Understood.  
Don't worry. Stay right there and relax.  
Whatever world greets you when you next open your eyes...  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Just know you have nothing to blame yourself for.  
Don't forget that.  
Don't be sad.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, see you around.  
Here's hoping your life, your reality, turns out to be a happy one...  
  
**???：**  
First you simmer~♪ Then boil up hot~♪  
Keep that rice snug in the pot~♪

**???：**  
...Oh!  
I see you have awoken, my lord.  
  
**Choice: (20)**  Do I... know you...?  
`Tag 20`  
**???：**  
I am your guide,  
 sent by the ineffable Lady Ameth.  
You may call me Kokkoro.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I hope that we can get along.  
  
**Choice: (21)**  (...  
`Tag 21`  
**Kokkoro：**  
To protect my lord from morning till night,  
from the cradle to the grave, is my sworn duty and calling  
as your attendant.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Do not hesitate to ask me for anything, my lord.  
  
**Choice: (22)**  (I can't... remember anything...  
`Tag 22`

**Kokkoro：**  
...My lord?  
Whatever is the matter?  
Have I displeased you in some way, perhaps?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am not sure exactly what I should do  
in a situation such as this.  
My lord, please, I beg you...

**Kokkoro：**  
I do not wish to see you shed so many tears...
