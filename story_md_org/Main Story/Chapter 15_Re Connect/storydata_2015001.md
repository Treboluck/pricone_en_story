# Chapter 15 Episode 1
Faced with the overwhelming power of the Omniscient Kaiser's monstrous new form, Masaki and Daigo are defeated. To set an example for the traitorous Karyl, the Kaiser shoots down the airship carrying Carmina, before declaring that she will kill each of Karyl's friends one by one.

**Narration：**  
Working together, the party has succeeded in defeating the monsters  
and Shadows that flooded the city. But the cornered Kaiser takes on a  
monstrous new form, dominating them with greater strength than ever!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Now... All of you, kneel to your god!  
  
**All：**  
Aaaaghhhhh!  
  
**Yui：**  
O-owww...  
  
**Rei：**  
The Omniscient Kaiser has been...  
 transformed?!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Just when we thought we had her cornered!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ngh... These energy levels are no joke...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
None of the monsters we have ever faced  
can compare to this fearsome sight...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
B-but... I'm sure if we work together...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...You can beat me? Is that what you want to say?  
You still don't see how outmatched you are?  
...Still, let's see...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
You may have gained confidence in numbers,  
but each of you individually is no match even for Christina...  
So I suppose I can't expect you to fully appreciate your own weakness.  
  
**Daigo：**  
Don't gimme that bull!  
I'm gonna take you down and avenge the old lady!  
  
**Neneka：**  
Chris isn't dead yet, you know.  
Though, like myself, she is admittedly on her last legs.  
...*cough* *cough*  
  
**Masaki：**  
Mistress Neneka...!  
  
**Masaki：**  
For the sin of harming my mistress, you will pay dearly!  
Omniscient Kaiser!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Hah.  
 Pay for such a meager offense?  
 My dear boy...  
The privilege of witnessing my divine form  
should be more than payment enough!  
  
**Daigo & Masaki：**  
Aaarghhhhhh!  
  
**Neneka：**  
Masaki...!  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Daigo!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
*sigh*...  
Even your Princess Knights are this pathetic?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Or perhaps it's just {player} who was an exceptional case...  
My own Karyl was a worthless piece of trash too, after all.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Ahhhh... Your Majesty...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Oh, Karyl...  
After you betrayed me and spat in my face...  
Please don't gaze at me like a poor abandoned kitten.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
My foolish, witless, useless, yet occasionally sweet, adorable Karyl.  
The question of when, where and how I should abandon you  
is one I had pondered a number of times...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
But yes, I suppose...  
Why don't I make you  
 my glorious new form's first victim?  
Hee hee. Isn't that an honor?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Y-Your Majesty!  
Please stop!  
Please, just stop...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Hahahah!  
Very good, Karyl!  
Let's see you prostrate yourself and beg for mercy!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Aaaaaaghhh!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh?!  
Where's she aimi— Ahhhh?!  
  

---  
  
**Carmina：**  
Aaaaaghhhhh!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Dammit!  
Was that shot aimed at Carmina's airship?!  
  
**Rino：**  
The airship... At that rate, it'll fall and crash!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
With that airship, you hunted down my Shadows,  
defeated them together, and thus negated my Astral Insight.  
What a frightful irritation.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...!  
 Stop—!  
  

---  
  

---  
  
**Yui：**  
The airship...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It just... exploded...  
  
**Rei：**  
Tsumugiiii!  
Wh-why, you...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Haha... Ahahahah!  
That's good.  
I like that face...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Your tiresome cries of friendship and precious bonds always  
struck me  
 as incredibly insipid and tedious.  
 But the faces you make  
when you lose those friends...  
 They at least entertain me a little.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Y-  
Your Majesty!  
Didn't you say you'd make me your first target...?!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Yes.  
I did think that might be a fun idea.  
But, my dear Karyl...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
If instead I take those precious friends who led you to betray me,  
and tear each of them to shreds right before your eyes,  
won't that be  
 an even more fitting punishment for your disloyalty...?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Waahhhhh!  
That woman's glare is just too scary!  
My knees are shaking... Urghhhh!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
T-try to calm down, Rino!  
But her magical strength really is crazy...!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Guys, steel yourselves!  
If you hesitate for an instant, she'll obliterate you!  
In this new form, she might be able to defeat all of us at once!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I \"might\" be able to beat you?  
Oh, please. You still don't understand at all...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Now that I've ascended to this state...  
I could crush you worms  
 a thousand times without even trying!  
  

---  
  
**All：**  
U-uwaaaaghhhhh!
