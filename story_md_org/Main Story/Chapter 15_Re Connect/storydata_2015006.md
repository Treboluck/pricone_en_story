## Subtitle: The Light to Banish Despair
  
**Pecorine：**  
My name is Eustiana von Astraea.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Born as heir to the Landosol Royal Family,  
I was raised as the future Princess who would inherit the throne.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
My mother and father and all my attendants were strict yet kind.  
They taught me the manners and morals I needed  
to take on the responsibility of a ruler.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Among my lessons,  
the one I loved the most and learned at the youngest age  
was to always put on a bright and smiling face.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
For instance, in a parade or ceremony,  
I represent my nation, and must gain the people's love.  
And even on the battlefield, my role is to inspire the soldiers.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm sure it's partly just the nature I was born with.  
I may not have excelled at all my studies and tasks,  
but I could always say I was proud to act as a beacon of joy.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's why...  
Even when the Kaiser appeared before me  
and stole my life away...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Even after all my subjects  
forgot that I had ever been their princess...  
I knew I had to keep hold of my bright and smiling face.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
After all, if I let go of that lesson on top of everything else,  
even wearing my full Royal Equipment,  
I didn't think I'd be able to stay \"myself\" anymore.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Of course, when I was all alone, sometimes I got horribly sad.  
And sometimes I almost gave in to hunger...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But Karyl...  
Kokkoro...  
And of course, {player}...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Before I knew it, my life was filled again  
with people more precious than I could have hoped for.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Their company touched my weak heart when it felt like it might break,  
warming me from within like a bowl of freshly cooked rice.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Until...

**Kokkoro：**  
My lord!  
My lord...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Until...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Finally, I lost the person I loved most...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And it seems the time has come for me to forget my golden rule.

**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
So, how do you feel now, princess...?  
Having yet another treasure snatched away?!  
Haha... Ahahahahah...! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The Omniscient Kaiser's words  
brush against my awareness and then slip away.  
  
**All：**  
Aaaaghhhh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
In the corners of my eyes,  
I see my friends rush past me screaming.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And I know I have to take my sword as well  
and stand up to our enemy.  
I have to reject the Kaiser's words and mount a counterattack.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But I...  
I can't  get to my feet.  
I can't move anymore.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I don't have any smiles left in me...  
After watching him lose his own life in exchange for saving mine...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What is there left for someone like me to do in this world...?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  (Let's win, and share a delicious meal.  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
...  
......Huh...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Um... mm...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
D-did you guys...  
Did you hear a voice just now?  
Karyl?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?  
I didn't hear anyone talk, and it wasn't me...  
...  
Waghhh!

**Karyl：**  
Wh-what the?!  
What's this all of a sudden?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh...?!  
{player}'s body is... glowing...?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh... what? What the heck is this freaky light?!  
Koro, did you just do something?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
No... I was unable to revive him...  
And yet...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...!  
My lord!  
My lord's heartbeat is...!

**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Tch!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
That light, and this hacking... An intervention from Akira?!  
So, you make a ploy at the eleventh hour, Queen Labyrinth! But...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I can still annihilate you all first!  
No... I'll reduce the whole city to dust!  
With my spell of mass destruction!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Spell of mass destruction...?  
The same attack that leveled the elven mountains...?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
If Her Majesty unleashes her full strength on the city...  
nobody will survive it!  
  
**Jun：**  
Ngh...  
There are still many citizens in hiding...  
And my knights are still scouring the city to find them...!  
  
**Neneka：**  
Rajraj, can you Spatial Leap?!  
  
**Rajraj：**  
I am terribly sorry.  
At best, I may be able to save myself.  
To carry everyone here would far exceed my abilities!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Move... Move!  
Move, my useless body!  
I have to protect them all—protect {player}!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't you dare say \"I can't stand up\"!  
If you can't protect them now, you're getting no dinner for life!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Haaaahhhhhhhh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Pecorine!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine, don't be rash!  
Without my lord's support, you'll...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Trying to shield them with your body?!  
Even with your Royal Equipment's full power, you won't last seconds!  
You'll be dust, and so will everyone behind you!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I won't... let that happen...!  
`Tag 2`  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
What...?!
