**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Little boy!  
Look out!  
 Run for it...!  
  
**Boy：**  
...Hah.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAGHHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
A whip made of magic...?  
Is that boy fighting the monsters?  
  
**Rei：**  
No... That's not it!

**Giant Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Waahhh!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Wh-what now?!  
That monster just grew really big!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As he struck the monster with his whip, it grew to great size...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's not just its body.  
Its strength, its magic... They're all powered up!  
  
**Boy：**  
There's your carrot and your stick.  
Now get moving, monster scum...  
Turn this city into a giant trash heap!  
  
**Giant Monster：**  
GRRRUOOOGGGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
You don't think... that boy set these monsters loose?!  
  
**Rei：**  
A child like him... How in the world?!  
  
**Boy：**  
...Bah.  
You're all the same.  
There's more to being a grown-up than height, you know!

**Hiyori：**  
Who are you?!  
Why are you doing this?!  
  
**Boy：**  
Huhhh? You a moron?  
You're about to get murdered,  
so what's the point explaining anything?  
  
**Boy：**  
...Ehhh?  
Hang on, those faces... Feels like I've seen you before.  
Hmmm...?  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Mmmm...?  
  
**Boy：**  
Ohhh, yeah. Got it.  
So you're Akira Mosakuji's Princess Knight and his merry crew.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
He knows not only my lord... but Miss Akira...  
Miss Labyrista's true name on top of that...?  
Just who could this strange young man be...?  
  
**Boy：**  
Y'know, slaughtering you guys  
won't win me any extra points or anything...  
But I don't need you in my way.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Wh-what?  
Little boy... what are you saying?  
  
**Boy：**  
Oh, don't worry. It's real simple.  
  
**Boy：**  
I'm just gonna get rid of every one of you losers, that's all!  
  
**Giant Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
He strengthened the monsters, and increased their size once more!  
  
**Yui：**  
Hey, Rei... Doesn't that boy's power seem familiar...?!  
  
**Rei：**  
Yes.  
It's similar to the power we all know well!  
So that's why the beasts all had this strange aura!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Then that boy... Is he one of the Seven Crowns' Princess Knights?!  
  
**Boy：**  
Hah! Yeah right, you morons!  
I don't hang out with that club of old hags and fogeys!  
I fight for myself!  
  
**Karyl：**  
\"I fight for myself\"? Bah, you think that sounds cool?!  
If you want to leave an impression,  
why not start by announcing your name?!  
  
**Boy：**  
...Hah.  
  
**Boy：**  
Die!  
  
**Giant Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Karyl：**  
O-oh crap...!  
  
**Rei：**  
...Ngh!  
Far from harming the beasts, I can barely defend myself!  
There must be some way...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine will surely return with aid in time!  
Until then, we must focus our efforts on survival!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Agreed!  
Even if we can't win, we can't give in!  
We mustn't let them ruin the city any more!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Aarghh...!  
I hate to rely on her for everything, but I guess it's our only shot!  
These things are too deadly to even turn tail and run from!  
  
**Yui：**  
Y-yeah!  
After all...!  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Oohhh...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Oohhh...  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
Standing behind us  
are people we absolutely must protect!  
  
**Boy：**  
...Hah!  
I've barely even gotten started, and already you're desperate!  
That old Omniscient Kaiser you beat can't have been worth much!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...!  
Shut it, you little brat!  
What would you know about Her Majesty?!  
  
**Boy：**  
Ehhhh?!  
Who's a brat now?!  
I'll murder your ass, mangy cat!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Whaaa?! *You'll* murder *me?!*  
Don't talk to me like that, you little runt!  
Get too cocky, and I'll kill you dead!  
  
**Yui：**  
...That boy and Miss Karyl...  
They seem a little bit... similar, huh?  
  
**Rei：**  
This is no time to be trading words of abuse!  
Hm...?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  ...?  
`Tag 2`  
**Narration：**  
Something rolls along the ground just ahead...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  ...?  
`Tag 3`  
**Karyl：**  
...Hm?  
What did {player} just pick up...?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Is that one of the magic items Peco left behind?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  ...*gulp*  
`Tag 4`  
**Yui：**  
Whaaaaaa?! Mr. Knight?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Mr. Knight... swallowed the crystal ball!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You must not, my lord!  
Please spit it out!  
Go on, spit!  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight! Are you OK?!  
Umm... umm... What now?!  
  
**Yui：**  
I haven't learned any spells to make someone spit,  
or to control their insides...  
 I'll just have to try my healing!  
Mr. Knight, I'm sorry! I'm going to touch your tummy!  
  
**Boy：**  
Tch... We're in the middle of a fight.  
You tryna make a fool of me?!  
Hurry up and crush 'em, monster scum!  
  
**Giant Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Hiyori & Rei：**  
Waaaghhh!  
  
**Yui：**  
Rei!  
Hiyori!  
...  
Huh?!  
  

---  
  
**Yui：**  
I can't control my magic...?!  
  

---  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huhhh?!  
Wh-what now? What's even happening?!  
  
**Boy：**  
Whoaagh?!  
What is this? Some kinda flash-bang?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Y-Yui?!  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Yuuu?  
  
**Rei：**  
Her body's emitting blinding light...!  
What in the world is this phenomenon?!  
  
**Yui：**  
I... I don't know!  
Umm... umm... What should I...?  
Wahhh?!  
  
**Giant Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  

---  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Ah!  
The aura around the monsters has disappeared!  
  
**Boy：**  
Ehhh?!  
The hell's going on?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...I don't really get it,  
 but if they're not enhanced,  
this has gotta be our chance!  
  
**Rei：**  
Agreed!  
Let's go, Hiyori!  
Gourmet Guild, cover our backs!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?!  
S-sure...!  
  
**All Three：**  
Haaaahhhh!  
  
**Giant Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Rei：**  
Ngh... They're still not going down!  
I suppose their sheer size isn't just for show...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
But this is working way better than before!  
We can... fight them now!  
  
**Boy：**  
Why, you...!  
Hey, Arnold!  
Get up!  
  
**Giant Monster：**  
GRRUOOOGHH...  
  
**Boy：**  
Tch...!  
Useless piece of trash!  
  
**Boy：**  
Hey, morons... This isn't over!  
I'll be back soon enough!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Shaddup!  
Don't show your face again, dummy! Lousy runt!  
  
**Boy：**  
Ehhhh?!  
Who're you calling a—  
  

---  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...  
  
**Yui：**  
...H... huh?  
He just vanished...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Was that a Spatial Leap,  
 I wonder...?  
  
**Rei：**  
Whew... Looks like he's withdrawn.  
  
**Rei：**  
If your magic hadn't nullified their enhancements, Yui,  
this could have gone much worse.  
Thank you.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey, Yui, when did you learn that spell?  
It was amazing! ♪  
  
**Yui：**  
No, no!  
I wasn't expecting any of that stuff to happen either!  
What on earth was that light...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord!  
My lord...?  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Ga goo...?  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh—that's right!  
Mr. Knight, are you okay...?!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Zzzzz...  
`Tag 5`  
**Kokkoro：**  
...He appears to be fast asleep.  
Thanks to your swift healing efforts, Miss Yui,  
his improper meal seems to have done little harm.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Eheh.  
It is the same sweet sleeping face I have always gazed upon... ♪  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, phew! What a relief...  
  
**Rei：**  
Yes.  
 But...  
  
**Girl：**  
Wahhh! Wahhh...  
  
**Citizen 1：**  
Urgh... Owww...  
  
**Citizen 2：**  
My house...!  
Just when it was finally fixed!  
  
**Creditta：**  
One billion rupies... My entire one billion rupies...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...We worked so hard together to rebuild it,  
and now the plaza's in ruins again...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
There appear to be many injured, also.  
We should assist however we can  
to provide first aid and such to those who need it.  
  
**Yui：**  
Mm, I agree...  
 Huh?  
  
**Soldier 1：**  
Step aside, bystanders!  
We are an elite guild in service to the Council of Nobles:  
the Golden Hand!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Could they be...  
soldiers from the palace, sent by Miss Pecorine to assist us?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Geez... Get here sooner, why don't you?!  
You're pretty high and mighty for latecomers!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Now now, Miss Karyl.  
There is no need for such aggression.  
They too are only trying to protect the populace...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Wait... H-huh?  
It looks like those soldiers are coming this way...  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh?  
Do they want to ask us something?  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Uhhh?  
  
**Soldier 1：**  
All of you! Drop your weapons!  
  
**Soldier 2：**  
If you come quietly, we won't have to hurt you!  
But if you resist, your lives may be forfeit!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wha—?! Hey, what's the big idea here?!  
  
**Rei：**  
We're surrounded?!  
But why?! We were only fighting to protect this city!  
  
**Soldier 1：**  
Don't talk back!  
Objections will be taken as a sign of resistance!  
  
**Rei：**  
...!  
  
**Soldier 2：**  
Commander!  
We have the suspects right here!  
  
**Commander：**  
Yes... very good!  
That face matches the felon we were sent for!  
  
**Yui：**  
F-felon?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Please, this has gotta be a mistake!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed. We would never...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...  
  
**Soldier 1：**  
Hrmph! I told you, no objections!  
  
**Commander：**  
We will take the wanted felon and associates into custody!  
Throw them into the palace dungeons!  
  
**Soldiers：**  
Yessir!  
  
**All：**  
Whaaaaaa?!
