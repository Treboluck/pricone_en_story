## Subtitle: The Girl Who Fell from the Sky
  
**Narration：**  
The Omniscient Kaiser, who plotted to make the world her own,  
lies defeated at the hands of a nameless hero.  
  
**Narration：**  
Pecorine, who had been forgotten by all her subjects,  
has recovered her true name of Eustiana  
and returned to claim the throne.  
  
**Narration：**  
And now, one month has passed since that fateful battle...  
  
**Mother & Daughter：**  
Aaaaghhhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
─GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord!  
Let us intervene!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Absolutely!  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Haahhh!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Yahhh!  
`Tag 2`  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Are you OK?!  
`Tag 3`  
**Daughter：**  
Y-yeah!  
Thanks a bunch, nice guy, nice girl!  
  
**Mother：**  
Th-thank you so much...  
Thank you ever so much...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
To think dangerous monsters are at large even here,  
on a road so close to Landosol.  
It seems  
 the knights of Nightmare are still sorely understaffed.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Madam and miss.  
The two of us are adventurers from Landosol,  
on our way home from performing a delivery job.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Would you care to join us in this carriage?  
We would be happy to negotiate with the coachman on your behalf.  
  
**Mother：**  
This really is so helpful.  
My daughter and I left Landosol during the monster crisis  
and took refuge for a while at my parents' village...  
  
**Mother：**  
But we recently received a letter from my husband  
assuring us that the city was recovering.  
So I thought it would be safe to return home with my girl.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That cannot have been easy.  
 Still, please do not fear.  
Just as your husband informed you, the city is at peace once more,  
and spirits are high from the recovery efforts.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord and I too, in recent days, have been doing all we can  
to help the city rebuild. Today, we were visiting a certain farm  
to deliver food orders and payment for supplies...  
  
**Daughter：**  
Hey, nice guy! Let's play!  
  
**Mother：**  
N-now, now!  
I'm sorry about her, good sir.  
She's always so full of energy...  
  
**Daughter：**  
Let's play, let's play~! ♪  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Sure, I'll play with you.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, are you certain that is wise?  
Are you not still fatigued from battle?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'm totally fine.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kokkoro：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Since our clash with the Kaiser, a month has passed.  
My lord's battle wounds appear to be fully healed, and yet...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ever since that day,  
from time to time, my lord's consciousness seems to waver.  
He tries to avoid worrying me by not letting it show, but...  
  
**Mother：**  
I have to say, you're a remarkable pair.  
You're both still so young,  
yet you work so hard to help others...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We are merely striving  
to earn our keep in this world as best we can...  
But thank you nonetheless.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The Sarendia Orphanage where the two of us stayed for a time  
is busier than ever looking after newly orphaned children.  
If we are to repay them, we will require finances.  
 ...  
And yet...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...My lord. It is hard to imagine your fatal wound left no effects.  
You really must continue to rest as much as possible.  
I will gladly earn enough finances for both of us, so...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I want to support you too.  
**Choice: (7)**  I can't sit back while you're working hard.  
`Tag 6`  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord...  
In battle and in life, you have grown so very strong.  
  
Jump to tag 8  
`Tag 7`  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Ah, how terrible.  
I know I must keep you safe above all else...  
And yet the thought of having you by my side brings me such joy...  
  
`Tag 8`  
**Kokkoro：**  
...So what is this feeling?  
Why is my chest filled with an unease that I cannot explain?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Why do I feel as though the lord who I love and trust  
might leave me at any moment?  
I cannot seem to shake this troubling premonition...  
  
**Daughter：**  
...Huh~?  
Hey guys, what's that up there?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Up where?  
`Tag 9`

**Kokkoro：**  
...?  
I sense a magical signature from the sky near the Tower of Sol...  
Is that...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A girl... falling from the sky?!  
  
**Daughter：**  
Huh?! But why?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
She does not appear conscious...  
I fear a collision with the ground may prove fatal!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  I've got to save her!
