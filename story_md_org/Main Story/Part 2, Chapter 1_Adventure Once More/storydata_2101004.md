Ameth speaks to {player} in a dream. She explains that the reason he has reverted to an infant state is due to the friction created between his old and new identities during the battle with the Omniscient Kaiser.

**???：**  
Listen... Hey, listen!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  ...?  
`Tag 1`  
**Ameth：**  
{player}!  
Yes, you, {player}!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Get a hold of yourself!  
Can you hear my voice...?!  
  
**Ameth：**  
...Unlike normal, it barely feels like we're connected...  
How awkward.  
Guess I'll just have to keep talking and hope you hear me...  
  
**Ameth：**  
...Listen, {player}.  
I don't know if you can understand me,  
but I'll explain your current situation.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Right now, you're suffering serious damage.  
Not in your body, but in your soul.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Do you remember?  
When the Kaiser almost killed you,  
I brought you here and you talked to Akira.

**Labyrista：**  
The Princess Knight abilities I restored to you...  
It's true that they're your own power, {player}.  
But the \"you\" they belong to is the \"old you.\"  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Your slightly different former self from before you lost your memories...  
If you unleash his powers as you are now,  
I can't say what might happen to the \"new\" you.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
It's possible that those slight differences  
could cause the \"key\" to shatter into pieces.  
Or worse, they could trigger a rebound and shatter the user's body.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
In the very worst case, an irresolvable error could occur,  
prompting this world to erase you from existence.  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
You ended up using that power to save everyone.  
Which was certainly a brave and noble thing...  
  
**Ameth：**  
But in return, you caused some kind of friction with your past self.  
That friction is what's reverted your mind back to infancy.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, it beats Akira's \"worst case\"...  
You haven't disappeared from the world completely, so that's a relief.  
But this is still a pretty big crisis.  
 It can't be easy for Kokkoro...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh—speaking of which, what about that girl you saved?!  
Who even is she?  
For some reason, she's gone baby-mode just like you!  
  
**Ameth：**  
The Tower of Sol must be involved somehow...  
But this tower's so full of mysteries, even I don't fully understand it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
...Still.  
If her memories are lost like yours, I'm sure she must be in trouble.  
So try to be nice to her. Even if you'll have your own problems.  
  
**Ameth：**  
...Ohhh, the connection was already unstable,  
but it's getting even weaker...  
I guess there's no time to say much more...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Let's just say... I'll try to find a way to help you from here.  
For a little while, we probably won't be able to talk like we used to...  
  
**Ameth：**  
But be careful.  
With the Kaiser gone, it may seem like peace has returned...  
But something's giving me a really bad feeling.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Yes, just a feeling.  
As a former Guide Fairy, this may be a bit vague...  
But I feel like there's something big approaching.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It could mean more difficult battles ahead.  
Maybe even worse than your clash with the Omniscient Kaiser.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Don't you dare lose, hero!  
And if I can have one wish...  
  
**Ameth：**  
I only hope I'll be able to fight by your side this time...
