## Subtitle: The Council Dances
  
**Narration：**  
That evening, in the palace throne room...  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Following the Council's dispatchment of the Golden Hand main force,  
the invading monsters fled underground.  
Thanks to our soldiers' efforts, we were able to avoid any further harm.  
  
**Noble：**  
Ah!  
The Golden Hand is reliable indeed!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
However... Regrettably, the damage was already done. Including the  
just-completed Creditta Tower, fifteen buildings in the vicinity were  
destroyed, and efforts are still underway to attend to the many injured.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...  
  
**Gorschin：**  
That concludes our initial report on this monster disturbance.  
Your Majesty, I must ask you to swiftly approve funds for our efforts to—  
  
**Pecorine：**  
U-um, Mr. Gorschin!  
What about {player}, and Kokkoro and the others?  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Hm?  
...Who might they be?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
They're my good friends!  
Before the Golden Hand arrived, they were in the plaza  
fighting against the monsters!  
 You saw them too, didn't you?  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Ahhh... Those individuals.  
Hmmm...  
Hmm, hmm...  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Well, I cannot say I see their names on the injured list.  
They will likely have returned to their guildhouse, will they not?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmmm...  
I suppose that makes sense.  
...  
I'll have to drop by the guildhouse later and check...  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Majesty... I refrained from bringing this up earlier...  
But in a crisis situation such as this,  
you cannot truly intend to make frivolous private visits?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Urk...!  
But listen, it's not a recreational—  
  
**Gorschin：**  
A-hem! ...Listen carefully, Majesty.  
Once these funds have been fully checked and approved,  
we will require you to issue a royal proclamation of safety to the public.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? A proclamation... of safety?  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Yes. So soon after the Omniscient Kaiser's misdeeds,  
this new incursion of monster activity  
will surely cause unrest in the hearts of Landosol's citizens.  
  
**Gorschin：**  
The task of dispelling those fears falls to none other  
than this nation's head of state—  
Princess Eustiana, your own royal personage.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...  
Yes, you're right.  
I suppose that is... a necessary measure.  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Ah, Your Majesty's wisdom knows no bounds.  
I am honored that you would give my counsel due consideration.  
  
**Noble：**  
Then we will begin compiling the proclamation at once.  
Please await its completion.  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Once the plaza is made presentable, we will gather the populace  
so that Your Majesty may relay the proclamation in person.  
Until that time, please continue auditing the emergency funds.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
......  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*sigh*...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I really hope {player} and the others aren't hurt...  
At this rate, it doesn't look like I'll be seeing them any time soon...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I expect they'll be sitting down for a snack about now.  
...  
Ahhh, I'm so hungry...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Meals at the palace are pretty tasty, I can't deny... But with all  
the strict manners, I can't enjoy a bite in peace. And once the  
table setting and food tasting's done, it's barely even warm...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Piping-hot rice balls... crepes... grilled fish... takoyaki...  
Urgh. Just the thought of it makes my tummy rumble...  
  
**Soldier：**  
Forgive my intrusion, Your Majesty.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh?  
Oh—hello!  
Is something the matter?  
  
**Soldier：**  
I have brought a meat bun from a city stall.  
Please accept this small offering, Your Majesty.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhhh!  
Thank you so much! I'll dig right in!  
*munch munch munch*...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Mmmmm, it's so gooood!  
The way the meaty juices fill your mouth...  
 How crazy is that?!  
I can't get enough!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Wait, huh?!  
Where did that nice soldier go...?  
  
**Neneka：**  
It's a pleasure to see you, my dear Queen Eustiana.  
I'm glad to see you enjoyed the gift I brought.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Neneka?!  
Was that soldier just now one of your disguises, then?!  
  
**Neneka：**  
Yes, precisely. ...  
If I ever wished to poison you,  
it would be easier than taking candy from a baby.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Come on, don't say scary things like that!  
But I'd still eat it anyway!  
Thank you for the meat bun! It was the yummiest!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So, um... What exactly are you here about?  
If you snuck past all the palace security,  
I'm guessing you've got something important to tell me?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Well, yes.  
I suppose I should begin by getting directly to the point.  
  
**Neneka：**  
The world is in peril, Your Majesty.
