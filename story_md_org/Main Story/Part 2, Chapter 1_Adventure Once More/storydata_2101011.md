**Hiyori：**  
Oh—Mr. Knight!  
Good morning! ♪  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Goo mo-ing! ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, my lord! So you have awoken once more.  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight, you were fast asleep for a little while.  
  
**Rei：**  
You dozed off so suddenly, it was quite the surprise...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Agreed.  
Are you sure you're OK?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  ...I'm OK!  
`Tag 8`  
**Karyl：**  
Uh-huh?  
If you say so...  
 Hm?  
  
**Yui：**  
Ah... Mr. Knight,  
 have you gotten a bit better at talking?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  ...Maybe...  
`Tag 9`  
**Kokkoro：**  
The words you speak are growing more eloquent already.  
How wonderful, my lord... ♪  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That's so great!  
Eheheh.  
 At this rate, you'll be back  
to your cool old self in no time!  
  
**Rei：**  
Yes, that's good news.  
 I always feel more secure  
knowing that you're at our back protecting us.  
  
**Choice: (10)**  ...  
`Tag 10`  
**Yui：**  
...Mr. Knight, are you still sleepy?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Or perhaps... Are you attempting  
to recall something you witnessed in your dream?  
  
**Choice: (11)**  Dream...  
`Tag 11`  
**Karyl：**  
Shh.  
Hey, you'd better quiet down, Koro, {player}.  
...Someone's coming.  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Ooh...?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Footsteps?  
Sounds like... five men...?  
  
**Soldier 1：**  
Chairman Gorschin, this way!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Ugh, how awful... This place reeks of mold!  
My made-to-measure boots will be stained...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Gah... This guy!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
...A-hem!  
Very good, very good! You felons seem to be behaving yourselves!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
You're the guy who took Peco away back at the plaza...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I believe you are a noble by the name of Mr. Gorschin?  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Indeed.  
It is I, Chairman of the Council of Nobles, Marquis Gorschin himself!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmph. Chairman now, are you?  
You must've pulled some fancy tricks  
in the confusion after Lady Mana's fall!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
My, my! Why, if it isn't the stray beastgirl who fancied herself  
our former Majesty's confidante!  
What brings you to a place like this?  
  
**Karyl：**  
As if you don't know already!  
You were at my trial, smirking in the gallery the whole time!  
Don't think I didn't see you!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Ahahahah! Without your mistress,  
it seems you've finally fallen to your proper place,  
my dear little beast!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Beasts belong securely in cages, after all.  
It sickened me to see our proud and historic palace  
besmirched by your kind for so long!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Why, you...!  
  
**Yui：**  
How awful...!  
Why would you say things like that...?!  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Goo!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...This man seems like a classic example  
of the closed-minded Landosol nobility Miss Maho told us of.  
  
**Rei：**  
Chairman Gorschin, I beg you to listen.  
Just now, you addressed us as felons,  
but I don't believe any of our number has committed a crime.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That's right!  
It's some kind of mistake that we got thrown in here!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah, exactly!  
Let us see Pecorine...  
 uh, I mean...  
 Her Majesty Princess Eustiana!  
She'll sort this out in no time!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Hah! After your Majesty's fall,  
you've ingratiated yourself with her successor?  
You do enjoy fawning upon friends in high places, don't you, beast?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Excuse me...?! Her Majesty's one thing,  
but I'd never dream of \"fawning\" over Pecorine!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
I see, I see!  
Then I see no need to summon Princess Eustiana herself  
to visit a pack of felons in this filthy dungeon.  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Her Majesty is a very busy woman.  
As Chairman of the Council,  
I cannot afford to interrupt her work with such trifling matters.  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Yes... Myself and the members of the Golden Hand  
should more than suffice to pass judgment in this instance!  
  
**Yui：**  
\"Judgment\"...?!  
  
**Rei：**  
Wait a minute! Let's not get ahead of ourselves!  
In the first place, didn't I just explain that none of us  
have committed any crime?  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Poppycock!  
If there were no cause to arrest you, you would not be here.  
Wanted criminal and her associates!  
  
**Rei：**  
\"Wanted criminal\"...?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hold on. You can't mean me, right?!  
Then which of us is the wanted one?!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
That would be...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That would be...?  
  
**Choice: (12)**  ...  
`Tag 12`  
**Gorschin：**  
That would be you.  
Impudent young dragongirl.  
  
**Sheffy：**  
...Sheffee?  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Yes, that's right. They called you \"Sheffy,\" didn't they?  
We thought you were a lone actor,  
but to think you had so many accomplices!  
  
**Yui：**  
Little Sheffy is... a wanted criminal...?!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Indeed.  
For attempted assassination of royalty, no less.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
A-attempted assassination...?!  
  
**Yui：**  
That's... that's not possible!  
There's no way Sheffy could do anything like that!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Exactly! Her and {player} are practically babies...  
They're so dumb right now,  
they try to eat pet fairies and random items off the ground!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
\"Right now,\" you may be correct.  
But what about half a year ago?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Half a year...  
That would be while the Omniscient Kaiser was still in power.  
Long before any of us became acquainted with Miss Sheffy...  
  
**Rei：**  
But then... if Sheffy really did  
attempt to assassinate a royal personage...  
Wouldn't that make her target the Omniscient Kaiser?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Come to think of it...  
 I do recall an assassination attempt.  
I was out of the city when it happened,  
so I don't know the details, but...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Wait a minute!  
If her crime was standing up to the Kaiser, aren't we all—  
Mmmph?!  
  
**Rei：**  
Wait a minute, Hiyori!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
R-Rei...?  
Why'd you cover my mouth like that?  
  
**Rei：**  
The Kaiser was defeated  
by Pecorine and the knights of Nightmare.  
That's the story that was officially announced, remember?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ohhh, good point...!  
Drawing too much attention could make doing adventuring jobs tricky,  
so we decided to keep our names  
 on the down-low, huh...  
  
**Rei：**  
Yes.  
Besides, it wasn't just us in that battle.  
It also involved Makoto, Kaori and so forth from the Menagerie.  
  
**Rei：**  
If our beastfolk friends  
were accused of deposing the monarch of Landosol...  
it could lead to talk of war and other such topics best avoided.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That's true...  
 I never thought it was a big deal,  
but with guys like that noble who actually hate beastfolk around...  
I guess we can't be too careful...  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Ahem! What are you muttering about?!  
Inventing new excuses, perhaps?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
No, no! It's not like that at all!  
  
**Yui：**  
That's right! More like the opposite, if anything...!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
...Hmm?  
Well, no matter.  
I can already imagine the excuses you might come up with.  
  
**Gorschin：**  
\"The former monarch was a pretender, so the crime is void\"?  
Or perhaps you \"never knew that dragongirl to begin with\"?  
Does that sound right?  
  
**Gorschin：**  
However...  
Invading the palace. Property damage. Injuries to soldiers.  
These crimes cannot be ignored.  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Above all, we have no reason to assume  
that this girl and her associates will not plot another attempt.  
Thus, I have a duty to pass judgment on you all!  
  
**Yui：**  
No way! That's crazy talk...!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Crazy? Far from it, I think!  
As a proud member of the nobility, I must protect Princess Eustiana!  
And in so doing, defend the nation she represents!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Now, Golden Hand! Raise your bows!  
Through the bars of this cell, pierce the felons with arrows of justice!  
  
**Soldier 1：**  
...Yessir!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wha—?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Y-you're holding a summary execution?!  
We don't even get a trial...?!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Oh? You desire a trial?  
Then let us hold an official tribunal right here and now!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Jurists of the Golden Hand!  
What is your verdict?!  
  
**Soldier 2：**  
Guilty!  
  
**Soldier 1：**  
Guilty!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Sentence is passed.  
 Guilty!  
Death! Death to the felons!  
Let the execution begin!  
  
**Soldier 2：**  
Yessir!  
As you command!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
S-stoooop!  
  
**Rei：**  
Ngh... What can we do...?!  
  
**Choice: (13)**  Protect everyone.  
`Tag 13`  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, please stand back!  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Goooo!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
...Fire!
