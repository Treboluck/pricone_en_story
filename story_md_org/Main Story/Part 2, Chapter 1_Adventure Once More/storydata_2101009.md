# Part 2: Chapter 1 Episode 9
Arrested as dangerous felons, {player} and friends can do little but wait for Pecorine to rescue them. In their cell, they speculate on the identity of the strange boy, the monsters, and the mysterious light given off by Yui. Meanwhile, the strange boy himself returns from his failed operation to speak with a man named Zane.
  
## Subtitle: Bewildering Imprisonment
  
**Yui：**  
Is anybody here?!  
Please... at least hear what we have to say!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Geez!  
Let us out!  
Just let us out already!  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Gaaaa!  
Goo!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
To think we would find ourselves in these dungeons once more...  
  
**Karyl：**  
...*sigh*  
This place is as dingy and depressing as ever.  
  
**Rei：**  
You two... have been to these dungeons before?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well...  
 yes.  
Up until not that long ago...  
I was imprisoned here myself, as Lady Mana's accomplice.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As for my lord and I, we visited a little earlier,  
when we were forced to invade the royal palace  
to rescue Miss Pecorine from captivity.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, I never knew...  
That must've been pretty tough.  
  
**Yui：**  
Not that our situation now is exactly great, either...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed.  
But nowadays, this palace is ruled not by the Omniscient Kaiser,  
but by our friend Miss Pecorine.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If she learns of our predicament,  
she will surely waste no time in releasing us from this cell.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That's true!  
And I mean, in the first place, this is all a misunderstanding!  
There's no way any of us are on a wanted list!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah... that's true.  
To start with, I honestly thought this mess might be my fault...  
  
**Karyl：**  
But I was granted probation in court...  
and I haven't caused trouble since.  
I'm even allowed to use magic if it's for my guild activities.  
  
**Rei：**  
Indeed.  
We haven't done anything wrong,  
so it seems wisest to just wait for Pecorine to find us.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Oh, right!  
So Rei, that's why you said we should go along quietly  
when they came for us!  
  
**Rei：**  
To be honest, relying on a friend's influence  
doesn't sit too well with me personally.  
Even so, there's a time and place for everything.  
  
**Rei：**  
If we'd fought back to resist arrest back there...  
I expect we'd have been able to escape.  
 However, raising my blade  
against humans that aren't even Shadows... It wouldn't feel right.  
  
**Yui：**  
I wouldn't want to hurt any innocent soldiers...  
And besides, the last thing we want to do  
is put Mr. Knight and Sheffy in danger!  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Yoo-ee...  
  
**Yui：**  
Hehe... Good girl, good girl.  
Hey, Mr. Knight, are you really feeling OK?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  ...Uh-huh!  
`Tag 1`  
`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
I see... That's good!  
I'm still a bit worried about that thing you swallowed...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Speaking of that...  
Yui, are you feeling weird at all?  
  
**Yui：**  
...Huh?  
Me? Why?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
You know—that bright glowing magic thing!  
You said you couldn't control your own magic...  
So I was wondering if you're OK.  
  
**Yui：**  
Mmm...  
What was that light in the end?  
I don't think it harmed me.  
 If anything, I'm full of energy.  
  
**Yui：**  
Back there, I was trying to heal Mr. Knight...  
And I thought it had worked, but just then  
 my body started glowing...  
What could have caused all that...?  
  
**Rei：**  
...Haha.  
I'd be thrilled if you could actually control it next time.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Those monsters we just fought... That freaky aura they had  
made all our attacks do squat—  
uh, do nothing.  
That magic of Yu... Miss Yui's might have saved us all.  
  
**Yui：**  
Hmm... I don't know its incantation or effects,  
so I don't know if I can use it again...  
But that aside...  
  
**Yui：**  
Hey, Karyl.  
You can just call me Yui, OK?  
We're all friends who fought together against the Kaiser, after all.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yeah, and call me Hiyori!  
I'd love it if you could be pals with us,  
just like with Kokkoro and Peco!  
  
**Rei：**  
Agreed. Lately, the three of us have been spending  
more time in the Gourmet Guild's guildhouse...  
And as fate would have it, now we find ourselves sharing a cell.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Urk. That's,  
 uh, well...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Arghhh...  
Th-this is so awkward!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Now that I'm not working for Lady Mana,  
I don't know how I should talk to these guys...!  
It's not like with the Gourmet Guild that I was trying to infiltrate...  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Oh, geez!  
Why am I such an idiot?!  
I should just try to act normal! Totally normal!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ummm...  
So, um...  
 Yu... Yu...  
  
**Yui：**  
...  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Urghhh...  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Ooo...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Ahhh...  
Actually, what was the goal of those monsters, anyway?  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh?  
Oh...  
 well.  
I guess we don't really know...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ohhh, geez...!  
I don't even know how to do \"normal\" anymore...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl...  
 You truly are a natural \"tsundere\" to the core...  
It cannot be an easy life.  
  
**Rei：**  
...Hmm.  
Those monsters... Rather than attacking the citizens,  
they seemed more focused on damaging the surrounding buildings...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If it was that boy who brought them...  
Would that mean those were his orders?  
  
**Karyl：**  
...It's certainly possible. But that brat...  
I don't think he was controlling them with magic  
or anything like my old Princess Knight ability.  
  
**Karyl：**  
In my case, while I was using my control ability,  
I could barely do anything else myself.  
Besides, those monsters were going pretty wild for a bunch of puppets.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That boy... Who even was he?  
Why did he want to hurt everyone like that?  
Do you think... he has any friends or family...?  
  
**Rei：**  
His goals are unknown, but we also know very little else about him.  
Rather than attacking a target, he tried to cause wanton destruction.  
And I suppose it seems he can enhance monsters and give them orders.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Also, as he left, he used what appeared to be a Spatial Leap.  
It is difficult to say whether it allows him to travel quite as freely  
as Mr. Rajraj, but...  
  
**Rei：**  
Yes... The way the monsters appeared inside the city,  
bypassing the watchful guards, must surely be thanks to that power.  
Quite the troublesome ability...  
  
**Yui：**  
There's one more thing.  
That boy...  
Before he vanished, he said that he'd \"be back soon.\"  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Which means...  
he must be planning to attack the city again...?  
That's really bad! We've gotta stop him!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
However, if he has a Spatial Leap ability,  
there is no way to predict when or where he may appear.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Geez... What an annoying runt!  
He even called me a \"mangy cat\"!  
Next time I see him, I'm gonna kick his butt till there's nothing left of it!  
  
### Place: ???
  
**Boy：**  
Tch...  
  
**Boy：**  
Aghhh, dammit!  
Just the memory of it is still pissing me off!  
  
**Boy：**  
She thinks she can call *me* a \"lousy runt\"?!  
That mangy cat!  
Next time I see her, I'm smacking her face till there's nothing left!  
  
**Slime (Red)：**  
Plghh!  
  
**Slime (Blue)：**  
Prnghh!  
  
**Slime (Yellow)：**  
Pyoing.  
  
**Boy：**  
Dammit!  
Quit dodging, Yellow!  
Show some respect...!  
  
**???：**  
...  
  
**???：**  
...You shouldn't lash out at your own pets.  
  
**Boy：**  
Ehhh?!  
Oh... Blech, it's just you...  
Zane.  
  
**Boy：**  
Tch... Why should you care?  
Not like smacking those jelly bodies'll leave a scratch anyway.  
  
**Zane：**  
I see.  
...If you say so.  
  
**Slimes：**  
Prlhhh!  
  
**Zane：**  
...So. How was it?  
  
**Boy：**  
Ehh?  
How was what?  
  
**Zane：**  
You went there, yes?  
To Landosol.  
  
**Boy：**  
Hah!  
It was a pile of trash!  
I could crush that town in less than...  
  
**Zane：**  
Is it fully destroyed?  
  
**Boy：**  
...Ngh...  
I'm gonna smash it soon!  
I just came back for, uh...  
 a toilet break, that's all!  
  
**Zane：**  
...I see.  
  
**Boy：**  
...What?!  
Gonna stop me, are you?!  
Think I can't do it on my own?!  
  
**Boy：**  
I like hitting fast and hard, and I act alone!  
I don't wanna see you or Azold interfering!  
  
**Zane：**  
Of course.  
Neither I nor the other members will stand in your way.  
  
**Zane：**  
But... as a fellow guildmate, let me say one thing.  
  
**Zane：**  
Don't dismiss a stray stone on your path.  
  
**Boy：**  
...Ehhh?  
  
**Zane：**  
In this... crudely made world,  
many systems exist that we know nothing of.  
What looks like a simple stray stone... may bare hidden fangs.  
  
**Zane：**  
If you thoughtlessly try to kick it aside,  
you may not only trip, but find your foot in its maw.  
  
**Boy：**  
...  
  
**Boy：**  
Unknown systems, huh...  
  

---  
  
**Rei：**  
Her body's emitting blinding light...!  
What in the world is this phenomenon?!  
  
**Yui：**  
I... I don't know!  
Umm... umm... What should I...?  
Wahhh?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Ah!  
The aura around the monsters has disappeared!  
  

---  
  
**Boy：**  
...Hah.  
I guess your advice... well, it might make some sense, Zane.  
  
**Boy：**  
...So?  
What're you suggesting?  
  
**Zane：**  
...It's simple.  
You shouted it yourself at your own pet slimes.  
  
**Zane：**  
Show them a little respect.  
  
**Boy：**  
...Tch.  
  
**Zane：**  
I understand your disdain.  
But...  
  
**Boy：**  
...Yeah.  
I get it.  
  
**Boy：**  
I'll do what I have to.  
Whatever it takes to make my wish come true.
