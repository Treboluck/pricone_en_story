**Gorschin：**  
...Fire!  
  
**Yui：**  
*cough*... *cough*...  
  
**Sheffy：**  
*cough* *cough*  
  
**Rei：**  
What's going on now...?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Was that blast one of your spells, Miss Karyl...?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Of course not!  
...But what the heck *was* it?!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Ahhh...!  
So you show your true colors, felons!  
At this point, it falls to me to... Ngh!  
  
**Soldier 1：**  
Chairman Gorschin!  
The explosion blew a hole in the roof...  
Something's coming from above!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Wha—?!  
Monsters, here?!  
Underground or no, this is the royal palace! What are the guards—?!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Gorschin：**  
Nguaaahhhh?!  
  
**Soldier 2：**  
Chairman Gorschiiiiin!  
  
**Soldier 1：**  
Fire! Fire!  
  
**Soldier 2：**  
...I-it's not working!  
Our arrows just bounce off!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Soldiers：**  
Guaaahhhhh!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey!  
Aren't these monsters...?!  
  
**Rei：**  
Yes!  
They're the same ones that attacked the plaza a few hours ago!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Which means...!  
  
**Boy：**  
...Hey.  
Finally, I found you losers.  
  
**Yui：**  
That boy...!  
He really did come back!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
\"Finally\"...?  
 This suggests the boy has decided  
to make us his specific targets.  
Unlike before...  
  
**Boy：**  
That's the deal.  
To achieve my goal, I gotta get rid of anyone who'll get in the way.  
  
**Rei：**  
Your goal...?  
  
**Yui：**  
Who even are you...?  
  
**Boy：**  
My name's Kariza.  
Kariza of Rage Legion.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...\"Kariza,\" huh...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...\"Rage Legion\"...  
Could that be the name of the guild that this boy belongs to...?  
  
**Rei：**  
I doubt you've suddenly learned good manners.  
When we asked your name before, you laughed at the question.  
What makes this time different?  
  
**Kariza：**  
Good manners...?  
As if I give a crap about those.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Then what's your deal?!  
  
**Kariza：**  
Nothing's changed.  
I could crush \"stray stones\" like you without even trying.  
...But I messed it up once already.  
  
**Kariza：**  
So, y'see.  
This time, I figure I'll treat you as enemies.  
As a threat that needs destroying.  
  
**Kariza：**  
That's why I told you my name.  
To give you a at least a bit more value.  
Stray stones on the path don't call me by name, do they?  
  
**Yui：**  
...I don't quite get it...  
But I guess you mean you're taking us seriously?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Honestly, I'd rather avoid all this fighting to begin with...  
  
**Rei：**  
But the boy doesn't seem willing to relent.  
In fact, he gave his name because he means to fight. Is that right?  
  
**Kariza：**  
Yeah. Well, that and...  
I was getting sick of the mangy cat  
calling me stuff like \"runt\" and \"brat\"!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Who're you calling mangy?!  
I've been stuck in a prison cell where an upstart noble almost killed us,  
so I'm *not* in the mood for your mouth right now!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You dumb runt!  
Lousy brat!  
This time, I'm killing you so dead!  
  
**Kariza：**  
...Hah.  
  
**Kariza：**  
Murder them, monster scum.  
Crush that cage and mince these morons' guts!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Waahhh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Even a high security prison cell reinforced with magic  
will not last long under an assault of this magnitude!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Guys, get back!  
I didn't want to use this against humans,  
but if it's monsters, I can blast 'em...!  
  
**Rei：**  
Wait!  
These monsters still have that aura.  
Our attacks won't have any effect!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh yeah...!  
 Then, um... um... Yui!  
Can you do that glowy thing one more time?!  
  
**Yui：**  
Huhhhh...?!  
U-ummmm...!  
  
**Rei：**  
Please try, Yui!  
It's the only chance we have to overcome them right now!  
  
**Yui：**  
...I'm so sorry!  
Without knowing the incantation or effects, I really can't...!  
  
**Kariza：**  
Hah!  
Like I thought! That weird flashy magic  
isn't something you can use on command!  
  
**Kariza：**  
If you can't erase my power,  
you don't stand a chance against my monsters!  
I'll kill you dead in no time, pink-haired girl!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
We won't let you do that!  
  
**Kariza：**  
Sure!  
I ain't just after her!  
I'll crush all you punks, then flatten this whole palace as well!  
  
**Yui：**  
Why...?  
Why would you want to do these things?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Could he have some manner of grudge against this kingdom?  
  
**Kariza：**  
Hah! Fat chance of that.  
This is all just a means of granting my wish!  
A wish I'd never be able to grant in any normal way!  
  
**Rei：**  
To grant a wish...?  
So that's the \"goal\" you mentioned...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
But hold on!  
Wrecking the town and hurting people...?  
Nasty stuff like that won't make wishes come true!  
  
**Yui：**  
Agreed! If anything, you'd be better off  
climbing the Tower of Sol with us!  
  
**Kariza：**  
...Ehhh?  
The Tower of Sol?  
  
**Kariza：**  
...Hah!  
You really don't know a damn thing, huh?  
  
**Kariza：**  
That tower's just an empty husk.  
Nothing left up at the top. Just an empty birdcage.  
You won't get any wishes granted there.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Huh...? Whaaaaaa...?!  
  
**Yui：**  
No way...!  
Then what have our efforts as Twinkle Wish been for...?!  
  
**Rei：**  
Kariza, is that the truth?!  
And if so, why would you have knowledge of—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh!  
They have bitten through the bars of our cell!  
  
**Kariza：**  
Go on! Try to resist me!  
I'll crush all your pathetic attempts  
and leave you as stains on the wall!  
  
**Rei：**  
Nghhh...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Aaahhhh!  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Unhhhh...!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!
