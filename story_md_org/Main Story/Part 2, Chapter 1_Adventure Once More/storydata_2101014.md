# Part 2: Chapter 1 Episode 14
Transfigured into their Princess Forms, Pecorine and Yui mount an offensive against Kariza and his monsters, wielding power that far exceeds anything they were previously capable of—and not long afterwards, they are both assaulted by incredible pangs of hunger. This new power seems to herald the start of a brand-new adventure...
  
## Subtitle: A New Power
  
**Yui：**  
Huhhh?! What is this...?!  
My clothes look all different...?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wooow! I tried doing what Neneka told me to,  
and I really managed to transform! ♪  
 How crazy is that?! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-what happened to you two?!  
Those outfits...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This is the new power {player}'s given us!  
We can go into the details later, OK?  
  
**Yui：**  
I'd kind of like to hear some explanations too...  
 But for now...!

**Kariza：**  
...Heh!  
I dunno what kind of new power that is,  
but it won't stop me crushing you all flat!  
  
**Giant Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The monsters have grown larger than ever...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh crap!  
If they get too big in this tiny cell, there'll be nowhere to run!  
  
**Kariza：**  
Hahah!  
Die, die, die!

**Giant Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Auughh...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Everything's fine!  
Yaaahhhhh!  
  
**Giant Monster：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, wow!  
Peco's pushing back that gigantic monster all on her own!  
  
**Rei：**  
Yes!  
And that aura is doing nothing to stop her!  
  
**Yui：**  
I'll try this too!  
Spirits of light! Grant me the power to cleave the heavens and earth!  
  
**Kariza：**  
G-guaaaaaarghhhh?!  
  
**Giant Monster：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  

---  
  
**Kariza：**  
Nghhh...  
 Th-the sky?!  
  
**Kariza：**  
Pinky blasted me all the way up here from those dungeons?!  
And with a single attack spell?!  
  
**Kariza：**  
Still, that's no big deal!  
I've taught my dumb minions how to fly just fine!  
  
**Giant Monster：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Kariza：**  
Arnold!  
And Enolith, too?!  
  
**Kariza：**  
...Dammit!  
Talk about useless monster scum!  
  
**Kariza：**  
But seriously, what the heck's up with those guys?!  
It's almost like Zane was right this whole time!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahh...! The brat got away again!  
  
**Rei：**  
He Spatial Leapt away, monsters and all...  
Still, I have to say...  
  
**Yui：**  
We're back, guys!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh... We totally beat him!  
Victory!  
  
**All：**  
...  
  
**Sheffy：**  
Bicko-ee! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Wait, huh?  
What's the matter, everyone?  
  
**Karyl：**  
That's our line, dummy!  
What's with the fancy clothes?!  
And all that power!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yui, and Peco too...!  
It was crazy how much you powered up!  
You were like... whoom, zoom, kaboom!  
  
**Rei：**  
Your magical and physical strength were magnified,  
and it seemed like you could slice right through those monsters' auras.  
But how in the world...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Just now, Miss Pecorine,  
you spoke of some manner of \"new power.\"  
But what is it, exactly...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, this thing?  
It's called a Princess Form, apparently! ☆  
How crazy is that?! ☆  
  
**All：**  
A Princess Form?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Apparently it's related  
to that magical item that he ate earlier.  
Though I'm not exactly clear on all the details myself...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Just spill everything you know!  
Don't you dare leave us hanging!

**Pecorine：**  
Well, of course, Karyl!  
...Ohhh...  
 But, um... before we do that...  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh...? What is this?  
My body...  
No... my stomach...?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Y-Yui? Are you OK...?!  
You didn't get hurt in the battle, did you?!  
  
**Yui：**  
N-no... Not exactly, but...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  ...Ohhh...  
`Tag 1`  
**Sheffy：**  
Gaaa, goo! ♪  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Goo... ga goo...  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
M-my lord...?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yui?! Yui...?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
C'mon... Pecorine?!  
  
**Yui & Pecorine：**  
Urghhh...!  
  
![210101403.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/210101403.webp)  
**Yui & Pecorine：**  
I'm sooooo starving!

**Narration：**  
My lord was suddenly reduced to an infant once more.  
  
**Narration：**  
From the sky descended a strange girl with no memories—Miss Sheffy.  
  
**Narration：**  
And the strange boy who attacked Landosol—Kariza.  
  
**Narration：**  
New enemies lurked in the shadows.  
Miss Pecorine, now returned to her throne, awakened a new power.  
  
**Narration：**  
Hidden plots of hope and despair,  
entwined in the wheels of fate, began to turn...  
  
**Narration：**  
And it seemed our days of adventure and battle  
were undoubtedly beginning once more.
