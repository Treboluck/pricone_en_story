## Subtitle: Interlude 2
  
**Ameth：**  
And that’s the end of that chapter.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Welcome back to your dreamworld...  
The in-between world where I explain things you already know.  
 Haha.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So, it looks like your story has really kicked off, hasn't it?  
First your carriage gets blown up, then you get attacked by  
one strange group after another... Quite the day you're having.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Enough trouble for a lifetime, really.  
With so much going on, you probably couldn't follow it all,  
so as promised, I'll fill you in on anything that wasn't clear.  
  
**Ameth：**  
This time around, the key player is Muimi...  
Or Novem, as it seems she'd rather be called.  
  
**Ameth：**  
This is supposed to be the first time you two have met, isn't it?  
She certainly didn't seem like  
 an acquaintance of yours  
in the same way as Suzume, Shizuru and the rest.  
  
**Ameth：**  
As far as you're concerned right now,  
she must seem like some weird kid who says things that don't make sense...  
  
**Ameth：**  
But the truth is, she's a very important figure in this world.  
She's the key to unravelling the mysteries surrounding you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's why everyone seems to be after her.  
You and your  
friends happened to get caught in between two different factions,  
both trying to get their hands on this important person.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Too bad for you, eh?  
But I suppose that's how adventures tend to start  
for heroes like you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Not all it's cracked up to be, right?  
  
**Ameth：**  
At any rate.  
This world is home to a great mystery.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Or perhaps a \"lie\" would be a better word for it.  
A great and terrible lie. A huge deception, a subtle discrepancy.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And there's a faction making sure everyone believes that lie,  
while getting rid of anyone who doubts it.  
That would be the faction that was pulling the strings behind Octo.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Meanwhile there's also a faction trying to see through the lie  
and solve the great mystery.  
That's the secret society, Labyrinth.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Labyrinth has made solving this mystery their goal,  
which is why they're after Muimi, who holds the key to solving it,  
and why they attacked you like they did.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So of course, the faction who doesn't want the mystery solved  
sent Octo to stop them from getting what they want.  
That's the long and short of what just happened.  
  
**Ameth：**  
As you saw, it was Labyrinth that came out on top.  
Muimi has been captured by Labyrinth now,  
so she'll be out of the picture for a little while.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What will become of her in the end, I couldn't say just yet.  
But those Labyrinth folks aren't a dangerous bunch,  
so I'd like to hope they won't treat her too badly.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You yourself have already met Shizuru and Rino,  
and you seem to get along well enough with them, don't you?  
They're not bad kids, so I don't think they'll do anything too rash.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But those good kids had to stage a grand kidnapping,  
all to take Muimi away by force.  
That's just how important that girl is to this world right now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So, naturally...  
The faction opposing Labyrinth—the ones who don't want the  
mystery solved—aren't going to give up easily, either.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Now that they've failed once,  
they'll probably want to think bigger for their next attempt.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Octo didn't seem that concerned, either,  
so perhaps he's still got some nasty plot up his sleeve.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Be careful out there, {player}.  
You and your friends are caught up in the great current of fate.  
If you don't watch your step, you might lose something you'll regret.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Be cautious, and think before you make each move.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Though frankly, you might not have much time to think,  
what with all the trouble that's headed your way.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Do what you can to deal with it,  
and try your best to stay alive,  
while gathering what clues to the mystery you can find.  
  
**Ameth：**  
First of all, try talking things over with the members of Caon.  
That's the combat guild Makoto belongs to,  
and they'll be taking you into custody for your own protection.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Yep, you'll be stuck with the Caon girls  
 for a little while.  
But you'll find you're already acquainted with some of them,  
so I think you can trust them to look after you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Of course, the final decision of who to trust rests with you.  
I'm just here to give you advice when you get confused.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I don't have the privileges to interfere with your reality.  
So I wouldn't expect too much help from me.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But please do believe me when I say...  
I'll always be on your side,  
{player}.
