# Chapter 1 Episode 5
The mysterious assailants who descended upon Octo's team were Shizuru and Rino, a pair of girls from the secret society \"Labyrinth.\" As the scene descends into a free-for-all melee, the newcomers make off with Muimi.
  
## Subtitle: A Not-So-Secret Society
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey, cut it out!  
What do you think you're playing at?!  
If it's a fight you're after, I'll give you one!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Bring it on! I could use the chance to vent some stress!  
What guild are you from, anyway?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Ohohoh!  
Though our daring deeds should need knowing destruction...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Everyone!  
I think what Rino means is \"need no introduction\"!  
  
**Rino：**  
That's the one, Big Sis Shizuru!  
  
**Rino：**  
As I was saying!  
Though our daring deeds should need no introduction...  
We are the secret society \"Labyrinth,\" seekers of the world's secrets!  
  
**Rino：**  
We have no personal quarrel with you...  
But in this matter, we must intervene!  
  
**Rino：**  
Because if that, um,  
 \"Novem\" girl gets hidden away somewhere...  
It would be quite inconvenient for us!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You know, Rino...  
I don't think secret societies are actually supposed to introduce themselves...  
 Got that?! ☆  
  
**Rino：**  
Guehh?!  
N-no headbutts!  
Do you really gotta do the headbutt thing, Big Sis?! It really hurts!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
And we shouldn't go around telling everyone about  
our secret objectives either...  
 Got that?! ☆  
  
**Rino：**  
Aguahhh!  
Seriously, enough with the headbutts!  
  
**Rino：**  
I'm sorry for messing up, Big Sis!  
I really am!  
I-I'll be a good girl from now on!  
  
**Makoto：**  
What's the deal with this pair of doofuses...?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hmm? \"Labyrinth\"?  
That's not a guild name I've heard before.  
And did they call it a \"secret society\"?  
  
**Rino：**  
Aha! I see an opening!  
Big Sis, let's sneeze this opportunity and grab the target!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Roger that!  
But I think you mean  
\"seize\" rather than \"sneeze\"! ☆  
  
**Makoto：**  
Whoa! She's charging straight at us!  
  
**Makoto：**  
This girl's got guts, I'll give her that!  
Bring it on! I can take you any day!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I hope you don't think just 'cause I'm a beastgirl...  
I'm going to sit around waiting to be hunted  
like a wild hare in a bush!  
  
**Makoto：**  
{player}, you and the others get back! This could get ugly!  
Let's do this one-on-one, you big bully!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Th-the situation has become somewhat chaotic...  
My lord, Suzume, come this way!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ohhhh? Is that {player} I spy?  
We do keep running into each other, don't we?  
I'm not sure I approve of you hiding behind a girl, though! Bad boy! ☆  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Oops... Sorry.  
`Tag 1`  
**Shizuru：**  
Ahaha! What a cute response!  
That’s so like you, {player}!  
It's always a treat to see my little bro!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Is this unstable individual another acquaintance of yours, my lord?  
Perhaps I should assume you know everyone until proven otherwise...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Heheh.  
{player} is quite the special fellow, you know!  
He's smack-dab in the middle of the swirling currents of fate!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Some people are just born to be heroes!  
So don't judge him too harshly, OK?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ah, but I shouldn't get distracted.  
I'm afraid I don't have time to chat with you today, {player}!

**Makoto：**  
Whoaah?!  
This girl... Did she just block my attack  
and take advantage of it to leap a crazy distance through the air?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
She talks like an airhead, but she's actually pretty tough!  
That's more like it... This is starting to get fun!  
Get back here! I wanna see what else you can do! ☆

**Shizuru：**  
Like I said, I don't have time to play right now, little doggie.  
Hurry on back to your kennel!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Nobody likes a girl who's too overbearing, you know?  
Even if I am a little flattered by your enthusiasm! ☆  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But my target right now... is over here!  
Take this! Big Sister Kick! ☆  
  
**Octo：**  
Wha... Me?!  
Hold up, I can't keep track of this many people at once!  
  
**Octo：**  
Can't you see I'm a thinker, not a fighter—  
—G-  
guahhh?!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Octo?!  
You all right over there?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ahaha!  
Weren't you and this guy fighting each other a minute ago?  
Why are you worrying about him now, hmm?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ooh, wait! My Big Sis senses are tingling!  
Could this be... the sweet scent of romance?! ☆  
  
**Muimi：**  
Wh-wha...?!  
Whaddaya think you're saying?! Who *are* you, anyway?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
In your case...  
The name \"Labyrinth\" should be enough  
to give you a good idea, shouldn't it?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
At any rate, we can talk later!  
For now... Big Sister Chop! ☆  
  
**Muimi：**  
Mguarhh?!  
  
**Octo：**  
Muimi?!  
D-did that girl knock her out with a single swipe of her hand?  
That's kinda scary... She's unnervingly efficient!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
There! One Novem successfully retrieved!  
Time for us to make our exit! Rino, back me up!  
  
**Rino：**  
On it!  
Time to teach this naughty guy who makes girls cry  
 a little lesson!  
  
**Octo：**  
Eh?! Whoa whoa whoa!  
Hold it! Stop! Don't shoot!  
  
**Octo：**  
Also, could you quit trying to snatch the Muimi girl?  
Retrieving her is supposed to be *my* job here, not yours!  
  
**Rino：**  
Sorry to be a nuisance, but I'm afraid that's our mission too!  
And if our objectives are the same, it's first come, first served!  
Too bad for you if you couldn't keep up, Mr. Tortoise!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
And that's a wrap! Good work, us!  
Let's head home, shall we, Rino?  
  
**Rino：**  
Sure thing, Big Sis!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Master! It's time for us to retreat,  
so could you provide a little \"object manipulation\"  
to keep anyone from following?  
  
![200100502.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/200100502.webp)  
**Octo：**  
Wha—?  
What's going on *now?!*  
  
**Octo：**  
The trees and the ground are shifting around,  
as if to hide those two from our sight?!  
  
**Octo：**  
Is this magic?  
No, I've never heard of any magic like this...!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Awahhh! I can't stay on my feet!  
What's going on?! I'm scared!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Try to reassure Kokkoro.  
**Choice: (3)**  Offer Suzume some support.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Ahh...?  
M-my lord, you really should not embrace me so suddenly...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Mmmhh...  
I-I am quite all right now.  
I have regained my composure, so please release me...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh...  
I must apologize for freezing up just now, my lord.  
But the fact is, this should not be possible.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Reforming the very earth is the domain of gods or devils alone.  
Have we found ourselves in the midst of a legendary occurrence?  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Suzume：**  
Waahhh?!  
Wh-wh-why are you suddenly hugging me,  
{player}?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh? I looked like I was going to fall?  
Ahh, you were trying to give me a little support!  
  
**Suzume：**  
B-but I'm all right, really!  
I've had a bunch of practice at falling over without getting hurt!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Still, I'm sure you just acted in the heat of the moment...  
Eheheh... It was very nice of you, really.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Makoto：**  
Hey! Can we cut the chatter already?!  
The ground's not stable here! It's going to collapse!  
If we don't get outta here quick, we could all be done for!
