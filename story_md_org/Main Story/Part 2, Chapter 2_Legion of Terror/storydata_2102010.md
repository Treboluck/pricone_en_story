**Monsters：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Rei：**  
This misty breath...  
 Is it poison?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...!  
Our defensive magic cannot hold!  
  
**Yui：**  
I'm so sorry!  
I can't... keep it up...!  
  

---  
  
**Hiyori：**  
*cough*  
*cough*...!  
  
I-I breathed it in! The poison mist...!  
  
**Yui：**  
...Huh?  
...?  
Something smells really nice... Like the scent of the forest...  
  
**Karyl：**  
It looks like it's not poison...  
...B-but...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wh-why do I feel weaker all of a sudden...?  
Aaahhh...

**Rei：**  
...?!  
Traces of that green crystal are appearing on our bodies!  
And they're growing rapidly!  
  
**Karyl：**  
What is this?! Some kind of petrification spell in breath form...?!  
  
**Rei：**  
So this is what defeated Twilight Caravan...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Then are all of us gonna be  
turned into those giant crystals too?!  
  
**Yui：**  
I-it's no good...  
My magic doesn't even seem to slow it down...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
That girl...  
Is she really gonna defeat all of us all by herself...?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...My lord...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Once again, I am subjecting my lord to great distress!  
If only I could do more to aid him...

**Monsters：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Stay back, beast!  
...Aaahhh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Kokkoro?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
 I-I am fine...  
Before the crystallizing breath could reach me,  
my lord guarded me from its effects...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My body is still... almost entirely free of crystal matter.  
I can still move more freely than you all!  
  
**Karyl：**  
But if you're on your own...!  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Aaahhh!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Kokkoro!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...Umm...  
 Miss Kokkoro...  
Would you... go somewhere else...?  
...If you do that... I won't go after you...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I cannot!  
With my lord and our friends in peril,  
how could I think of saving myself...?!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...I'm not... all that familiar with how... the heart works, but...  
When I look at you, I hear the sound of hesitation...  
Ah—I'm so sorry if it's just my mistake...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
But, you know...  
If you feel so unsure, then...  
do you really need to work so hard to carry on...?  
  
**Ranpha：**  
After all, this world is just an illusion...  
A fleeting dream... disturbed by someone...  
so that its flow is horribly stained...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
She is... correct.  
I cannot deny that I feel uncertain.

**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Akira asked  
that I help the people captive in this world  
to return safely to the true reality where they belong.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And I myself do believe that this is the right thing to do.  
...However...  
  

---  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In this world of Astrum...  
I am able to serve by my lord's side without restraint or obstruction.  
A life more wonderful than I could wish for...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
To return to the other world  
would spell the end of our journey together.  
For me, it would mean... waking from this wondrous dream.  
  

---  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...My lord.  
I am sworn to be your guide.  
My role is to protect you, lead you, and aid you in all things.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
From the bottom of my heart, I am glad to stand here as your retainer.  
Simply staying by your side brings me immeasurable joy.  
  

---  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If I could have just one wish...  
I would ask to stay forever by my lord's side...  
  
**Monsters：**

The bond that joins my heart with his!
