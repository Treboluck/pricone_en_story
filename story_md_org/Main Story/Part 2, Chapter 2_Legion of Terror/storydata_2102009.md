### Place: Landosol City: Downtown
  
**Narration：**  
Not too far from Landosol's downtown area...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Everyone, be swift!  
We're approaching the location of the monster sightings!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Okay, Kokkoro!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ugh, geez... Just when I was ready for bed!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  (...So sleepy...  
`Tag 1`  
**Karyl：**  
Wait, not you too!  
 Pick your face up off the ground!  
  
**Yui：**  
I'm sorry we woke you, Mr. Knight. You must be so tired!  
We were able to leave little Sheffy sound asleep, at least...  
  
**Rei：**  
We haven't yet confirmed  
if this new disturbance is the work of the Rage Legion guild...  
But if it is, I'm afraid we'll need your help.  
  
**Rei：**  
I'm sorry, but please hang in there for us!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Karyl!  
Did you send a message to Peco for us?  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Huh? Yes...  
But right now, she's in the palace,  
so it'll take her a while to get here...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait...  
Why's it so quiet around here?  
The mood's creeping me out...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This area is not the most civilized of Landosol's districts...  
But to compensate, I recall its streets as always being alive with activity.  
Yet now...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
There isn't anyone around!  
Do you think they all ran away...?  
  
**Yui：**  
I hope that's all it is...  
  
**Rei：**  
This silence...  
It feels as still as a graveyard.  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...I finally thought...  
it had gotten a little quieter, but...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That's the same young woman we met the other day...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Such magical energy...!  
 She's not normal, that girl!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Huh?!  
Look, you guys!  
There's something behind the girl!  
  
**Yui：**  
Ahhh!  
Those people... they're trapped inside some kind of crystals!  
  
**Rei：**  
Are those... the members of Twilight Caravan?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
You know them, Rei?!  
  
**Rei：**  
The Destroyer, the Collector...  
The One-Eyed Devil and the Living Storm...  
They're all feared professionals in underworld society!  
  
**Rei：**  
And... is that Ruka...?!  
How could anyone defeat a swordswoman of her caliber so easily?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Who in the world are you?  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...Me...?  
  
**Ranpha：**  
My name's... Ranpha.  
I belong to the guild... Rage Legion.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...!  
Then you really are one of that dumb brat Kariza's friends!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Why are you guys attacking the city?!  
It's awful!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
Awful...?  
...Yes. You could say that, I suppose. But...  
 you see...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
If I don't do this... then my wish won't be granted, so...  
  
**Yui：**  
Your... wish...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Which is...?  
  
**Ranpha：**  
I don't know what Kariza and the others desire...  
But my wish is for... a quiet place of my own...  
That's all I want...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
In this world... No matter where I go...  
It's so full of noises, clamoring for attention...  
  
**Rei：**  
You can't mean...  
If you remove this city's people, that will bring you peace?!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...No.  
I wish it were as simple as that, but...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Y-you call that simple?!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
Ahhh... I knew it...  
None of you are able... to hear it either.  
I envy you...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
Here in this world...  
Even aside from the living people... there are so, so many...  
So many voices calling out to us...  
  
**Yui：**  
...Huh?  
I-I don't think I can hear any voices...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Ranpha, was it...?  
Whatever can your words be implying...?  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...  
Then...  
I'll make it easier... for you all to understand...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
... ♪  
  
**Hiyori：**  
She's singing?!  
  
**Yui：**  
What a beautiful voice...  
  
**Karyl：**  
There's magic in that song!  
It's like an incantation! We should stop her!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
Skeletal Wyverns?!  
I think they're protecting Ranpha...!  
  
**Rei：**  
That's not all! What are these dark forms?!  
  
**Shadows：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Are these... Shadows?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
This many of them?!  
They seem to be appearing in time with the song!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
Shadows...?  
That's not right. These are errors of this world...  
Beings that shouldn't even exist...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Errors of... the world...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Isn't that like... what Her Majesty used to say?  
Problem is, I don't know what any of it actually means...  
That pisses me off...!  
  
**Shadow 1：**  
\"What shall I make for today's dinner...?\"  
  
**Shadow 2：**  
\"Yeah, yeah. Take 'em out!\"  
  
**Shadow 3：**  
\"Make sure you put the trash where it belongs.\"  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Wahh?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Karyl! Be careful!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Aaghhh!  
I don't need any dumb Shadows hanging around me!  
  
**Shadows：**  
\"...!\"  
  

---  
  
**Hiyori：**  
W-w-wahhh!  
They just keep coming!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
Do you... understand now...?  
I can always hear their voices...  
Words with no meaning... Just going on and on... like empty ghosts...  
  
**Yui：**  
W-well, I guess...  
If I could hear Shadows' voices all the time,  
it might drive me pretty crazy...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Even so... We can hardly allow you to destroy this city!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...I see...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
Even you... who look so sleepy...?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Nod.  
`Tag 2`  
**Ranpha：**  
Oh... I see...  
...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
Well, that's a shame...  
An awful, awful shame...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
Well then...  
...Goodbye...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Rei：**  
Ngh!  
The Shadows are one thing... but these skeletal Wyverns are strong!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
And they're super tough, too!  
When I punch them, it makes my hands hurt!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Normal magic can't get through, either...  
{player}!  
Power me up! Can you do that?!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Uh-huh!  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah...!  
His Princess Knight energy is flowing through Miss Karyl!  
Just like before!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Great!  
Now I might stand a better chance!  
Yahhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Nice going, Mr. Knight!  
Looks like you can use your power again!  
  
**Rei：**  
As much as I hate to trouble you,  
can you extend that power to us as well?!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  ...  
`Tag 4`  
**Yui：**  
H... huh...?  
Mr. Knight closed his eyes...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
M-my lord?  
Oh, how awful. If you fall asleep at this time,  
Miss Karyl's battle with the monsters will be...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahahah!  
Let's see how you like an extra-huge blast!  
...Huh?  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Look out, Karyl!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Peco!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh! ♪  
Looks like I rescued Karyl from certain doom! ☆  
How's that, Karyl? Did I make you swoon?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Dummy!  
Dumborine!  
Quit saying stupid stuff and just fight already!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Right! ☆ Leave it to me!  
I'll take care of anyone who tries to harm our city! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
These bony Wyvern things  
seem tougher than your average skeleton...  
Yui! Let's take them all down!  
  
**Yui：**  
Right!  
It'll make me hungry again...  
 but I guess we have to...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord!  
Though it pains me to disturb you when you lie at rest...  
Please lend Miss Pecorine and Miss Yui your power!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Okay...!  
`Tag 5`  
**Yui & Pecorine：**  
Change! Princess Form!  
  
**Yui & Pecorine：**  
Here we go!  
  
**Yui & Pecorine：**  
Yaaahhh!  
  

---  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Just three more to go!  
Let's keep this up and smash the whole pack!  
  
**Yui：**  
Yes!  
Divine—!  
  
  

---  
  
**Yui：**  
...H-huh?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Our Princess Forms disappeared?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord is still fully awake...  
But then, why...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
What's going on?!  
  
**Rei：**  
Does this new power  
have limitations that we're still not aware of?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hmmm...  
 Maybe, like, after you transform,  
you can't do it again for a few days...  
 or something?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
N-no way...!  
It's true that curry tastes better if you leave it for a while,  
but we need this power right now!  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...Ummm...  
  
**Ranpha：**  
...Well then... I suppose I'll strike back...  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!
