# Chapter 10 Episode 1
Kokkoro and Akira walk through the strange world of Tsubakigaoka. Akira explains that everything Kokkoro has experienced in Landosol took place within a game called Legend of Astrum, and the world they are in now is the true reality.
  
## Subtitle: A Dream Named Astrum
  
**Narration：**  
Having somehow wandered into a strange new world,  
Kokkoro walks alongside the mysterious individual  
who calls herself Akira Mosakuji.

**Akira：**  
Uhhh, what's the best way to explain it? Right now, your mind's  
been removed from its body and placed inside something else.  
Your original body is lying in a hospital bed.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. \"Something else\" meaning what, exactly?  
This body looks no different from the one I am used to...  
Though now that I look closely, some moles and blemishes may differ.  
  
**Akira：**  
Ahhh... It's basically an organic robot... but that's not gonna help.  
Think of it like a very well-made doll.  
That's what you're in right now.  
  
**Akira：**  
An awful lot of data went into it,  
so it should be very close to your real body...  
  
**Akira：**  
But some of the details that don't really matter,  
like moles, might've been filled in at random!

**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm.  
So this body is just a doll...  
 A difficult notion to accept.  
It possesses human warmth, and I feel pain when I pinch it.  
  
**Akira：**  
Well, it is a complete recreation down to the nerves and blood vessels.  
The same idea as a prosthetic limb or an artificial eye,  
but taken to almost sci-fi-level extremes!  
  
**Akira：**  
That one model cost more than a big corporation's yearly budget,  
so, uh, try not to break it!  
Though it's not like I footed the bill, so I don't mind that much!

**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm.  
Well, let us set aside the issue of my body for a moment.  
I fear it will be too difficult for me to truly grasp the details.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
More pressingly, I must ask you.  
How is it that I came to be in such a state?  
  
**Akira：**  
Hmm... I'm really not that good at explaining stuff.  
Us geniuses never are, you know.  
  
**Akira：**  
I'm pretty sure I've caused {player}  
no end of frustration for the same reason.  
  
**Akira：**  
Besides, I'm just a sort of... guide? You know, just here to pick you up.  
For the details, you can ask your father, who you should be seeing soon.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ask my... father?  
Then the Elder is also, ah...  
visiting this reality in the same way that I am?  
  
**Akira：**  
Ahahah.  
That's right, the Elder.  
  
**Akira：**  
He's the oldest of the Seven Crowns, so people actually  
call him that here, too. When I heard it was his title over there,  
you should've seen me laugh!  
  
**Akira：**  
Anyway, to be more accurate,  
your father was never in \"that\" world to begin with.  
He's not young anymore, and he's never really been the gaming type.  
  
**Akira：**  
The Elder over there is just a well-made NPC based on his personality.  
Another kind of doll, I suppose, with no real mind of its own.  
  
**Akira：**  
That's actually why you started playing Legend of Astrum—  
to fulfill his role in the Seven Crowns  
since he wasn't interested in doing so himself.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I'm one of the Seven Crowns...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ehm...  
I'm sorry. Some of the words you use seem quite unfamiliar.  
What is this \"Legend of Astrum\"?  
  
**Akira：**  
It's a game that was hugely popular over in this world.  
Do you have video games over there?  
Well, it's a form of entertainment. A way to pass the time.  
  
**Akira：**  
Actually, remind me, Kokkoro— how much do you know?  
About the truth of the world  
where you and young {player} are living, I mean.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well, ah...  
 Miss Novem did share  
her knowledge and suspicions about the world's secrets with us.  
That we are all living in something akin to a dream.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That our original world,  
the true reality where we were born, lies elsewhere...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yet all our knowledge of it remains forgotten,  
leaving us thinking that the dream is reality.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
\"That\" world is the dream, and \"this\" is reality.  
And for some strange reason, I suddenly find myself here...  
In the world that I originally called home.  
  
**Akira：**  
Ohhh, that's how she explained it to you?  
I never thought she'd be much for complex explanations,  
but it sounds like she chose her words carefully.  
  
**Akira：**  
No, maybe she's just smarter than I thought.  
It's a good way of putting it.  
  
**Akira：**  
Anyway, your understanding is about right.  
You've all been snatched from reality,  
forgotten all about it, and are trapped in a dream.  
  
**Akira：**  
That \"dream\" you're in is what's known in this world  
as the game called Legend of Astrum.  
  
**Akira：**  
To borrow little Muimi's metaphor,  
it's a game that creates dreams for its players.  
Wonderful, exciting, happy dreams to enjoy.  
  
**Akira：**  
That's the new form of entertainment that took this world by storm.  
  
**Akira：**  
Until half a year ago, when the incident known as  
\"Minerva's Enslavement\" changed everything.
