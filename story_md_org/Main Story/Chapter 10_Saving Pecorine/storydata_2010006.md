## Subtitle: Villain Coming Through
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank you for your patronage.  
Your change will be fifty rupies! ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please do come again in the future! ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. Working at a stall with my lord is actually rather fun.  
...But I wonder, just how long will this be continuing?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I confess I am beginning to tire of waiting.  
When I remember that Miss Pecorine is still suffering as we speak,  
it is difficult to contain my restlessness.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Mm, I totally get that, but hang in there.  
Rushing won't get us anywhere.  
Don't worry, the sign should be coming any moment now.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh! There!  
Look up there, you two! That's the sign!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh...? The sky seemed to flash with a strange colored light.  
Is somebody setting off fireworks to celebrate the festival?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm...  
But the sun is still shining,  
so I doubt fireworks would light up the sky so clearly.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Heheh.  
That's Novem unleashing her trademark weapon, the Spiresbane Blade!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I don't know how,  
but it seems like that sword can fire off some kind of energy.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah... That most enormous of weapons,  
quite unlike Miss Novem's own height.  
I have seen her wielding it once before, if I recall.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Does this mean she is doing battle somewhere in the city?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, no. It's just a signal for us.  
We wouldn't fight among all these people. It'd be a huge mess.  
Can't risk harming any of the innocent citizens or tourists.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I know they're calling Labyrinth a terrorist guild,  
but that doesn't mean  
 we want to slaughter people  
 like real villains!

**Kokkoro：**  
That figure causing chaos... It is Miss Novem, yes?  
She seems to be declaring herself a villain after all...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Um, yes... She does like calling herself that.  
I hear she used to be quite the little rogue!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But right now, she's just saying that for show.  
Do you remember how Nightmare's vice-captain, Octo,  
seemed to have his eye on her before?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
If she's causing chaos, Nightmare won't be able to ignore it.  
They'll all come running to get her.  
In other words, she's a decoy! She'll keep them busy while we strike.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Her job is to grab the attention of the patrolling Nightmare guards,  
and get them as far away from the palace as she can.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
While they're distracted, we'll sneak into the palace.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmmm.  
I see. A fairly straightforward plan.

**Kokkoro：**  
But then why are we so far from the palace?  
To reach it from here will take quite some time and effort.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Don't worry.  
Did you forget? We've got a handy ally for times like this.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
So sorry to keep you waiting.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wha—?!  
 Ahhh, you scared me.  
You always appear so suddenly, Mr. Rajraj.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
My apologies.  
I have indeed often been accused  
of having a very subtle presence.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
At any rate,  
 let us hurry.  
From this point, time is our enemy.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
We are outnumbered.  
And who can say how long Novem will be able  
to keep Nightmare occupied by herself?  
  
**Rajraj：**  
We should head to the palace at once.  
I will transport you there directly.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah... So we are to use your unique ability, Mr. Rajraj.  
I see now. Your ability to leap through space  
will be our route into the palace.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Yes. The palace is not without defenses,  
but during this festival, esteemed visitors are visiting,  
so our enemy cannot erect as many barriers and traps as usual.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
We will avoid leaping directly into the palace interior,  
but we can certainly reach the grounds nearby.  
I took the time to determine a safe route for us to use in advance.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
And I have already transported our other allies,  
including Mr. Masaki and Mr. Daigo. It is your turn next.  
Although I cannot transport too many people at once.

**Shizuru：**  
Oh—  
then you should take these two first!  
Their goal is to rescue their friend, Pecorine,  
so try to get them as close to the underground dungeons as you can!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh! We would certainly appreciate that.  
 But are you sure?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yep. Masaki and the others are there already,  
so our side should be OK for now.  
And I want to thank you for all your help!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Good luck out there, {player}!  
It'll take a strong man to save such a special girl!  
So go show everyone how cool you are!
