## Subtitle: A Bridge Between Worlds
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmmm...  
If nobody can return from that world—nobody can awaken—  
then how did we find ourselves here, Miss Akira?  
  
**Akira：**  
Oh, please drop the formalities! I can't stand them.  
Why don't you just call me \"Big Sis\" or something?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But you and I are most certainly not siblings...  
I'm sorry. Am I causing offence with my politeness?  
  
**Akira：**  
No, no! I know that's just who you are.  
I'm sure you don't remember,  
but I even changed your diapers once upon a time.  
  
**Akira：**  
As a student of your father's, I've known him since I was little.  
There was quite the fuss when you were born, little Kokoro Natsume!  
  
**Akira：**  
Your birth came so suddenly, you see.  
At first, everyone thought you were some robot he'd made,  
or a homunculus...  
 some kind of artificial human, you know!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Kokoro... Natsume.  
That is my name in this world, I gather?  
  
**Akira：**  
Yep. Bet it feels weird, doesn't it?  
The name \"Akira Mosakuji\" still feels weird to me, too.  
I went by \"Labyrista\" for so long over there, after all.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
By the way, why *did]] you call yourself Labyrista?  
  
**Akira：**  
Well, I'm something of a famous figure online.  
My real name would invite a bunch of attention,  
so I always use an alias when I play online games: \"Labyrista.\"  
  
**Akira：**  
What was the idea behind it, again...?  
Obviously it's based on the word \"labyrinth,\" but...  
Oh yeah, \"Crystal\"! It's short for Labyrinth Crystal.  
  
**Akira：**  
Well, not that the meaning really matters.  
  
**Akira：**  
Moving on.  
 Right now, we're the only ones  
who've been able to return to this world.  
That makes us candidates to fulfill a certain important role.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm.  
And what role is that?  
  
**Akira：**  
In essence, messengers between \"here\" and \"there.\"  
  
**Akira：**  
Everyone on the other side has been robbed of their memories  
and forgotten about this world.  
So our first goal is to recover those sealed memories.  
  
**Akira：**  
Meanwhile, we should tell them the truth,  
so that they can help us in the effort to get them back here.  
  
**Akira：**  
To do that, we'll need someone with established trust and authority  
to spread the word.  
 Otherwise, nobody will believe a word of it.  
  
**Akira：**  
I mean, it's a pretty wild and outrageous story to buy, right?  
  
**Akira：**  
But over there, I'm branded as a terrorist.  
And after expending too much magic,  
I'm barely hanging on to my own life right now.  
  
**Akira：**  
So... I'd like you to take up this role.  
  
**Akira：**  
That's why I used all the funds and resources at my disposal  
to temporarily bring you back to this world.  
Extracting your soul from its body and inserting it into that \"doll.\"  
  
**Akira：**  
There was, uh, a teensy mishap with the specific location...  
The original idea was that you'd wake up in a safe,  
isolated laboratory.  
  
**Akira：**  
But oh well. I need you to learn as much as you can,  
take that information back with you,  
and find a way to make it public.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ohhh...? How would I do that?  
Over there, I am no more than an ordinary citizen at best,  
and now that we oppose the palace, I may become a wanted criminal.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My position is hardly any better than your own.  
  
**Akira：**  
Nuh-uh! There's one big difference between you and me.  
You've become friends with a princess.  
One of that nation's biggest bigshots.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A princess...  
  
![201000301.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/201000301.webp)  
**Akira：**  
Yep, I mean Pecorine.  
She's a precious friend of yours, so she'll believe what you say.  
Now, I know she's been forcibly removed from her position right now...  
  
**Akira：**  
But if she can just recover it, she'll be an honest-to-god princess.  
The perfect candidate for our needs.  
  
**Akira：**  
Return her to her throne, and she can share the truth with the world.  
Of course, given the situation,  
recovering her throne won't be an easy task.  
  
`image display end`  
**Akira：**  
And it's not as though revealing the truth  
will magically solve everything, either.  
  
**Akira：**  
It could even cause a panic,  
or be scorned as fake news and make the princess a laughingstock.  
  
**Akira：**  
But it's an important first step.  
We just have to hope it's enough.  
'Cause they can't all keep dreaming forever.  
  
**Akira：**  
Bringing everyone from that world back to reality...  
That's our duty as the Seven Crowns who created Minerva  
and the world of Legend of Astrum.  
  
**Akira：**  
It's our responsibility, so I hate to burden you with it too...  
But you're the only one I can turn to.  
We've both returned here for the moment through a backdoor...  
  
**Akira：**  
But as one of the Crowns,  
I still need to stay and take care of things here.  
  
**Akira：**  
The situation over here is still dangerously volatile,  
and I'm in the best position to address it.  
  
**Akira：**  
So I need your help with this.  
In fact, you're the only one who *can]] help.  
  
**Akira：**  
Bringing a person back in this way  
requires constructing a convincing enough artificial body  
that the mind can't tell the difference.  
  
**Akira：**  
And right now, yours is the only one we've got.  
Even for your genius of a father, it took half a year to develop,  
and if it weren't his own daughter at stake, I doubt he could've done it.  
  
**Akira：**  
This body I'm using is artificial too, but it's a flimsy prototype.  
I was lucky enough to transfer into it this time,  
but there's no guarantee it'll work again.  
  
**Akira：**  
I can't just jump back and forth.  
The only one capable of that right now is you.  
  
**Akira：**  
So... please, do this for me.  
Help everyone wake up...  
No, rescue them from the dream, little Kokkoro.
