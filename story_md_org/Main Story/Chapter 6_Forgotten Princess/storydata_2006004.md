**Pecorine：**  
Hmm, I suppose you're right...  
I've avoided revealing too much about myself so far,  
because I didn't want to mix you up in my problems.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But I guess you're involved at this point, either way.  
So it would be a bit inconsiderate of me  
to go on keeping secrets.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Very well, then!  
I'll do my best to explain as much as I can.  
Please feel free to keep eating while you listen!

**Pecorine：**  
Let's start with my real name.  
I was born Eustiana von Astraea.  
The eldest daughter of the royal family that rules Landosol.

**Choice: (1)**  That's a beautiful name.

`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh! Thank you very much!  
You sure do like to compliment me, don't you, {player}?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's nice of you, but when you do it so suddenly,  
my heart skips a beat! How crazy is that?!

**Pecorine：**  
Oh, I'm sorry, did you not catch it the first time?  
It's Eustiana von Astraea.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I know, it really is a bit of a mouthful, isn't it?  
When I was a little girl, it took me way too long  
to learn my own full name!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If you can't remember it, that's fine.  
You can just keep calling me Pecorine, same as always!

**Suzume：**  
Wait... what?  
But if you're the daughter of...  
wouldn't that make you the princess?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Aaaaahhhhh!  
That's, um, very... I mean... Ahhh...!  
  
**Suzume：**  
M-my utmost apologies for my insolent attitude!  
I beg your forgiveness!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ahahah!  
What are you panicking for, Suzume?  
You're so funny!  
  
**Suzume：**  
No no no...  
This is no laughing matter!  
  
**Suzume：**  
In this land, the princess serves as head of the monarchy...  
Which would mean we're talking to  
the most important person in the entire country!  
  
**Suzume：**  
A-and I just made her  
wake up early to cook us breakfast...?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha!  
Really, you don't need to be all formal.  
I'm just a normal girl like anyone else, really.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It'd make me happiest  
if you could keep on thinking of me as plain old Pecorine!  
  
`image display end`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm?  
But, Miss Pecorine... ...Yes, that name seems best.  
It would feel strange to refer to you any other way.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Anyway, one small question.  
Why would such an esteemed individual be travelling alone?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Um, actually... Since milady used to work at the palace,  
I've had the opportunity to look through  
the Registry of Nobles before.  
  
**Suzume：**  
So if you're a princess,  
I should have recognized you much sooner.  
  
**Suzume：**  
The official Registry  
lists everyone who has a noble title, including royals,  
complete with photographs and details of their background...  
  
**Suzume：**  
And yet,  
somehow I don't remember seeing you on it.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Umm...  
Could it be you're using some kind of magic  
to change your face?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I've heard about advanced spells that can do that!  
They're mostly used for very particular cases  
where a person of interest needs to be carefully protected...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No no, this is my real face right here!  
It's not easy to explain,  
but there are some tricky circumstances at play.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hmm? Wait a minute...  
My family are nobles, so I know some stuff about the royal family,  
but aren't they supposed to be beastfolk?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Our country oppresses beastfolk, but we're ruled by them too...  
That's what my mom and dad were saying,  
and I remember thinking it was weird.  
  
**Ayane：**  
'Cause like, doesn't that mean  
they're discriminating against themselves?  
Why would anyone do that? It makes no sense!  
  
**Ayane：**  
For some reason Mom and Dad  
didn't seem to think it was strange at all, though...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Exactly.  
For some reason, nobody in this country  
seems to notice that things aren't quite right.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I think there must be some kind of magical spell  
preventing anyone from thinking too hard about it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let me get straight to the point.  
The princess currently ruling over this country  
isn't royalty at all. She's an impostor.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
An impostor who stole my name,  
my position,  
my entire life from me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
She stole... your life?  
I cannot imagine  
how such a feat would be achieved...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, ah...  
Not that I wish to cast doubt  
on the honesty of your words...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No, no.  
It's only natural that you would wonder that.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Even I myself  
don't really understand how it happened.  
One day, things had just suddenly changed somehow.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
In accordance with our royal traditions,  
I was out travelling the land on a training journey.  
It's a ceremony we have to fulfill before inheriting the crown.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But then...  
when I finished my journey and returned home,  
nobody at the palace remembered who I was.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Not my father and mother...  
Not the retainers and attendants I had known my whole life...  
None of them seemed to recognize me at all.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And there, in my old home,  
was somebody else calling herself Eustiana  
and living the life of a princess.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Hang on... \"Eustiana\"?

`Tag 5`  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm?  
That's right, {player}.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The white-furred fox beastwoman who tried to kill us  
with that spell of mass destruction...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
She's the impostor princess  
who stole my life from me.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
She's taken over my place in the palace,  
made herself princess,  
and is ruling over this country as she pleases.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I don't know who she is,  
or what she plans to do with that power.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Actually, {player},  
you had some sort of conversation with her, right?  
It would be great if you could tell me about it later.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I get the feeling  
both of us might have to face her someday  
as our ultimate nemesis.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Anyway...  
To be honest,  
I thought it was some kind of prank at first.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Or that maybe  
I hadn't done well enough on my training journey,  
so they were trying to tell me I wasn't ready for the throne.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But, no.  
It's all too strange.  
None of this makes any sense...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
As time went by,  
I even started to wonder if I was the one who'd gone crazy.  
I thought I might be losing my mind!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But Eustiana is my name, not hers.  
My father and mother chose it for me,  
in loving reference to a goddess from another land.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I can remember my father telling me all about it,  
gently stroking my head all the while.  
And my mother's smile as she sat beside him...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yet somehow...  
All of that...  
has been taken from me.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
My mother and father...  
And everyone else...  
They've forgotten all about me...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
In fact, they even called me the impostor..  
Sent the palace guards after me...  
Put a bounty on my head...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It was hard to accept.  
I wanted it to be a lie,  
or a joke, or even a nightmare.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I told myself it was a mistake,  
and even tried to explain the truth to a few people.  
But nobody believed a word I said.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
As I evaded capture,  
all I could think to do was continue the training journey  
that my parents had sent me on while they still knew me.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Then I headed back to Landosol,  
hoping things would somehow be different this time.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And it was on my way there  
that I first ran into {player} and Kokkoro.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
They made me so happy.  
Happier than I'd ever been.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Just talking and smiling,  
sharing a meal with friends...  
I hadn't done that in so long.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But now...  
It's time I stopped running from the truth.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That Eustiana impostor  
has proven she's not above taking my life.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Having the real princess running around  
must make her feel less stable in her position.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And that's why...  
I have to say goodbye to this happy life,  
before I put all of you in danger.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The days I spent with you guys  
were wonderful and precious to me, but that's exactly why...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The thought that  
she might come and steal all of you from me too  
is more than I can bear.
