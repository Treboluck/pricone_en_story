### Place: Esterella Road
  
**Narration：**  
After discussing various matters over breakfast,  
{player} and the others have decided to take action.  
  
**Narration：**  
First, they need to find Saren, who left the Orphanage in search  
of {player}, and let her know that he's safe.  
  
**Narration：**  
She was headed in the direction of Elizabeth Park,  
so {player} and co. set out for the mountains.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aaaand we're here! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm? This is a little odd.  
I'm pretty sure this is where everyone from Elizabeth Park  
was supposed to have set up camp after they evacuated...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But looking around,  
I can't see anyone here.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmmm...  
That is quite perplexing.  
I can see the remains of a campfire and the like.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Have they abandoned this site already, then?  
One can only assume they did not simply vanish into thin air.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, this is a pickle...  
I'm guessing it's a side-effect of that battalion-class spell,  
but the flow of magical energy in this whole area is messed up.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's stopping us from using communication magic,  
so I'm not sure how we're going to get in touch with them.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I fear we may have become too reliant on magic  
in our everyday lives.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A disturbance of this scale in the natural flow of magic  
is entirely unheard-of.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Alas, I could not predict this turn of events.  
Whatever shall we do?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The messenger crows I often use  
also rely on the target's magical signature to locate them.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
With the flow of magical energy disrupted,  
they will have no hope of locating an unfamiliar recipient,  
so that option is similarly impractical.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, if communications were working normally,  
we could have just gotten in touch with this Saren person  
that way, instead of coming out here in person.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This was the only way  
for us to let her know that we're safe...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But it looks like we've gone and missed her.  
What perfectly awkward timing.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Really, what *are* we going to do?  
We need some kind of clue as to which way they went...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Then it would be easy enough to follow after them,  
and we'd meet up eventually.  
I don't suppose they left a note lying around?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Let us search the area for clues.  
Failing that, we can always proceed up the mountain,  
under the assumption that they returned to the farm.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Though if it transpires that they went to the city instead,  
that would prove quite the wasted effort.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I guess we could always split up and check both places,  
but I'd rather not do that right now if we can help it...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We've only just survived an attempt on our lives,  
so it would be safer to stick together.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Agreed.  
My lord, I would ask you  
to stay close to me for the time being.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In your hour of need, I was not by your side...  
And that failure still troubles me greatly.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
From now on,  
I will protect you no matter what happens.  
Never again will I leave you alone.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh!  
You're so cute,  
latching on to {player} so tightly!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
When you hug him like that,  
you really do look like brother and sister!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Though if you want to keep him away from danger,  
it might actually be better if we did split up.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm the one who that impostor Eustiana  
is trying to kill, after all.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Are you sure?  
That seems less than certain.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
From my lord's description of their encounter,  
this \"impostor,\" as I suppose we should refer to her...  
This woman seemed to have an interest in my lord personally.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Though I cannot fathom her reasons,  
she is an individual with the power to level mountains.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
To oppose her,  
we will surely need to work together.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I would be most grateful for your assistance,  
Miss Pecorine.  
Let us stand united against the forces of evil.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Though, logic aside,  
I am hurt that you would suggest we leave you.  
Are we not companions, members of the same guild?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, Kokkoro...!  
Thank you! That makes me super happy!  
Good girl, good girl~!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I-is all this patting of my head entirely necessary...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheh!  
Actually, just before she unleashed that crazy spell,  
I think that imposter did say I wasn't her main target.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So I guess just assuming  
\"we'll be fine if we stay away from Pecorine\"  
would be a bad plan anyway.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We're all in this together now!  
And with our powers combined, we'll find a way out of it!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed.  
It would appear my lord agrees with you also.His face is simply brimming with determination.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, my lord...  
How rugged and majestic you look...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Thanks, Kokkoro.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm just trying not to look too scared...  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Haha... No need for thanks, my lord.  
I merely expressed my true and honest opinion.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well, yes, that is to be expected.  
Very little time has passed since you were almost killed.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In fact, if you felt no fear in these circumstances,  
that would be quite concerning.  
It reassures me to know that you are still only human.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
You know, Kokkoro,  
you're awfully good at reading {player}'s emotions.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's probably because of the memory loss,  
but his face always looks kind of blank and mellow to me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hee hee...  
In the village where I grew up,  
looking after animals was one of my responsibilities.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So I developed a talent  
for understanding the needs and emotions  
of even the least communicative of beasts.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha!  
I think she might be calling you a beast,  
{player}!  
 ...Hmm?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Guaaaaaahhh!  
I can't believe I overslept! I'm shamed for life!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
This has gotta be  
because I stayed up so late last night...  
Guys, where did you go?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Urghh...  
I've committed a violation  
of my own Hero's Code...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Showing up late to the scene of the action...  
I'm a failure as a hero!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But this won't happen again!  
I swear that by tomorrow,  
I'll be twice the hero I am today!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm?  
Who could that little girl be?  
Do you think she's lost?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am afraid I cannot say.  
But travelers are not a common sight in these parts,  
and since we have no other leads...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Perhaps it would be wise  
to ask her a few questions.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hello there?  
Excuse me, young miss.  
Might we trouble you for a moment?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Whaaa?!  
Wh-who're you?  
You look like a suspicious bunch!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, that's not very friendly...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Um...  
We were hoping to find the members of Elizabeth Park  
camping somewhere around here.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I don't suppose you have any idea  
where they might have gone, do you?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Oh, if it's those Elizabeth Park guys you're looking for,  
they got the go-ahead that things looked safe,  
so they headed back to the farm to start work on repairs.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah...  
So it is as we surmised.  
They really did return to the farm already.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
You got it!  
They were all packing up their tents last night,  
so they must've started moving not long after.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I guess by now,  
they'll have made it to the farm for sure.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Elizabeth Park itself was a ways from the middle of the blast,  
so it wasn't as badly damaged as it could've been.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Of course, there was also that monster attack before,  
so it was still in pretty bad condition.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But if they put up some temporary lodgings for now,  
they oughtta be fine still living there.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Last I heard, they were saying  
they'd try and clean up as much as they could before the day's out.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
They're tough cookies, those farmgirls!  
Gotta say I was impressed!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Anyway, I heard a bunch of other guilds  
are heading to the farm too,  
to help out with the rebuilding.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
To be totally honest,  
I was supposed to head over there with them...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But I messed up and now I'm running late...  
Urgh... Waking up early is hard!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahahah!  
You shouldn't look so down.  
The sun only shines on those who smile!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Anyway, thank you for all that information!  
You've been a big help!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
No problem! Hero's Code, Rule the First!  
Kindness is its own reward!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I don't need a reason to help people out!  
One good deed every day, that's my motto!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wow... I've never met such a good little girl before!  
What a sweetheart!  
Can I pat you on the head?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Whaaa—?!  
Hands off the head! The head's off-limits!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The girl is right, Miss Pecorine.  
This head-patting is a bad habit of yours.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Still, you seem very well-informed, young miss...  
I assumed you were just a local youth passing through,  
but perhaps I was wrong?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Oh! I forgot to introduce myself!  
Hero's Code, Rule the Third!  
A hero announces their name with pride and gusto!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
How did I manage to forget such a basic thing?  
I really am in a funk today!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Sorry, guys! It's a bit late for it,  
but lemme show you a real hero's entrance!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ta-daaaaa! ☆  
Behold the fearless superhero of the forest,  
Tora Tiger!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...'s biggest fan and future hero-in-training!  
My name's Matsuri!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
As an apprentice knight of the Nightmare guild,  
I do battle by the light of day and the stars of night  
to defend the weak and crush evil!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Friends of justice, it's a pleasure to meetcha! ☆
