# Chapter 6 Episode 9
Saren and Mifuyu are arguing over how to go about rebuilding the farm. Though their ideas and methodologies differ, they share a common desire to help. Tamaki suggests that Elizabeth Park, where humans and beastfolk live together in harmony, is a kind of paradise.

**Mahiru：**  
Oh, howdy, {player}!  
So you made it outta there!  
Well, ain't that some good news!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You seem to be doing well yourself!  
`Tag 1`  
**Mahiru：**  
Eheheh...  
We were real lucky the place wasn't more beat-up all over.  
It was basically just the buildings that needed fixin'.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
The biggest hurdle was gettin' the barn standing again,  
so I reckon we'll be back in business before the day's out.  
Well, we've still got our fair share of injuries...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But none of that's too serious.  
An' a real fine mender-upper came to help,  
so things're going smoothly there too!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A \"mender-upper\"?  
Oh, you mean a medical magic specialist,  
what's known as a "healer," right?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Is that what they call 'em in the city?  
This one was from the Mercurius Foundation. Name of Yukari.  
And lemme tell you, this lady coulda put ten doctors outta business!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Oh, I know her.  
`Tag 2`  
**Mahiru：**  
Hmm?  
She a pal of yours, {player}?  
You should go say hi later, then!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Right now's probably not the time...  
She's still pretty busy tending to all the patients.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha!  
It always amazes me  
how many people you know, {player}!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
At any rate, it's good to hear that everyone's doing OK!  
I'm glad my efforts here didn't go to waste!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Yup! Everyone's alive, and that's what counts.  
Lives before profits, right?  
Long as you're alive, you can always get back on your feet!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
This farm'll be full of beaming smiles again soon enough!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, heck.  
I've still got a whole buncha stuff to see to,  
bein' in charge of this farm and all...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
So it's time I got back to work!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Right, you do what you need to do!  
...Now then.  
This Saren person should be somewhere around here...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But which one could she be?  
I've never met her, so I don't know what she looks like.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  She's an elegant beauty.  
**Choice: (4)**  She's got... long hair.  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Wow, talk about piling on the compliments!  
Could it be you've got a little crush on her?  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmmm...  
I might need a bit more info than that.  
I mean, that description covers a lot of people. Even me!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed. Still, it is not an incorrect assessment.  
Miss Saren does have quite beautiful long and flowing locks.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ehmmm...  
Oh! I believe I see her now.  
Hello there! Miss Saren?  
  
![200600901.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/200600901.webp)  
**Saren：**  
What's the meaning of this?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
No need to get so heated.  
This is only a proposition on my part.  
The final decision will fall to the proprietor, Miss Mahiru.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Is it really your place to be voicing complaints?  
  
**Saren：**  
Well, I suppose not, but it's the principle of the thing!  
We're all just volunteers helping out,  
so let's not overstep the mark!  
  
**Saren：**  
Cutting down the trees  
and building a magic-conducting pylon?  
Do you want to completely spoil the rural scenery?  
  
**Saren：**  
Are you sure you're not just trying to create a market  
for your own high-priced magical wares?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I've said this enough times, and it's all there in the report.  
The flow of magical energy here is disrupted,  
and this is the only way to restore it to normal.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
The alternative is far more costly.  
Do you expect these people to struggle along  
with inefficient magic forever?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Besides, natural scenery is all very well,  
but this area has already been damaged all over  
by that unfortunate monster rampage.  
  
**Saren：**  
That's why I'm saying  
we shouldn't add insult to injury  
by causing even more damage!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Think about the future, not the past.  
Even the scenery won't recover  
without the magical currents back in working condition.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
If you leave this disturbance unattended,  
it'll wreak havoc with the whole ecosystem.  
The situation will only get worse if we don't intervene.  
  
`image display end`  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyow, nyow...  
Fighting isn't going to solve anything.  
Why don't you both cool your heads off a little?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Whose side do you think you're on, Tamaki?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Seriously, though.  
The people here are stressed out  
after the nightmare they've just been through.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It's only going to stress them out even more  
if they see you shouting at each other all day.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
...Perhaps you have a point.  
I'm sorry. I do seem to get a bit carried away  
when I get into a proper debate with Saren.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Despite their similar upbringings,  
she couldn't be more different from Akino!  
  
**Saren：**  
That girl's in a category of her own...  
But I agree, talking to you is always so educational!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Well, I appreciate the compliment.  
I must say I find our discussions  
rather stimulating myself.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
There aren't many people at my guild  
who are willing to discuss these sorts of difficult topics.  
  
**Saren：**  
But being difficult is what makes them fun! Right?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Right!  
...I mean, maybe I shouldn't be enjoying myself  
when people have been put in actual danger...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
But if having these tricky little debates  
can help us reach the best solution for everyone, it's a win-win!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
And with so many people showing up to help,  
the repairs are progressing much more quickly than I expected.  
At this rate, there might not be much left for us to do!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Well, we're outsiders here,  
so we shouldn't poke our nyoses in too hard.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
A vigilante may steal from the rich to give to the poor,  
but he shouldn't go telling the poor how to spend the spoils!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I'm not sure I'm quite ready to understand  
your unique view of morality, Tamaki...  
...Oh, what's this?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
{player}!  
Thank goodness.  
I was worried when I heard you'd gone missing.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
{player}! Myahahah...  
I see you're surrounded by girls as usual!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Sorry for making everyone worry.  
`Tag 6`  
**Kokkoro：**  
And these people are... who, exactly?  
Yet more friends of yours, my lord?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh, I guess I haven't met you girls before!  
I'm Tamaki, from the Meow-curius Foundation!  
Pleasure to meetcha!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
As a token of my friendship,  
have a steaming hot taiyaki each!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Where did you even pull those out from, Tamaki?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh, yes please!  
...Actually, I think I recognize this flavor?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh? You know my wares?  
Come to think of it,  
haven't I seen you at my stall about a hundred times?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Thanks for all your patronage!  
I love a regular customer!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A taiyaki stall...?  
If I might ask, just what kind of guild is this Mercurius Foundation?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Uhhh... We do all sorts of things. Financial stuff mostly.  
Really, we just go where the money is!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Today we got a request from Caon,  
so we're here to help out our fellow beastfolk!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Like most beastfolk, I'm registered with the Menyagerie,  
so I've got a duty to do my part!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
You know us beastfolk,  
we're all about that community spirit!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
There's a few Caon members  
who are working at Elizabeth Park right nyow...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
So they used their connections  
to bring in beastfolk from all over to pitch in.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
This farm is home to all sorts of people,  
human and beastfolk alike, living together in harmony...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
You could call it a sort of paradise.  
So we can't let one little disaster spoil such a precious place!
