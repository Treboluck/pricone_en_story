{player} and co. decide to visit the nearby elf village. Meanwhile, hearing that monsters have appeared in the vicinity, the Mercurius Foundation members move to protect the farm.
  
## Subtitle: Working Together
  
**Saren：**  
I completely agree, Tamaki.  
Though the rifts between races have been widening lately,  
we really should do our best to all work together.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyow I think about it, you're an elf, right?  
With the pointy ears and everything.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
'Cause I heard there's an elf village near here,  
and the big explosion caused them a bit of trouble, too.  
Maybe you should go check in on them?  
  
**Saren：**  
Hmmm...  
I really don't have that much of a connection  
with the forest elves around here.  
  
**Saren：**  
They're a separate tribe, you know.  
I think the same goes for you, right, Kokkoro?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed.  
Though we share a common race,  
elves are not united in a single community.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Still, I do feel some kinship with my fellow elves,  
so it concerns me to hear that they may be in trouble.  
  
**Saren：**  
Well then, let's go pay them a visit later.  
In an emergency like this, we all need to help each other.  
  
**Saren：**  
What's that?  
You want to come too, {player}?  
  
**Saren：**  
Honestly, I swear...  
When it comes to helping people,  
you never hesitate for a second, do you?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm just worried about some people I know.  
`Tag 1`  
**Saren：**  
Oh...?  
You even have friends in this village of elves?  
How *do* you manage it? Elves are usually pretty insular...  
  
**Saren：**  
Actually, hang on a moment.  
You just kind of slipped into the conversation, so I forgot to ask,  
but where the heck have you two been this whole time, anyway?!  
  
**Saren：**  
What kind of emotional reunion do you call this?  
Shouldn't we be, I don't know, crying or hugging or something?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Hug Saren.  
**Choice: (3)**  Apologize for making her worry.  
`Tag 2`  
**Saren：**  
Ahhh! I was only kidding...!  
As long as you're safe, it's all good, really...  
Just remember, people do worry about you.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Saren：**  
You're right, I *was* worried!  
But you don't have to look quite that forlorn about it...  
Just fill me on what happened later, okay?  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Haha...  
Somehow when you're talking to {player},  
you seem much more easily flustered, Saren.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
And all this after you were worried sick about him.  
That's why you were taking out your frustration on me, right?  
  
**Saren：**  
Huh? You think?  
H-he's living with us, so he's family...  
Worrying about family is normal, right?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Haha...  
Anyway, perhaps it's time  
I introduced myself properly to the new faces, too.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I'm Mifuyu, from the Mercurius Foundation.  
What would my job title be, I wonder? Sales? Admin?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Honestly, you're basically like our CEO...  
The rest of us are so easygoing,  
we don't have much of a work ethic!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Our guild would fall apart  
without you to take charge of stuff!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
So, thanks a bunch!  
We're always counting on ya!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
If you're aware you barely have a work ethic,  
you could try to do something about it...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Heheh.  
We've actually got a fair nyumber of guild members,  
but most of 'em are back in the city doing regular work.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It's just a handful of us that came to help at the farm.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I know Yukari is busy attending to the injured right now...  
But does anyone know where Akino is?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
She gets up to the craziest things when you let her  
out of your sight, so I'm a little worried...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myahahah!  
Last thing I heard, she'd flown off to visit  
some of the other farms nearby.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
You know,  
remember that brother and sister we met  
when we saved their farm from corrupt business practices?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Well, they and some other nearby farms  
are going to be taking care  
of Elizabeth Park's animals for a little while.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It'll be a while before all the fences and stuff here are fixed,  
so someone nyeeds to keep an eye on the animals till then.  
That's what Akino's sorting out for us.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I see...  
Well, if she's doing legitimate work,  
I suppose I can't complain.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Akino can be a surprisingly convincing negotiator.  
I'm sure she'll be able to handle it.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Yup, she does have a way of winning people over!  
Nyatural charisma, I guess you'd call it?  
It's like she was born to be a bigshot!  
  
**Saren：**  
Yes, she's always been that way...  
I really don't know how she manages it!  
  
**Saren：**  
She just does whatever she pleases,  
yet things seem to go her way,  
and people wind up thanking her in the end.  
  
**Saren：**  
Meanwhile her friends  
struggle just to keep up with her antics!  
  
**Saren：**  
But I'm relieved to see  
she seems to be getting along well  
with all of you at the Foundation.  
  
**Saren：**  
Accommodating other people isn't her forte,  
so she can be pretty polarizing in the wrong crowd.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Getting along, huh? She's brought me no end of trouble...  
Though I guess for all our arguments,  
we've managed to make things work as fellow guildmates.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hey guys, sorry! Can I get a bit of help over here?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Whoopsie! We got carried away with the chitchat.  
Something up, Yukari?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Yes...  
Some monsters have wandered close to the farm,  
and it's gotten everyone nervous.  
  
**Yukari：**  
They haven't done any actual harm just yet,  
but so soon after the incident,  
people are on edge, you know?  
  
**Yukari：**  
To be safe,  
we're gathering a group of fighters  
to drive them out of the area.  
  
**Yukari：**  
The only thing is,  
everyone's exhausted from a hard day's work,  
so we're short on fighters.  
  
**Yukari：**  
I'd handle it myself,  
but you know I'm more of a healer than a fighter.  
  
**Yukari：**  
So I was hoping for some help  
from someone with more combat skills, like Mifuyu.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ahhh... Mifuyu's overseeing the whole rebuilding effort,  
so she can't just abandon her post.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Tell you what, I'll help you out!  
Where's the nyasties that need beating up?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Right over this way.  
And let's hurry!  
  
**Yukari：**  
The girls from Elizabeth Park are holding off the monsters for now...  
But most of them barely slept last night,  
so I'm worried how they'll hold up.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Wait a second!  
I'll come too.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Eliminating monsters is one thing I'm good at.  
...Saren, can you handle things here for me?  
  
**Saren：**  
All right, no problem.  
To be honest, I'd like to help with the monsters too...  
  
**Saren：**  
But with all these different guilds doing their own thing,  
things could get chaotic quickly.  
  
**Saren：**  
Someone needs to take charge  
and make sure everyone stays on the same page.  
  
**Saren：**  
And, well, smoothing things over is a specialty of mine!  
So I guess I'll be most useful here!
