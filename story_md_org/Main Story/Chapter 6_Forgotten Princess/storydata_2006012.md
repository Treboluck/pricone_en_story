**Christina：**  
Hmph.  
I don't like any of this, not one bit.  
  
**Christina：**  
After being struck by a destructive spell of that caliber,  
I should probably be grateful that my story did not end there...  
  
**Christina：**  
But is life in a dingy cell really a better outcome?  
At this rate, the tedium will kill me instead.  
  
**Christina：**  
Still, I wonder...  
Why *was* it that I survived the blast?  
  
**Christina：**  
Her Majesty had every intention of taking my life.  
Escaping from that attack should have been  
absolutely impossible through any normal means.  
  
**Christina：**  
\"Absolutely\" impossible...  
Hmph. I suppose even for Her Majesty,  
no victory can be truly \"absolute.\"  
  
**Christina：**  
How very tedious.  
Is it true, then, that in this world,  
absolutes simply do not exist at all?

**Christina：**  
If my memories do not deceive me...  
The spell Her Majesty used was a battalion-class attack,  
boasting incredible thermal energy.  
  
**Christina：**  
Even for me,  
those temperatures should have spelled instant annihilation.  
  
**Christina：**  
But there were a few other people there  
who seemed to be quite out of the ordinary...  
  
**Christina：**  
I can only assume they devised some method  
to prevent the attack from finding its mark.

**Christina：**  
That red-haired woman in particular...  
There was something about her.  
Something that intrigues me greatly.  
  
**Christina：**  
And I think I saw the redhead  
receive some kind of item from that little Novem brat.  
  
**Christina：**  
It looked like a brooch in the shape of a crown...  
What was that thing, exactly?  
  
**Christina：**  
I seem to recall Octo  
showing off a very similar item at one point.  
  
**Christina：**  
And wasn't he trying to track down  
some kind of stolen item?  
So that incident was connected to this situation as well...

**Christina：**  
Tch. How irritating.  
If I'd known that brooch was so important,  
I'd have taken it for myself.  
  
**Christina：**  
Not that I suppose  
I could have predicted any of this at the time.  
  
**Christina：**  
For all his failings, Octo is certainly a genius  
with unique skills of his own.  
  
**Christina：**  
Is that brooch an invention of his?  
Or a treasure that he used his connections to acquire?  
  
**Christina：**  
Once I get out of this cell,  
I'll have to see if I can pry the truth out of him.  
  
**Christina：**  
Though he might not be so keen on cooperating  
after I used him for my own purposes.  
  
**Christina：**  
At any rate.  
That redheaded vixen, brooch in hand,  
did *something* in the instant before the blast descended.  
  
**Christina：**  
It looked as though she reached out to touch  
that dark-skinned \"Rajraj\" fellow.  
  
![200601204.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/200601204.webp)  
**Christina：**  
In that instant, the world twisted out of shape.  
I could feel it in my bones—an indescribable sensation.  
  
**Christina：**  
It seemed as though we were enveloped in light  
and connected to some far-off location.  
  
**Christina：**  
And then, I heard a pair of voices.  
One of them identical to that of Rajraj,  
the other a wizened old man...  
  
**Christina：**  
Who could that possibly have been?  
Don't tell me it was some sort of god?  
  
**Christina：**  
Strangely, it sounded somehow nostalgic...  
But I can't make sense of it. It was like I was in a dream.

**Christina：**  
Next thing I knew,  
I was in my chambers in the palace.  
Transported instantly through space.  
  
**Christina：**  
Could this be related  
to the \"warp gate\" magic Her Majesty keeps closely guarded?  
  
**Christina：**  
I don't know the logic behind what happened,  
nor why I found myself in my chambers specifically.  
And I have no idea where the others might have ended up.  
  

---  
  
**Christina：**  
My first instinct in that moment  
was to take revenge on Her Majesty.  
So without delay, I made my move on the throne room.  
  
**Christina：**  
Where naturally, I was confronted  
by the Nightmare knights tasked with guarding her.  
  
**Christina：**  
Thanks to our beloved Captain and her team of elites,  
I was overpowered, forced into submission...  
And so, here I am in this accursed cell.  
  
**Christina：**  
This is a secret dungeon within the palace,  
where dangerous enemies of the throne are imprisoned.  
  
**Christina：**  
It's equipped with a disgusting number of precautions  
against jailbreak, so escape is borderline impossible.  
  
**Christina：**  
Even my Absolute Offense can't break these bars.  
I suppose Her Majesty, being all too familiar with my abilities,  
must have prepared this cell specially.  
  
**Christina：**  
There's really nothing to be done.  
  
**Christina：**  
My last hope would be for a gallant rescuer to appear,  
but I haven't exactly made myself popular.  
I suppose this is the downside of villainy!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hah! Well, no matter.  
It's been quite the tiring day,  
so I suppose I'll get some rest.  
  
**Christina：**  
There are no absolutes in this world.  
I'm sure if I put my mind to it,  
I'll find a way out of this dungeon sooner or later.  
  
**Christina：**  
Your Majesty...  
  
**Christina：**  
Why... did you try to take my life?  
  
**Christina：**  
...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hey.  
  
**Christina：**  
Wha...?!  
You! Your name was... Novem, was it?  
How did you get in here?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hahah!  
It's not what you'd call fair play,  
but our Rajraj has an ability called \"Spatial Leap.\"  
  
**Muimi：**  
It transports him anywhere, and he can even take  
another person along for the ride.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Right now, though, he's almost exhausted his strength...  
So sending me here alone  
was about the most he could manage.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmmm...  
Perhaps this \"Spatial Leap\"  
is how we were able to escape Her Majesty's coup de grâce.  
  
**Christina：**  
Though I can't imagine Her Majesty  
would neglect to account for such a possibility...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Mmm... I dunno about the complicated stuff.  
But that redheaded lady... Labyrista, was it?  
She seemed to boost Rajraj's strength somehow.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Well, what matters is...  
It worked, and we came out on top!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Anyway!  
Thanks to one thing and another,  
I'm working together with Labyrinth right now.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Whaddaya say?  
Would you like to come with us too?  
  
**Christina：**  
Huh?  
I can't believe I'm asking this,  
but did you come here to recruit me?  
  
**Christina：**  
You worked a miracle  
and infiltrated this dingy excuse for a cell  
just to ask me to join your cause?  
  
**Christina：**  
I suppose I should compliment you on your good taste,  
choosing the great Christina as an ally.  
  
**Christina：**  
But it hardly seems wise.  
Though it's odd for me to point this out myself,  
I'm a wild hound who can't be tamed, you know?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Oh, I know.  
If it were up to me, I'd rather not ally myself  
with a dangerous woman like you...  
  
**Muimi：**  
But the thing is,  
I owe you quite a bit.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm? You said something similar  
the first time we met, as well...  
Have we encountered one another somewhere before?  
  
**Christina：**  
Frankly, I can't recall earning any goodwill  
from a pipsqueak like you.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah, I know—you've forgotten it all.  
The time we spent together at the Round Table...  
  
**Muimi：**  
It's probably no use telling you this now,  
but we were guildmates once.  
  
**Christina：**  
...?!
