### Place: Outside Sarendia Orphanage
  
**Saren：**  
Akino?  
Sorry to keep you waiting!  
  
**Saren：**  
Hmm?  
I can't see any carriages  
parked anywhere near the orphanage...  
  
**Saren：**  
Did she get impatient  
and head off without me already?  
  
**Akino：**  
Ohohohohoho!  
You think too little of me, my dear Saren!  
  
**Akino：**  
In my many experiences at the Foundation,  
patience is one of the virtues I have learned!  
  
**Saren：**  
Ahh...! I'd know that laugh anywhere...  
Akino! You really shouldn't make such a ruckus at this hour!  
  
**Akino：**  
My sincerest apologies!  
But really, why are you gazing off into the distance?  
I'm right here, you know!  
  
**Saren：**  
Right here...?  
Um... I can hear your voice, but I can't see you anywhere.  
Where exactly are you?  
  
**Akino：**  
Like I said, I'm right here!  
Look up!  
 I'm right above your head, you silly billy!

**Akino：**  
Strictly speaking, it's still a prototype in testing.  
But this is a bona fide emergency,  
so I convinced Father to let us use it!  
  
**Akino：**  
The farm where we're headed is up in the mountains,  
but by air, it's only a short flight away!

**Saren：**  
Well, that does make sense.  
Thanks, Akino!  
This should cut our travel time down a lot!  
  
**Saren：**  
Honestly, you're usually such a nincompoop,  
yet you always come up with the craziest ideas  
that somehow actually work!  
  
**Akino：**  
Are you trying to compliment me?  
Or insult me?  
  
**Akino：**  
Just hurry and climb on board! Time is money, you know!  
Weren't you the one who was always lecturing me  
not to let a minute go to waste?  
  
**Saren：**  
Ahaha...  
Good point, well made!  
  
**Saren：**  
But, um, how exactly am I supposed to climb on board?  
A big hulking ship like that  
isn't going to be able to land in the city, is it?  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh!  
That's very true...  
Whatever should we do?  
  
**Saren：**  
You're saying you didn't even think about it?!  
Really, how do you think these schemes up,  
but neglect the most obvious details?  
  
**Saren：**  
Let's see...  
If you have something like a rope ladder on board,  
I could probably climb up from here!  
  
**Akino：**  
Aha!  
I believe we do have one of those!  
  
**Akino：**  
Tamaki!  
Where's the rope ladder we used the other day  
when we infiltrated that corrupt tycoon's mansion?  
  
**Saren：**  
Corrupt tycoon...?  
Hey! You haven't been getting yourself mixed up in  
any shady business, have you?!  
  
**Akino：**  
Not at all!  
The only path I walk is the path of justice!  
Surely you should know that!  
  
**Akino：**  
The venerable Akino Wisteria  
never accepts a job that she could not take  
the utmost pride in completing!  
  
**Akino：**  
There! The ladder should be nice and secure now,  
so hurry along up here, my dear Saren!  
  
**Saren：**  
R-right...  
I don't really have any climbing experience,  
so this is a little unnerving...  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh! Then allow me to support you.  
  
**Akino：**  
Doooown we go...  
  
**Akino：**  
And a perfect landing!Now, let's climb up together! Give me your hand!  
  
**Saren：**  
Th-thanks.  
You seem to have learned some...  
interesting skills since the last time we met.  
  
**Akino：**  
Hee hee...  
Surely that goes for the both of us, my dear Saren.  
  
**Akino：**  
Once, we were noble young ladies  
with little to our names but our beauty and fortunes...  
  
**Akino：**  
But we have forged our own paths in life,  
gaining countless nuggets of wisdom and experience!  
  
**Akino：**  
Hee hee... Come, let us share our stories together,  
my dear friend!  
  
**Akino：**  
This flight won't take too long,  
so if we have a nice chat, we'll be there before we know it!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Whew...  
She certainly knows how to make a a scene and a half,  
that Miss Akino.  
  
**Suzume：**  
That airship sure was something...!  
I'd love to ride one someday!  
  
**Suzume：**  
But I guess that will have to wait  
until everything's sorted out and the peace preserved...  
  
...Hmm?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ummm...  
Big Sis Suzume?  
  
**Ayane：**  
What's going on out there?  
All that rumbling  
totally woke us both up!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ohh! I'm so sorry!  
It's the middle of the night, isn't it?!  
Did all the commotion disturb your sleep?  
  
**Suzume：**  
It's all right, though—nothing's wrong!  
You go tuck yourselves back in!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Huh, okay then...  
I thought those Shadows might have showed up again.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ahhh... Don't say that...  
I've been so scared these last few nights,  
it's been hard to get to sleep at all...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, you poor thing...  
But there's nothing to worry about!  
You can trust me, can't you?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Milady and myself are both working hard  
to make sure your sleep goes undisturbed!  
And so is {player}, I'm sure.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um, where is {player}?  
Did he get home already?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, um...  
Not just yet.  
It looks like he's running a little late.  
  
**Suzume：**  
There was a sort of accident a long way from here,  
and it's given him a bit of a hold-up.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh dear...  
I know I'm not exactly telling the whole truth there...  
  
**Suzume：**  
But if I were to explain about the explosion,  
it'd just make them even more scared and worried...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Please come home quickly, {player}!  
You are all right, aren't you?  
Everyone here, myself included, is worried about you!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hmm?  
{player}'s not home?  
Are you sure about that?  
  
**Ayane：**  
'Cause just a minute ago,  
I could've sworn I heard noises  
coming from inside his room...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh?  
Th-that doesn't seem right at all...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Don't tell me  
we really do have another case of the Shadows?!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Nooo!  
Don't say that! It's too scary!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hmmmm...  
Tell you what, I'll go and see what's going on!  
You two stay here where it's safe.  
  
**Suzume：**  
If there's any sign of danger,  
don't worry about me! Just run!  
And don't forget to shout if you're in trouble!  
  
**Ayane：**  
O... Okay.  
You be careful too, though.  
If you're scared, I can go investigate with you!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ahahah!  
Thanks, Ayane, but I'll be just fine.  
Don't you worry about a thing.  
  
**Suzume：**  
If there are any nasties trying to scare you girls,  
Big Sis Suzume  
 will sort them out good and proper!

**Suzume：**  
Oohhhh...  
{player}...?  
Did you get back home already?  
  
**Suzume：**  
N-no response...  
What if it really is a Shadow  
or a monster that's snuck in there...?  
  
**Suzume：**  
S-so scary!  
 But I can't let it get to me...  
The kids must be way more scared than I am!  
  
**Suzume：**  
And milady trusted me to take care of them!  
I have to handle this on my own!  
  
**Suzume：**  
{player}...?  
I'm going to open the door!  
If you're in there, you really should say something now!
