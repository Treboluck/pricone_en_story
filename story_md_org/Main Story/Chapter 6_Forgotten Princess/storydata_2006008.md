### Place: Elizabeth Park
  
**Rin：**  
What's all this?  
Something going on?  
Oh, hey! It's {player}!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Miss Pecorine, too...  
So you were both safe after all.  
Thank goodness.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Eheheh...  
I'm happy to report,  
little Nyatt here made it out safely as well!  
  
**Shiori：**  
We got separated during all the commotion,  
so I was out of my mind with worry for a while...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh? Is that the baby monster we heard about?  
How cute! It looks delicious!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Huh? Did you just say \"delicious\"?  
No, I must have misheard...  
You do know Nyatt isn't food...?  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh, yeah.  
I heard cat meat's all greasy,  
so it's not much good for eating!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, Rin...  
You always seem to know the most useless trivia.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hahah!  
When you laze around all day reading books and stuff  
to pass the time, you learn a thing or two!  
  
**Lima：**  
If you're that bored, do some actual work!  
Not you, Shiori, you can rest all you like.  
  
**Lima：**  
All this sudden commotion  
hasn't done wonders for your health, has it?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm all right, really.  
I want to help however I can.  
  
**Shiori：**  
This is a crisis like the farm has never seen...  
I can't just sit and watch while everyone's hard at work.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
For such a big crisis, though,  
it sure looks like the damage has been fixed crazy fast!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I mean, not that I'm saying  
that's a bad thing or anything...  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's true.  
All these guilds came to help us out,  
and we've been hard at work ourselves since morning.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Everything looks presentable on the outside now,  
but there's still a lot of work that needs doing.  
  

---  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh yeah, and there was this incredible mage too.  
Said she was a friend of Lima's?  
  
**Rin：**  
She did a bit of hocus pocus stuff,  
and suddenly the barn was looking good as new!  
  

---  
  
**Rin：**  
Who the heck was she, anyway?  
I've never seen magic like that,  
even down in the city.  
  

---  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh, you mean Neneka.  
She said she wanted to repay me  
for all the times I've helped her out with her work.  
  
**Lima：**  
Haha...  
You wouldn't know it from her stony face,  
but she's a kind girl at heart.  
  
**Lima：**  
I bet she couldn't stand doing nothing  
when her neighbors were in a sticky situation.  
I'll have to thank her properly later!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
\"Neneka\"...?  
Hmm... The name sounds familiar somehow.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Could she be some sort of famous mage?  
But no... Hmmm...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Something about this is bothering me.  
Would you be able to introduce us to her at some point?  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh, sure!  
Though I'm not sure when I'll see her...  
She always seems to pop up when I least expect it!  
  
**Lima：**  
By the way...  
I don't think we've been introduced?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah...  
My sincerest apologies. How very rude of me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am a humble retainer in service to my lord.  
My name is Kokkoro.  
It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh my, what a polite introduction for such a little girl!  
But what do you mean, \"retainer\"?  
{player}, are you a noble or something?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'm nobody special, really...  
`Tag 4`  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, I've been wondering about that too!  
I never found the right time to ask,  
but just how *did* the two of you meet each other?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, that would take some time to explain...  
Right now, we should hurry and find Miss Saren,  
to let her know that we are safe.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I don't suppose any of you  
would happen to have any idea where we might find her?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, Miss Saren from the Sarendia Orphanage?  
  
**Shiori：**  
She should be over by the barn,  
overseeing the reconstruction effort  
with Mahiru and that lady from the Mercurius Foundation.  
  
**Shiori：**  
If you like, I could show you the...  
 Ahhhh...  
  
**Rin：**  
Aw man, Shiorin, look at you!  
You can barely stand! Get some rest already!  
  
**Lima：**  
Rin's right!  
If you work yourself into submission,  
it'll only create more work when we have to look after you!  
  
**Lima：**  
I understand you want to do whatever you can,  
but don't forget to take care of yourself!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes...  
You're right, of course.  
I'll be more careful in the future.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So, this barn...  
You mean that building over in the distance, right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We should be able to get there without any issue,  
so there's no need to escort us!  
You go get yourself some well-earned rest!  
  
**Shiori：**  
I will.  
Thank you ever so much.  
You're all so kind...  
  
**Shiori：**  
We need strength to survive in this world,  
but without kindness, perhaps we don't deserve to...  
I'll try to become a stronger, kinder person too.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Looking at all of you, I feel sure I can.
