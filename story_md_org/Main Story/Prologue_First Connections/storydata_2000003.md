# Prologue: Part 2
Awoken from a long slumber, you are greeted by Kokkoro, who calls herself your \"guide.\" Together with a hungry girl known as Pecorine and a kind young healer named Yui, you soon find yourself fighting a pack of monsters that are attacking a girl who has collapsed in the woods.

### Place: ???
  
**???：**  
Good morning, sleepyhead.  
  
**???：**  
Sorry, sorry, did I wake you up?  
You can rest a little longer. I need to focus on this work anyway...  
I don't really have time for you right now.  
  
**???：**  
Hmm? Oh, I suppose you're wondering who I am.  
After everything we've been through together, too...  
It's a little depressing to think that for you, this is our first meeting.  
  
**???：**  
I'm... Well, you can call me Ameth.  
That's what everyone calls me lately.  
No need to remember it, though—you'll forget soon enough anyway.  
  
**Ameth：**  
After all...  
This is little more than a dream.  
  
**Ameth：**  
As you can probably tell, I'm pretty damaged right now.  
I can't do much until I finish fixing myself up.  
Can't affect the real world at all.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Which is why...  
I've prepared a sort of replacement.  
A guide who'll take care of you in my stead.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Someone to point you in the right direction, when your life gets complicated.  
You can ask her for the details.  
  
**Ameth：**  
...Oh dear.  
I'm afraid it seems we're out of time.  
I would have liked to talk a little longer, but ah well.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Reality can be cruel like that.  
I suppose you can't laze about dreaming forever.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, see you around.  
Here's hoping your life, your reality, turns out to be a happy one.
