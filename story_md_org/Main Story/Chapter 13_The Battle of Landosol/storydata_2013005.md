## Subtitle: For Whom We Stand Firm
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm.  
 That's enough prattling away amongst yourselves.  
Let's hear explanations.  
Who exactly is this charming young lady?  
  
**Muimi：**  
It's Neneka... right?  
Neneka of the Seven Crowns, who Masaki wanted to rescue!  
Tell me, do you remember who I am?  
  
**Neneka：**  
...Yes, to an extent. During the reconstruction,  
even I could only protect around thirty percent of my memories,  
so the rest is merely my speculation.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I'm afraid you may be the only one among our number  
who retains all of her former memories,  
 Novem.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I expect your special powers are to thank for that, but it is hard to say.  
By studying a member of Forestier with similar powers,  
I was able to craft theories, but the mechanism remains far from clear.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I see... Heheh. Still, it's great just to hear you call me \"Novem\"!  
Everyone else forgot even that—  
they all use my official name and call me \"Muimi\" now.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Yes, they would. Akira and Mana are one thing, but Chris and the like  
must have been entirely defenseless against the reconstruction's effects.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Never one to prepare for all manner of eventualities, were you, Chris?  
  
**Christina：**  
I don't get it, but am I being insulted right now?  
If it's a fight you want, I'll oblige!  
  
**Daigo：**  
Ya think this is the time for infighting, old lady?  
  
**Christina：**  
I think you meant  
 to call me a \"beautiful young maiden.\"  
  
**Christina：**  
So, you're safe, big boy!  
You seemed the type to rush in head-first and get killed,  
so I was a little concerned.  
  
**Daigo：**  
Hah, don't you worry about me!  
Though I guess things *were* pretty touch-and-go back there...  
  
**Daigo：**  
Just as planned, I headed in with Rajraj to smash that  
brainwashing machine right up... but suddenly the woman  
sleeping inside it—that Omniscient Kaiser—opened her eyes.

**Daigo：**  
That maniac...  
She started firing off magical attacks from inside the machine!  
  
**Daigo：**  
She took us by surprise, so me and Rajraj got knocked out for the count.  
Ugh, what a joke... I thought I was made of tougher stuff than that.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Most aptly put. To be frank, I fear we may have wildly  
underestimated our enemy's abilities.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
She unleashed a barrage faster than I could react,  
and we were rendered unconscious in an instant.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
I thought this Kaiser was more of a schemer,  
using others to achieve her nefarious ends...  
But it would seem she is a formidable foe in combat also.  
  
**Daigo：**  
Quit complimenting the enemy!  
Ugh, that hussy...  
Next time I see her, I'm slicing her up good!  
  
`image display end`  
**Muimi：**  
Ahaha. Don't worry, Daigo, it looks like we'll get that chance soon.  
Just now, I saw Mana... the Omniscient Kaiser...  
flying off towards the city center.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I don't know what she's planning to do,  
but it's not gonna be anything good.  
So let's stop her! All of us together!  
  
**Daigo：**  
Hell yeah! I'm not losing again!  
No, I'm not counting last time as a loss either!  
Long as we win in the end, it's all good!  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Haha. I find that attitude rather appealing.  
Sometimes, Mr. Daigo, your words seem quite astute.  
  
**Neneka：**  
...  
  
**Rajraj：**  
...Is something wrong, young lady?  
You are staring quite intently. Is there something on my face?  
  
**Neneka：**  
No. You're... Rajnikanth, aren't you?  
Yet your mannerisms... differ from my memories somehow.  
Something seems strange. Hmmm...?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Well, putting that aside.  
There's no telling what the Kaiser may be up to.  
It's worrisome, to say the least.  
  
**Neneka：**  
We should go after her.  
Masaki... I cannot move on my own, so carry me on your back.  
  
**Masaki：**  
'Tis my pleasure!  
My mistress, I shall be your own personal carriage!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Haha.  
Well, looks like everyone's alive for now,  
so let's call that a win.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I was pretty worried about you all!  
...But I guess it's too soon to relax.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Let's hurry after Mana—the Omniscient Kaiser!  
I don't know exactly where she was heading, but I saw the  
general direction! Everyone who can move, follow me!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yes, yes.  
Honestly, this is going to be the longest day of my life.  
  
**Rino：**  
Less grumbling and more hurrying, Big Sis!  
Time wastes for no man!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
So close!  
It's \"waits\" for no man, Rino!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Do you suppose we should also accompany Miss Novem?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I think so.  
If possible, I'd like to find somewhere  
where we can let our sleeping Karyl rest first, but...  
  
**Karyl：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
She still shows no sign of awakening...  
How very concerning.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Yeah, I'm worried...  
**Choice: (2)**  What if we shout in her ear?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed.  
It worries me so, my heart feels ready to burst from my chest.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, that is not nice at all, my lord.  
Please refrain from playing cruel tricks on our friend.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It may be that she is sound asleep  
because her earlier rampage drained her of a great amount of energy...  
For now, we should let her rest, I think.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, Miss Karyl...  
I do hope you awaken for us soon.  
Until you do, we will stay close by your side...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Awaaah!  
I'm so sorry! Of all the times for my tummy to start rumbling!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...!  
Oh, of course! I put my Royal Equipment on,  
so I'm getting super hungry for the first time in a while!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We managed to recover it  
on the way from the cell where they found me  
to the throne room where Karyl was fighting.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I know it's mine, but stealing from the palace without permission  
felt like an awfully un-princess-y thing to do...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Still, it's not quite time for me to return  
to being Eustiana von Astraea yet!  
For now, I'll do battle as plain old Pecorine of the Gourmet Guild!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine, your eyes are glazing over. Are you all right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, I'm sorry.  
We need to keep moving quickly, don't we?  
Let's follow Mr. Daikon and the others right away!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, let us do just that.  
...Eheh.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What was that for, Kokkoro?  
Looking at me and laughing... Do I have rice stuck to my cheek?  
But it's been a while since the last time I ate a proper meal...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, no. I must apologize.  
I was merely thinking, that Royal Equipment you wear  
suits you better than anything. That is all.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The sight of you in it brought a smile to my face.  
Please allow me to say...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Welcome back, Miss Pecorine.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, I appreciate it!  
Thanks to the both of you,  
the perpetually peckish Pecorine is back in action! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Pecorine of the Gourmet Guild isn't totally back just yet.  
For that, we need me, the two of you,  
and our cute Karyl all working together!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, you are quite correct!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let's hurry after the others!  
And fight for the delicious meals we all love!
