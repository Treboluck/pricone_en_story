## Subtitle: Trouble at the Orphanage
  
### Place: Sarendia Orphanage
  
**Narration：**  
Out at the Sarendia Orphanage on the outskirts of Landosol,  
a sudden horde of rampaging monsters is terrorizing the residents.  
  
**Narration：**  
Together with the city folk who have taken refuge at the orphanage,  
Suzume and the other residents are doing their best  
to fight off the threat.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hyahhh! Pukichi Fullswiiiiing!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Waaahhhh! Go away! Go away! Please just go awaaaay!  
I'm scared! Why are there so many monsters?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
T-try to calm down, both of you!  
Don't swing your weapons wildly!  
With all the people from the city, there's barely any space in here!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
B-but...!  
If we don't beat the monsters, everybody's gonna die!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ohhh, this is scary!  
But I won't cry! Big girls like me don't cry!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wh-wh-wh-what should I do?  
I don't even understand how this happened!  
  
**Suzume：**  
This horde of monsters showed up  
and completely surrounded the whole Sarendia Orphanage!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I really ought to contact milady,  
but is something wrong in the city too?  
The magic flow is so unstable, I can't get through to her!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Just minutes ago, we were happily enjoying the festival...  
We came back home to eat, since the festival food was a bit pricey,  
and suddenly found ourselves in this crisis!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Urgh...?  
 Pull yourself together, Suzume!  
You can't panic now!  
Not until you've at least made sure the children are safe!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
E-excuse me!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Uwahh?! Ehh?! Wh-wh-what's the matter?  
You're, um... ahhh...  
 one of the children  
who was chased here by the monsters, right?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh—yes!  
I was enjoying the festival with Misogi when the monsters attacked...  
We panicked and ran, and somehow ended up here.  
  
**Misogi：**  
That's right!  
We didn't even find the stall where Mimi's working yet!  
Why'd those monsters have to get in the way?  
  
**Misogi：**  
It was pretty tough with Kyoka crying her eyes out the whole time!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I-I wasn't crying! Aaahhh...!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Now, now...  
It isn't nice to argue. We should get along with our friends.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Urgh...  
 Well, forget that!  
We came up with a sort of plan, so could you help us out?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I-I'm sure grown-ups like you won't listen  
to a thing kids like us have to say...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
But if we work together, we might be able to escape the monsters!  
So I... I... Waaahhhh...!  
  
**Misogi：**  
C'mon, calm down, Kyoka.  
There, there. It's gonna be OK~! ☆  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Don't treat me like a child!  
Really, Misogi, you're only one year older than me!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Even so, I *am* a whole year older than you,  
so I've gotta stay strong at times like this.  
Or what, do you want me to mess around like usual?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahhh... I don't want that either, but...  
It throws me off when you get all serious!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahahah! ♪ I'm sorry, Kyoka! Calm down, OK?  
Look, do what I do, see? Take some deep breaths!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I-in... out...  
In... out...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ummm...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh! I'm very sorry. I'm all right now.  
...Thank you, Misogi.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Any time! ♪  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Now, where was I?  
Like I was just saying, we have a plan!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I'll fire off a magic blast in the distance  
to draw the monsters' attention...  
Then we can run while they're distracted!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Even if some of them come after us,  
we can use my traps to slow them down!  
While they're stuck in my pitfalls, everyone can get away!  
  
**Misogi：**  
I already set up a bunch of traps  
a little way down that path over there!  
As long as we get that far, those monsters will never catch us!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Right.  
 Normally, I should tell you off  
for setting up traps near a public path like that...  
But this time, your bad behavior might actually have paid off.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Heheh!  
I've fallen into my own traps too many times in the past,  
so lately I've been keeping notes on where I left them!  
  
**Misogi：**  
We can use those to avoid the traps and get away from the monsters!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Then we can all just make a beeline for the city.  
What do you think?  
Does it sound all right? Or are we just being naive children...?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hmmm...  
Honestly, I do think there's a limit to how long we can stay here.  
It won't be long before the monsters start breaking through the walls.  
  
**Suzume：**  
So we do need to escape sooner or later.  
Anything that helps us run away more safely is a good thing,  
so I appreciate you sharing the plan you came up with.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Thank you. You must be so scared, too...  
You're both such strong girls. There, there! ♪  
  
**Kyoka：**  
W-wahh?!  
Eheheh... I don't mind compliments... ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ahh! Suzume's getting friendly with other kids!  
That's like cheating on us, right, Pukichi?  
  
**Pukichi：**  
Is this really the time to be gettin' jealous over that stuff?  
We all gotta work together to get out of this alive!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I agree with Pukichi...  
I-it's scary, but we have to do our best...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Exactly! You kids are such good girls, too! ♪  
  
**Suzume：**  
Okay, let's try to find a good moment to escape.  
We'll have to tell everyone the plan so we can all move at once.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Anyone who's able to fight can help fend off the monsters behind us.  
Um, Misogi... That was your name, wasn't it?  
Are you going to be our navigator?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Yep, Misogi, that's me!  
But what's a \"navvy-gator\"?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
That's the person who shows everyone else the way.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ohhh! Well, why didn't you just say so?  
Sure thing! I can take the lead!  
I'll point out where all the traps are, so everyone follow behind me!  
  
**Misogi：**  
All right, let's go!  
C'mon, Kyoka, this is starting to get fun now! ☆  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wait—don't start moving yet!  
Didn't you hear her say we need to tell everyone the plan first?  
You have to listen properly!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Haha...  
 I was really scared,  
but watching all the kids get so lively has calmed me down a little...  
I really must keep all their smiles safe.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Milady...!  
I swear I'll do everything in my power!  
  
**Saren：**  
Suzume!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Uwaaaahhh?! M-m-m-milady?  
You came back already?!  
  
**Saren：**  
Yep! I was worried about you,  
so I left the evacuation to the others and came as fast as I could!  
Is everyone OK? Nobody's hurt, I hope?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Welcome back, Mama Saren! ☆  
  
**Boy：**  
Oh, wow!  
Mama Saren really came back!  
  
**Girl：**  
Aahh... Mama Saren...!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Waaahhh! Mama Saren!  
I was so scared...!  
  
**Saren：**  
I know.  
There, there. I'm here now, so it's all going to be fine.  
  
**Saren：**  
If any monsters dare try to hurt my home and my kids,  
I'll send them flying over the mountains and far away!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Bold words, milady!  
Now, um... We were just thinking of using a plan  
the kids came up with to escape from the orphanage...  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, really?  
I see... I'd make a few adjustments, but that's not a bad idea.  
  
**Saren：**  
The monsters are growing in number by the minute,  
so the sooner we escape, the better.  
Let's tell everyone the plan quickly, and get out of here fast.  
  
**Saren：**  
There's a farm in the mountains  
where they're preparing to accept evacuees...  
It'll be a bit of a hike, so we should try to make good time.  
  
**Saren：**  
OK, let's get moving!  
As long as we don't give in, hope is never truly lost!
