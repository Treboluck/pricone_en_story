# Interlude 14
Nebbia appears before Kokkoro and the awakened Karyl with a message from Ameth. She explains that Karyl holds a key entrusted to her by Akira Mosakuji, but when Karyl hears the method of passing that key to {player}, she starts to panic.

**Kokkoro：**  
Here, Miss Karyl, drink this water.  
I infused it with my own medicinal herbs,  
so it should help you to recover.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Mm... Thanks, Koro.  
*glug glug*... ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh.  
Once you are done, shall we retreat for now?  
Allow me to lead the way.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The battle is most chaotic—I fear this spot is too dangerous.  
We should at least get you to a less perilous location.  
  
**Karyl：**  
No... I'll fight too.  
I can't keep holding you back forever.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Maybe it's 'cause you tended to me so carefully,  
but I feel pretty good right now.  
Actually, my body's so full of energy,  
 it almost feels like it might burst.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm...  
I cannot advise pushing yourself too hard, Miss Karyl.  
Mere minutes ago, you were on the verge of death.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I said I'm fine! I won't go overboard.  
But I want to do something to help you guys.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Koro?  
I-I said I'm all right, didn't I?!  
See? I'm totally full of energy! ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh.  
No, I'm sorry...  
 I did not mean to frown.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
However...  
I feel rather powerless.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord lends his power to everyone,  
and Miss Pecorine fights on the front lines,  
but I feel I cannot contribute nearly as much...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh... If only I too had some manner of power  
that could turn the tide in an instant.  
A divine ability like those wielded by the Seven Crowns...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But all that I possess is a few truly mundane abilities  
which are little use right now.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm? I don't really get it...  
But do you really need some kind of godly power?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm pretty glad to have someone like you around  
who can show kindness in a situation like this.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. Thank you very much, Miss Karyl.  
You truly are a kind soul, striving to comfort me with such words.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmph.  
I'm just speaking my mind for once.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Hey! Gourmet Guild girls! I've been looking for you!  
I tracked your magical scents all over town!  
Could you quit it with the teleporting around?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wahhh...?  
You're that weird fairy that lives in our guildhouse!  
Uhhh... Nebbia, was it?  
  
**Nebbia：**  
That's right! I'm the wonderful Guide Fairy, Nebbia!  
Let's see some respect!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
But forget that!  
I've got a message for you! Can we talk?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, sure...  
 But, uh, should you really be here?  
The city's teeming with monsters.  
I'm pretty sure they could crush you with a single swipe.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Yes, I'm quite aware!  
I *was* taking refuge in the world of dreams,  
but Fio... uh, Ameth, sent me to do something important!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Normally, she communicates with you guys through dreams.  
And being dreams, you forget them when you wake up, right?  
  
**Nebbia：**  
But...  
This time, she needs to tell you something you mustn't forget.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
If Ameth tried to come herself, she'd probably break.  
Even I would usually disappear if I left the guildhouse,  
but Akira sent me a special program.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
It falsifies the data of the immediate area...  
Well, you wouldn't understand.  
 Basically, it means I can move  
freely for a little bit, so I came to deliver the message instead!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
So be grateful!  
It's not every day I do a favor this big!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm...  
Well, thank you for your earnest efforts.  
But Miss Nebbia, what is Lady Ameth's message?  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Yes... I was just getting to that.  
But first, is {player} around?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes.  
My lord is supporting our allies from just behind the front lines.  
You see? Just there...  
 Hmm?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, shoot! That dummy Pecorine is charging in too far!  
And I think {player}'s trying to follow along behind her!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Call him back! Quickly!  
That boy {player} is the key to this whole plan!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Hmm?  
A plan, you say?  
  
**Nebbia：**  
That's what I need to tell you!  
Kokkoro, get {player} back here quickly!  
And Karyl, you need to open a communication channel with Carmina!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?!  
 Don't you order me around!  
\"Carmina\"... That's, uh...  
Like, the famous idol group?  
 What've they got to do with this?  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Yes, them.  
They were on a tour of the continent in a high-spec airship.  
We need to make use of it.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
I'm sure they'll be evacuating to safety too,  
but we need to contact them and bring them back!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
I'll explain in more detail once {player} gets back here,  
but the Crowns on the other side,  
 like Akira Mosakuji,  
came up with this plan, so it should be pretty effective!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Mmmhh... But I used up all my magic in that rampage before.  
Sorry, but I might not be able to handle communication magic right now.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
That's OK.  
You may no longer remember, but in your dreams just now,  
Akira Mosakuji gave you a lot of magical energy.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Or so I heard.  
Of course, this is Akira, so she might've forgotten to tell you...  
  
**Nebbia：**  
But Karyl, she gave you the power you need to fight.  
Along with the key we need  
to strengthen {player}'s ability.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Key?  
Huh? I don't think I have any key...  
  
**Nebbia：**  
It's not literal.  
The key is stored inside your magical energy.  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Using a certain process,  
you should be able to transfer it to {player}.  
  
**Karyl：**  
P-process...?  
Why do I have a bad feeling about this?!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
The process is...  
*mutter mutter* ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Whaaaa?!  
Huh?! No way! You're kidding?!  
Hell no! Why do I have to do something like that?!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Oh, stop. Just accept it and do as you're told!  
The whole world is at stake!  
Is this any time to be getting embarrassed?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-whaaa...?  
B-but...!  
I'm not... I'm not ready for this...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Nebbia!  
As you instructed, I have brought my lord back!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Great! Thanks.  
I can see why Fio likes you. What a good girl! ♪  
  
**Nebbia：**  
Now, I'll run you through the details!  
Listen close, because I'm only saying this once!  
I want to get to safety as soon as possible!  
  
**Nebbia：**  
No, we all need to reach a happy end this time!  
So work your butts off for it!  
I'll be cheering you on from the sidelines! ♪
