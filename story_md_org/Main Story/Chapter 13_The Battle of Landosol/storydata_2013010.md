**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Haha. Worrying about others in this situation? How naive.  
Since you haven't learned your lesson,  
I suppose I'll turn up the power a little.  
  
**Illya：**  
Nguahh! Why, you...  
How dare you wreak such havoc  
upon the world that will one day be mine?!  
  
**Illya：**  
Haaahhh! I am an immortal vampire!  
If you think such magic will defeat me, think again!  
  
**Yori：**  
Waaaahhh?!  
  
**Akari：**  
Uweh? Illya deflected the magic attack, so it didn't hit its mark...  
But the shockwave alone is still this powerful?!  
  
**Illya：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
  
**Illya：**  
S-somehow, I survived...  
I'm too old for this kind of thing! Honestly...  
  
**Akari：**  
Ah... Illya's back to normal again.  
  
**Illya：**  
Indeed. Simply deflecting a single attack from this foe  
consumed all the magical reserves I possess...  
  
**Illya：**  
I suppose without {player} to amplify them,  
even if I can regain my powers, they do not last.  
  
**Yori：**  
...! Hey—where'd she go?  
The creepy lady up in the air! She's totally vanished!  
  
**Illya：**  
Say what, now?!  
Curses... I lost sight of her in the smoke from the blast!  
  
**Illya：**  
Nghhhh! Who do you think you are?!  
I will not permit another moment of this barbaric conduct!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Oh? You won't permit it?  
Very good. If you have objections, do try to stop me.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
This game is a war to claim a single wish.  
It's kill or be killed. If there's something you want,  
you'll need to follow my example and take it by force.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
But all of you have forgotten our true goal,  
and allowed yourselves to sink into sickening complacence.  
Now let's see, which of us  
 is in the right by this world's standards?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
It's me!  
*That* is why the gods of this world will never answer your prayers.  
They'll happily allow a despicable villain like me  
 to end your friend's life!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Oh dear.  
Must you be so rough?  
I thought you might tear my arm clean off.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Silly me. I couldn't even react in time...  
I suppose I must still be half asleep.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Miyako! Are you all right?  
If you can hear, answer me!  
  
**Miyako：**  
*cough* *cough*...  
Sh... Shinobu... Uerghh...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
How awful. Her life force...  
 the substance that forms her very being...  
has been massively drained away.  
Left like this, she will vanish of her own accord.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
As a wandering spirit, her form was already unstable...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
But...  
Miyako is our precious companion, so I *will* save her.  
It's far too soon to say goodbye.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Illya! Yori and Akari, too... Can you all move?  
This enemy is far too dangerous. Let's avoid battle and retreat for now!  
  
**Illya：**  
I-indeed!  
That does seem best.  
Why should we humor that scoundrel by playing her way?!  
  
**Yori：**  
G-got it!  
Akari, can you get up?  
  
**Akari：**  
I-I think so...  
Urgh... I hit my head, and now I'm all dizzy...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Such fools.  
Do you think I'd let you escape?  
  
**Illya：**  
Why, you...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Don't make me laugh.  
Magical blasts of that level won't even leave a scratch on me.  
  
**Illya：**  
But they *will* obstruct your vision!  
Now! While I keep the wretch occupied, flee this place!  
We will never escape her without someone to act as bait!  
  
**Yori：**  
B-but...  
 We can't just leave you behind!  
  
**Illya：**  
It's all right.  
My dear little ones...  
 It's an elder's job to protect the young.  
  
**Illya：**  
Thank you for everything.  
  
**Illya：**  
Since you all found me and dragged me from my slumber,  
though I may have struggled somewhat at first,  
each and every day has been most fulfilling.  
  
**Illya：**  
Among all the years I have lived,  
these days will glitter brighter than the rest.  
  
**Illya：**  
However... All things must end. I fear this is farewell.  
Live on without me, and please,  
pass down my legend to your children and grandchildren.

**Illya：**  
The Ruler of the Night...  
 The vampire, Illya Ornstein...  
Her touching tale will live on in your hearts.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
My, she's actually ready to die.  
How irritating. That will only make it more difficult.
