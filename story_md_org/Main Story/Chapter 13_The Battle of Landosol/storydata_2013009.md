## Subtitle: The Kaiser Attacks
  
**Miyako：**  
...Uwighh?!  
  
**Yori：**  
Waaahhh! Wh-what's wrong, Miyako?!  
Don't make weird noises all of a sudden! You scared me for a moment!  
  
**Miyako：**  
G... guys, look there!  
Something really creepy is floating in the sky!  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh?! What's this about now?!  
Don't say such scary things!  
  
**Akari：**  
Oh, sis. You've got so many weaknesses.  
You sensitive thing...  
 Hee hee. It's so cute! ♪  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmm? What could this be about?  
What would strike terror into the innocent Miyako...?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...  
  
**Illya：**  
What is that...? The sight confounds me...  
It appears to be human in shape,  
but this aura is sinister beyond measure!  
  
**Illya：**  
Wretch, speak thy name!  
How dare you look down upon me?! Such insolence!  
Who do you take me for?!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Ruler of the Night and legendary vampire, Illya Ornstein...  
Ahahah. I always assumed those titles  
were just a fantasy you had invented...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
But my oh my! You do look delectable.  
I don't care if you're a fake or the genuine article.  
That bounty of magical energy within you  
 is just what I need.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Hahaha.  
 The populace may have fled the city,  
but I have little use for small fry anyway.  
Many still remain, fighting for love and justice to protect the innocent.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
They will be a more filling meal. Just the kind of prey I seek!  
Besides, utterly crushing their sickly-sweet ideals and virtues  
as I feast upon them  
 will be ever so satisfying.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Vampire Illya and her merry companions...  
\"Diabolos,\"  
 did you call yourselves? What a flowery name.  
For now, I think I'll make you my first appetizers.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
For my dream, my wish,  
 you will give your lives.  
  
**Illya：**  
...! Look out—her aura brims with menace!  
And... what is this? This outrageous magnitude of magical energy?  
  
**Illya：**  
Flee, all of you!  
This wretch challenged me by name! I am her target!  
While I keep her attention on me, the rest of you can—  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh? Huh?  
What's going on? What the heck *is* she?!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Too bad. There's nowhere to run to, for any of you. Or for me.  
We're imprisoned in this broken world,  
forced to spill our blood in a pitiful game.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
All we can do is pass the time...  
 so let's at least enjoy ourselves!  
  
**Illya：**  
...Urghh! Not good. This output is unparalleled!  
A single attack spell from her would overwhelm our defenses!  
I feel certain nothing would remain of us!  
  
**Illya：**  
The humiliation! If only I could still assume my true form!  
It may have been within my power to protect these innocents  
who took pity on me in my weakness and offered me companionship!

**Illya：**  
...!  
Ahhh... What is this...?!  
 My true body is restored!  
  
**Akari：**  
Whoa! No way! Illya, you managed to transform  
even without {player}'s help?!  
  
![201300902.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/201300902.webp)  
**Illya：**  
Hahah. Desperate times bring newfound strength!  
How's that?! In our hour of need, my power blooms brightest!  
Am I not a glorious leader?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Haha.  
 I've been wondering for a long time  
what really triggers your transformations...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
But if it can be brought on  
when you feel the touch of {player}  
or desire to protect us, your guildmates...  
  
**Akari：**  
It's gotta be the power of love, hasn't it?! ☆  
  
**Illya：**  
All of you!  
Cease your incessant babbling  
 and take refuge behind me!  
I will erect a magical barrier!  
  
**Illya：**  
Fwahahah! Prostrate yourself!  
Insolent wretch who has not even given her name...  
Perhaps in the next life, you will learn some semblance of manners!

**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
My, my. Such overconfidence...  
A mere player like you thinks herself an administrator's equal?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Frankly, I don't like your attitude. Who do you think you are?  
I'll make you regret the disrespect you have shown me.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Perhaps *you* should die, and in the next life,  
suffer a miserable existence  
 that once more amounts to nothing!  
  
**Illya：**  
Ngh...! Her power is greater still than I expected!  
A single direct hit will shatter my barrier in an instant!  
  
**Illya：**  
In which case, I must use an attack of my own to divert its course!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Illya! That does seem like a wise move,  
but the citizens are still nearby, so please take extra care  
not to send the spell towards them!  
  
**Illya：**  
Yes, I am quite aware!  
Although we will have to pray that nobody still remains  
in any buildings that the spell may annihilate!
