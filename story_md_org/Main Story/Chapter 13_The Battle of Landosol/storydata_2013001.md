## Subtitle: Taking Command
  
### Place: Landosol Plaza
  
**Narration：**  
With the city flooded in a strange black sludge,  
the citizens of Landosol begin to descend into panic.  
  
**Narration：**  
At the headquarters of the committee overseeing the festival,  
the guild leaders and other officials  
have their hands full trying to deal with the situation.  
  
**Saren：**  
Akino, I need your help!  
You're much better than me at this kind of thing.  
  
**Akino：**  
Yes, of course. Leave it to me!  
Everyone! Attention, please!  
I need you to quiet down and listen for a moment!  
  
**Akino：**  
We are commencing an evacuation plan!  
All citizens should follow our instructions!  
And of course, you must remain calm and move in an orderly manner!  
  
**Akino：**  
Ohohohoho!  
House Wisteria's entire fleet of airships has been fully mobilized,  
and they are now standing by in Landosol's main plaza!  
  
**Akino：**  
We will guide you all safely to the plaza now,  
so proceed calmly and board the waiting vessels!  
  
**Akino：**  
Our airships will carry you to a safe location in no time flat!  
Ohohohoho! ☆  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Is all the ostentatious laughter really necessary?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Anyway...  
 We of the Mercurius Foundation will take the lead,  
so please listen carefully and follow our instructions!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
When boarding the airships, give priority to the elderly,  
those in bad health, and small children.  
...Come on, Yukari, wake up and give us a hand with this.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Weheheheh... I'm fine, I'm fine!  
 Not asleep at all!  
As if the reliable Yukari would get drunk on the job  
and fall asleep at her post~! ☆  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Sadly, I have to say that objectively speaking,  
you're as drunk as a skunk right now.  
  
**Yukari：**  
*glug glug glug* Aaaahhhhh! ☆  
But, y'know~? 'Course I was gonna drink! It's a festival!  
My work was all done, so I thought,  
 \"Just one glass! As a treat!\" ☆  
  
**Yukari：**  
But once I started drinking, I kinda couldn't stop, see?  
I meeean, I've been soooooo busy lately,  
I couldn't even go home for a tipple!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Weeheehee... It's so good to drink again!  
I finally feel alive!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Ooh, I hate being seen like this...  
But... that won't stop me now!  
I'm drinking till I drop today!  
  
**Akino：**  
Are you sure you're all right, Yukari?  
You seem... seriously plastered.  
  
**Akino：**  
Haha. You're usually such a calm and collected grown-up,  
so I'm surprised to see you get like this from a little drink.  
Hee hee. It's actually a rather cute revelation!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
\"A little\" hardly covers it.  
I just checked the barrels we prepared for the after-party,  
and more than one was empty.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Still... I suppose there won't be time for any parties now.  
Go ahead, Yukari. You can drink the rest if you like.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Huh? Really?  
Wow, thanks, Mifuyu! You're the best! I love yooooou! ☆

**Yukari：**  
Yaaaay, I'm drinking the night away!  
C'mon, Akino, you have some too!  
Wait, I can't offer alcohol to minors!  
 Ahahahah... ☆  
  
**Akino：**  
I, ah, think it may be best  
to leave Yukari to her own devices for now.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Agreed. Still, I never thought I'd see the day  
Akino seemed more reliable than Yukari...  
  
**Akino：**  
Excuse me?  
I am always dependable to a fault, am I not?!  
Ohohoho! ☆  
  
**Saren：**  
Come on, Mercurius Foundation! Is this really the time to chat?  
I've rounded up the evacuees and prepared them to move,  
so start guiding already!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh!  
 I see you're as efficient as always.  
  
**Akino：**  
Impressive, my dear Saren!  
I'd expect no less from my greatest friend! ☆  
  
**Saren：**  
Thanks for the compliment.  
But to be honest, I didn't do much.  
It's mostly thanks to Nightmare that things went so smoothly.  
  
**Saren：**  
They really are professionals.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Well, we do hold regular training sessions for emergencies like this.  
Frankly, if we *couldn't* handle it well,  
we'd be wasting everyone's taxes.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I've sent word via communication magic  
to the various Nightmare units that were on guard duty  
in each district. I'm sure they'll all do the best they can.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Worryingly, we've lost contact with Jun  
and the other higher-ups at the palace...  
but we rank-and-file knights will just have to do our best on our own.  
  
**Saren：**  
OK.  
Thank you. It really is a huge help.  
  
**Tomo：**  
No, no. If it weren't for you, their former vice-captain, taking command,  
I'm sure it would have taken much longer.  
You should really give yourself more credit.  
  
**Saren：**  
Well, that can wait until the populace is safely evacuated.

**Saren：**  
Now, Tomo, was it? Could you hold the fort here for me?  
I need to check in on my kids,  
so I'd like to head over to the Sarendia Orphanage if possible.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ah...  
 Sure, go ahead.  
Will you be OK on your own?  
If you like, I could send someone along as backup.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'll be fine. I can take good care of myself.  
  
**Saren：**  
Well then, I'm counting on you! I'll try to be back soon!  
Suzume, Ayane, Kurumi...  
My beloved family... You'd better all be safe and sound!  
  
**Akino：**  
Ahaha.  
 My dear Saren, when did you become so domestic?  
Still, compared to when you were stifled by the ways of high society,  
you seem a lot more spirited these days.  
  
**Akino：**  
I think I like you better this way!  
I wish you the best on your chosen path!  
Let us both protect everything that is truly precious to us!
