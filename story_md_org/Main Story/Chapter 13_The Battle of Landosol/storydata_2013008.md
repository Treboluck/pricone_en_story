### Place: Landosol Plaza
  
**Narration：**  
As the people of Landosol flee the city to escape the chaos,  
the members of Diabolos are doing their best to protect those citizens  
from harm.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Evacuee Man：**  
Aaaaghhhh!  
S-somebody help, please!  
  
**Evacuee Boy：**  
Waaaahhhh!  
Daddy! Mommy! Where did you go?!  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Yori：**  
Akari, take care of that kid!  
  
**Akari：**  
Sure thing, sis!  
Good boy—come over here! Everything's gonna be fine! ♪  
  
**Evacuee Boy：**  
A-ahhh? Waahhh!  
  
**Yori：**  
Why, you... Stop scaring little kids already!  
Get lost, you brutes!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Yori：**  
*pant*... *pant*...!  
Geez! What the heck is even going on?!  
  
**Yori：**  
There's monsters everywhere!  
We've got them under control now,  
but at this rate, we'll be out of stamina in no time!  
  
**Akari：**  
Try to calm down, sis...  
You'll only tire yourself out more.  
Here, let your sweet little sister heal you with a hug! ♪  
  
**Yori：**  
Mmlngh?! Hey—stop that! I can't fight with you clinging onto me!  
And quit treating me like a kid!  
I know we're twins, but I'm supposed to be the big sister!  
  
**Akari：**  
Eheheh! ♪  
Still, I'm sure even you need a little tender loving care sometimes!  
  
**Akari：**  
...You're always helping me out, so let me return the favor for once.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Yori, Akari, good work out there.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
If we can just secure an escape route for the evacuees here,  
they should be safe...  
The evacuation of the citizens will be finished soon enough.  
  
**Yori：**  
R-really?  
Thank goodness... I was just about to collapse...  
  
**Akari：**  
Mmm... Even after they escape,  
we should still try to get rid of any monsters left here in the city.  
If the city becomes a monster nest, nobody'll be able to come home.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Indeed.  
So please, let's all keep up the good work.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I expect that other guilds,  
 especially battle-focused ones like Caon,  
will also be working to fend off this crisis...  
We should try to work with them and all get through this together.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Such an unprecedented disaster will take cooperation to overcome.  
There's no time to tell fortunes, so I'm speaking on instinct,  
but I'm sure there's still hope ahead.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
*sigh*...  
Though all of this constant fighting is certainly a struggle.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
You OK, Shinobu?!  
You've never had much stamina, so don't push yourself too hard!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
All right, I'll handle this myself! Those twins just taught me  
that the cure for an exhausted heart is the warmth of family!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
C'mon, Shinobu, let your daddy nuzzle you back to health!  
Nuzzle, nuzzle, nuzzle... ♪

**Shinobu：**  
...There's nothing else for it.  
I suppose the time has come to unleash my last resort.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
It involves pumping my father full of magic  
and throwing him at the enemy,  
 so it won't be very pretty.  
But it will at least kill both the enemies and my father.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Huh? You're kidding, right?  
I don't like that look in your eyes!  
My sweet little girl wouldn't resort to such a heartless scheme, right?  
  
![201300802.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/201300802.webp)  
**Shinobu：**  
Haha. Of course not.  
It was just my little joke to lighten the mood.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Uh, why do your jokes always gotta be so scary?!  
  
`image display end`  
**Illya：**  
Come, friends.  
 Do not allow your focus to wane.  
We are still in the midst of a catastrophe.  
  
**Illya：**  
Although, stuck in this form as I am,  
scarcely able to contribute, it may not be my place to lecture...  
  
**Illya：**  
Urgh... How very vexing.  
It pains me to ask you all to fight while I cannot.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Don't get frowny, Illya!  
Miyako feels all sickly now and can't fight much either,  
so Illya has Miyako for company!  
  
**Miyako：**  
We're partners in uselessness!  
 Eheheh! ☆  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh? I did think you seemed sluggish...  
You're feeling sick, Miyako? Are you OK?  
  
**Akari：**  
How awful!  
I just assumed Miyako was lacking in motivation like usual!  
  
**Akari：**  
Listen, I'll bring some pudding from a shop nearby!  
That should make you feel much better, right?  
I guess  
 I can just leave some money on the counter as payment!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Hmm.  
I was aware that Illya was unable to fight  
without the aid of {player} to restore her true form...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
But Miyako's ailment is more concerning.  
She's usually so full of boundless energy...  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmm. As a lingering spirit,  
Miyako is sensitive to the magical and emotional currents around her.  
  
**Illya：**  
With the entire city descending into fear and panic,  
the negative atmosphere may be adversely affecting her.  
  
**Illya：**  
In human terms,  
 it may be similar to a cold.  
Though I am no expert. I expect we should allow her to rest...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Hmm.  
 After so much fighting, all of us have exhausted our stamina.  
Perhaps it's time we sought out a safe building to recuperate.  
  
**Illya：**  
Yes, I would concur with that.  
As the mistress of Diabolos, I order you all...  
Retreat from the field of battle! Let us heal our bodies!  
  
**Yori：**  
Oh, come to think of it,  
I guess Illya *is* technically our leader, isn't she?  
  
**Akari：**  
Ahaha.  
Shinobu always takes charge of everything,  
so it's easy to forget, huh?  
  
**Illya：**  
Ehhh?!  
 Such insolence!  
Surely it was my boundless charisma that brought us together!  
Was it not?! You are all my loyal servants, yes?!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Nope... Illya helped at the start,  
but we all stayed because we like each other!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako is happy here...  
Making all these new friends even after becoming a ghost!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Eheheh.  
Some things in the world are almost as wonderful as pudding! ♪  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako learned that thanks to all you guys!
