**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Hmm...  
 Looks like plenty of your friends have made it here now,  
so I think that's enough talking.  
Honestly, I would have liked to cover some more important things...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
But as I said before, we're out of time.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...? I don't get it.  
I think I mostly understand what the Shadows are now...  
But I don't get your actual goal, Omniscient Kaiser.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You're gathering this huge reserve of life force, but for what?  
What are you trying to achieve? What's the wish you want granted?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
What will you do if I tell you?  
As a benevolent royal with a duty to grant the people's wishes,  
will you try to help me achieve it,  
 Princess?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, no.  
You already stole everything I had from me once.  
I hate you more than anything.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Of course, thanks to that, I ended up on a journey  
that gave me a lot of new precious things...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But I still can't forgive you or accept you.  
Still, it would be sad to do nothing but hate and reject each other,  
so I'd at least like to hear your story and understand you.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I don't want to just assume you're nothing but a heartless villain,  
toss you aside and forget about you.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Being rejected out of hand and forgotten by the world  
is a cruel fate to suffer... I know that better than anyone.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Besides, you're a human just like us, trying to live your life.  
And I think Karyl cares a lot about you.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
As long as you have even one person who truly cares for you...  
your life, your story, can't possibly deserve to be forgotten.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
How admirable.  
No, how terribly kind, little princess.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I can't wait to see you give up on those empty ideals.  
When the time comes, I'll give you a nice, hearty laugh.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Did you not understand a word of what I just told you?  
How to create a Shadow, the perfect source of life energy?  
I thought I made it quite clear.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
You tear a person's soul from their body.  
The empty shell is Lost, and the soul becomes a Shadow.  
...Now, can you guess the easiest way to extract a soul?  
  
**Rajraj：**  
...Look out! Several magical signatures detected!  
We are surrounded by a large horde of monsters!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Awfully slow, aren't you?  
Did you really think I'd explain my evil plans  
like some second-rate villain for no reason?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
By experimenting with Karyl's Princess Knight ability,  
I fully analyzed its logic...  
So now  
 I don't need her help to control monsters as I wish.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Before the reconstruction,  
there was even a \"monster tamer\" job, you know.  
I think Octo was a particular specialist in that class?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
With the right techniques, anyone can tame monsters.  
And just now, I took control of enough monsters to fill all of Landosol,  
and summoned them all here.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Enough that even all of you together,  
fighting your hardest, won't stand a chance.  
You may resist at first, but eventually you'll be worn down and crushed.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
And when your bodies or your lives expire, your souls will be exposed.  
Death makes the soul leave the body.  
 Nice and simple, isn't it?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
The real world may differ, but that's how it works here.  
And then, when the soul is parted from its host,  
I can turn it into a Shadow.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
What's more, as I just explained,  
Shadows are rich with pure life energy...  
The perfect meal for me to feast upon.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
All of you here now are going to be cooked up and served at my table.  
Doesn't that sound wonderful? ♪  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Say, princess, didn't you found something called the Gourmet Guild?  
A guild devoted to eating, I believe?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Then you'll understand!  
Just how happy and full of anticipation I feel!  
Oh, you people are so stupid and easy to fool!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Coming to me like lambs to the slaughter!  
So eager to be cooked  
and become a delicious banquet for me to savor!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Now, a fun, fun lunchtime is at hand!  
Time to dig in! ☆  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I'll slaughter all of you, turn your souls into Shadows,  
and fill my belly with their delicious forms!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
To defy fate and write the story I desire!  
To make my wish a reality at last!
