{player} and his allies emerge from within the black cube, which turns out to have been Neneka transforming herself to carry them to safety. Neneka laments how terrible her condition is, but in reality, she still has energy in reserve.
  
## Subtitle: Ark of Reunion
  
**Muimi：**  
Huh...?  
The black box melted away and turned into a girl!  
Wh-what was that? Some kind of magic trick?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Wait, no. You're...  
 Neneka?  
Hahah... Now I get it! You used your ability!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm?  
And you are...?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Well, well.  
It's been some time, Chris.  
  
**Christina：**  
Only my closest friends are allowed to call me \"Chris.\"  
  
**Neneka：**  
Yes, I'm quite aware.  
  
That would be why I'm doing so.  
  
**Christina：**  
...?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Anyway, before we celebrate this reunion...  
Allow me to confirm—is everyone all right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ummm...  
Let's take roll call! Is the whole Gourmet Guild here?  
{player}! Kokkoro!  
 Karyl~?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes. My lord and I are both safe.  
As for Miss Karyl, my lord is holding her tightly in his arms.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, good!  
 That's a relief...  
But I guess Karyl's still totally unconscious, huh?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes. She shows no sign of awakening, which concerns me.  
Her magical activity has fully calmed down,  
and it seems she is merely asleep,  
 which I suppose is reassuring...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha.  
 She really does just look like a sleepyhead.  
I can even see her drooling...  
 How cute! ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  D'awwww...  
**Choice: (2)**  We should wipe her mouth.  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Right?!  
 I knew you'd agree, {player}!  
You like cute things as much as I do! ☆  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Sure!  
You just keep holding her still, {player}!  
I'll wipe her mouth nice and clean! Wipey-wipey! ♪  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Heheh.  
 The situation still looks pretty bad...  
But I'm glad Karyl seems to be safe, at least!  
  
**Neneka：**  
You people have no sense of urgency.  
It would appear that Mana... the Omniscient Kaiser...  
tried to destroy the palace and bury all of us alive in the rubble.  
  
**Neneka：**  
If I hadn't transformed into a box and protected you all from harm,  
every last one of us would have been done for.  
  
**Neneka：**  
My transformations require a lot of energy,  
so I'm afraid I can't move a single finger after that.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Particularly considering I was connected to that apparatus  
which siphoned my life force for the Kaiser's sake.  
Even as one of the Seven Crowns, that left me close to death.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Your... life force?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Indeed. Due to various reasons,  
including the spell of mass destruction she unleashed,  
the Omniscient Kaiser was depleted and unconscious...  
  
**Neneka：**  
So in order to reawaken, and most likely for other purposes,  
she needed to drain energy from others.  
  
**Neneka：**  
As the name suggests,  
that brainwashing device was controlling the palace residents,  
turning them into convenient pawns for her to use freely...  
  
**Neneka：**  
But it also served  
to drain and accumulate the life force of other people.  
  
**Neneka：**  
As its most direct victim, siphoned continuously at very close range,  
I am utterly drained.  
It takes all the energy I possess just to speak like this.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh...  
You sure seem to be pretty talkative, considering.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Well, I've never been one to let my fatigue show.  
In fact, due to my job, I have trained myself to control my emotions.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Well, well... She seems airheaded, but she's surprisingly sharp.  
She noticed that I still have energy to spare.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Trump cards are to be kept hidden, dear princess.  
I also have a reserve of energy concealed in Masaki's body,  
though he knows nothing of it.  
  
**Neneka：**  
That is the reason why I am so relieved to see him again.  
Yes, it is most certainly the only reason. That is no lie.  
...Wait, who am I even making excuses to?  
  
**Neneka：**  
At any rate. Regardless of whether Mana...  
the Kaiser wins this battle or is defeated at the heroes' hands,  
I need only defeat the exhausted victor to take the spoils.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Hahaha.  
 To secure my own ultimate victory,  
I must pretend to be depleted and conserve my own energy.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I have no plans to retire from this game yet.  
Good and evil alike are mere tools for me to use as I please.
