## Subtitle: The Final Stage Begins
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Oh, aren't we all getting lively!  
This is why I can't stand you people.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
You have no sense of mood.  
Your lives, and the world, are about to end. Can't you grieve a little?  
Although watching you like this does feel rather nostalgic...  
  
**Rei：**  
Hmm?  
Have we met somewhere before?  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Yes.  
Not that I would expect you to remember.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Ah, this almost feels like fate. Everyone is here!  
Once this is over, I'll finally be able to move on!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey, Daikon!  
You take the enemies on the right! I'm gonna handle the left!  
  
**Daigo：**  
Guahhh!  
At least *try* to get my name right for once!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Huh? \"For once\"...?  
Hang on, this is the first time we've met, right?  
  
**Daigo：**  
Ehhh? Sorry, I wasn't thinkin' straight!  
Forget it. Let's focus on the battle!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
No, no, I won't forget!  
I wouldn't want to lose any bonds that I've formed!  
  
**Rei：**  
Haha. Quite right.  
 There are cases like \"his,\"  
where one's memories are sadly snatched away...  
But ordinarily, the memories we share should remain ours to keep.  
  
**Rei：**  
I would never wish to surrender those precious connections.  
  
**Neneka：**  
On that point, I can agree.  
That is the source of your strength.  
  
**Neneka：**  
The reason why, despite our great disparity in power,  
you once defeated us.  
  
**Rei：**  
Whoa! You scared me!  
Where did you just pop up from?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Oh, I'm never very far away.  
And I'm always keeping a careful eye on you.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I am Neneka...  
For now, allow me to fight by your side.  
  
**Masaki：**  
As you wish, so let it be done!  
I will likewise lend every facet of my strength!  
  
**Neneka：**  
I should think so.  
I'm not in the best condition, so I require your help.  
Fight to your heart's content, my Princess Knight.  
  
**Masaki：**  
Ahhhh! Strength floods through me!  
Now I can wield my ability with abandon!  
Ah, my mistress is filling me with her love! ☆  
  
**Neneka：**  
Please don't describe it in such a disturbing way.  
  
**Rei：**  
Haha...  
 I don't quite get it, but thank you for helping.  
We have to defeat more monsters than the eye can see;  
we'll need all the help we can get.  
  
**Rei：**  
Yui, back us up as usual!  
With you watching over us,  
 no enemy will take us down!  
  
**Yui：**  
Okay, Rei!  
Tell me if anyone gets hurt! I'll heal them up quickly!
