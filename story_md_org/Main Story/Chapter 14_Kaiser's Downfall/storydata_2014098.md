## Subtitle: Interlude 15
  
**Narration：**  
The streets of Landosol are overrun by the monsters  
unleashed by the Omniscient Kaiser.  
  
**Narration：**  
As the members of Carmina oversee the situation from an airship above,  
the members of various other guilds across the city  
do their best to work together as {player} requested.  
  
**Chika：**  
...So, as I've explained,  
{player} and his allies are working to foil Eustiana's...  
No, the Omniscient Kaiser's evil ambitions.  
  
**Chika：**  
Members of Weissflügel, I'd like to ask you all  
to take care of the Shadows and monsters on the city outskirts.  
You can count on us to guide you from above!  
  
**Monika：**  
Much appreciated!  
We were tackling the monsters ourselves, but with all the chaos,  
it's been a real challenge to determine where to start!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Gueheheh...  
 We can't let you harm the normal city folk,  
but I won't complain if you want to attack me a little more!  
How's that sound, monsters?! ♪  
  
**Chika：**  
U-umm... I'm very sorry. Could you please try  
to hunt down the Shadows as well as the monsters?  
It seems the enemy is using them to gather information.  
  
**Monika：**  
Understood!  
My Carmina allies, let us fight as one!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Monika：**  
More of them already?!  
Come, do your worst!  
...Hm?!  
  
**???：**  
Nanaka Infinite Blast!  
  
**???：**  
Howling Heavenly Thunderblitz!  
  
**Monika：**  
Waaaaghhhh?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Aaawaaaahhh! ♪  
  
**Monika：**  
Ngh... What in the...?!  
What was that explosion?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Hahahah!  
It seems my Ultimate Magick has banished all nearby monsters  
to the void beyond this plane!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Yep, this has gotta be quickest!  
Just like I thought, the meta for this quest  
 is us! ☆  
  
**Ruka：**  
You guys, it's great that you're motivated...  
But is it just me, or did you just blast some innocent bystanders?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Heheh... heheheheh...  
Everywhere I look, I see new guinea pigs!  
It's enough to make my other \"eye\" tingle...! ♪  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ahhh... So many pitiful monsters all around us...  
If anything happens to my beloved, I'll make you regret it.  
  
**Chika：**  
Um, hold on... Nozomi?  
Wasn't Twilight Caravan one of the guilds  
you were supposed to be handling?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
S-sorry, Chika!  
They just don't seem to listen to a word I say!  
  
**Kuka：**  
These people are... Twilight Caravan?  
A guild searching for the City of Twilight...  
I've heard they're very dangerous!  
  
**Monika：**  
Ah, I see... The name rings a bell.  
So these are the members of that underworld guild.  
Hmm...  
  
**Monika：**  
Listen, ladies of Twilight Caravan!  
We members of Weissflügel  
possess valuable intel about the City of Twilight you seek!  
  
**Monika：**  
If you work with us and defeat these monsters and Shadows,  
we will share it with you!  
How's that? Do we have a deal?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ohhh~?  
Monika, when did you uncover rare info like that?  
  
**Monika：**  
Um, well...  
 I don't have any right now.  
But I couldn't think of any other offer  
that was sure to interest them.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Oh, so you made it all up...  
If they find out...  
  Gueheh!  
Who knows what they'll do to us~?! ♪ Gueheheh!  
  
**Monika：**  
Making such false claims tarnishes my honor as a soldier...  
Still, I won't allow them to stay false forever.  
Once this is over, we'll see what we can do.  
  
**Monika：**  
Besides, since Ninon and co. have wandered off who-knows-where,  
we'd struggle to take care of this many monsters alone, wouldn't we?  
  
**Eriko：**  
...What do you think, Ruka?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Kyu-pi-ping! ☆ Why even hesitate on this, Ruka?!  
They've got the Twilight City deets we crave!  
If this isn't the big wave to hop on, what is?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Well... I suppose it can't hurt to play along with that little lady.  
I'd rather not leave this city in its current state either...  
  
**Ruka：**  
All right!  
We're lending these people our aid, guys!  
For the City of Twilight!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Heh... So be it.  
Hecate of the Gale will make short work of these beasts!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
That's our Ruka! You get what's up! ♪  
Okay then, which monster wants to be the first  
to taste a big kaboom from Magical Girl Nanaka?!  
  
**Monika：**  
Hmm, they seem difficult to coordinate with...  
Still, we're counting on you, members of Twilight Caravan!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Likewise.  
Hee hee... Let me know if you get injured.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ummm, so first we beat the monsters and Shadows in the city...  
Then... what do we do after that, Carmina?  
  
**Chika：**  
Well, it's not just the city.  
There are hordes of monsters outside too.  
So ideally...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
To ensure {player} and the others  
can focus on the Kaiser...  
it'd be really great if you could take care of them all!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Personally, I must say this situation irritates me a little.  
But supporting one's beloved from the shadows  
is also a valid form of love.  
  
**Monika：**  
Good. Then as of right now,  
we members of Weissflügel and Twilight Caravan  
will begin a joint operation!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Ready, you guys?  
Let's not embarrass ourselves in front of a military squad!  
  
**All：**  
Yeah!
