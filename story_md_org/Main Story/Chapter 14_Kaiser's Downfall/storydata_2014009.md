# Chapter 14 Episode 9
Pecorine and friends arrive just in time to save Christina and Rajraj. With her monsters thoroughly eradicated and her Astral Insight neutralized, it seems that the Kaiser will have no choice but to surrender, but suddenly, she gathers mana from across the city and transforms into a sinister new form.

**Rajraj：**  
*cough*...!  
  
**Christina：**  
Urgh...!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Now, now.  
Can't you even handle this?  
I'm only emitting a torrent of magical energy in all directions...! ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
Ngh...  
Forcing me to focus entirely on defense is quite the feat!  
  
**Rajraj：**  
To think the Kaiser hid such sheer power...!  
  
**Christina：**  
Still, what's this?  
It's as though she's begun toying with us all of a sudden.  
At the start, she was in such a hurry to end the battle...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Now, let's try one more time.  
Dodge if you like, or give up on defense and charge at me.  
Either way, if you don't go all out...  
 you'll surely die!  
  
**Christina：**  
The instant I try to attack, this torrent takes advantage to bypass my  
Absolute Defense!  
 In the heat of battle, have you learned to read me  
with such precision? Through sheer intellect?!  
  
**Christina：**  
...Nguahh!  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Chris!  
  
**Christina：**  
No... I'm not done yet!  
This exhilarating game is still just getting started!  
  
**Daigo：**  
Time to step aside now, you reckless old lady!  
  
**Christina：**  
Daigo?!  
But weren't you scouring the monsters with Muimi and...  
  
**Daigo：**  
We finished that ages ago!  
...Geez, look at you. You're both in tatters!  
  
**Christina：**  
Haha. More beautiful than ever, aren't I?  
At any rate, don't interfere.  
I was just beginning to enjoy myself...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
My, you're very late.  
Princess Knights and company.

**Choice: (1)**  Omniscient Kaiser!  
`Tag 1`  
**Rajraj：**  
All of you...!  
  
**Masaki：**  
Mistress Neneka! Are you unhurt?!  
  
**Neneka：**  
I'm certainly healthy enough to be irritated by your shouting.  
Masaki.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Omniscient Kaiser!  
Most of the monsters you were controlling are out of the picture now!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Sorry, but it's high time you gave up!  
  
**Yui：**  
I beg of you. Just don't hurt anyone anymore...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Your Majesty... I'm sorry.  
But...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You're out of pawns and out of escape routes!  
It's time to surrender!  
  
**Christina：**  
Argh, honestly... What a crowd.  
Have you all gathered to snatch away my moment of rapture?  
  
**Christina：**  
Then... you owe me one! Don't you forget it.  
I will make sure to claim this debt from each of you,  
in person and in full. You just wait.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Chris... You did well to hold out this long.  
I'm even inclined to thank you for once in my life.  
You have my gratitude.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Still... What's this Omniscient Kaiser's deal?  
Even that ridiculously strong Old Lady Christina  
has been beaten within an inch of her life!  
  
**Kaori：**  
We're all powered up right now too,  
but we've used up a lot of energy already.  
Can we really beat her without losing anyone?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Still, the Omniscient Kaiser has only just reawakened herself,  
and she's had to use tons of magic, too.  
This has got to be our best chance of beating her!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Now, surrender to us, Omniscient Kaiser!  
Sorry to outnumber you like this, but it's time to settle the score!  
  
`image display end`  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
*sigh*...  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
So with the power of friendship,  
you stamped out my monsters and Shadows,  
and now you've all arrived to face the big boss. Is that about right?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Yes, that's correct.  
With this many terminals depleted, your precious Astral Insight  
can no longer procure nearly enough data to maintain its precision.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Metamorph Monarch, Leaping King, Regina Geas...  
Three of the Seven Crowns. Plus Queen Labyrinth's Princess Knight,  
and a host of irritating insects swarming around me.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Even my trump card, Astral Insight, is almost fully disabled...  
...So, yes.  
I'll have to give up.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
H-huh?  
She gave up more easily than I expected...  
Th-then come with us and—  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Filthy girl.  
Don't you come near me, princess.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aaahhh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Honestly... Are you getting the wrong idea?  
I won't allow you to take me alive,  
and I still fully intend to slaughter every last one of you.  
  
**Rei：**  
Wh-what...?!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
It's just that thanks to those stubborn other Crowns,  
I've lost one of my biggest trump cards.  
So although it pains me,  
 I'm giving up on killing you the smart way.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
S-something about this feels really, really bad!  
She means every word of what she's saying!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Say, Neneka.  
I assume your intention was to keep me occupied with Christina...  
But too bad for you. You weren't the only one buying time.  
  
**Yui：**  
Wh-what now...?  
This area's...  
 No, this whole city's magical energy  
is flowing directly towards her...?!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
My monsters all lie defeated...  
And I doubt I'll be getting any more Shadows.  
So I suppose it's about time now.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Mana...?!  
Don't tell me you have yet another trump card in reserve?!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Mana"...  
 Yes, that's my name.  
And the energy that pours forth from defeated monsters and Shadows...  
Coincidentally enough, it also happens to be called "mana."  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
All of you people have experience hunting monsters  
and making use of their mana, don't you?  
Like a hunter devouring his victims' meat.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Well, right now, Landosol is brimming with mana from the Shadows  
and monsters you killed. Left alone, it would naturally disperse...  
But this city has always been in the palm of my hand.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
So... you see?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
...Sorry to butt in, guys!  
I don't like where this is going, so I'm going to attack  
before she tries anything else! Come on, Rino!  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh! R-right, Big Sis Shizuru!  
I'll fire off a whole barrage! Time flies like an arrow shower!  
Yah-yah! Yah-yah-yahhh!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Tch... True, there's no more time for talking!  
Let's go, Kaori!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Sure thing, Makoto!  
I'll give her the old Ryukyu-Ken Knuckle Cannon!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
C'mon, Kokkoro! Karyl!  
We should move in too!  
Full power! Princess—  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Wait!  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh?!  
O-okay!  
I can wait!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Haha... Ahahaha.  
Ahahahahah! A wise decision!  
But I'm afraid it's already far too late!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh...? Th-this energy is...?!  
Aaaaahhhh!  
  
**Rino：**  
Big Sis Shizuru!  
...Waaaaghhh!  
  
**Makoto & Kaori：**  
Aaarghhh!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Now... All lingering mana in the city of Landosol!  
Come to me!  
To the Omniscient Kaiser... Mana Senri!
