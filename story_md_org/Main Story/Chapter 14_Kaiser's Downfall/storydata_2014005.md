**Narration：**  
With the aid of Neneka, the Metamorph Monarch,  
the members of the Gourmet Guild have succeeded in escaping  
from the clutches of the Omniscient Kaiser for the moment...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I think this should be enough distance for now.  
Though with that Kaiser as our enemy, we can never be entirely safe...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, I think I'll go clean up the monsters around here.  
I need to vent some stress anyway!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's very kind...  
Thank you, Karyl.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Be careful, OK?  
`Tag 1`  
**Karyl：**  
H... hmph!  
As if I need the likes of you to tell me that, dummy!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...I mean, right now,  
I can barely even look you in the eye!  
Ugh, what's gotten into me? It was only a little... ...on the forehead!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl, you silly billy...  
...Ngh...! Owwww...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine, hang in there!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Are you OK?!  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
 I'm sorry.  
Once I let my guard down, my legs gave out beneath me...  
Owieeee...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
On closer inspection, you seem quite heavily wounded...  
I am terribly sorry that I did not notice sooner.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I will cast a healing spell right away.  
My lord, though I hate to impose, will you lend your strength?  
It would take some time to heal this with my energy alone...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Of course.  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
...I'm sorry, guys.  
I just caused trouble for you all again.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I know we'll be stronger if we all work together.  
In my head, I understand that, but...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
As soon as I saw the Kaiser's face,  
I could only think of one thing.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"If I defeat the Kaiser, it'll all be over.  
My mom, my dad,and everyone will be safe...  
I'll finally be able to go home…\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And suddenly, all I could see was the Kaiser's face in front of me.  
From there, I just swung my sword desperately,  
trying to carve a path forward...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But... in the end, I was no match at all.  
None of my attacks did a thing.  
I couldn't leave a scratch...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  If we fight together, I know we'll win.  
`Tag 4`  
**Pecorine：**  
Maybe... you're right.  
But... will I even be any help to all of you?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No, forget being helpful...  
When I see the Kaiser's face... I might lose control.  
Go charging off in a blind rage again...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If I'm being honest...  
I don't deserve all the kindness you give me.  
I'm really just holding you back...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine...  
It is not like you at all to say such things.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Is it not more your style to exclaim  
\"How crazy is that?!\"  
 and laugh it off,  
no matter how dire the ordeal?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
B-but...  
The Omniscient Kaiser  
 told me something just now...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That I'm lacking in brains... power... everything.  
That this country would have perished anyway, with me as a ruler.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Those words... I don't think I can totally deny them.  
No, worse. Somewhere deep down,  
I actually believe they're right on the mark.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I know sometimes I call you a weakling, {player}...  
But despite my Royal Equipment, I can't seem to accomplish  
a single thing. I'm the real weakling...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So please, guys...  
It's best if both of you just leave me behind and...  
Mmlmphh?!

Mlngh... mmgphh?  
Gmh... Gmhamhyl?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
It was about the size of my whole arm...  
How the heck did it all fit in there?  
Sometimes I wonder if your body is even of this world.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
M-mlphghh... Mm, that's good...! ♪  
Wait, forget that.  
Why did you...?!

**Karyl：**  
If you've been using your equipment's full strength against Her Majesty,  
you must be dying of hunger by now.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That was just a crusty old sandwich I found in a pile of rubble,  
but it beats eating raw monsters, right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, Karyl...  
  
**Karyl：**  
*sigh*... Geez.  
A few taunts from Her Majesty, and you lose all your confidence?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yes, you're stupid and selfish and single-minded.  
You get all touchy-feely, but never listen to a word anyone says.  
I tell you that every day, so shouldn't you be used to hearing it by now?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhhh...  
  
**Karyl：**  
But... you still came to rescue me.  
Even after I tried to kill you and threw all your trust in the trash.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...That's right.  
You've got tons of great qualities I could never copy.  
So... isn't that enough for you?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
B-but...!  
In the end, I'm just a hopeless weakling...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, you... dummy!  
If that's what you think, why not work to improve?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Look at me. I messed up big time! I've been the worst!  
If I don't believe people can improve themselves,  
what's even left for me?! I'd be better off dead!  
  
**Karyl：**  
So come on...  
Let's both change ourselves, Pecorine.  
You and me together.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, Karyl...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
W-waaaahhh!  
Karyl, Karyl, Karyyyyyl!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Guehh!  
Hey—quit trying to squeeze me to death!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
When you quit being prickly and talk all sweet like that...  
it fills my belly better than the toastiest of toasty sandwiches!  
Waaaahhhhh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl... *sniff*  
I am so, so glad we were able to save you...  
Hug... Big huuug... ♪  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Karyl~!  
**Choice: (6)**  Huuuug!  
`Tag 5`  
`Tag 6`  
**Karyl：**  
Mguehh!  
Not you two as well...!  
You're crowding...  
 no, crushing me! Get off already! It actually hurts!  
  
**Karyl：**  
And... hold on!  
{player}, get back! You're right in my face!  
Sorry, but I can't take this right now! My heart's gonna explode!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGGRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wahhh!  
A-a monster...!  
Just when the mood was getting nice...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A-ah, of course. This city is still mired in chaos.  
Alas, we do not have time for frivolities...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Geez... Listen up, you guys!  
I'll take care of all these pesky monsters for you!  
  
**Karyl：**  
So while I do, Pecorine, you can ask Koro to fill you in on the plan!  
Oh, and make sure she fixes all your wounds up, too!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGGRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Take that! And that!  
Get your dumb faces out of our city, stupid beasts!  
I'll blast you to pieces!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Aaghhhhh, geez!  
Just remembering it gets me antsy!  
I can still feel his scent, his warmth,  
 right here on my lips...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
It was my first ever kiss, too!  
But it was just on the forehead! That doesn't count, right?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh... ♪  
How lovely, Miss Karyl.  
You are finally back to your old lively self...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
U-um...  
Before you tell me all about this plan,  
I've got one little request...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Yeah?  
`Tag 7`  
**Pecorine：**  
So, um... I know I said this before, but I...  
I think I want to defeat the Kaiser a little bit *too* much.  
When we come face to face, I get carried away.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So... you've gotta help!  
I need you to order me!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
M-Miss Pecorine...?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You're my Gourmet Guild buddy...  
The one who saved my life...  
My most precious of friends...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And above all, you're my first love!  
I'm desperate to beat the Kaiser, but I want to please you just as much...  
So it has to be you!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If it's an order from you, I'm sure I can stick to it!  
Maybe that makes me an awful princess...  
 but I don't care!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This is for my mom and dad...  
For all this land's people...  
For the sake of defeating the Omniscient Kaiser...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And for all the tasty meals we still need to share together!
