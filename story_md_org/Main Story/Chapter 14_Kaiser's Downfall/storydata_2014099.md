# Interlude 16
As Muimi fights on alone, Octo comes to her rescue. He insists that it was a coincidence, but Muimi recalls their old days as partners. Though complaining all the while, Octo agrees to join the fray, and Muimi is thrilled to fight alongside him once more.
  
## Subtitle: Interlude 16
  
**Narration：**  
As {player} and his allies begin their counterattack,  
Muimi is still swinging her blade alone...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Take 'em down!  
Spiresbane Blade!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Muimi：**  
*pant* *pant*... I've taken care of a lot of the monsters,  
but my stamina is running out too!  
Guys, where did you all go...?!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Did we get split up in the chaos of battle?  
Or maybe isolating us from each other like this  
was one of Mana's traps?  
 Dammit...  
  
**???：**  
Ah... ahem...  
Hello~? Do you hear me?  
  
**Muimi：**  
...?!  
Wh-who's that?! Is this communication magic...?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
It's nice to meet you!  
I'm Tsumugi from Carmina!  
And you're, um...  
 Oh, yes! Miss Muimi, right?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Y-yeah, I am...?  
...Hmmm...  
This seems real suspicious...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I know this is sudden, but there's a wave of monsters incoming!  
Head south down that main street!  
You should be able to meet up with the oth—  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hmmm...  
 Oh, I get it!  
You're one of Mana's... the Kaiser's agents, aren't you?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Huh?  
O-of course not!  
Where did you get such a rude idea?!  
  
**Muimi：**  
I see your scheme!  
You're luring me towards the monsters!  
Well, too bad! I'm gonna run in the opposite direction!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
W-wait a minute!  
You have to listen to me!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Blah blah blah!  
I can't hear you!  
Blah blah blah!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Whoa—monsters?!  
Ugh... I-I'm out of energy to use the Spiresbane Blade!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Muimi：**  
O-owww...  
Wait, shoot...!  
  
**???：**  
Novem!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Muimi：**  
I-I'm saved...?  
But that whip... And that voice just now...!  
  
**Octo：**  
...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Octo!  
I knew it! It's you!  
And didn't you call me Novem just now...?!  
  
**Octo：**  
Uhhh... Did I really?  
Putting that aside. I see you're doing well, little Muimi.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hey...! I totally heard you call me Novem!  
Why did you switch back to Muimi?!  
  
**Octo：**  
Must be your imagination.  
After all, I only saved you by sheer coincidence.  
Oh dear, what bad luck.  
  
**Octo：**  
The whole palace suddenly collapsed.  
Luckily, I was out in the courtyard, so I thought,  
\"Great! This is my chance to skedaddle!\"  
 But just then...  
  
**Octo：**  
Captain Jun came charging through the rubble and found me.  
So we wound up rescuing all the other knights together...  
  
**Octo：**  
After that, she dragged me around the city fighting.  
Honestly, why didn't I run sooner?  
...  
Wait, why am I telling this to a random stray like you?  
  
**Muimi：**  
...Ahahah!  
Talking and running always were your strong points, weren't they?  
  
**Muimi：**  
But then, you never do run when it really matters.  
  
**Octo：**  
What do you know about me?  
Don't tell me you're still living in  
that fantasy where we used to be friends.  
  
**Jun：**  
Where've you gone, young Octo?  
Not deserting again, I hope!  
  
**Octo：**  
Guehh! It's the captain...  
  
**Jun：**  
...Oh...  
Never mind, then. I'm sorry.  
You were rescuing a citizen of your own accord? Most admirable.  
  
**Jun：**  
Young miss, can you walk?  
Here, I'll send my subordinate with you,  
so get out of the city with the other evacuees.  
  
**Muimi：**  
...No. You're wrong.  
I'm not some helpless evacuee.  
  
**Jun：**  
Hm?  
  
**Muimi：**  
I'm no evacuee... and Octo, I'm not your friend either.  
What I am...  
 is your partner!  
Closer than friends or family, and more precious! Together to the end!  
  
**Jun：**  
...Ahahah!  
Closer than family, you say!  
Isn't that wonderful, young Octo?  
  
**Octo：**  
Ueghh...? No, stop right there. Don't make me part of this.  
It sounds like even more of a pain than the fantasy friend thing.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Heheh. Well, look. Seconds ago, I was out of juice...  
But somehow now I feel full of energy again!  
That's gotta be 'cause I heard you say my name, Octo!  
  
**Octo：**  
Oh, please. That doesn't even make sense.  
How simple in the head are you, little Muimi?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
U-um...  
Sorry to butt in, or, well,  
 drop in from overhead, but...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Oh!  
Carmina girl!  
I'm sorry I doubted you back there! Really, I am!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
That's fine! This is a crisis!  
And if I get into arguments, Rei will probably be mad at me!  
Besides...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
That power boost you're feeling now  
is probably coming from {player}!  
I just took the opportunity to fill him in on your location!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Oh, really?  
 Then I guess I'd better thank him later!  
'Cause right now, I feel like I could beat up a hundred monsters!  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm... Young miss. We knights of Nightmare are also  
currently working with {player} and Carmina  
to eliminate the monsters from the city.  
  
**Jun：**  
So perhaps...  
If you wouldn't mind, could we join forces?  
Including your partner young Octo, of course.  
  
**Octo：**  
Whaaa~? C'mon, Captain...  
This girl's a civilian, and—  
  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah! I'm in! So in!  
Let's fight together, armor lady!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Tell you what—I'll keep an eye on Octo for you  
to make sure he doesn't slack off!  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha, that would be a great help.  
  
**Octo：**  
Oh, geez... My luck is the absolute worst lately.  
Guess I'll just have to take it out on some monsters.  
  
**Muimi：**  
That's the spirit, Octo!  
Don't you worry, I'll have your back the whole time! Partner!  
  
**Octo：**  
Yes, yes... You do that, \"partner.\"  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Jun：**  
Heheh... All right, knights of Nightmare!  
Everyone follow in their wake!  
  
**Jun：**  
We can't let these monsters...  
or above all, the Kaiser who deceived us...  
have their way with this city!  
  
**Knight 1：**  
Yessir!  
  
**Knight 2：**  
We'll follow you to the bitter end, Captain!  
  
**Jun：**  
We'll do everything we can to the best of our ability...  
So stay safe for me, young {player}.  
  
**Jun：**  
When this is over, I need to apologize for raising my sword against you,  
brainwashed or otherwise!
