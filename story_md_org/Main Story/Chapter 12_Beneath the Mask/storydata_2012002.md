## Subtitle: Performer's Pride
  
**Narration：**  
Amidst the festivities in the city,  
the members of Carmina, their tour around the continent complete,  
are holding a concert in Landosol to celebrate their return.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Everyone!  
 Thank you!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
And... boy, is it great  
 to be back home!  
  
**Chika：**  
Haha. It's such an honor to sing for you all again.  
No, it just makes me truly, deeply happy.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Yep, what she said! I'm afraid this next song will be our last today,  
but we'll be performing every day for the duration of the festival!  
  
**Chika：**  
So please, invite all your friends and come enjoy the show!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
We'd love it if you could cheer us on with smiles!  
We promise Carmina  
 will always be waiting for you,  
up on this shining stage!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Now, let's move on to our last song of the day!  
Chika, Tsumugi, are you ready?  
It's been a long and intense journey—you must be tired, right?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Not at all! In fact, I've got more energy than ever!  
I could go for one more...  
no, as many tours of the continent as you like!  
  
**Chika：**  
Agreed. Each place we visit fills me with such inspiration.  
I can feel the spirits' bliss, too... I finally understand what you  
always say, Nozomi. Everything seems to sparkle and shine.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ahaha. Chika, are you crying with joy?  
Those sparkles you're seeing are just the tears in your eyes, right?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Haha!  
 This is no time for crying, Chika!  
Let's stay idols to the end—true to ourselves—  
and put on the ultimate show! Today, tomorrow, and into the future!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
C'mon, guys! Follow me!  
  
**Chika：**  
Of course. No matter how far!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Yes! Do you need to even ask?!  
  
**Nozomi & Chika & Tsumugi：**  
Carmina, on stage!  
  
**Christina：**  
...Hmm. The crowd's hype has reached its peak.  
Nicely done, Carmina.  
Let me offer you a rare compliment from the heart.  
  
**Christina：**  
As your producer, I couldn't be prouder.  
...Dear me, for a mere temporary position,  
I'm getting far too serious about this.  
  
**Christina：**  
In another life, this could have been me. Not a fighter, blade in hand,  
spreading suffering and chaos, but a supporter, protecting and guiding  
shining stars down the road of peace...  
  
**Christina：**  
Almost like an ordinary woman.  
  
**Christina：**  
Still, I can't turn back now...  
The die has been cast, so I'll wait for its tumbling faces to settle.  
  
**Christina：**  
How are things going with the castle invasion  
and Novem's distraction, I wonder?  
Everything's ready here, so hurry up and reach the meeting point.  
  
**Christina：**  
The airship Carmina used on their tour of the continent  
is ready and waiting for you.  
  
**Christina：**  
As soon as everyone is assembled, it can leave at any time.  
We can retreat to my homeland for now.  
  
**Christina：**  
Depending on the outcome,  
we may have to wait things out there before we return.  
  
**Christina：**  
That's the gist of the plan.  
Honestly, reducing me to a mere getaway driver?  
What is this world coming to?  
  
**Christina：**  
Still... Our foe is \"Her Majesty\" Eustiana.  
The members of Nightmare who serve as her army  
are, of course, old comrades of mine,  
 so I am loath to fight them.  
  
**Christina：**  
No... If I found myself in combat and failed to fight them,  
not only would it ruin the plan,  
I would never be able to forgive my own weakness.  
  
**Christina：**  
That's why I offered to handle this sideline work instead.  
Actually, I suppose I merely ran away.  
Dear me, Christina, were you always such a coward?  
  
**Christina：**  
It's so shameful, I can't even laugh.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hmmm?  
Is it just me, or is our producer looking kind of glum?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Try as we might to hide it, I guess we are all  
worn out and stretched to our limits.  
 Not that we'd ever show it...  
At least, not anywhere where our fans might see.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But that producer's a special case.  
 Does she see right through us?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Looking closer,  
there are some people in the crowd who seem oddly detached, too...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
This concert is just one of the festival attractions, after all.  
It's not like everyone's here specifically for us.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Of course there'd be people  
who aren't all that interested in watching our performance...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But we should really be aiming to put on such a great performance  
that they'll become our fans, too!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
We have the power to do that!  
 We're Carmina!  
After a massive tour like this, I almost got complacent,  
but it looks like we still have plenty of room to grow!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I can't lose focus if I want to become a true top idol!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Thanks to Christina,  
we managed to put on a tour beyond anything the world has seen...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
We can't let her skills slip through our fingers,  
so we've got to be careful not to disappoint her.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
First, I'd better perform  
with every last bit of energy I've got for this last song!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Three seconds left... Two... One... And done!  
Finish with a smile  
 and a peace sign! ☆
