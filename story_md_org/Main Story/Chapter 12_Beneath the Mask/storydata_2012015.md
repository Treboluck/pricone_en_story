## Subtitle: Return of the Kaiser
  
**Narration：**  
Awakening from their mysterious dream,  
{player} and his friends are shocked by the state  
of the palace around them.  
  
**Narration：**  
The whole building is rumbling violently,  
and as the walls begin to crumble,  
a strange black sludge is pouring in through the cracks.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
{player}!  
Wake up, wake up, you sleepyhead!  
This is bad!  
 I might have to wake you up with a big sis kiss! ☆  
  
**Rino：**  
Hey! No fair, Big Sis!  
 That's clearly a little sister's job!  
But no time for arguing—  
this really is an emergency!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Mmnhh?  
 H-huh?  
Was I asleep just now?  
  
**Rino：**  
You sure were! When Big Bro got close to that Karyl girl,  
for some reason even you and Kokkoro  
suddenly fell fast asleep beside him!  
  
**Rino：**  
All of you were out for the count for a minute!  
We were worried! We thought you might be dead!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ummm...?  
 Oh, where's Karyl?!  
Did she come back to her senses OK?  
  
**Karyl：**  
...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Looks like she hasn't woken up yet.  
Well, if she's asleep, she can't fire off any attacks...  
So I guess she's safe from destroying her own body, at least...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But I'm worried.  
Did we really manage to help her like we were trying to...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
M-mmnh...  
More pressingly, what is this rumbling?  
This room is filling with some manner of black sludge...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh—Kokkoro!  
And {player}... You're both awake, huh?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes... I heard most of what you were saying.  
It seems that thanks to Lady Ameth's guidance,  
we all fell asleep and briefly entered the same dream.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We saw Miss Karyl's memories...  
and attempted to sway her heart with our words, until suddenly,  
I think this rumbling must have reawoken us.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Makes it pretty hard to say for sure if we managed to save her...  
I'd love to go back in the dream and talk to Karyl a lot more  
until we've gotten her fully convinced, but....  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahhh! What was that explosion?!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But that's...!  
So that voice really was you, wasn't it?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The source of all evil who stole my life!  
The false Eustiana!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
You can have that name back. I won't be needing it anymore.  
Unlike you, my dear, I was never suited  
to a sweet title such as \"Princess\" anyway.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I am this world's absolute ruler, Mana Senri.  
No,  
 let me call myself the Omniscient Kaiser.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I'm impressed by your efforts. I didn't expect this level of resistance.  
Now I'll have to redo my calculations, adjust my plan, and start afresh.  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
I won't let anyone stop me.  
This game is over, my dear fools.
