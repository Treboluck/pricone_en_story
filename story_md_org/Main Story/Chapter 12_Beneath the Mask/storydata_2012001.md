## Subtitle: Omens of Turmoil
  
**Narration：**  
While the streets of Landosol are alive with festivities  
and a deadly battle rages on in the palace...  
  
**Narration：**  
In the ancient castle that serves as a base for the guild Diabolos,  
Shinobu and Miyako are struggling with a different enemy: boredom.  
  
**Miyako：**  
So bored... Boredy-boredy-boredy booooored!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Maybe it was a bad idea listening to Shinobu...  
Miyako should have gone to the festival after all.  
Even if it is a boring festival with no pudding-selling stalls...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ohhh... Now that Miyako said pudding, Miyako wants pudding...  
Pudding, pudding, pudding...  
Miyako is hungry! Where's pudding to eat?!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Somehow Shinobu's funny floaty daddy  
is starting to look like pudding...  
White and super creamy-looking...  
 *drool*... ♪  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Hey! Stop that!  
Get those hungry eyes off me!  
Being eaten alive—or dead—ain't my thing at all!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Haha.  
You'll get a nasty tummyache if you eat that, Miyako.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Uh, darling?! That's how you react to your daddy getting eaten?!  
Can't you worry about me?!  
Don't you care if I get turned into cute pudding ghost food?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I suppose I do.  
But Miyako is just starved for stimulation,  
so keep her entertained... Father.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I'm focusing on this fortune, so I can't deal with her right now.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hmmm?  
You sure love fortunes, Shinobu!  
Maybe even as much as Miyako loves pudding! ♪  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Heavens, no.  
Your love for pudding is the strongest love in the world.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Yaaaay! Miyako got compliments!  
Praise Miyako more and more! Miyako likes this feeling! ☆  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Kids are so easy to please...  
Ahh, I remember when a little praise from Daddy  
would make my sweet Shinobu happy too...  
  
**Miyako：**  
There, there.  
No crying, Mr. Daddy. Miyako will cheer you up! ♪  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Heyyy! Get those pudding-smeared hands off me!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Heheh~! ♪  
 Mr. Daddy, did Shinobu always love telling fortunes?  
That would be just like Miyako!  
Miyako's loved pudding more than anything since Miyako was born!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Hmm... Truth is, since Shinobu was a tiny little thing,  
she could always see stuff other people couldn't.  
So she couldn't help but learn about that kinda stuff.  
  
**Miyako：**  
That's good then!  
Because that's why Shinobu can talk to Miyako and Mr. Daddy!  
More friends for Shinobu! Shiny happy life~! ♪  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Hahah. Y'know, meeting someone as positive as you  
really must've been a big help to her...  
Keep on being a good friend to my daughter, you hear?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ahahah! Mr. Daddy is talking serious talk! That's too funny!  
Miyako is always Shinobu's bestest friend without asking!  
Dead or alive or even after reborning! ♪  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Shhh...  
Both of you, could you be quiet a moment?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Wh-what's the matter?  
Shinobu looks scarier than usual...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Sh-Shinobu wants pudding?  
Eating pudding makes faces all smiley!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
No...  
It seems we may not have time to be eating sweet treats.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Recently, a dark omen has been appearing in my readings,  
and it's growing clearer and clearer...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
A ghastly darkness,  
spreading at unearthly speed across the city of Landosol...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
This is a very bad omen.  
I came to this castle to shelter from the danger,  
but now I fear inaction will only hasten its path of destruction.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Wh-what does that all mean?  
Miyako doesn't understand complicated stuff!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I have a bad feeling that we should investigate.That's what it means.  
Miyako, can you wake Illya for me?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I'll try to get in touch with Yori and Akari.  
Let's all come together and try to prepare  
for whatever terrors may be in store.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
If we don't take action, I'm sure this will not end well for us.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ooh! A rare full meeting of Miyako and the Pudding People!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
A meeting of Diabolos.  
Please don't rename our guild on a whim.  
That would be too cruel  
 to Illya, who named it originally.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Urghhh...  
 Dee-abbles is too hard to say!  
Miyako thinks Pudding People is much better!  
Sounds tastier and deliciouser!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I think that's enough messing around. Let's hurry, Miyako.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Messy and round?!  
 Like pudding!  
Ahahaha! ☆  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ahh! Shinobu's face went all scary again!  
OK, don't get mad! Serious time now!  
Miyako can be serious, honest!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I'm not angry with you.  
This is just the face I was born with. Right, Father?  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Nah, back when you were little,  
you were a proper angel with a sweet face to match.  
I swear it's true.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
I've still got all the photos, so I'll dig 'em out later.  
The cute things you used to say, too!  
You even said you were gonna marry Daddy when you grew up! ♪  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Uh-oh. My little angel is about to turn into a demon beyond measure,  
so I oughtta get moving too.  
I do feel like there's something nasty on the horizon...
