**Muimi：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
Firing off my Spiresbane Blade this many times is tough!  
Quit dodging, Yui Kusano! I'll put you out of your misery in one blow!  
  
**Rei：**  
I don't think so!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Stop it already! This is meant to be a happy festival!  
You can't ruin it like this!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Who's that? I recognize her... A beastgirl named Hiyori, right?  
The others are Yui's friend, and... was her name Muimi?  
That girl who Octo was after?  
  
**Makoto：**  
The heck's the situation here?  
Why is that Muimi girl fighting Yui and the others?  
  
**Muimi：**  
You're the ones who should give it up! Quit getting in my way!  
That girl... Yui Kusano is the whole problem!  
You've just forgotten what she did to you!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Urgh...! Quit saying things that don't make any sense!  
  
**Rei：**  
This is going nowhere.  
If we let you rampage any longer, the damage will grow too large.  
  
**Rei：**  
I don't want to harm a child like you.  
Please put away your blade while we can still stop this.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hahahaha! Don't hold back. I didn't ask you to be nice!  
If you want to stop me, you'll have to slice my limbs off!  
  
**Muimi：**  
That's right—in this world, you can do that if you try!  
Blood can flow, people can starve, and death means death!  
You're the one who made it that way, Yui Kusano!  
  
**Muimi：**  
You sold your soul to the devil to save a single life!  
Turned our peaceful heaven into a hell with no escape,  
and condemned everyone to eternal torment!  
  
**Yui：**  
Wh-what do you mean?  
What do you know about me that I don't?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Heeeey! Who's causing this nyasty mess?!  
My stall got blown to smithereens!  
And I didn't even reach my sales target for today yet!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh—hey, Tama! Help us out here!  
We need to tie this girl up or stop her somehow!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Whoa, Hiyori! Long time nyo see!  
I know you love adventuring, but you could try attending  
Menagerie get-togethers once in a while, too!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Aha, sorry... Adventuring's just so much fun...  
But wait, this is no time for chitchat!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Is this... the beastfolk quarter?  
Did that wild scramble of a battle take us all the way here?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
This is our chance!  
I have lots of friends around here,  
so I'm sure they'll pitch in to help!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Beastfolk always repay favors!  
Your rampage ends here,  
 ummm...  
 Novem!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Christina!  
Thanks a ton—you came to help me?!  
  
**Christina：**  
No need to look so thrilled.  
It's not as though I rushed here to help a comrade in need.  
  
**Christina：**  
You're just lucky!  
In all my life, I have never acted in anyone's interests but my own!  
  
**Christina：**  
I happened to be guiding  
the Carmina girls away from that black goop  
when I heard the sound of thrilling conflict, so I came to investigate!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Black goop?  
 Guehh! What is that stuff?!  
Some kind of black sludge is sweeping across the city!  
  
**Muimi：**  
The heck? What's going on, Christina?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Whyever should I know?  
It seems to be formed from a mass of molten Shadows,  
but aside from that...  
  
**Christina：**  
I really couldn't say.  
It seems to be alive, but it doesn't respond to words, that's for sure.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huaaarghh!  
This fight's far from over!  
I've still gotta pay you back for what you did!  
  
**Kaori：**  
That's right! You trampled all over our Caon home  
and hurt our friends and family!  
Some of them were crying! I won't forgive you for that!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ugh, please. That's enough!  
I'd love to play with you all, but this is hardly the time!  
To me, Novem! Let us leave this place with haste!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Huh? R-right...!  
  
**Christina：**  
A-hup!  
 Heavens, you're light. Still just a kid, eh?  
I'll carry you off across the rooftops  
and meet up with Carmina outside the city!  
  
**Makoto：**  
And you think I'm gonna let you just get away?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Makoto!  
I don't knyow why, but that sludge is surging this way, and fast!  
We've gotta get everyone to safety!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I dunno what that stuff is, but it gives me a nyasty feeling...  
If the kids helping out at the stalls got caught up in it,  
I don't knyow what I'd tell their parents!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Urgh... I guess this is no time for fighting!  
But you're not off the hook, Christina!  
Someday, I'm gonna give you what's coming to you!  
  
**Christina：**  
I look forward to it.  
...  
Let's move, Novem. Careful not to bite your tongue!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Wh-whoa! Watch how you carry me!  
I'm not gonna ask you to treat me like a princess, but still!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ahhh! Is that really you, old lady Christina?!  
Where've you been this whole time?!  
The other Nightmare guys have been worried about you!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah, little Matsuri! Long time no see!  
You can pass the captain and Tomo a message from me—  
Christina is still living a fine and stimulating life!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Tell them yourself, why don't you?!  
Actually, you oughtta come back already!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
When you're not around, everyone gets all stiff and awkward!  
It doesn't feel right!  
  
**Christina：**  
...I see.  
Hahah...  
 I suppose nobody can truly live a life of solitude.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Christina!  
Sorry, can I butt in?  
  
**Muimi：**  
It looks like that weird black sludge is flowing towards the palace...  
Something might be going down there!  
  
**Muimi：**  
I'm worried about {player} and the others,  
so we should head there too!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm.  
You can be surprisingly astute. Good girl.  
So be it, then! I would hate to miss out on a climactic battle!  
  
**Christina：**  
To the palace! Our finale awaits!  
I am sick to death of letting unexplained mysteries rule my life!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah!  
This is our chance to seize our happy ending!
