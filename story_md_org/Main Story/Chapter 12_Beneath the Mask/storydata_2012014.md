## Subtitle: Back to Those Days
  
**Karyl：**  
Koro...  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's no use. I can't take back what I've done.  
How can I ever make up for it?  
I repaid all that love by trying to kill you all!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Because you were brainwashed.  
None of that was your fault, Karyl.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Besides, you scream death threats at us all the time,  
 but take a look!  
Not one of us has kicked the bucket!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Since we're all still alive, there's nothing to worry about!  
We'll just laugh it off again as one of your jokes,  
 Karyl! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
But I'm telling you, it never was a joke!  
I only got close to you to kill you!  
You're the ones who confounded me into becoming friends!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's right.  
No matter how it happened, we're friends now, aren't we?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No matter what you planned to begin with.  
It doesn't makeall those happy days we spent together any less real.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Our bonds, the love we found, is no dream or illusion.  
It's right here, safe inside my heart.  
Don't you have it there in your heart, too?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If not, that's a little sad.  
No, I guess I'm the one who should apologize...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You were hurting this whole time,  
and I never realized. I'm so sorry.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I was causing you pain without even realizing it.  
I'm sorry, Karyl. I know you're still only young.  
As the oldest one here, I should have taken better care of you.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm really sorry.  
I hope you can forgive me, Karyl...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Why are *you* saying sorry? This is totally backwards.  
Just how much of a princess can you be?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heheh.  
Well, I can't help that. I was born a princess, after all.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And I'm sure you, too, just made a few mistakes  
because your life wasn't easy.  
We all know you're really a kind girl who's more than capable of love.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's why we all love you so much in return.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I know Kokkoro already said this,  
but that's why we want you back at our table.  
We want to share so many more happy memories together.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You feel the same way, don't you, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Yeah. I love Karyl too!  
`Tag 1`  
**Karyl：**  
\"Love\"?! Don't use that word so lightly...  
I told you this once already, or did you forget?  
Loving a girl like me will only get you hurt.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You weirdos... I don't get it at all.  
You're all total nutjobs who only care about eating.  
So how... how did I end up caring about you all so much?  
  
**Karyl：**  
If only you were like the others...  
Like all the other people who hurt me...  
Dirty, underhanded, irritating lowlifes who I could easily hate!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Why'd you of all people have to be such good guys?  
At that point, even I couldn't help but like you, could I?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Is it really OK for the likes of me...?  
To be loved, cared for, happy with other people?  
Me, who not even my own mom and dad managed to love?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
But you guys want to love me? Why?  
I don't get it. Not one bit of it... It doesn't make any sense!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh...!  
That felt like a remarkably large shockwave!  
What could it mean?

**Pecorine：**  
I... I don't really know...  
But if you keep standing there, you might fall!  
Come over here to us, Karyl!  
  
**Karyl：**  
B-but...!  
I... I can't...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No buts! Come on, quick! I'm grabbing your hand!  
Tell me if you want me to stop!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-wha...? Why are you always like this?!  
You never stop for a moment to think, do you?!  
Can't you think about how I feel?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm sorry!  
I'll try to be better, but for now, please just grab on to my hand!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't let yourself slip away!  
Stay with us, please... Karyl!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Our beloved Karyl!  
You have to come back to where you belong!
