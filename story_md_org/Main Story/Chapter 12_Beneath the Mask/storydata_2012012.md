## Subtitle: All That I Needed
  
**Narration：**  
In the end, Karyl finds herself heading back to the palace  
with more rice balls than she can carry.  
Hauling such a massive weight, she almost appears to be wounded.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...  
  
**Karyl：**  
*sigh*...  
Another day where all I managed to do was eat a friendly meal.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm supposed to be a spy and assassin...  
Why am I getting so close to them?  
  
**Karyl：**  
But... when I'm with them, the whole world seems to sparkle...  
It's so blinding, I almost find myself losing sight of my actual goal.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I can't keep putting it off forever. It has to end sometime.  
The longer I wait and drag this thing out,  
the more hellish it's going to be...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Even though I'm the one who's going to betray them...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I hate this...  
Why've I gotta be the one to live a life as awful as this?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Welcome home, Karyl.  
You're rather late again today.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ah... Y-Your Majesty! I'm very sorry!  
It took me longer than expected to slip away from the Gourmet Guild!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Ohhh...?  
The \"Gourmet Guild,\" hmm? A guild devoted to eating, was it?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
How ridiculous.  
There must be more productive ways they could use their time.  
The common folk always lead such empty lives.  
  
**Karyl：**  
R-right...  
Um, it's rare to see you in the throne room  
outside of official hours, Your Majesty!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Do you have work to do?  
Is there anything I could help you with?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
You...? Help me with my work?  
You overestimate yourself, Karyl.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ah...  
 I-I'm sorry, Your Majesty!  
That was presumptuous of me!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Well, no matter.  
 Just remember your place.  
 I am the god who rules  
this world, and you a stray cat I plucked from the street.  
If you irritate me,  
 I'll crush you underfoot.  
  
**Karyl：**  
O-of course.  
I am quite aware of that. Please forgive my insolence.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
...Say, girl. Do you smell food in here?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh... I'm very sorry!  
I just ate with the members of the Gourmet Guild as usual,  
but there was too much food, so I brought some leftovers back with me!  
  
**Karyl：**  
A-a few rice balls, that's all.  
Would you like to try one?  
You never seem to eat much, Your Majesty, so I worry about you...  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Well, it's all just data, isn't it?  
The satisfaction it brings is an illusion. I hardly see much point.  
Besides, I was never fond of consuming foreign matter to begin with.  
  
**Karyl：**  
O-oh...  
I'm sorry. I suppose I was being presumptuous again.  
  
**Karyl：**  
This rice is so delicious, I hoped Her Majesty would like it...  
That's why I made so many rice balls, but...  
Maybe I shouldn't have bothered. Ahaha...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I should have known she'd react like this.  
What am I even trying to achieve?  
  
**Karyl：**  
But Your Majesty... You always look so bored by everything...  
Like the whole world irritates you...  
Just once, I hoped I could make you smile...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Long ago, when my life was empty,  
and I was full of hate for the world around me,  
you were the one who gave me hope...  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Karyl...  
 I changed my mind.  
Pass me one of those rice balls, would you?  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Huh?  
Are you actually going to eat one, Your Majesty?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Yes.  
You always seem so happy eating those things...  
I feel like reminding myself what the sensation was like.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Just a whim of curiosity.  
If you don't have any to spare, I'll happily go without.  
It's not as though I feel particularly hungry.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh—not at all!  
 Please, go ahead! They're very good.  
We harvested and prepared the rice ourselves! Then we cooked it  
to perfection, and stuffed them with the tastiest of fillings!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Is all this fuss necessary? You strange girl.  
Just hand over the food, would you?  
  
**Karyl：**  
O... of course!  
Here you go! Please enjoy! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Eheheh.  
How is it? Pretty good, right?  
We made them while the rice was freshly cooked, so they're still warm!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Oh, be quiet.  
You're irritating me, Karyl.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahh!  
I'm very sorry! I got carried away again...!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
It's fine. I was raised to treat each meal of the day  
as a swift and solitary affair, you see.  
So I find it off-putting to have others address me while I eat, that's all.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahaha.  
 I was the same way.  
I always used to eat my meals on my own...  
  
**Karyl：**  
My parents were always busy with work,  
so I'd just grab  
 a ready-made meal from the nearest store.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh... I don't mean to imply that we're the same, of course!  
In your case, I'm sure it's a matter of... noble manners?  
Or something along those lines!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Mm, yes.  
My life was always bound by these tiresome rules and traditions...  
Perhaps that's why I longed to be free.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
I wanted a life where I could celebrate my own passions,  
surrounded by the things I truly loved.  
Yes... That was all I really wanted, to begin with...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Um... Your Majesty...?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Haha. Forget it. I didn't say anything.  
I'll have this rice ball now.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Mmhh... Oh, is this a pickled plum inside?  
I've never liked sour flavors.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh... In that case,  
 this one has fish flakes! Do you like them?  
Here, I'll take the pickled plum one! Have this one instead!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yes, I'll happily eat this one myself! *munch munch*  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Do you have no manners?  
You shouldn't consume half-eaten food. Throw it away.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? But that would be such a shame!  
Now that I know how much work goes into the rice,  
I'd hate to waste a single grain...  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Ridiculous...  
...  
Oh my, this really is rather good.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I know, right?! Eheheh!  
Man, maybe all that hard work really was worth it!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Oh, please. Since when are you so excitable?  
...You really are a very strange girl.
