## Subtitle: Mystery of the Seven Crowns
  
**Kokkoro：**  
\"Seven Crowns\"...  
That name sounds... strangely familiar somehow.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I recognize it too.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm?  
My lord, you have heard this term before?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see...  
So when you faced the woman known as Eustiana,  
it was among the things she mentioned?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In fact, she even asked  
the exact same question we were just presented with?  
Whether you had heard of the Seven Crowns before?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I see...  
In that case...  
There may be more truth to my concerns than I would like.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
In this world...  
It seems there exist seven superhuman entities  
able to wield miracles approaching the divine.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
They are the \"Seven Crowns.\" Seven people shrouded in mystery.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Though I have only heard this from a certain someone  
who claims to be among their number.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
To be frank, I still find it difficult to believe  
that such people could actually exist.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hm?  
Who is this \"certain someone\"?  
  

---  
  
**Shinobu：**  
That is the main topic I wish to discuss.  
She is the very person who predicted the advent  
of that spell of mass destruction.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
My own talents were telling me that danger was on the horizon...  
But it was she who contacted me  
to provide a more specific warning.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
A mysterious individual who claims to be one of the Seven Crowns...  
I know not if it is her real name, but she calls herself Neneka.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Outwardly, she is no older than me, or perhaps even younger.  
No more than a sweet, young girl.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
But the way she carries herself...  
She seems more assured than her appearance would suggest.  
Almost mystical... Wise beyond her years.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
She runs a kind of research institution not far from here,  
and we have done business with her in the past.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
She asks us to gather materials for her—rare plants and minerals.  
Not the strangest of jobs, so we usually accepted.  
In return for our services, she offered us valuable information.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
It seems she possesses a great deal of knowledge,  
and can perform feats that would normally be impossible.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
For instance, she can deconstruct and reconstruct her own body,  
transfiguring herself into a completely different form.  
  

---  
  
**Illya：**  
Indeed!  
She seemed particularly fond of this transformation trick.  
  
**Illya：**  
When she learned of my body's ability to shift its age,  
she bombarded me with no end of questions!  
  
**Illya：**  
Incidentally,  
there are ancient documents in this castle  
that also make mention of these \"Seven Crowns.\"  
  
**Illya：**  
They are filled with gaps, and I cannot decipher all of their contents.  
But in one such document, I did find the name  
\"Neneka\" listed among the Crowns.  
  
**Illya：**  
It was written in a strange and unwieldy hand, but these characters  
meaning \"twice-imitated flower\"...  
They do seem to be pronounced \"Neneka.\"

**Illya：**  
Behold, this is the document of which I speak.  
Examine it closely.  
  
**Illya：**  
There are other names here I was able to decipher.  
\"Akira\"... \"Mana\"... \"Rajnikanth\"... \"Christina\"...  
  
**Illya：**  
By the way, this name \"Mana\" in particular  
apparently refers to Eustiana.  
Though again, we only have young Neneka's word for this.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm? Did you just say \"Christina\"?  
You don't mean... *that* Christina?  
  
**Illya：**  
Hm?  
You know someone by that name, do you?  
  
**Illya：**  
Of course, it's hardly an unusual name...  
So I could not say for sure  
if there is really a connection.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmmmm...  
Now that you mention it, I think \"that man\"  
might have called Christina one of the Seven Crowns...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And this \"Rajnikanth\"...  
Isn't he that man we saw in the weird outfit?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I do not know what you are referring to...  
But at any rate, the one who truly foretold the disaster  
was not I, but Neneka.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
So I suspect you'd do better to ask her about it than me.  
She seems to be quite the important figure, after all.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
There is only one way to reach her laboratory—  
through a warp gate right here in this castle.  
That is why I invited you all here.  
  
`image display end`  
**Shinobu：**  
But I'm afraid only Illya has the power to activate that gate.  
So I was hoping to ask for your permission, Illya.  
  
**Illya：**  
Ahhh...  
That gate is rather unstable,  
so I would much rather leave it alone...  
  
**Illya：**  
But if it's for {player}, how can I refuse?  
Especially after he was so kind as to calm Miyako for us.  
If it is truly necessary, I will gladly open the gate.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Necessary, huh...  
I do feel like getting in touch with this Neneka  
is our best shot at learning what we need to know.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Thank you for your helpful advice, everyone!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Think nothing of it.  
All of us owe {player} this much, at the very least.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Besides which,  
I sense that you all have a great mission to fulfill.  
That you stand at the very center of a great vortex of fate.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Your path may prove to be of great importance  
to each and every person in this world.  
So if we can help you in any way, it would be an honor.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
We cannot allow any more tragedies to occur.  
When I heard what happened to the farm, I was filled with regret.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
If only I had shared my knowledge of the future...  
If only I had given them better warning...  
  
**Illya：**  
That can scarcely be called your responsibility.  
Still, that said,  
it would indeed be best to avoid more tragedy.  
  
**Illya：**  
Peace and joy are better for this world than sorrow and suffering.  
That is a sure conclusion I have reached in my many, many years.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm?  
Is something the matter, Kokkoro?  
You're looking a bit paler than usual...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
N-no...  
I am quite all right. Do not worry.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Whatever could this mean?  
Among the names in that document...  
the names of the Seven Crowns... one is all too familiar.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This is the name... of the Elder.  
The name of... my very own father.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It is far from a common name,  
so I cannot see how this could be mere coincidence.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Come to think of it,  
if the Christina listed here  
really is the same woman who attacked Caon...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I recall she had... a strange reaction when she saw me.  
Could it be related to the possibility  
that my father is one of the Seven Crowns?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
There were concerning elements in the wisdom  
Lady Ameth bestowed upon me in the temple, as well...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What is this feeling?  
Somehow my whole body feels unsettled.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Pat Kokkoro on the head.  
**Choice: (3)**  Ask Kokkoro if she's okay.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh... Wh-what brings this on, my lord?  
Please do not caress my head so suddenly...  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Ahh? I am sorry... Did you say something, my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My deepest apologies. I was so lost in thought just now,  
I neglected to hear your words.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Heheh...  
There is no need for concern. I am quite all right.  
I think perhaps I am a little tired out, that is all.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Still, rest at ease.  
I am always ready to protect you.  
I will do whatever it takes to keep you safe from harm.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Even if, in the days ahead...  
Some terrible truth is waiting to confront me...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The days I spent together with you, my lord...  
The warmth and security I feel by your side...  
Nothing can take these things from me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The bond we share won't just disappear.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Isn't that right, my lord?
