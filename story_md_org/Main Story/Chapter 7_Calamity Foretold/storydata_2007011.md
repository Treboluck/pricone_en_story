### Place: Underground Labyrinth
  
**Miyako：**  
Ooh?  
Guys, be quiety-down for a minute...  
Miyako thinks something funny is hiding near here...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Yes...  
I can sense a worrying sort of presence.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I hear footsteps nearby.  
Is somebody approaching our location?  
  
**Illya：**  
This magical signature...  
I think our unwanted visitors must be monsters.  
  
**Illya：**  
Neneka stations monsters of her own creation  
around this entire area as an extra defense mechanism.  
  
**Illya：**  
She must have detected our unexpected arrival,  
and sent her minions to dispose of the intruders.  
  
**Illya：**  
Irritatingly enough, it has always been her style  
to attack first and ask questions later.  
  
**Yori：**  
I'll take the front lines!  
  
**Akari：**  
I'll help out, too!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You seem pretty used to this...  
Do you get attacked every time you come and visit this lab?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Just now...  
Did she say something about \"monsters of her own creation\"?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Can people really \"create\" monsters?  
Hmmm... Maybe it's just a metaphor...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord.  
Please position yourself behind me.  
As always, I will protect you.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Thanks for always doing this.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll fight too!  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh no—no need for thanks.  
It is my proud duty to keep my lord safe at all costs.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Haha.  
I appreciate the offer, and am proud of your courage...  
But your talents lie elsewhere.  
 I ask that you leave the combat to me.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
And Miss Pecorine—fighting with that equipment  
drains your energy greatly, yes?  
Let us handle this, so that you may conserve your stamina.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm... Well, it is a bit cramped down here.  
It might be difficult for all of us to fight at once,  
so I'll stay out of the way.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If I see you guys are in trouble, I'll leap in to help, though!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I should hope we will not fall into crisis so easily.  
 ...Hmm?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Are those things... really monsters?  
Their forms are like nothing I have ever seen before...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Yes.  
These are a highly unusual breed of monster  
seen only around this laboratory.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Created by artificial means, and used for research...  
Most noticeably, their bodies are formed  
from the parts of multiple monsters.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hang on...  
Wasn't someone talking about monsters like that before?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Right, we heard about them at Elizabeth Park!  
Could those strange monsters spotted near the farm  
have been runaways that escaped from this laboratory?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Hmm... Neneka is a very meticulous person,  
so I find it hard to imagine she would allow her monsters  
to escape so easily...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
But there is something odd about all this.  
The monster population here seems greater than usual, too.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
And what's more, they're acting in an uncoordinated manner.  
It looks like they're biting and scratching one another...  
Almost as though they've resorted to cannibalism.  
  
**Yori：**  
Urghh...  
I can't stand grotesque stuff like that...  
  
**Akari：**  
C'mon now, sis, don't look away!  
Even the creepiest things can be cute if you look at them  
with love in your heart!

**Illya：**  
Remember, we need not exterminate the beasts entirely.  
Let us merely carve a path through their ranks!  
  
**Illya：**  
This entire tunnel is filled with the pests.  
Fighting every last one would take us all day!  
  
**Illya：**  
Urghh... With my magic reserves empty,  
I feel horribly powerless in situations like this.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Eheheh.  
Let's take it easy breezy! *munch munch*  
  
**Illya：**  
Miyako...  
Did you bring your half-eaten pudding to the field of battle?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
A little more caution would be nice...  
Our guild isn't exactly specialized in heavy combat,  
so we don't want to draw this out.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Let's head for our destination as quickly as we can  
while avoiding any injuries.  
  
`image display end`  
**Skullfather：**  
Hey you, creepy monsters!  
You'd better not lay a single claw on my daughter!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Settle down, Father.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
This is a chaotic battle.  
If we go too wild with our attacks,  
we might end up hitting one another.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. No matter how many monsters we defeat,  
more appear to replace them.  
At this rate, we may never make any headway.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ummm... Miyako, was it?  
I need you to give me some of that pudding!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Huh?  
No ways. This is Miyako's pudding.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha...  
I'll make mountains of it for you later, so please!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Mnghh... You promise, OK?  
Breaking promises with ghosts is very scary!  
I'll haunt your bed and mutter \"evil pudding thief\" every night!  
  
**Miyako：**  
...Okies then. Just a little bite.  
Here, say \"ahhhh!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhhh! ♪  
*munch munch*  
 Mmmm, that's the energy boost I needed!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Everyone, get behind me for a moment!  
I'm gonna let loose and break through their ranks!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Here I go!  
Hiyaaaaaahhhh! ☆
