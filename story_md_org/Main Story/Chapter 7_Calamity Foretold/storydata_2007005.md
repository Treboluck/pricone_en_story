## Subtitle: Castle of Outcasts
  
### Place: Ancient Castle
  
**Akari：**  
Ooh, aaahhh...!  
I'm so worn out, I'm going weak in the knees~!  
  
**Yori：**  
H-how do you manage to make everything sound so dirty?!  
Honestly, sis!  
  
**Akari：**  
If it sounds dirty to you,  
that's probably because you have a dirty mind!  
  
**Yori：**  
I-I'm not dirty like you...  
{player}, are you guys okay?  
Do you need to take a break?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, we're fine!  
But what are we doing in a dungeony-looking place like this?  
Is this really where we're going to find the fortune-teller?  
  
**Yori：**  
Umm... The truth is...  
Due to some unique circumstances,  
our guild kind of made this castle its base of operations.  
  
**Yori：**  
I mean, most of the time, we just do our stuff separately in town.  
We only use this place when we need to get together and plan something.  
  
**Yori：**  
It's just that our guild's... well, I guess you'd call her our leader...  
Our most important member is living here right now.  
  
**Akari：**  
Originally, we were planning to meet Shinobu  
at a cafe or something back in the city center.  
  
**Akari：**  
But when we opened up a channel and got in touch with her,  
she was all like, \"Meet me at the castle!\"  
  
**Akari：**  
Apparently she thought it would make things quicker?  
Though I'm not sure what she meant by that.  
  
**Akari：**  
W-waaahh?!  
  
**Yori：**  
Wh-what's wrong, Akari?!  
Are you OK?!  
  
**Akari：**  
Y-yeah.  
I think some sort of little scrap came floating down from the ceiling.  
It must have touched me in a sensitive spot, so I let out a little squeal!  
  
**Akari：**  
Eheheh!  
You guys should be careful, too.  
This castle's pretty old, so it's falling apart in places!  
  
**Akari：**  
If the roof falls in above you, you could really be done for!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Actually, I do seem to feel some kind of quaking sensation.  
And I hear distant voices raised in anger.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What could it be?  
Are the spirits haunting these ancient walls unhappy to see us?  
  
**Yori：**  
Ahh... You could actually be right.  
Ohh... Miyako, you silly girl...  
Are you causing a poltergeist phenomenon again?  
  
**Yori：**  
Oh, uh, Miyako is one of our other guild members.  
She's a bit... er, *very* out of the ordinary,  
so try not to be too surprised if you see her.  
  
**Akari：**  
Ahaha!  
Our guild's members are all like that, aren't they?  
  
**Akari：**  
There's Shinobu, who's got that creepy talking skull.  
And Illya is big sometimes and little other times,  
so she's definitely not normal.  
  
**Akari：**  
Personally, I think it makes things fun  
having so many weird people around...  
  
**Yori：**  
Yeah.  
A lot of them have had pretty difficult lives,  
or been misunderstood because of their... oddities.  
  
**Yori：**  
So it would be great if you could be nice to them,  
no matter how offbeat they might seem.  
  
**Yori：**  
Even the two of us have been side-eyed before for being twins.  
These experiences are kind of what brought us all together,  
so try not to be mean to anyone.  
  
**Yori：**  
Honestly,  
that's why normally we try to avoid  
getting too involved in other people's business.  
  
**Yori：**  
But we couldn't ignore a request from {player}.  
He's helped us out a lot in the past.  
  
**Akari：**  
It feels like there's a nasty mood hanging around the city lately,  
too. If there's anything we can do to improve it,  
we'd be happy to help out!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, thank you very much!  
You're totally right—it's better if everyone can live in peace!  
So let's strike down evil,  
 and protect everyone's happiness!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Wahhh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Buehh?!  
Wh-whatever is the matter, Miss Pecorine?  
Please do not cling to me so tightly...  
It makes it difficult to breathe...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh—I'm sorry!  
I just got this sudden chill down my spine.  
Do you think there really might be ghosts around...?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are you OK?  
**Choice: (2)**  Ghosts are scary...  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, sure! Don't worry about me!  
But it's nice of you to ask. You're so kind!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
Actually, ghosts are a bit of a weakness of mine...  
I mean, you can't eat them, so...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha!  
You can be like a little kid sometimes, {player}!  
You're so cute!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But don't worry!  
If any nasty ghosties show up, I'll send them packing in a jiffy!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shinobu：**  
No... This is not the work of ghosts.  
In the first place, spirits other than Miyako rarely enter this castle.  
It seems they are afraid to stray too close to Illya.  
  
**Yori：**  
Ahh! Shinobu!  
Sheesh, could you not suddenly appear from the shadows like that?  
  
**Yori：**  
People really will think you're a ghost!  
You even made me jump for a second!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
My apologies...  
Visibility is a problem here,  
so I would like to install some more effective lighting...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
But Illya is not fond of bright lights...  
And I myself do not dislike the darkness, so...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
At any rate...  
Greetings, everyone. Thank you for coming all this way.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I am Shinobu, the fortune-teller.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I know what brings you here.  
I have prepared tea for us to share,  
so make yourselves at home, and let us sit down and talk.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh...!  
This girl still seems pretty young,  
but she has a real atmosphere about her!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So she's the fortune-teller  
who might have the same ability as \"that man\"?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
There's something about her that's almost otherworldly...  
Or to be honest, she seems a little creepy somehow...  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Gahahah!  
Way to go, brat! You've done well!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
To think you'd bring me such a fine specimen yet again!  
You just love to please me, don't you?  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Young lady with the bounteous bosom! What's your name?  
Care to join me for lunch?  
There's a really nice little cafe I know!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Waahh?!  
Th-th-th-that skull just spoke!  
Are you a ventriloquist or something?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
My apologies...  
This skull is possessed by the spirit of my late father,  
so it does speak sometimes...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father...  
You shouldn't come on so strongly  
when you meet girls for the first time.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Bah! First impressions are important!  
Whether it's a horror movie or romance, that's the golden rule!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
You just wait, Shinobu!  
I'll find a new mother for you in no time!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
You're more than enough for me, Father.  
I've made more friends lately, too, so it's not like I'm lonely.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
At any rate...  
I suppose it's a little too noisy right now  
for us to sit down and enjoy our tea.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I'm so sorry.  
It looks like Illya and Miyako are having another of their fights.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
With them going at it like this,  
it will be difficult to hold a civil conversation...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
{player}...  
Could I ask you to go and calm them down?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I think a word from you...  
might be just what they need to come to their senses.
