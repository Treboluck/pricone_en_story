## Subtitle: Fortune-Telling and True Foresight
  
**Miyako：**  
Munchy munchy munchy!  
  
**Miyako：**  
This is sooo yummy!  
You win Miyako's pudding award! Eleventy-hundred points!  
Nice lady, you can be Miyako's personal pudding maker!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, that's quite the honor!  
It's really all thanks to the ingredients, though.  
You have such immaculate fresh milk and eggs!  
  
**Illya：**  
Ohoh!  
But of course. We have good relations with a local farm.  
In this day and age, we can hardly live by our own means alone.  
  
**Illya：**  
Though I hear said farm is in a spot of trouble of late,  
due to damage from the recent magical explosion.  
  
**Illya：**  
By purchasing their wares in large quantities,  
I hoped to contribute to their recovery efforts at least a little.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hang on...  
Is it just me, or have you shrunk back down in size?  
All these sudden changes in age... How does that even work?  
  
**Illya：**  
Mmm... 'Tis a little difficult to explain.  
In fact, you could say that investigating that mystery  
is one of our guild's primary objectives.  
  
**Illya：**  
In short, there is much in this world  
that has yet to be explained!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I see...  
It does seem like all your guild's members  
have one or two mysterious issues of their own.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's so intriguing!  
But I suppose that's not what we're here to talk about.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Nice lady! More pudding please!  
No pudding is ever enough pudding!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Coming up!  
Um, it seems a bit late to be saying this,  
but how come you can eat if you're a ghost?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Normally I'd have thought  
it would just fall right through you and go splat on the floor.  
  
**Illya：**  
Ah, yes.  
You have hit upon yet another of our guild's little mysteries.  
  
**Illya：**  
It seems that when Miyako eats pudding,  
she can intentionally take physical form.  
She switches between the physical and spiritual planes at will.  
  
**Illya：**  
To be frank, she's an extremely unique case,  
so we don't really understand the logic behind it.  
Truly, there is no end to the oddities that surround us!  
  
**Illya：**  
But that is precisely why  
we are in the perfect position  
to deal with abnormal occurrences in the world at large!  
  
**Illya：**  
You could go so far as to call us specialists  
in that which cannot be explained!  
So please, share your concerns!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, that's reassuring!  
With everything that's happened to us,  
it's been tough just trying to keep up with it all...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If you guys are willing to help us out,  
I feel like we might finally be able to strike back!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh.  
I made lots of other treats besides pudding,  
so everyone feel free to dig in!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll be taking the cookies out of the oven in a minute,  
so get those mouths watering!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Haha...  
Should we really be enjoying ourselves like this, though?  
Didn't you have something you wanted to discuss?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes...  
I fear Miss Pecorine has become highly distracted by her cooking,  
so allow me to introduce the topic in her place.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I believe we already explained the basics  
when we initially got in contact remotely, yes?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
You did. I recall you were hoping to inquire  
about the recent magical disaster.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Specifically, about the predictions I made  
before that terrible spell of mass destruction was unleashed.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I do not want to get your hopes up, so I will say this right now...  
While I am indeed a teller of fortunes,  
I do not possess the gift of true foresight.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
True foresight is a miracle beyond the realm of mortals.  
Only a higher being with truly transcendental powers  
could possibly achieve such a thing.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
My talents are limited to the telling of simple fortunes.  
Things like \"It is likely to rain tomorrow.\"  
Or \"Something regrettable may befall you today.\"  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Those kinds of vague and uncertain predictions.  
Little more than intuition.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
The future is a vast and unstable thing, bathed in a deep mist.  
I do not have the power to look upon it with clarity.  
To be frank, I do not believe such a thing is even possible.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, I see...  
But \"that man\"—that \"Eustiana\"—  
seemed to be making quite specific predictions.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Like predicting an incoming arrow, and dodging it effortlessly.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Hmm...  
I can think of two possible explanations.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
The first is, as I just stated,  
the possibility that this \"Eustiana\" person  
is a higher being who can perform true miracles.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
The other possibility that comes to mind  
is that they have extreme power or authority  
allowing them to twist the future to their liking.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Umm...  
What's the difference, exactly?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Let me illustrate with an example.  
Say I were to predict that in five seconds' time,  
a sharp implement, say a fork, will stab {player}'s hand.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
In the case that this prediction was a true miracle,  
this fate would be entirely inevitable, written into destiny.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
No matter how you may try,  
it would be impossible to prevent the fork  
from penetrating {player}'s flesh.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I... I would never allow such a thing to come to pass!  
I will protect my lord from any threat that may befall him!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Thank Kokkoro.  
**Choice: (2)**  Brace for incoming forks.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Pardon?  
 Please, my lord, there is no need for thanks.  
To protect you with all my being is my proud duty.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh?! Your sudden movements surprised me...  
My lord, we are only speaking hypothetically.  
There is no real imminent danger.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shinobu：**  
Haha... At any rate,  
no matter how you try to elude your fate, it is entirely futile.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
That is the nature of destiny.  
This is what it means to have true foresight.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Even if you directed all your efforts  
towards protecting {player} from harm...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
The fork would surely appear from somewhere beyond your reach.  
Some coincidence would conspire to make the prediction a reality.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Meanwhile, in the second of my two scenarios...  
Unlike the case of true foresight, the tragedy would not be preordained.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
However, the person who made the prediction  
would take steps to ensure its accuracy.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Perhaps... I might kill you before you could protect {player},  
then take a fork in hand,  
and triumphantly stab it into his hand myself.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Or perhaps I would bribe you all with money,  
employ powers of seduction, or use authority to compel you...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I would construct a situation  
in which the fork is certain to find its mark.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
In both cases, the prediction comes true.  
A future event is identified, and it comes to pass.  
The outcome is the same, but the means of reaching it is different.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
If this... \"Eustiana\" individual... is truly predicting the future,  
I cannot say for sure which method is being employed.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
In the case you mentioned, of dodging an incoming arrow  
in a way that seems effortless...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
This could simply be the result of extreme physical capabilities  
allowing them to react in the instant of the arrow's approach.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Or perhaps they had bribed the archer in advance,  
learning ahead of time when and where it would appear.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Such apparent miracles are quite possible to achieve  
without the need for true foresight.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Speaking personally,  
absolute predictions could render my business obsolete,  
so I would like to believe in the latter explanation...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm...  
I was hoping you could tell us some secret behind Eustiana's  
crazy reactions, but I guess it's not that simple.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
In the first scenario, there's really nothing we can do,  
so I guess we should just pray it's the second.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Indeed.  
Except that... \"Eustiana\"... That name itself concerns me.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
It might just indicate the former scenario...  
You may be dealing with someone beyond the realm of humanity  
who can perform truly miraculous feats.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Um...  
That name means something to you?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Yes. Tell me, everyone,  
have you ever heard of a group called the \"Seven Crowns\"?
