**Miyako：**  
You are the worstest!  
  
**Miyako：**  
No forgivings for you, ever!  
Anyone who eats Miyako's pudding  
gets boiled in the boily firepot of hell! Hmph!  
  
**Illya：**  
W-w-w-will you calm down, you fool of a spirit?!  
Enough of your tantrums!  
You're going to shake my castle right to the ground!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shaky-shaky just like pudding!  
Every bite so wobbly and melty...  
The sweetness swims through my whooole mouth!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Or it would if Illya didn't *steal* it!  
That's why Miyako is mad right now!  
  
**Illya：**  
Wh... What need have I for pudding?!  
I am no half-grown whelp!  
As a lady of high class, I consume only the finest delicacies!  
  
**Miyako：**  
You making fun of pudding now?  
Pudding is every king, queen and princess's favoritest,  
classiest, treatiest treat!  
  
**Illya：**  
Of all the things to get angry about, you choose that?!  
  
**Illya：**  
H... Have you not heard the news of late  
that monsters have been intruding upon my esteemed abode?  
Likely they are to blame for the vanishment of your sugary morsels!  
  
**Miyako：**  
No pinning blame on monsters!  
Illya is a sneaky sneak!  
Always eating pudding when nobody's looking!  
  
**Miyako：**  
And if monsters stealed pudding,  
that's Illya's fault too for not guarding the castle!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Aaaaall Illya's fault! Stealing all Miyako's treats!  
  
**Illya：**  
You are mistaken...!  
I am not guilty of these crimes!

**Choice: (1)**  What's all this?  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
Hmm? Ahhh, {player}!  
Your timing is impeccable!  
  
**Illya：**  
Prithee, put a stop to Miyako's outburst...  
She is such a stubborn fool,  
she will not listen to a word I say!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh...  
Looks like, um, there's a pair of little girls having a fight.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. They are quite the unusual pair, I must say.  
One appears to be somehow floating in the air,  
while the other exudes a most mysterious aura...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Whatever should we do, my lord?  
I gather you are... acquainted with these young misses...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Whatever the reason for their argument,  
I feel we should stop them before the castle really does collapse.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmmm, why is all this happening, anyway?  
I don't really feel any magic being used,  
but everything in the room is flying around like crazy!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Stay alert, everyone! We don't want anyone getting hurt!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
It is called the poltergeist effect,  
an ability possessed only by particularly powerful spirits.  
I believe it is also known as \"house-rattling\" in this region.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Originally, the term referred to the sudden creaking noises  
made by old buildings that have fallen into disrepair.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
But as you can see, the influence of actual restless spirits  
can give rise to the same phenomenon.  
  
**Yori：**  
Um, let's not stand around analyzing it!  
Miyako! Calm down, please!  
If it's pudding you want, I'll buy you some later!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako wants pudding *now!*  
But miss fancy-pants lady doesn't get it at all!  
  
**Akari：**  
Oh dear...  
There really is no reasoning with her, is there?  
  
**Akari：**  
Oh, here's a thought!{player}, could you be a sweetie  
and give Illya a big old cuddle for me?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  All right.  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm on it.  
`Tag 2`  
`Tag 3`  
**Illya：**  
What are you doing?!  
H-hey, stop that!  
'Tis not your place to touch me so casually, {player}!  
  
**Illya：**  
Mmmnhhh...?  
Ah! I am restored to my true form!  
Mwahahah! Power courses through my body!  
  
**Illya：**  
It really does seem that touching you, {player},  
somehow triggers the change...  
A perplexing phenomenon. I can scarce fathom it myself.  
  
**Akari：**  
It's got to be the power of love! Don't you think?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh?  
Her appearance totally changed...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And suddenly, I feel a massive magical signature from her...  
What's going on?  
Just who is this girl?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
It is a little difficult to explain, but...  
Illya has... a somewhat unique body.  
  
**Akari：**  
So, Illya, if you're back to your full-powered self,  
you should be able to overpower Miyako, right?  
  
**Akari：**  
See, the thing is, we've got some talking to do...  
So you can handle this yourself, right?  
  
**Illya：**  
Uhhh...?  
Well, yes... But if I use my full strength,  
I fear I may damage the fabric of Miyako's soul.  
  
**Illya：**  
That would hardly be right.  
She has done nothing to deserve such treatment.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
As always, you are most kind...  
What shall we do, then?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
The matter we were about to discuss  
actually concerns you as well, Illya.  
So if possible, it would be helpful if you could attend.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Though it pains me to say this,  
perhaps it would be best  
to subdue Miyako's consciousness for the time being.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I am used to dealing with spirits.  
A simple sealing charm would be quite within my abilities.  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmmm...  
Does that exactly qualify as solving the issue?  
  
**Illya：**  
Though I suppose... while Miyako is incapacitated,  
I could flit into town,  
and purchase some of her beloved pudding.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ummm... I'm not sure I get what's going on,  
but if you have the ingredients, I could whip up some pudding myself!  
Do you mind if I borrow the kitchen?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Huh? You can...  
make pudding???  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's actually quite simple!  
Well, it depends on how well-equipped the kitchen is...  
But I've made pudding at home plenty of times!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's so creamy and delicious...  
It really tastes like home, you know?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Yes, yes! This lady gets it!  
The taste of pudding is the taste of love!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Actually, wait.  
I saw you before one time...  
at a dessert shop I visit lots!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Don't tell me... you're a dessert-making person?!  
Eheheh! We found us a pudding pro!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Okie-dokey!  
If tasty pudding is on offer, no reason for being mad anymore!  
...Are you really, truly gonna make pudding for Miyako though?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Sure thing! It shouldn't be too hard.  
I'll make some for everyone else, too!  
It'll be the perfect accompaniment for our little teatime chat!  
  
**Miyako：**  
No no no!  
I'm gonna eat *all* the pudding!  
  
**Illya：**  
Well, well...  
Miyako's pudding tantrums are the stuff of legends,  
yet you seem to have calmed her right down.  
  
**Illya：**  
Who exactly might you be, young lady?  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmmm... I feel certain I have seen you somewhere before...  
But I fear my memory fails me. Aging is a terrible thing...
