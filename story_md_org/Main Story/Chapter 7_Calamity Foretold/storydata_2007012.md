## Subtitle: Critical Juncture
  
**Shinobu：**  
Phew.  
One way or another, we made it through that swarm of monsters.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
They were tough!  
I'm totally famished right now...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What was up with that swarm?  
It seemed a bit over-the-top for a simple strike team  
sent to fend off a few intruders.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Is everyone unharmed?  
If there are any injuries, please let me know,  
and I will perform some basic healing.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I got scratched up a bit.  
**Choice: (2)**  Are you OK, Kokkoro?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
What?! Are you quite all right?  
Please show me your injuries at once, my lord!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Oh, thank goodness.  
 These really are little more than scratches.  
My apologies, my lord. I should have protected you more thoroughly...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Even scratches are vulnerable to infection, so let me sterilize them.  
This may sting a little, my lord.  
I'll just rub on a little disinfectant...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
There, all done.  
Now, ah, is there anyone else who is injured?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes. Thanks to everyone's efforts, I am fine.  
Our allies defeated the majority of the monsters  
before they even reached me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
They made my job surprisingly easy.  
I am not confident in my stamina, so the prospect of a lengthy battle  
worried me,  
 but thankfully, that crisis was averted in the end.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Nevertheless, the struggle was rather chaotic,  
so I am concerned about our allies' condition.  
Is everyone unhurt?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Miyako：**  
Everybody's okie-dokey!  
All full of energies!  
 Being alive is wonderful!  
  
**Yori：**  
We're not hurt ourselves, but our weapons are pretty worn out.  
  
**Yori：**  
We should avoid much more fighting.  
Let's do what we came here for and get out.  
  
**Akari：**  
I've got some sharpening stones!  
Let's do a bit of weapon servicing!  
Mmm, \"servicing\" sounds a little bit dirty, doesn't it?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heheh...  
It's good to see everyone's OK!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...So, this Neneka. Is she around here somewhere?  
This area looks the same as all the rest to me...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Yes.  
Just around that next corner,  
there's a button hidden behind an ordinary-looking rock.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Pressing it reveals the entryway to the laboratory.  
There are no signs or markings to go by,  
but I have a good memory for these things.  
  
**Illya：**  
...Hm?  
Everyone, halt your advance!  
Something doesn't seem right here...  
  
**Illya：**  
Take a look. We have yet to press the button,  
yet the entryway is already open.  
And do you all feel that ominous rumbling sensation?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Yes.  
It's not quite like the monsters' footsteps...  
What could be making it?  
  
**???：**  
...Hmm?  
Who's that out there?!  
  
**Yori：**  
Wha...?!  
S-someone just came rushing out of the laboratory entrance!  
  
**Akari：**  
Ooh, that sneaky-looking outfit...  
Could it be a bandit hunting treasure in the ruins?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm?  
Hold on... Might you be Miss Muimi...?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Huh?  
Ahhh! You guys! Why are you here?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I might ask you the same thing...  
We were worried about you, Miss Muimi.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I hear you were seen at the site of the spell of mass destruction  
when it was unleashed a few days ago.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh... It's a relief to see that you are alive and well.  
It seems you have some kind of affinity for large explosions.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Urgh...  
If I could help it, I'd rather not  
run into quite so many explosions...  
  
**Muimi：**  
But I guess fate has other plans.  
Annoyingly enough.  
  
**Muimi：**  
...Wait, this is no time to be chatting!  
I don't know what you guys are doing in a place like this,  
but you've gotta run! This whole lab is about to blow!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What...? Yet another explosion?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ummm...  
What exactly is going on?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We came here to find a girl by the name of Neneka...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Ahh... Tiana!  
So you made it outta there too.  
 Well, that's good news...  
  
**Muimi：**  
From the looks of things...  
I guess basically everyone at the center of that spell  
must've managed to get away.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Tiana\"...?  
Hold on, why do you know my real name?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Oh... That's just what Christina was calling you.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Christina?  
Last I heard, she'd just broken out of prison...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Oh, geez... Enough yammering!  
We need to get outta here, and quick!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Can't you feel the ground shaking?  
That's the lab's main reactor going into overdrive!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Soon it'll reach the critical point and trigger a massive blast!  
There won't be anything left of this lab!  
  
**Muimi：**  
We're talking an explosion on the same level  
as that spell of mass destruction, or worse!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Waaahh...?!  
No way... After we went to all that trouble to get here...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Now we have to run straight back  
without even meeting the person we came here for?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Can't meet anyone if you're dead!  
Long as you're alive, it'll work out somehow!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Besides...  
There's no point looking for Neneka here.  
It looks like she's been kidnapped already.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Before either of our groups got here,  
this place was assaulted by an army from the palace.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Neneka's a powerful being herself,  
but it looks like this attack was too much for even her.  
  
**Muimi：**  
The soldiers caused a lot of damage in the process,  
so Neneka's bug monsters got unleashed from storage.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Bug monsters\"...?  
Oh... Do you mean those weird ones that look like  
multiple monsters all mixed up?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah.  
It's Masaki's Princess Knight power that creates them.  
He can fuse multiple monsters together.  
  
**Muimi：**  
When he does, it causes weird bugs,  
and they end up as freaky-looking beasts that shouldn't exist.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Masaki...?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh! That's a name I recognize.  
He's like an assistant or a bodyguard of Neneka's.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I've met him a few times before.  
He's a rather lively man. Only barely of age, I'd say.  
Did he make it out of here already?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
You said Neneka was captured by a royal army  
that attacked the lab...?  
What exactly happened in this place?  
  
**Muimi：**  
No point asking me.  
  
**Muimi：**  
We thought Neneka was likely to be the next target,  
so we came here to save her...  
But when we got here, we were already too late.  
  
**Muimi：**  
As for Masaki...  
It looks like Neneka managed to get him out of here.  
  
**Muimi：**  
He was looking pretty beat-up,  
but we found him just now and got him to safety.  
So if you've got questions, you can ask him.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Now can we hurry up and run already?!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Neneka couldn't stand the idea of anyone stealing her research,  
so she set this place up to self-destruct.  
And it looks like that feature's been activated.  
  
**Muimi：**  
You should know Neneka never half-asses anything.  
Once this place goes up, I'm sure there won't be  
a shred of her research left.  
  
**Muimi：**  
So let's get outta here before the same thing happens to us.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We'd love to, but...  
The teleportation circle we originally used to get here  
is a long way back through the tunnels.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Even if we dashed at full speed,  
the explosion might reach us first...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Urghh...  
Guess I've got no choice. You lot come with me!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Rajraj can only transport a few people at a time,  
but he'll just have to make a bunch of trips.  
  
**Muimi：**  
That'll still be faster than heading all the way back  
to your magic circle.  
  
**Muimi：**  
And of course, it's that ability of his—his \"Spatial Leap\"—  
that got me here in the first place.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Rajraj\"...  
Oh, would that be a guy called Rajnikanth?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That big and mysterious-looking guy  
who was at the site of the spell of mass destruction?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Arghh, there's no time to stand around explaining!  
Just follow me!  
  
**Muimi：**  
I know this is all a bit rushed and confusing,  
but getting out of here alive comes first!  
  
**Muimi：**  
So run!  
You're not gonna learn any answers if you're dead, are you?!
