# Chapter 7 Episode 2
Pecorine and co. have successfully driven off the monsters around Elizabeth Park, when {player} returns from the elf village to relate some interesting news they learned from Hatsune. Apparently there was a fortune-teller who predicted the whole incident.

### Place: Elizabeth Park
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whewww!  
Finally we get to catch our breath!  
Looks like all the monsters around the farm are gone for now.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Honestly though, that airship was a lifesaver!  
It was almost scary how powerful it was!  
How crazy is that?! ☆  
  
**Akino：**  
Eheh!  
That's what I like to hear!  
By all means, keep the compliments coming!  
  
**Saren：**  
Let's not get carried away, shall we, Akino?  
Things may have turned out all right this time,  
but that airship is still only an experimental prototype!  
  
**Saren：**  
I dread to think what might have happened  
if we'd lost control of it.  
  
**Yukari：**  
And in the end, we *did* wind up making a crash landing...  
My life flashed before my eyes!  
  
**Yukari：**  
It's always like this lately...  
Do you think our insurance covers this sort of accident?  
This crazy guild will be the death of me someday...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
No time for grumbling.  
We need your help healing the injured. Okay, Yukari?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Most of the injuries aren't even from the monsters—  
they're from the airship's great big crashdown...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myahahah...  
One step forward, two steps back. What a cat-astrophe!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
But hey... Let's look on the bright side!  
At this rate, the farm should be back to nyormal within a week!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It could've been seriously paw-ful,  
but barely anyone was seriously hurt in the end!  
All's well that ends well, or so they say!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Great work, folks!  
We couldn'ta managed any of this  
without the help of the Foundation an' everyone else!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
We really can't thank y'all enough!  
You've been such a big help!  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, no need for all that!  
Charity is a duty for those of us blessed with greatness!  
Isn't that right, Saren?  
  
**Saren：**  
Well... I suppose you're not wrong.  
Whew... It sure has been a long day.  
  
**Saren：**  
But, well, I'm just glad everyone's still in one piece.  
  
**Saren：**  
Um... Miss Pecorine?  
When Kokkoro and {player} get back from the forest...  
  
**Saren：**  
We should probably return to the Orphanage while it's still light.  
If we're gone too long, the kids will worry.  
  
**Saren：**  
It's not like the farm is properly fixed up yet,  
so we'd be in the way if we tried to spend the night.  
And I'd rather not navigate those mountain trails after dark.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Makes sense to me!  
It's always a pleasure staying with you, Saren!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
As for Kokkoro and {player}...  
Um, let's see. They went into the forest to visit the elf village  
where Shiori's big sister lives, right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I would have loved to go with them,  
but I had those monsters to take care of...  
And it wasn't easy! I didn't expect them to put up that much of a fight!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Actually, there's one thing bothering me.  
It's about the monsters we saw around the farm.  
Is it just me, or did their bodies look more than a little unusual?  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh? Really?  
I wasn't looking that closely, so I didn't notice! Ohohohohoh!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yes, yes, I wasn't asking you.  
But it looked to me like...  
Like they were made up of multiple monsters mixed together.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Could that spell of mass destruction  
have given rise to a whole new breed of monster?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I've heard that magical disturbances, including powerful attack spells,  
have been known to affect the local ecosystem,  
causing mutations in the monster population...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Naw, actually...  
This ain't the first time we've seen them weird monsters around.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
They've popped up occasionally since way before the attack.  
Though we're only talkin' a handful o' times a year.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hmmm...  
Are they a unique breed nyative to this area, then?  
Rare beasts can fetch a pretty penny... I should've tried capturing one!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, stop that, you...  
Buying and selling living creatures doesn't really sit well with me.  
Besides, they'd be hard to take care of. I doubt you could turn a profit.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hmmm.  
You know, most mutations die out quickly,  
because they can't adapt well to their environment.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Perhaps conservation should be our angle here.  
They'd make useful subjects for research studies,  
so we might be able to turn a profit that way.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
In return for having their lives protected,  
they'd be offering their unique assets to science.  
Makes a certain kind of sense, doesn't it?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yes, I can see the books balancing neatly!  
I think I might have to put together a proper proposal,  
and put this plan into action.  
  
**Saren：**  
I don't know *how* you manage to turn every little thing  
into a business opportunity.  
 Honestly...  
You're merchants through and through, you Mercurius Foundation folk.  
  
**Saren：**  
But hey, I suppose there's nothing wrong with that.  
It's none of our business at the Sarendia Orphanage,  
so go ahead and make all the money you like!  
  
**Saren：**  
We may have been working together this time,  
but as a rule, we're completely separate guilds, after all.  
  
**Akino：**  
Quite right! I hope we can maintain a passionate rivalry  
and keep each other on our toes going forward, my dear Saren!  
  
**Saren：**  
Um, to be perfectly honest,  
I'd rather not deal with you much more if I can help it...  
My \"dear\" Akino!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hello, everyone!  
I apologize for our late arrival.  
We have returned from our forest excursion.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh!  
It looks like {player} and the others are back.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heyas!  
Welcome back, {player} and friends!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Thanks.  
**Choice: (2)**  Have you all been getting along?  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
You're welcome!  
You're such a good boy, you know that?  
Good boy, good boy~!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? That's a very... fatherly sort of thing to ask!  
Don't you worry, though, we're all bestest buddies!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
So how were things at the elf village?  
Was everyone there okay?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, yes.  
Hatsune seemed to be in good spirits. I was really relieved.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed.  
It seems the village actually suffered  
no damage from the attack whatsoever.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That spell of mass destruction...  
Somehow its damage seems to have been limited  
to an unnaturally specific area.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, that's good news!  
Actually, I guess there *was* a barrier around the area  
around the same time the spell went off.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It must have prevented the blast  
from reaching much further than necessary.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So it would seem.  
More importantly, Miss Shiori's elder sister—Miss Hatsune—  
provided us with some surprising new information.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It seems our trip to the elf village was not in vain.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ooh, surprising information?  
What's all this about? Smells like profits to me!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Um. I am not sure if this information has financial value...  
But it seems that before the blast was unleashed,  
the village had been warned of its danger by a fortune-teller.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thanks to this fortune-teller's insistence that danger was at hand,  
they were able to keep damages to an absolute minimum.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Both the blast itself and the monster rampage that preceded it  
failed to harm the elf village because they were forewarned.  
Though of course, they were initially skeptical of the predictions.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But once they saw the blast actually tear through the sky...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Hatsune was rather upset and angry with herself,  
wishing that she had thought to share the predictions  
with their neighbors at Elizabeth Park also.  
  
**Saren：**  
Fortune-telling, though?  
I can see why they wouldn't believe it.  
If this person really predicted the future, that's incredible.  
  
**Saren：**  
Predictions like that aren't supposed to be possible,  
no matter what kind of magic you use.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmmm... This is quite intriguing.  
I'd like to hear more details.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
After all, \"that man\" who set off the spell of mass destruction...  
That \"Eustiana\" who stole everything from me...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I've noticed more than once that it seemed like  
they knew exactly what was about to happen.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So if it's possible that this fortune-teller  
has the same ability as \"him\"...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
There might be a connection there.  
It's worth investigating, at any rate.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If nothing else, a fortune-teller who can really see the future  
might be able to warn us when \"that man\" will attack next.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Even if he's in a weakened state right now,  
we can't let our guard down for a second.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I want to make sure nobody gets hurt again.  
I don't want anyone to have to shed any more tears.  
So it's important that we're prepared.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let's find this fortune-teller, and see what they have to say!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We can't let \"him\" stay one step ahead of us forever.  
It's time we went on the offensive!
