### Place: Throne Room
  
**Karyl：**  
Urngh...hhh...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahhh!  
H-huh?  
Where... Where am I?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Isn't this... the throne room in the palace?  
How did I get to a place like this?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Just a moment ago,  
I was out in those mountains near the farm...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I left Christina to take care of Tiana...  
Focused all my energy on calming down the rampaging monsters...  
  
**Karyl：**  
And just when I'd finished with that,  
I ran into {player}, didn't I?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I guess since Tiana...  
 I mean, Pecorine was missing,  
he'd come looking for her.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Seriously, though, heading out there alone?  
For a weakling like him, that's basically suicide!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Lucky for him, I'd managed to calm down the monsters,  
but then he almost fell right off a cliff!  
So I rushed out and lent him a hand...  
  
**Karyl：**  
After all, Her Majesty did tell me  
we shouldn't let him die.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's not like I did it because I care about him!  
Don't get the wrong idea!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Who am I even making excuses to?  
Ugh... Today has been the absolute worst.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Maybe Her Majesty was right all along, and I'm...  
just a worthless, defective creation...  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Hmm?  
What the...?! {player}!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-wh-wh-why are you clinging onto me like that?!  
Are you in love with me or something?!  
Hey! G-get off me! I'll murder you! Gahhh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Huh...?  
{player}, are you... asleep?  
You were just clinging to me in your sleep?  
  
**???：**  
Hahah...  
You probably shouldn't move him around too much.  
If you really care about him, that is.  
  
**???：**  
He seems to be in a mild state of shock.  
Nothing life-threatening, you understand. He's just passed out.  
The transfer must have put a bit too much strain on his body.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Eek...?!  
Y-Your Majesty...!

**???：**  
Dear me, what a silly girl.  
\"Eek!\" she says. How adorable.  
  
**???：**  
But you know,  
that kind of reaction is for when you see a monster or a ghost.  
Not sweet little old me! Hee hee...  
  
**???：**  
I thought I'd treated you better  
than to deserve a reaction like that...  
  
**???：**  
And haven't I told you before not to call me \"Majesty\"?  
We're family, aren't we?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I... I-I-I apologize if I displeased you!  
Um... Lady Eustiana!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
I could do without the \"Lady\" part too...  
But no matter. I'm in a good mood today, you see.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
After all, I might just be able to get rid of a whole bunch  
of irritating pests. A little spring cleaning  
really makes you feel good, doesn't it?

**Eustiana：**  
At any rate...  
I saw the two of you  
wasting time getting yourselves all stranded in the mountains.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
So, well, I got tired of waiting.  
It was getting rather late, and I need my beauty sleep...  
So I brought you here directly!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
I used you as the focal point, my dear,  
to summon both of you to my own location.  
  
**Karyl：**  
D-direct transportation?  
You don't mean me and {player}  
were teleported here? All the way from the mountains?  
  
**Karyl：**  
But that's impossible... Even magic can't do that!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Of course it's not impossible.  
My dear Karyl, have you forgotten who I am?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
There's a little thing called the \"warp gate\" system...  
I've sealed it away from most people's use for the time being,  
but long ago, it was quite a common method of transport.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
All I did was hook into that system's magical conduits...  
And, well, here we all are!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
It took quite a bit of magical energy out of me, too...  
Even though I'm trying not to waste too much right now!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
So I hope you're thankful, my darling Karyl.  
If I'd left you out there in those mountains,  
you might have gotten mixed up in something quite fatal.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh...?  
I'm not sure I quite understand...  
But, um, do you require {player} for something?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I've been watching over him all this time on your orders...  
But really, he's just a normal boy without any special features.  
I don't understand why you seem so interested in him.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
So I should leave him alone? Is that what you're saying?  
You really have become quite close to him, haven't you?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
The \"Gourmet Guild,\" was it?  
You seem to have formed a happy little group there.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Umm...  
Th-that's part of my plan!  
I thought if we were guildmates, I could take him unawares...  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Yes, I quite understand.  
My dear darling Karyl... My lovely Karyl...  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Haven't I told you? You're essentially a part of me.  
So naturally I can tell everything  
you're thinking and feeling.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Tell me, did you want some friends?  
Or perhaps it was love you were after?  
I can understand that. It's a terrible thing to be lonely.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
...But you know, Karyl.  
A god... doesn't need friends.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
A god is a singular entity that rules over all creation.  
That's how we are meant to be.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
You're supposed to be a part of me,  
so why can't you understand such a simple thing, hmm?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Dear me, how very tiresome.  
I suppose I should have known that in this world,  
my Future Sight could hardly be relied upon.  
  
![200500402.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/200500402.webp)  
**Eustiana：**  
Please don't get the wrong idea.  
It's not as though I'm trying to punish you.  
You haven't done anything wrong.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
You may have failed to fulfill any of my orders,  
and bumbled along like a hopeless clown...  
But none of that is your own fault.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
My darling Karyl... My good little Karyl...  
I have only myself to blame.  
I treated you too much like a human being.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Even though you're nothing but a tool.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
The power of a Princess Knight is a potent thing,  
and I thought your body might not be able to handle the strain...  
So I was hoping to feed it to you gradually, a little at a time.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
But look where that got us.  
You couldn't even control those monsters properly,  
and you failed me as a result.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Even so, if I let you build up some experience,  
I thought you might make yourself useful sooner or later...  
  
**Eustiana：**  
But we don't have time for that,  
and honestly, I'm getting tired of waiting around.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
So forget not straining your body.  
I'm just going to pour all this power straight into you.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
If you end up irreparably broken as a result...  
Well, I can always just make another one!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Trial and error, that's the secret to success.  
And who knows, the next Karyl  
might be a more devoted and useful pawn than you.

**Karyl：**  
Wh-why...?  
Why would you... do this to...  
Stop... Stoooooop!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I tried... I really tried...  
I tried so hard to be a good girl...!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Get on your feet.  
**Choice: (2)**  Cry out \"Stop!\"  
`Tag 1`  
`Tag 2`  
**Eustiana：**  
...Hmm?  
Oh my.  
It looks like you've woken {player} up.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
This is what happens when you keep crying like a little baby, Karyl.  
I'm awfully sorry, {player}.  
We didn't mean to disturb you.  
  
![200500403.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/200500403.webp)  
**Eustiana：**  
Hmm?  
What's this now, {player}?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
You seem to be stretching your arms out...  
Don't tell me you're trying to protect little Karyl?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Even though you can't possibly understand the situation...  
What a good boy. You're so very kind.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
I suppose some things never do change.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
But too bad for you! This isn't a game; this is reality.  
And in the real world, virtuous do-gooders  
just get themselves killed.
