**Christina：**  
Hahah... Hahaha...!  
Hahahah! Ahahahahahahahah! ☆  
  
**Christina：**  
Isn't this fun, Tiana?!  
Our most gracious and beloved princess!  
  
**Christina：**  
Won't you dance the night away with me?!  
A dance of death, our dresses stained with blood!  
  
**Christina：**  
Let us rend one another's flesh and send sparks flying!  
Bare our fangs and whisper sweet nothings!  
  
**Christina：**  
Is it not your duty to grant the wishes  
of a humble citizen like myself?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Don't tell me you're too tired to go on!  
My lust for carnage is still far from sated!  
  
**Christina：**  
Even when the clock strikes twelve, this ball will not end!  
Come, take my hand and dance, Your Highness!  
  
**Christina：**  
Brandish your blade like your life depends on it!  
Slay the tedium that plagues me so!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aaahhhh!  
That lady doesn't know when to give up!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
How long has she been chasing me?!  
The sun's totally gone down and everything!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
{player} and the others  
must be starting to worry  
about where I am...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm so sorry, everyone!  
If only I'd prepared some means of keeping in touch...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But how was I supposed to know  
I'd end up in a situation like this?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I came here to stop the monsters,  
not to get chased around all night by some crazy lady!  
  
**Christina：**  
What's wrong, my dear? Lost in thought?  
Or are you on your last legs?  
Do we need to take a tea break?  
  
**Christina：**  
Don't disappoint me, I beg of you,  
my star-crossed beloved!  
Not when fate has finally brought us together!  
  
**Christina：**  
Come, dance with me!  
My sweet and adorable Princess Tiana!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhhh...  
What is this lady's deal?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
She certainly seems to know my real name...  
Which is a nice thing, don't get me wrong!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
After all, everyone else has forgotten all about me...  
My father, my mother... everyone!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So it would be great if I could ask her a few questions...  
But I get the feeling she's not much for conversation!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, what should I do?!  
For some reason none of my attacks seem to hit her...  
I think she's using some kind of supernatural ability to dodge!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So there's no point facing her head-on...  
And since the monsters that were ravaging the farm  
all seem to have dispersed at this point...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I think we can say Elizabeth Park  
is safe and sound!  
I've done what I came here to do!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I was only trying to stop this mystery villain  
from setting those monsters on the farm.  
So it would be nice if I could just go home now!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Given the timing, I guess the one behind the monsters  
must have been the lady who's chasing me now?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
She doesn't really seem  
much like the crafty magic-using type, though...  
Hmmm...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I mean, she does have impressive physical skills,  
and this mysterious power that's letting her dodge my attacks,  
so she must be *some* kind of \"special person\"...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Just like \"that man\"  
who stole everything from me...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's another good reason  
why it would be nice if we could sit down  
and have a nice long chat about this stuff...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And I'm pretty sure she's human, too...  
So I'd rather not kill her and make a meal out of her...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, what to do?  
Even at the minimum output I need to run away,  
I can't keep using my Royal Equipment forever...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh... I'm starting to feel really hungry...  
At this rate, things don't look good for me at all!  
  
**Christina：**  
...Hmm?  
  
**Christina：**  
Tiana!  
Did you hear an unusual sound just now?  
I felt the ground quake, as well...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wh-what...? Well, uhhh...  
Yes, I guess you're right.  
It sounded like some kind of explosion!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But hang on,  
why are you suddenly talking to me like this?!  
Aren't we in the middle of a battle?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah! ☆  
Well, that's good to hear.  
So you do consider this a battle, at least!  
  
**Christina：**  
Can I take it your constant running is some kind of strategy, then?  
How wonderful!  
I like a girl who keeps me on my toes!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Urghhh...  
An explosion out here in the mountains doesn't seem normal...  
So it must be a man-made incident, or some kind of accident...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Do you mind if I go and see what happened?  
If anyone's hurt, I'd like to help them out...  
  
**Christina：**  
Hah! Well, aren't you considerate!  
Very well, then.  
I'd be willing to put our little scuffle on hold!  
  
**Christina：**  
That explosion came from the direction of my original objective...  
The base of operations of this mysterious \"Labyrinth\" guild.  
  
**Christina：**  
It does pique my interest.  
I should go and survey the situation myself.  
  
**Christina：**  
They may have realized their cover is blown  
and decided to flee the coop,  
using some kind of explosion to destroy the evidence.  
  
**Christina：**  
That would make things quite awkward.  
I'm under orders to capture at least one of their number alive.  
  
**Christina：**  
And they do call themselves a \"secret society,\"  
so running and hiding must be their specialty.  
  
**Christina：**  
I doubt it would be easy to track them down a second time  
if we let them get away from us here.  
  
**Christina：**  
Then it's decided! Let us away at once, Tiana!  
Take my hand in yours, and let us fly like birds on the wing!  
  
**Christina：**  
Let us settle this quickly, that we may do battle once more!  
Ahahahah! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhhh... Someone help me, please!  
I think I've somehow attracted the worst kind of stalker!  
If this is a dream, I want to wake up!
