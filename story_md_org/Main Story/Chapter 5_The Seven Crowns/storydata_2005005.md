Eustiana seems to know something about {player}'s life before he lost his memories. But after confirming that his memories are truly gone, she breathes a sigh of relief and decides to eliminate him.
  
## Subtitle: This Half-Baked World
  
### Place: Throne Room
  
**Karyl：**  
Ur...ghhh...  
Nn...nngh...  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Now then, Karyl.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
I've decided I'd like to have  
a little talk with our friend {player}.  
So pick yourself up and fetch us some tea, why don't you?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yes, Your Majesty...  
I'll do anything you say...  
So please... Don't do that to me again...  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Lovely. What a good girl.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Oh, what's that look for, {player}?  
Do you have something to say to me?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Can't you see I was just disciplining my pet?  
You can't fault me for that, can you?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ehh...?  
Hey... {player}!  
Get your hands off me— Owwww!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Oh my, are you treating her wounds?  
You really are such a kind fellow.  
So kind, it makes me sick.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Well, feel free to continue as we talk.  
You see, {player},  
I have a few questions I'd like to ask you.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
While we're having our little chat,  
I'll refrain from doing anything to harm Karyl.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
So if you care about her, you'd do well not to bore me.  
And Karyl, try not to bother us with any tiresome squealing.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
So, tell me, {player}...  
Have you ever felt like this world is somehow... artificial?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  ...Huh?  
`Tag 1`  
**Eustiana：**  
Even though we're in peacetime, there are so many shops  
selling weapons, and barely any selling ordinary supplies.  
There are no fields for growing crops, or even any proper plumbing.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Of course, I've done what I can  
to make up for those obvious omissions.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
But be it history, geography, even our system of government...  
Wherever you look, there are pieces of the puzzle missing.  
Why do you think that is?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Were our forebears so foolish?  
How did such a society... or should I say, such a \"setting\"...  
survive for so long as nothing more than a childish imitation?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Come on, haven't you ever thought it strange?  
This world is so inconvenient for living an ordinary life.  
It's lacking in far too many ways.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
There's so much detailed data when it comes to monsters,  
yet ordinary animals and plants are less clearly defined.  
I could go on listing these anomalies all day.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
And when the inevitable economic struggles and criminal  
activities arise, everyone blames the ruling powers.  
It's quite a bother for someone in my position.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
It's not the royals who messed up, it's this world's creator!  
Blame whatever divine being devised this half-baked world!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Well? Wouldn't you agree?  
Or do you think I'm just spouting meaningless delusions?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Hee hee...  
But of course, you've lost your memories, haven't you?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Perhaps that makes it easier for you  
to just accept this as \"the way things are.\"  
  
**Eustiana：**  
After all, most people in this world don't suspect a thing.  
They've all been reassembled and reconfigured not to.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
I expect there's only a tiny minority of people out there  
who suspect anything is amiss. Myself included.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
And what does that get me? Treated like a raving lunatic!  
It's such a bore, it really might drive me crazy.  
Perhaps you're the lucky one, not having to remember a thing.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
By the way...  
How much *do* you remember, really?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Which of your memories have been eliminated, and how?  
And in what position does that leave you in this world?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
This is what I've been hoping to find out, you know.  
That's why I instructed Karyl to get close to you and investigate.  
Well, not that she uncovered anything useful.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
I didn't want to stimulate you too much, you understand,  
in case it caused all your memories to come flooding back.  
I don't need you getting in my way again.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
So I thought it might be best  
to speak with you directly and find out where you stand.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Have we met somewhere before?  
`Tag 2`  
**Eustiana：**  
Ahahah! If you're saying that as an act, it's impressive...  
And if it's supposed to be a joke, it's frankly hilarious.  
But if you really don't remember, then so be it.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
I'd rather not linger on those awful memories myself, either.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
So if you've forgotten all the history we share,  
I really couldn't ask for a better outcome.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Say, do you know anything about \"Legend of Astrum\"?  
Do you recognize the name "Minerva"?  
Do you think \"Princess Knight\" is just another guild name?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Can you name all of the \"Seven Crowns\"?  
Or in fact, have you met anyone claiming that title?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
How about that irritating little fairy... Ehm...  
\"Fio\", was that her name?  
Do you remember her at all?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  ...Huh?  
**Choice: (4)**  Some of those names sound familiar...  
`Tag 3`  
**Eustiana：**  
Oh my, drawing a complete blank, are we?  
How adorable. You don't understand a thing I'm saying.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Eustiana：**  
Hmmm... I see.  
So the best you can muster is a vague recollection?  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Eustiana：**  
...  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Heh... Heheheh...  
So it's true... You really have forgotten everything.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
I forgot to mention before, but this audience chamber  
is enchanted with a lie detection charm.  
So I can always tell whether you're telling the truth or not.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
As a result,  
I can now feel completely confident  
that you know no more right now than a newborn infant.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Ahhh, what a relief.  
It looks like this time, you won't pose any threat to me.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Though of course...  
Even without your memories, you are still yourself.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
The boy who, despite being completely and utterly ordinary,  
managed to sway the fate of the world, like a real hero.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
I've suffered far too much, in far too many timelines,  
because I treated you as beneath my attention.  
I've learned my lesson not to become overconfident.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Even if you did have help from Akira and Minerva,  
ultimately it was you...  
  
**Eustiana：**  
A worthless, ordinary boy, who stood in my way  
and prevented me from achieving my goals.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
So in this timeline...  
Now that the world, though tragically incomplete,  
has been assembled in such a very convenient arrangement...  
  
**Eustiana：**  
I won't hold anything back.  
I'll do everything in my power  
to make my dream a perfect reality.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
As for Minerva...  
For whatever reason,  
that brat doesn't approve of my grand vision.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Would you believe she actually tried to grant  
all those girls' petty wishes for love or friendship or whatever?  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Well, I have no need for such a worthless, simple-minded god.  
I'll take her place and shine down upon this world like the sun.  
I'm so close, so very close, to finally achieving my dream!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
Don't you think that's wonderful, {player}?  
Ahah! Ahahahah!  
  
**Eustiana：**  
...You really don't understand any of this, do you?  
You must think I'm a proper raving lunatic,  
prattling about delusions of grandeur.  
  
**Eustiana：**  
If that's the best interpretation you can muster,  
all I can say is, \"You poor, poor thing.\"
