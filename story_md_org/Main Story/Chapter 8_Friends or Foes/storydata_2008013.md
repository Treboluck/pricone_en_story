**Pecorine：**  
*pant*... Whew...  
W-we finally made it out of those caves, huh...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, it was a surprisingly arduous journey.  
Thanks to the rush, I have exhausted more stamina than I would like...  
And despite that, it took quite some time. The sun is already setting.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...What's this?  
My lord, are you feeling quite all right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha.  
{player}'s looking pretty worn out.  
That's not good, you know! You should get more exercise!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sorry...  
**Choice: (2)**  I do train quite a bit.  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha! Don't let it get you down.  
Running from scary enemies takes more out of you than normal exercise.  
No one can blame you if you're a little pooped!

`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh, is that right?  
What do you do? Sit-ups and stuff?  
Let me have a little feel... ♪  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Muimi：**  
Guys! Stop right where you are!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whoa!  
Wh-what is it now?  
  
**Muimi：**  
It's bad news.  
I guess the enemy was two steps ahead of us.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Look—they've got us surrounded.  
We're cornered like rats in a great big trap.  
  
**Muimi：**  
And it's not like we wiped out all the monsters in that cave,  
so we can't even retreat easily... There's nowhere to run.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
N-no way... It can't be!  
Nobody but us should know about this route out of the base!  
  
**Rino：**  
We kept the hideout itself pretty well concealed, too,  
but they found us awfully quickly...  
I guess our enemies must have some serious intel-gathering skills.  
  
**Rino：**  
Kinda makes it really hit home that we're up against the palace—  
fighting the government itself.  
With all the resources they've got, there's not much they can't do.  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahhh... We really are totally surrounded...  
We've been \"ridden into a corner,\" haven't we? What now?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
That's \"driven\" into a corner, Rino.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm... As a former member of Nightmare myself,  
I understand the way they work. Upholding the peace  
and stamping out crime are part of their duties.  
  
**Christina：**  
They are well versed in the art of investigation.  
It would not be difficult for them to uncover our escape route  
by casting high-level search spells over a wide area.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
It appears they prepared well before initiating this operation.  
There are monsters and soldiers as far as the eye can see...  
Enough forces to wage war on a rival nation.  
  
**Daigo：**  
For real?! Why would they go that far?  
The hell'd we do to deserve all this?!  
  
**Masaki：**  
Hmm.  
If, as we discussed at the breakfast table,  
they are led by the villain who reconstructed this world...  
  
**Masaki：**  
A guild such as Labyrinth  
would represent a direct threat to that villain's power.  
They are, after all, trying to uncover the world's secrets.  
  
**Masaki：**  
Ignoring such a group would be unwise.  
It is only natural our foe would seek to swiftly eliminate us.  
  
**Masaki：**  
Power can strip a person of their kindness and humanity...  
I have seen it happen all too many times.  
  
**Christina：**  
So what now?  
Our present situation could not look much worse.  
  
**Christina：**  
Shall we make a mad attempt to break through their lines and escape?  
Or would we rather give up and surrender?  
  
**Christina：**  
The latter option is not appealing.  
If all life holds for me is a return to that gloomy cell,  
I would rather die a glorious death on the field of battle.  
  
**Daigo：**  
I'm with you on that one!  
Like hell I'm scared of a few measly knights or monsters!  
Bring it on! I'll take 'em all out with my own two fists!  
  
**Octo：**  
Hello?  
Sorry to interrupt when you're getting so overexcited,  
but could you all listen to us for a moment?  
  
**Muimi：**  
...Octo?!  
  
**Octo：**  
Lovely to see you as well, Muimi.  
 I'm so glad you're safe.  
If you were dead, it would make recovering my brooch  
that much more difficult.  
  
**Muimi：**  
...  
  
**Octo：**  
Oh, no need for the icy glare...  
You'd look much cuter if you smiled, you know!  
  
**Christina：**  
What's this, now?  
Not even a word of greeting to me, my dear Octo?  
  
**Christina：**  
After all the kindness I showed you... Wherever are your manners?  
I don't know what you're doing in a place like this,  
but getting on my nerves is not a wise move.  
  
**Octo：**  
There are all sorts of things I'd like to say to you,  
but I'm afraid I can't steal the spotlight from my superiors,  
so I'll fall back for now.  
  
**Octo：**  
Your Majesty, they're all yours! ♪  
  
**Muimi：**  
\"Majesty\"...?  
Don't tell me Mana... Eustiana is back in action already?!

**Karyl：**  
Octo, you should be more precise when addressing others.  
I am merely acting in Her Majesty's stead while she is indisposed.  
There is no need to show me such reverence.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Though of course, if you defy me, you will regret it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh?  
K-Karyl...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl...?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yes.  
I am Karyl, and my word is Her Majesty's.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I am here to exterminate the treasonous organization Labyrinth,  
along with the dangerous criminals in their care.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I would advise you to surrender.  
If you continue to resist, I will execute you all where you stand.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wh-what are you talking about, Karyl?  
What's wrong with you today?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Execute us...?  
Whyever would you say such a thing?  
The kind Miss Karyl I know would never do anything to harm us!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I did not grant you permission to speak.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You have one minute to comply.  
If, after that time, you do not formally surrender,  
by the will of Her Majesty, whose word is law, your lives will be forfeit.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I suggest you consider your options most carefully.  
Pecorine, Kokkoro, {player}...  
If you continue to defy us, you will not live to see another day.
