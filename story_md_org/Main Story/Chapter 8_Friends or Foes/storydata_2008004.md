**Labyrista：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So this is the head of the secret society known as Labyrinth.  
Your leader, Labyrista.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
She certainly does have a certain aura of importance about her.  
It's like gazing into the mouth of a dormant volcano...  
Somehow my body is trembling of its own accord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And yet, why could this be...?  
Alongside the dread, I also feel a strange connection to her.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It feels as though I have met this woman somewhere in the past...  
Almost like meeting an old relative who I knew when I was  
no more than an infant.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Could this have something to do with how the elder...  
my father... was listed as one of the Seven Crowns  
in Miss Illya's ancient documents?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It seems possible that this person has some deep relevance to me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I would like to ask her many questions, but for better or worse,  
she shows no sign of awakening. I feel disappointed,  
yet also relieved... It is a complex sensation.  
  
`image display end`  
**Choice: (1)**  Pat Kokkoro on the head.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Ahh...  
My lord, why are you patting my head like this?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Because you looked anxious.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm, did I really?  
How careless of me, to let my emotions show so easily...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Even so...  
Your kind consideration makes me very happy, my lord.  
I truly am such a lucky soul.  
  
**Muimi：**  
You two!  
Sorry to interrupt while you're getting all flirty,  
but if you're done looking at Labyrista, can we head to the cafeteria?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I-I do not think we were flirting.  
We were talking normally. Very normally.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Still, is seeing her face really all we can do?  
It would be helpful if we could at least talk,  
but am I to understand that she has not awakened in some time?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah. The other day, when that mass-destruction spell was unleashed,  
I think Labyrista used everything she had to deal with it somehow...  
She's all out of gas, so she's been dead to the world ever since.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Out of \"gas\"?  
Are you referring to a state where her magical energy is drained?  
In that case, I suppose letting her rest is the only solution.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Pretty much. We have been trying IV drips and stuff  
to see if we can help restore her magical energy,  
but we've had no luck so far. All we can do is wait and hope.  
  
**Muimi：**  
From what I can tell, it looks like Labyrista and Mana...  
  
Oh, uh, hang on... What name was that scumbag going by now?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Eustiana.  
**Choice: (4)**  The Pallid Menace.  
`Tag 3`  
**Muimi：**  
Right, yeah, Eustiana.  
Tricky name to remember, that one.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Muimi：**  
Uh, no. I've never heard that one in my life!  
We're not brainstorming original ideas here.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hang on, I think it was... \"Eustiana,\" right?  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Muimi：**  
Anyway, to keep that dirty villain under control,  
I think Labyrista's doing battle right now.  
In like, an inner world. Some kind of mental plane.  
  
**Muimi：**  
If we try to force her awake, we'll end that battle.  
And that might mean Eustiana, who wants to slaughter us all,  
wakes up at the same time.  
  
**Muimi：**  
So, uh, for the moment, I'd rather not interfere.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eustiana... That would be the underhanded villain  
who stole Miss Pecorine's life, yes? It seems safe to say  
she is our greatest enemy at the present moment.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If Miss Labyrista is restraining our archenemy at the moment,  
then I suppose... we should take this chance  
to prepare as best we can for the next step.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah, you got it. That's what our guild is trying to do right now.  
We don't want to drag you guys along on our business,  
but if you'd like, it would be great if we could cooperate.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Of course. We would be glad to.  
After all, Miss Muimi, you did save our very lives from peril.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I did what?  
Ohhh... you mean when I dragged you out  
of the exploding carriage that day?  
  
**Muimi：**  
That time, you healed my burns and stuff afterward,  
so honestly I figured we were pretty even...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yesterday, too, it was you who warned us  
to flee the self-destructing laboratory,  
and brought us to a safe location.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
There may still be much about you that is a mystery,  
but you have more than earned our trust.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If you wished to bring harm to any of us,  
you had more than enough opportunity to leave us to our fate.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I didn't really do much.  
But hey, if you think of me as a friend, I'm not complaining.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Heheh... Battling together with you, {player}...  
To me, it's a bit of a dream come true.  
I was always kind of jealous of all the fun you guys seemed to have.  
  
**Muimi：**  
'Course, standing in your path  
as a nefarious duo with Octo was tons of fun too...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Ah man, everything seemed so great back then.  
A calm and peaceful life, full of laughs, where everyone was happy.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I'm not saying there weren't times when I felt scared or sad...  
But looking back, even those feel like good memories.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...? Whatever are you talking about?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah, you wouldn't know, would you?  
I'll fill you in on all that stuff later.  
But it's about time for breakfast, so let's go eat first.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Very well, then.  
...My lord, is something wrong?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  ...  
`Tag 6`  
**Kokkoro：**  
You are gazing most intently at Miss Labyrista...  
I cannot imagine she would be pleased to be stared at so,  
so perhaps we should leave her be.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Actually, I don't think she'd really mind...  
Our Labyrista has never been the shy and sensitive type.  
  
**Muimi：**  
And she even seems to think of {player}  
like a little brother or something, too.
