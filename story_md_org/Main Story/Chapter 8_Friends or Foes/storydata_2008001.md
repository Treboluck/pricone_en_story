## Subtitle: Three Little Sleepyheads
  
### Place: Prano Plains
  
**Misogi：**  
All right...  
Mimi, wake up, wake up!  
Here, the sunlight'll wash the sleepiness away!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ohhhh...?  
Misogi... I don't need hugs now...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahaha! You're heavier than you look, Mimi!  
I guess you really are the oldest!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I-it's bad manners to tell a girl that she weighs a lot!  
I read that in a book!  
  
**Mimi：**  
I don't mind...  
But please stop hugging me now...  
It's so warm, it's making me all sleepy again...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahaha! Kids do have high body heat!  
Mr. {player} told me that!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Urgh...  
Why are these two always so happy-go-lucky?  
I need to be the responsible one...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Enough about that...!  
Attention, everyone! Listen!  
Something is clearly wrong here, right?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
The three of us were playing within the safety of Landosol...  
But we woke up out here in a place I've never seen.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Wow, you're right!  
This isn't a dream or anything, right?  
Misogi, can you pinch my cheek?  
  
**Misogi：**  
You'd cry if I pinched you, Mimi...  
Besides, we weren't playing, Kyoka!  
We were doing Little Lyrical guild stuff!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
*Playing* at guild stuff.  
All we do is copy what the grown-ups do in their real guilds...  
It would be more use focusing on our actual schoolwork.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Well then, you don't have to join in, Kyoka!  
Me and Mimi can do stuff on our own!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I... I didn't say I wanted to be left out!  
Without me around, who knows what you'd get up to...  
Someone needs to keep a proper eye on you!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Eheheh.  
Usually Mr. {player} watches over us like a daddy.  
But lately, he's been sort of busy...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Yeah... Must be tough being a grown-up with a job!  
I wanna play with him again soon!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Yep, me too! I miss playing with Mr. Nice Guy!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Yes, yes... We're drifting off topic again!  
Shouldn't we be thinking about how we're going to  
get back to Landosol?  
  
**Misogi：**  
I'd rather leave the tricky stuff to you, Kyoka...  
But this *is* a pretty big deal. Guess we oughtta work together.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ummm... My mommy always tells me if I get lost outside,  
I should head for the Tower of Sol...  
Do you guys see the tower anywhere?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hmmm...?  
With all these trees and rocks around,  
I can't see much of anything.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahh! Misogi, don't stick your head out!  
There might be monsters wandering around out there,  
so we need to keep ourselves hidden!  
  
**Misogi：**  
But we can't get home till we find the tower!  
Don't worry, it'll be fine! We're pretty tough, right?!  
We can handle a few random monsters! Probably!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
\"Probably\" isn't good enough!  
There's no second chances with real monsters, you know?  
We need to think carefully before we act!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
We've only been able to defeat monsters in the past  
thanks to {player} increasing our strength  
with that strange power of his.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I'm sure your parents have told you to run if you see a monster.  
Children of our age don't stand a chance against them, normally.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Uhh, well, I guess...?  
Then let's go find Mr. {player} first!  
As long as we've got him, we'll never lose!  
  
**Misogi：**  
D'you think he'll come if I call?  
Heeeey! Mr. {player}! ☆  
  
**Kyoka：**  
D-don't raise your voice like that!  
You'll attract the monsters!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Besides, what are the chances that {player}  
would be randomly wandering around out here?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Eheheh... I dunno what happened,  
but you two are so lively today! This is fun!
