{player} and Kokkoro arrive at the cafeteria. As everyone gathers, they exchange greetings and share a friendly, if somewhat raucous, morning meal together.
  
## Subtitle: A Hearty Breakfast
  
**Masaki：**  
Hello, ladies! Good morning!  
And a fine, refreshing morning it is indeed!  
  
**Masaki：**  
Though of course, it's a shame we cannot see the sun  
from this hideout below the ground.  
Still, I feel it in the air! This new day will be a fine one for sure!  
  
**Masaki：**  
On a day as fine as this,  
I feel certain we will succeed even at rescuing Mistress Neneka!  
In fact, this is our best chance! Would you not agree?  
  
**Masaki：**  
As such, I believe we should set out at once for the palace!  
Come, my friends, let us join forces and do battle!  
Hahaha! ☆  
  
**Muimi：**  
Uh, there's a lot of comments I could make...  
But for now, let's just say your vibe's a bit much to deal with  
when I've just woken up.  
  
**Masaki：**  
Hahaha! A shocking retort indeed!  
You have quite the little attitude there, Miss Novem!  
  
**Masaki：**  
Thank you kindly!  
Your sardonic words are just the medicine I needed  
to clear my drowsy head!  
  
**Muimi：**  
When you put a positive spin on anything I say,  
it actually kind of messes with my mood...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Being bright and cheery's great and all, but let's remember  
your injuries aren't healed yet, so settle down a bit.  
  
**Muimi：**  
We're still in the process of working out a plan to save Neneka.  
Thing is, ever since we snuck into the palace last time,  
they've tightened their security, and it's really no joke.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Coming up with a real surefire plan will take a bit longer.  
So you'll need to be patient.  
  
**Masaki：**  
I understand that! But these feelings are hard to suppress!  
For the first time in my life, I find myself sleeping less than soundly!  
Out of worry for my mistress!  
  
**Masaki：**  
Ahhh, Mistress Neneka! Tell me you are safe!  
I swear, I will save you no matter what it takes!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Yeah. And to do that, we need to be well prepared.  
If you ask me, the best way to heal yourself up  
is to eat a good, hearty meal.  
  
**Muimi：**  
So come on—let's have breakfast!  
Who was supposed to be making it today?  
  
**Rajraj：**  
It is my turn.  
But today, Miss Shizuru and Miss Rino have taken over the kitchen  
and are competing to cook a meal that will satisfy our guests.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Oh, morning to you too, Rajraj!  
I saw you having a little chat with Masaki—what was that about?  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Ah, yes. There still remain many blank areas in my knowledge,  
so he was helping to enlighten me on a few points.  
It turns out he is remarkably well-informed in general.  
  
**Masaki：**  
Haha! Well, that is quite the compliment!  
It is true that I have long assisted with Mistress Neneka's research,  
so I have some familiarity with academia! And I am decently educated!  
  
**Muimi：**  
...Right, I remember now. You were a civil servant, weren't you?  
Not sure how much of that's been reflected  
in the world's current state, though...  
  
**Muimi：**  
But you're still the same person. I can't imagine your basic  
intelligence level would have changed too much.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Though people like Rajraj, who've been turned into total amnesiacs,  
do end up lacking a little in common sense and stuff.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Haha. I have been doing my best to learn  
a little more of this world's ways,  
so as to avoid becoming too much of a nuisance.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Well, hey, you're one of the freaking Seven Crowns.  
You can't've been an idiot to begin with, so with a little effort,  
you'll probably wind up smarter than I am.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. Mr. \"Rajraj\"... Is that your name?  
Yesterday, I believe you saved us from the laboratory's explosion.  
I must thank you for that.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So it seems you are another of the Seven Crowns, as well?  
On reflection, I do recall seeing a name like that in those documents...  
I think it said... Rajni... ehm...  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Rajnikanth is my name, my dear young lady.  
But I have been nicknamed \"Rajraj,\"  
so please feel free to call me that instead.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As you wish, Mr. Rajraj.  
I should introduce myself as well. My name is Kokkoro.  
And this is my lord, {player}.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Nice to meet you.  
**Choice: (2)**  Aren't you hot in that getup?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rajraj：**  
Likewise.  
It is good to make your acquaintance, Master {player}.  
I hope we can forge an enduring friendship.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Rajraj：**  
Haha. Well, I can see why you might think it strange  
that I dress this way indoors,  
 but my personal circumstances  
make it unwise to leave my skin exposed.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Particularly in front of younger folk such as Miss Kokkoro,  
I cannot remove this cloak. I fear I might cause some alarm.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Muimi：**  
Uhhh, I only just noticed this, but...  
Tiana... I mean, Pecorine isn't with you guys, huh?  
Do you know where she is? If she's still sleeping, I oughtta wake her.  
  
**Masaki：**  
Oh, I do believe she is helping the others with their work in the kitchen.  
I overheard her saying something about how she would like to repay  
her hosts' kindness with a good meal!  
  
**Muimi：**  
I see. Hmm... She's the one thing I'm still not sure about in all this.  
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere before...  
But just who was she? Hmmmm...  
  
**Christina：**  
My dears! Ever so sorry to interrupt your chat, but take your seats,  
if you would! We can't serve the food with you standing there!  
If you refuse, I'll just have to kick you aside!  
  
**Daigo：**  
Geez, no need for all that...  
But uh, is there gonna be room for all these people?  
  
**Christina：**  
I'm sure we can just about manage.  
Now, big boy... we have plenty of plates to carry,  
so let's get a move on and set them on the table, shall we?  
  
**Daigo：**  
Yeah, yeah... I'm on it.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Ahahah!  
I was wondering where the two of you had gotten to!  
Nice to see you're actually helping out, mm-hm!  
  
**Christina：**  
We are freeloaders here; it would be rude not to.  
To become a mere eyesore leeching off my hosts' kindness  
would not suit my tastes at all!  
  
**Christina：**  
Besides, this kind of domestic activity is all rather new to me.  
It keeps me entertained to an extent. At the very least,  
this life is downright heavenly compared to my time in that cell.
