## Subtitle: A Labyrinthine Harem
  
**Pecorine：**  
Good morning, everyone! Breakfast is served!  
Let's get those bellies nice and full!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I wanted to repay everyone for all their help, so I whipped up a feast!  
I've gotta say I was surprised that this Labyrinth hideout  
has such a well-equipped kitchen!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
There aren't many like it even back in Landosol!  
I was so thrilled to use it, I might have made a few too many dishes!  
How crazy is that?! ☆  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahaha... Our furniture and facilities are all made  
using our guildmaster's \"object manipulation,\"  
so they're pretty good quality in general.  
  
**Rino：**  
She doesn't always have time for the details,  
so a lot of them are just pretty shells with nothing on the inside...  
  
**Rino：**  
But she does have a thing for cooking up sweet treats,  
so she did a great job with the kitchen.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
For as much as she loves making crepes and other desserts,  
her skills never seem to get any better...  
Why could that be? Just a natural lack of talent for cooking?  
  
**Rino：**  
Hmmm...  
 It is pretty mysterious!  
But you know what they say—do what you love, and the sixes will flow!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
\"And success will follow,\" I think you mean, Rino! ♪  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hey, you guys! Quit chattering over there  
and come sit down for breakfast!  
We can't start eating till everyone's ready!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Right!  
But I'm not sure if there's space for this many people,  
so we'll stick to serving the food for now.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
If we all pack in too close together,  
it'll be awkward to use our knives and forks.  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, but Pecorine, you should sit down and eat with the others!  
You can leave the rest of the serving stuff to us! ☆  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, yes.  
You're a guest, after all. We want to make you feel at home.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Okay then!  
To be honest, I appreciate it. My tummy's rumbling like crazy!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine, please take a seat here.  
My lord... I think Miss Pecorine could use a bit more space,  
so could we shift together a little?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Got it.  
**Choice: (2)**  Want to sit on my lap?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank you very much.  
I would not mind if you nestled a little closer to me... ♪  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh...  
M-my lord, I am not a small child any longer,  
so I would find it a little embarrassing to settle upon your knees...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Wow, you two are as lovey-dovey as ever.  
It's nice—like a family!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hmm? I'm sorry—what did you just say?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
{player}'s got all the family he needs in Rino and me!  
Well... I wouldn't be against starting a bigger family...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But what should we do, Rino?!  
While we've been hiding out and laying low,  
has {player} grown too far apart from us?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
We need to reinforce our position as his big and little sisters!  
  
**Rino：**  
You're totally right, Big Sis!  
It's a bit awkward claiming to be his only family when we're  
not actually related...  
 but I'm with you on the basic sentiment!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
That's the spirit!  
I knew I could count on you, Rino!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
So here goes nothing!  
Time to unleash the power of a real big sister!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
{player}...  
Lean over here and let your big sister feed you! Say \"ahhh\"! ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Hey—don't be too rough with him, Sis!  
Look, you've made his mouth all messy.  
I'll be a good little sister and clean him right up! There you go! ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmph...  
Feeding my lord in this way is supposed to be my duty...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
However... It is true that I am only his humble attendant.  
No matter how kindly he treats me, I am not his family,  
so perhaps I should concede this point...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heheh.  
Hey, Kokkoro...  
It wouldn't hurt to follow your own heart once in a while!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Come on—if you hesitate too long,  
someone might steal {player} away from you!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I-I may belong to my lord alone,  
but that does not make him my property in return...  
It makes little sense to speak of him being \"stolen\" from me.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahahah... There's such a thing as being *too* dutiful!  
It would be a shame to only realize what you had after you'd lost it.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Not sure I get it, but you guys sure seem to be having fun...  
I've got important stuff to talk about,  
so it'd be great if you could settle down a bit.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Well, I guess that can wait till after breakfast.  
  
**Christina：**  
Indeed.  
Ordinarily, it is bad manners to converse too much during a meal.  
  
**Christina：**  
But I must say... This {player} lad  
has certainly built quite the little harem for himself.  
As a fellow male, do you feel jealous of him at all, big boy?  
  
**Daigo：**  
...Why're you asking me?  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh, you just seemed the least likely to be popular with the ladies.  
What do you say? If you really are jealous, say \"ahhh\"  
and I'll feed you myself! ♪  
  
**Daigo：**  
You wanna die?!  
I-I ain't jealous of that kid or anything!  
Why should I care what he gets up to?!  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Haha.  
Such a fervent denial actually makes you sound less convincing.  
  
**Masaki：**  
No need to feel embarrassed, young man!  
Your feelings are only natural for a healthy youth!  
  
**Muimi：**  
There, there. Don't feel down, Daigo.  
C'mon, look, I'll feed you a spoonful too, so cheer up, okay?  
Go on, say \"ah\"!  
  
**Daigo：**  
Oh, shadduuuuup!  
Why does everybody gotta be all up in my face?!
