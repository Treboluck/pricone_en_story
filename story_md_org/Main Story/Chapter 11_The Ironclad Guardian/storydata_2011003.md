**Jun：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh...! This overwhelming hostile stare...  
She seems very powerful, so I fear we may have  
little chance of victory in combat.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh, her aura alone terrifies me...  
If that woman really is a friend of my lord's,  
I think our best chance may be to appeal to her good nature.  
  
**Jun：**  
Would you be so kind as to show yourselves?  
Subtle machinations are not my forte,  
so if at all possible, I would prefer to face you head-on.  
  
**Jun：**  
Still, if you insist on mounting a lowly ambush, do as you wish.  
But in that case, I cannot promise to treat you kindly.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh... Her aura grew in intensity!  
It feels as though she is physically towering over us!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
W-wait one moment!  
We do not wish to make an enemy of you!  
  
**Jun：**  
Hm? A child?  
Merely lost...? No, that seems unlikely.  
  
**Jun：**  
But regardless...  
Even if you are an innocent tyke in the wrong place, it changes nothing.  
All who infiltrate these walls must face equal punishment.  
  
**Jun：**  
By Her Majesty's law, your deeds are forbidden.  
Violations are not to be permitted.  
Minor though it may be, this is still a form of treason.  
  
**Jun：**  
I would give you a stern scolding and send you off home...  
But that will hardly suffice in this case.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ehm...  
I am... not sure how to explain our presence here.  
Wh-what should we do, my lord?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Jun! It's me!  
`Tag 1`  
**Jun：**  
Hmm?  
Ah... So it really is you, young {player}.  
I fancied I heard your voice. If only I had been mistaken.  
  
**Jun：**  
How very sad.  
It brings me no pleasure to take the life of a fine young man.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh... Even though he showed himself...  
Her hostile aura has not so much as wavered!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In the majority of cases,  
I find my lord's acquaintances are willing to listen to reason...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But perhaps this is a cruel exception...  
Wh-what should we do?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Try your best to get through to her.  
**Choice: (3)**  Attempt a surprise attack.  
`Tag 2`  
**Jun：**  
...  
  
**Jun：**  
Hm, I see. So you infiltrated the palace walls to save a precious friend.  
Putting your life on the line against terrible odds,  
like a prince from a fairy tale.  
  
**Jun：**  
An inspiring tale.  
I applaud your courage. It moves me to tears.  
  
**Jun：**  
Yet... I cannot show mercy  
to a criminal who has violated our sacred laws.  
  
**Jun：**  
It does pain me to do this.  
But as I have explained, this is my duty.  
I must strike down the treasonous, even if that means you.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Huh? M-my lord... What are you doing?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My ever-compassionate lord, mounting a cold offensive?  
  
**Jun：**  
...How awful.  
Raising your sword against me without warning...  
But of course, I need not even defend against such a strike.  
  
**Jun：**  
If you mean to ambush me, at least consider your timing more carefully.  
Your intent to attack was all too obvious from your movements.  
  
**Jun：**  
Besides, I am not a motionless statue for you to target.  
When struck, I strike back.  
  
**Jun：**  
If you wished to move me from my station,  
you should have aimed to take my life with your first blow.  
  
**Jun：**  
But instead, you have rendered me fully alert.  
I confess I was not in a fully battle-ready state,  
but even I cannot remain passive when directly attacked.  
  
**Jun：**  
How disappointing, young man.  
You just squandered your one and only chance.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Jun：**  
To explain what just happened,  
the suit of armor standing before the dungeons is empty.  
  
**Jun：**  
All it contains is a magical receptor to emit my voice.  
I have a new subordinate who is talented with magic, you see.  
  
**Jun：**  
The more wary you grow of the empty armor,  
the less likely you are to detect my approach from behind.  
I am not fond of such trickery... But young Octo is quite the rogue.  
  
**Jun：**  
Still, it is effective.  
This is checkmate. I suggest you come quietly and resist no further.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Never!  
Not while I can still fight!  
  
**Jun：**  
You cannot defeat me, you poor girl...  
Since you learned that I am acquainted with {player},  
no matter how you try to threaten me, I sense no intent to kill.  
  
**Jun：**  
You're a kind soul.  
But that is precisely why you cannot take my life.  
  
**Jun：**  
You are outmatched.  
So I'm afraid this is the end for you.
