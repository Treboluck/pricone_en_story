### Place: Landosol Palace Corridor
  
**Narration：**  
Meanwhile, {player} and Kokkoro have entered the  
palace and begun their search for the captive Pecorine.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Stand back, my lord!  
Yaaahhhh!  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
Wh-who are you people?  
Intruders... G-guaaaahhh?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Phew...  
Thanks to our Labyrinth friends and their distraction,  
the palace interior does seem less well-guarded than usual.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
They are maintaining a certain level of security,  
so we cannot be complacent,  
but this much is simple enough for me to handle.  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
Nn... gghh...  
Who are you, intruders?  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
Opposing the palace? The state itself?! You mad fools!  
Your fate will surely be an ugly... Ngaahhh?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Quiet, now.  
It would be inconvenient if your cries brought more guards rushing over.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Just like the other guards we encountered along the way,  
I will gag his mouth...  
For the moment, he can sit himself down here.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
All the knights responsible for guarding the palace  
seem to wear face-covering helmets for some reason,  
so from a distance, it will appear that he is simply napping.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This will only buy us a little time...  
But these guards are all merely doing their duty.  
It would be wrong for us to take their lives.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Agreed.  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's hurry onwards.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. I find it most reassuring  
when you affirm my judgment, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As long as our hearts are in tune,  
I can do what I must without hesitation.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed. It is just as you say.  
Right now, we have not a moment to waste.  
Let us proceed swiftly to find Miss Pecorine and rescue her.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
These various musings can wait until she is safe and sound.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Take my hand, my lord. Just ahead is a stairway,  
and at its base should lie  
 the palace's dreaded dungeons...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If our information is correct,  
these dungeons are where we will find the captive Miss Pecorine.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It was extraordinarily helpful of this Miss Neneka  
to share such detailed information with us.  
Without it, we may have wandered the palace utterly lost.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The palace dungeons are a most secure facility,  
fortified to prevent the escape of enemies of the throne,  
or so we have been told.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Even if we reach it, freeing Miss Pecorine from her cell  
will be most difficult.  
 Ideally, we would like to find a guard on duty  
and steal the keys from them...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But if there is no guard, or we are unable to obtain the keys,  
please use your ability to increase my strength to its limit.  
Subtle it will not be, but I will strive to open the cell by force.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Not the most reliable of plans, I must admit,  
but it is the best we have right now.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
At any rate, we must hurry and find the cell...  
 Ahhh?!

**Jun：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Be on your guard, my lord.  
In front of the stairs to the dungeons,  
there stands a most imposing-looking figure.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That elite guard must doubtless be the dungeon's last line of defense.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Is that... Jun?  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh...?  
Ehmm... Is that guard an acquaintance of yours?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You certainly are well-connected, my lord.  
Still, I suppose this is a fine turn of events.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If the two of you are friends,  
simply explaining our purpose may be sufficient to avoid combat.  
  
**Jun：**  
I can tell you're there.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Wha?!  
 I took the utmost care to hide our presence as we moved,  
yet she detected us at this distance!  
 Her senses must be sharp...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What now?  
If she is a friend of yours, shall we simply show ourselves  
and attempt to reason with her?  
  
**Jun：**  
Intruders, eh?  
How vexing. This prison is not my usual station...  
  
**Jun：**  
But my orders are to eliminate all who come near this place.  
Don't take this personally. I merely serve the throne.
