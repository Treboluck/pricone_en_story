**Narration：**  
In the midst of their adventures in the Tower of Sol,  
the members of Twinkle Wish find themselves caught up  
in a very strange phenomenon.  
  
**Narration：**  
Upon reaching the tower's upper levels  
and making contact with a mysterious crystallized girl named Ameth,  
Rei and Hiyori alone are transported to an unfamiliar world.  
  
**Narration：**  
Though they retain only vague memories of their  
dream conversation with Ameth,  
Rei and Hiyori are left with the strangest of sensations.  
  
**Narration：**  
Meanwhile Yui, who was left behind in the real world,  
frantically attempts to awaken her two unconscious friends.  
  
**Yui：**  
Rei! Hiyori!  
  
**Rei：**  
...  
Wha...?!  
  
**Rei：**  
H-huh?  
Where am I?  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh—thank goodness! Rei!  
I kept calling your name and shaking you,  
but not even magic would wake you up! I was so scared!  
  
**Rei：**  
Ahh, Yui...  
I'm not sure I follow, but I'm sorry.  
I can hardly believe I lost consciousness in the middle of an adventure...  
  
**Rei：**  
Mmm...  
My thoughts seem a little hazy.  
I'm having trouble getting my bearings.  
  
**Rei：**  
How careless of me.  
...  
W-wait, huh?  
Why are we back here in Landosol?  
  
**Yui：**  
I don't know...  
  
**Yui：**  
I tried everything I could think of to wake you up,  
but then there was this flash of light,  
and before I knew it, we were here in the middle of the main street.  
  
**Yui：**  
I was worried you might get run over by a carriage,  
so I carried you both over here to this bench!  
  
**Yui：**  
It was tough...  
But thank goodness you woke up in the end!  
  
**Rei：**  
Right.  
I really am sorry for worrying you, Yui.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Mmm~! Ahh, what a good nap!  
I feel all refreshed!  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh, you're up too, Hiyori?  
That's a relief...  
You both seemed troubled in your sleep, so I was worried...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Eheheh...  
I don't really get it, but I'm right as rain!  
And full of energy to boot!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Weaaghh?! That scared me!  
Huh? What was it? An explosion?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Actually... it's pretty lively here, huh?  
Oh right, I guess it's the first day  
of that big festival in Landosol today...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Heheh. Let's go visit all the stalls together!  
Can't miss out on the festival fun!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Wait, why are we in Landosol, anyway?  
Did we step on another warp trap?  
  
**Rei：**  
Let's leave that question for later.  
Right now...  
 Be on your guard, everyone.  
I think we may have a situation on our hands.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Now—allies of justice! Heroes! All my beloved despicable foes!  
Let's take back our good old days,  
 even if it's only a momentary dream!  
  
**Yui：**  
Whaaaa?!  
Ahhh, how did this happen?  
What is that girl even talking about?  
  
**Yui：**  
It's strange...  
I don't understand, but her words sting.  
  
**Yui：**  
This is my fault? All of it?  
What does she mean by that? What could my \"wish\" be?
