**Jun：**  
After such a perfect happily-ever-after,  
I hate to be the one to interrupt,  
but I'm afraid I still can't let any of you leave.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh.  
At last, you are beginning to act like your usual self, Miss Pecorine.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Of course, I have to suppose after life in confinement,  
your legs must not be in the best shape.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It may in fact be quite logical  
to allow my lord to carry you in his arms for now.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
C'mon... I wasn't in the cell for that long, was I?  
But with no Royal Equipment,  
I'm not even as strong as an average person...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So it really is a huge help if you can carry me.  
Lemme snuggle up close! Mmm~! ♪  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You're making it hard to run...  
**Choice: (3)**  Hug me as tight as you like.  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha...  
 Sorry, sorry! ♪  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh~?  
Bold words indeed! Here I go, then...  
 Squeeeeeeze! ♪  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh.  
 Right now, my arms are weaker too,  
so I have to hold on tight, or I'll fall...  
After my little love confession back there,  
 this is a bit awkward, huh?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. Speaking of your Royal Equipment...  
Ideally, we should probably retrieve it. We will surely be forced  
to fight more enemy guards before we can fully escape...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And my lord and I are so thoroughly exhausted...  
It would be a great boon to us if you could fight also.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmmm...  
They took my Equipment away when they first threw me in the cell...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If it hasn't been moved since,  
I think it'll be stored in the palace vault.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You know, this is my home, so I know the whole layout.  
If we take a little detour, we could head over and grab it...  
What do you think?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Personally, I'd rather leave it for later  
and focus on getting you guys to safety...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But if I can't fight, I guess that'll be easier said than done.  
Kinda tricky, huh.  
I really am being nothing but a nuisance this time around, huh?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Not at all.  
You have always been a great help to us, Miss Pecorine.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
When my lord and I arrived in Landosol,  
we were both utterly unprepared for life in the city.  
It is thanks to the Gourmet Guild that we are able to live so comfortably.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
At least allow us to repay that favor.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Minor wounds? Fatigue?  
 A little danger? No problem at all.  
If we can conquer the outrageous dishes you prepare,  
we can survive anything.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha.  
 You really have grown strong.  
You're so dependable... Both of you.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...How crazy is that?! ☆
