**Royal Knight A：**  
Are you sure we shouldn't have done something  
back at the dungeons, Vice-Captain Octo?  
  
**Octo：**  
Mm-hm.  
 I'll take care of things there,  
so you guys hurry to the palace depths.  
We can't slack off on defending Her Majesty's own chambers.  
  
**Octo：**  
Intruders inside our royal palace?  
 That's disgraceful enough already,  
but letting harm come to Her Majesty would be far worse.  
  
**Octo：**  
All of us here would be executed, and that's only if we're lucky...  
Worst case, this whole nation could be turned upside down.  
You don't want that, do you?  
  
**Octo：**  
Besides, if I had to die for my country,  
I'd at least like to make it a glorious death.  
 Wouldn't you?  
  
**Royal Knight A：**  
Yes! You're right...  
We did hear word of intruders in the palace depths as well!  
Of course that should be the priority!  
  
**Royal Knight B：**  
Let's move, men!  
Our duty is to protect Her Majesty!  
  
**Octo：**  
Ahaha.  
 So old-fashioned.  
Makes them easy to handle, at least...  
  
**Octo：**  
Oh boy...  
If anyone finds out about this, my head'll be on the chopping block.  
It's treason, plain and simple.  
  
**Octo：**  
Still, I wouldn't just let them kill me,  
and I never liked this job anyway, so I don't mind leaving it.  
  
**Octo：**  
Fighting for Nightmare...  
Being a defender of justice just isn't my style.  
  
**Octo：**  
Maybe I should take this opportunity to slip away in the confusion.  
  
**Octo：**  
I'll go into hiding for a while  
and look into the things that have been bugging me.  
  
**Octo：**  
While messing with my own mind  
to protect it from that nasty brainwashing magic,  
I did come across some pretty intriguing memories...  
  
**Octo：**  
So I'll follow up on those.  
'Cause the last thing I want  
is to dance like a puppet to somebody else's tune.  
  
**Octo：**  
Everyone has their own pride, even villains.  
And those who'd sneer and walk all over that pride are our enemies.  
Isn't that right, Novem?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine!  
I have unlocked the cell door. Please come out at once!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Miss Pecorine?  
 Hurry!  
We are in the palace, the heart of enemy territory!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If we take too long,  
new enemies will surely appear and bar our escape for good!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
 You're right.  
It would be a big shame to get caught after all this, wouldn't it?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But... I'm sorry.  
The sheer relief has made me all weak in the knees!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Honestly...  
You really can be hopeless sometimes.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
However...  
It is wonderful to see you safe, Miss Pecorine.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yeah. Thanks so much, Kokkoro.  
And you too, {player}...  
I really thought I wasn't going to make it this time.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh. When things get really crazy,  
I can't even say \"How crazy is that?\", can I?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hug Pecorine tightly.  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Whaaugh?! What a shock!  
You shouldn't hug people so suddenly, {player}!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This is kind of backwards.  
Normally I'm the one asking \"Can I hug you?\", aren't I?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And when you say yes,  
I get so happy, I hug you over and over...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
E-eheheh...  
I probably didn't need to keep asking every time.  
It's not as though either of you ever said no.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But you know, I was always scared.  
'Cause I... 'Cause I'd had everything taken from me...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
My father, my mother, the whole life I knew...  
All of it had been snatched from my grasp.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So I was scared...  
Every time I asked if it was OK, I was shaking inside.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Always thinking, what if... what if the answer is no?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If all of you were to forget about me as well...  
If you treated me like a stranger, I couldn't take it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Because it was you who gave me everything.  
Those dinnertimes with the people I love.  
The simple happy times I thought I'd lost.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
{player}, Kokkoro, Karyl...  
All of you in the Gourmet Guild  
saved me from that horrible emptiness.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You gave me this lovely name, \"Pecorine\"...  
Saying it with a smile as we enjoyed all those delicious meals...  
All of that just made me so happy.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Happier than I could bear...  
So I was terrified of losing it all again.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And I almost did lose it all...  
But you guys fought to the bitter end...  
Put your lives on the line to come here and save me.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Thank you.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Thank you so much, both of you!  
I really, really love you guys more than anything! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Is it OK if I feel that way?  
Is it OK for me to love you guys, as my precious friends?  
Am I really allowed to have that kind of happiness?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Of course.  
Nobody can forbid you from having that.  
You need not even ask our permission.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
To love another person, to find happiness,  
is a freedom we all equally share.  
Is that not correct, my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh.  
You see? My lord, too, is furiously nodding his head in agreement.  
Indeed, it is a simple fact, obvious even to a child such as myself.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Wipe away Pecorine's tears.  
`Tag 2`

**Pecorine：**  
Uwahh?!  
Ahhh... What's this now, {player}...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Your face is so close... Is this a kiss?  
Are you going to kiss me?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I-I guess the prince who rescues the captive princess  
probably does have the right to do that, but...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please calm yourself, Miss Pecorine.  
I think my lord is trying to wipe your tears away.  
  
![201100602.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/201100602.webp)  
**Pecorine：**  
Awahh?  
 Ahaha, how silly of me!  
I was crying this whole time... I'm such a baby! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But of course.  
This is {player}, after all.  
I shouldn't have gotten the wrong idea.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. Well, if you do wish to have your kiss...  
I suppose I might choose this moment to briefly avert my eyes,  
so please do as you will.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No, wait!  
 It really would be wrong of me  
to do that while he's got no memories!  
I'd feel like I was taking advantage of an innocent little kid!

**Pecorine：**  
And after all, before he lost his memories,  
he had his own precious companions...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm sure at least one of them  
must have had special feelings for him, too.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You're a dashing guy, after all, {player}.  
So I can't snatch you away from them like that.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But...  
If someday your memories return,  
 and you still care about me...  
If you still feel the same,  
 is it OK if I kiss you then?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No...  
My kind, precious {player}...  
  
![201100604.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/201100604.webp)  
**Pecorine：**  
My little weakling who fought so hard  
and came all this way to save me...  
My prince in shining armor...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Is it OK  
 if I fall in love with you?
