**Pecorine：**  
Hiyaaahhhh!  
  
### Place: Elizabeth Park
  
**Pecorine：**  
And we're here!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Looks like we made it  
to the place where that smoke signal was coming from!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Beautifully done!  
**Choice: (2)**  You're not hurt, are you?  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha, you say that like it was all me.  
You were a pretty big help too, you know!  
Powering us up with that mysterious ability of yours!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Nope, not a single scratch!  
I'm a lot tougher than I look, you know!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But thanks for the concern!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
...Anyway, best not let our guard down just yet.  
Umm... Hello? Is anyone here?  
We saw your signal and came as fast as we could!  
  
**???：**  
Wahh!  
Wh-what's going on?!  
Who are you people?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hm?  
Umm, are you... a monster?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But... you just spoke human language, didn't you?  
I don't think there are many monsters  
that are capable of intelligent speech...  
  
**???：**  
How rude! Of course I'm not a monster!  
Well, I'll admit I do get that a lot...  
But I'll have you know I'm perfectly human at heart!  
  
**Rin：**  
Lima! You're OK!  
Thank goodness...  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh? Rin, it's you!  
Didn't you run off to the city to get help?  
I didn't expect to see you back so soon.  
  
**Rin：**  
Uh-huh, I ran into {player} just out in the mountains!  
Along with this crazy girl who's his friend!  
They both came to help us out!  
  
**Lima：**  
Really?  
Wow!  
 {player}, it really is you!  
Howdy!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Howdy.  
`Tag 4`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha!  
You sure do know a lot of people, {player}.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Anyway...  
Sorry for saying those rude things just now.  
Are you another member of Elizabeth Park?  
  
**Lima：**  
Yup! Though I'm really just a freeloader.  
When the monsters attacked,  
I brought the others here to hide in the barn.  
  
**Lima：**  
It all happened so suddenly,  
there was no time to escape from the farm entirely.  
  
**Rin：**  
I was still back in the farmhouse 'cause I overslept...  
So the monsters heading for the barn weren't in my way.  
That's why only I could get out...  
  
**Lima：**  
Right. I was hoping you at least would make it  
out of here to safety...  
  
**Lima：**  
But I guess you came back in the end.  
You're so weird sometimes, Rin.  
Usually you're the first to run from anything that sounds like work.  
  
**Rin：**  
Even I know there are times when it would be wrong  
to run away!  
  
**Rin：**  
You guys at Elizabeth Park are my family...  
I don't wanna leave any of you behind.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Family, huh...  
Well, that certainly does sound worth putting your life on the line for.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Anyway,  
I'll fight the monsters some more and keep them distracted,  
so you guys take the opportunity to get out of here.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
For some reason, monsters seem to be drawn to me...  
So if I try to hold their attention,  
you should be able to find an opening and escape.  
  
**Lima：**  
W-wait, are you serious?  
That's far too dangerous for you!  
You'll be killed!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha!  
  
Putting our lives on the line to protect the people  
is supposed to be \"our\" duty, or at least it was.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
By the way, have we got all the survivors here?  
Is there anyone who didn't make it to the barn?  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh?  
Actually... Where are Mahiru and Shiorin?!  
  
**Lima：**  
About that...  
Mahiru got herself really worried  
about the cows and sheep that we raise here at the farm.  
  
**Lima：**  
So she headed out to the pastures.  
She thinks of all the animals as family too, you know.  
  
**Lima：**  
As for Shiori...  
She went running off towards the monsters  
with a look of determination on her face.  
  
**Lima：**  
Saying that it was her duty  
to protect Elizabeth Park from danger.  
  
**Rin：**  
That's not right!  
Surely  
 it's my job to protect the farm!  
  
**Rin：**  
Shiorin just comes and helps out a lot  
because she knows I'm always slacking off...  
  
**Lima：**  
That does sound like Shiori...  
She takes things so seriously.  
  
**Lima：**  
Also, you remember how she found that stray  
baby monster and decided to take care of it?  
She even named it Nyatt.  
  
**Lima：**  
Well, I'm afraid it looks like she got it into her head  
that these monsters might be trying to rescue their baby,  
and that's why they attacked.  
  
**Lima：**  
So she decided this must be all her fault,  
and ran off with Nyatt straight towards the monsters.  
She thought they might go away if she handed the baby over.  
  
**Rin：**  
Uhh, I don't think Nyatt's got much to do with this...  
It's not like those monsters  
are all the same species or anything.  
  
**Rin：**  
And they don't look like they're searching for anything.  
More like just smashing things up at random.  
  
**???：**  
You got that right!  
It's just like Rinrin says, y'all!  
  
**???：**  
Those nasty ol' monsters  
just seem to be smashin' up whatever they can find.  
Long as you know when to dodge, they're just a buncha big dummies.  
  
**Rin：**  
Wha— Mahiru?!  
Thank goodness, you're alive!  
Where have you been?!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ahaha!  
You think I'd go dyin' on y'all  
while my animal pals were still in danger?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
For the moment, I went an' set 'em loose on the mountain paths.  
Better than lettin' 'em near those monsters, yeah?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
If we're lucky, they'll get away,  
and some village nearby will take 'em in for us.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
It'll be tough trackin' 'em all down  
and makin' sure they're safe afterwards...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But hey, we raised 'em all up to be big and strong!  
They ain't about to let a few monsters get the better of 'em!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
An' it looks like it's only the monsters that've gone all crazy.  
Our trusty animals were bein' nice an' well-behaved,  
so they should be headin' outta here just like I told 'em to.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Now all that's left is getting you guys outta here too.  
The farm buildings might be pretty beat-up,  
but as long as y'all are safe, we'll figure things out!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, and don't worry,  
I've got Shioshio right here!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wouldja believe it, I found her  
passed out in the middle of a pack of monsters!  
If I hadn't spotted her, she woulda been flat as a pancake by now!  
  
**Shiori：**  
...  
  
**Rin：**  
Shiorin!  
You dummy...  
Don't do crazy things like that!  
  
**Shiori：**  
I... I'm so sorry.  
I suppose I made you all worry...  
  
**Shiori：**  
But I'm always so sickly,  
I don't know how long I'll live anyway...  
  
**Shiori：**  
So I thought if I could put my life to good use  
protecting all of yours...  
Then at least I wouldn't have been born for nothing...  
  
**Lima：**  
Honestly...  
Don't you dare say a thing like that ever again,  
all right, Shiori?  
  
**Lima：**  
Nobody wants you to throw your life away.  
There's not a soul here at Elizabeth Park  
who thinks you're anything close to worthless!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Right...  
I'm very sorry.  
Lima, Mahiru, Rin... I'm sorry, everyone...  
  
**Lima：**  
Well, good!  
But I think that's enough scolding for now.  
For the moment, let's think about getting out of here.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Right...  
Actually, I think I might know the best direction to escape.  
Please, let me lead the way.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I noticed the monsters' rampage seems to be centered  
on a particular spot in the mountains.  
So the further away from there we get, the safer we'll be.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm...  
Sorry to butt in.  
Could you show me where that \"particular spot\" is?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
There's something that's been bothering me about  
these monsters' behavior.  
 I think there's a possibility  
they're being controlled by some kind of magic.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And if they are, then the effects of that magic  
should be centered on whoever's controlling them.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So we might well find them  
at that \"particular spot\" you just mentioned.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If someone's forcing the monsters to attack the farm,  
defeating them is the quickest way to stop this!  
So I'll head straight for their location and take them out.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Doesn't that sound much easier  
than taking out all these monsters?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Only thing is, if I head that way,  
I won't be able to protect all of you at the same time...  
  
**Rin：**  
No worries.  
We can handle a measly bit of running on our own.  
  
**Rin：**  
I may not be all that...  
But Lima and Mahiru and Shiorin are all really strong.  
  
**Shiori：**  
You're a strong person too, Rin...  
You could have run away, but you came back for us.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm...  
 OK, {player},  
you stick with the Elizabeth Park girls  
and try to get to safety.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll make a scene and draw the monsters' attention,  
while dashing over to defeat whoever's controlling them.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You remember when we first met, {player}?  
This seems to happen to me a lot more often than you'd think.  
Getting chased by packs of monsters, I mean.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If I don't face down the root of the issue,  
there's no telling how long it'll keep happening.  
So I'll see if I can't settle things here once and for all!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Really, I've had enough of monsters chasing me everywhere  
like I'm some princess out of a fairytale.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'd much rather live a peaceful life,  
eating lots of delicious food,  
and enjoying each day as it comes!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Besides which, I have a policy  
of cooking and eating every monster I defeat!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But with so many monsters attacking me every day,  
if I try to eat every last one of them,  
even I'm going to get the worst kind of tummyache.

**Mahiru：**  
All righty!  
Sounds like we got ourselves a plan, then!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm not totally sure  
who this friend of {player}'s is...  
But we can do the introductions when this is all over!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
For the moment, let's move! And the quicker, the better!  
I'll count to three, and then we dash!  
Everybody follow me!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I know this farm like the back of my hand.  
Right down to every little lump in the ground!  
So here goes nothin'! One, two, and... THREE! ☆  
  
`image display end`  
**Shiori：**  
I've got your back, Mahiru.  
I won't let anyone die today.  
  
**Lima：**  
Come on, Shiori, climb onto my back!  
Honestly, anyone can see you're weak on your feet!  
Oh... Not you, Rin—you can run for yourself!  
  
**Rin：**  
Awwww... I mean, sure, I guess...  
Gotta prove I'm good for something once in a while!
