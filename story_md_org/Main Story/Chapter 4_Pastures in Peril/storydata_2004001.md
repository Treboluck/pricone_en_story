# Chapter 4 Episode 1
Saren, Maho and Jun are discussing reparations for Christina's attack on Caon. As they debate the proper course of action, the topic turns to the Shadow situation, and Maho suggests somewhere the Sarendia Orphanage children could take refuge.
  
## Subtitle: A Three-Way Debate
  
### Place: Landosol Guildhouse
  
**Saren：**  
Ahhh...  
This is starting to get to me.  
  
**Saren：**  
Day in, day out,  
 there are so many things to deal with  
in the aftermath of Christina's attack on the Caon guildhouse.  
It's driving me crazy.  
  
**Saren：**  
I do have my own work to deal with too, you know!  
At this rate, I'm going to end up falling horribly behind  
on managing things at the Sarendia Orphanage...  
  
**Saren：**  
The Orphanage is a home and haven to so many children...  
Yet with me away at these meetings the past few days,  
there's barely anyone there to protect them.  
  
**Saren：**  
If there was another emergency,  
like the Shadow attack a few days ago, I'd be powerless to help.  
Oh, what to do... I don't want to waste any more time here!  
  
**Saren：**  
For the moment,  
I did ask my father to send a few guards  
to make sure they're not completely unprotected...  
  
**Saren：**  
But my father demands payment for these things—  
even from his own family!  
Honestly, how greedy can you get...  
  
**Saren：**  
Of course, money's no object if it can buy the children's safety,  
but this doesn't look great for the Orphanage's finances.  
With all the kids we've taken in, it's not easy to make ends meet.

**Jun：**  
You're looking a little pale there, my dear.  
  
**Saren：**  
...Please don't address me like that, Jun...  
  
**Jun：**  
My apologies. I suppose that was excessively familiar.  
Old habits can be difficult to break...  
I have known you since you were very young, after all.  
  
**Jun：**  
Still, I cannot treat you as a child forever.  
I will try to be more careful in future.  
  
**Saren：**  
No need to be so hard on yourself.  
I still remember when we used to play together, too.  
  
**Saren：**  
I try to put on a tough face  
so that people don't underestimate me,  
but it can be tiring for me too, at times.  
  
**Maho：**  
Sounds like y'all could use a break.  
How about a nice cup of tea?  
  
**Jun：**  
Oh...  
That's very kind of you to offer.  
Your consideration is most appreciated.  
  
**Maho：**  
Aw, don't mention it. I like to make folk comfortable.  
And I'm sure we've all got dry throats from all this jabbering.  
I was dyin' for a drink myself!

**Saren：**  
Hmmm...  
She's a lovely person,  
this Caon guildmaster... Maho.  
  
**Saren：**  
A kind and gentle soul, and a pacifist as well.  
In ordinary circumstances, I'd have liked to be friends with her.  
  
**Saren：**  
But this is an emergency... War is on the horizon.  
At times like this, kindness can be a weakness.  
Caon are undoubtedly the victim in this whole affair...  
  
**Saren：**  
But her willingness to compromise is harming her position.  
I wish I could step in to help...  
 But I'm a neutral third party.  
It would be wrong for me to take sides in this negotiation...  
  
**Jun：**  
Still, I think I must decline the tea for now.  
Kind though your offer is, we are not here to hold a tea party.  
  
**Maho：**  
Really? It's not like I'm tryin' to bribe you or anything...  
  
**Jun：**  
Ah, you misunderstand. I did not mean to seem ungrateful.  
As you can see, I am unable to drink tea.  
This helmet would rather get in the way.  
  
**Maho：**  
Then why don't you take that heavy ol' thing off?  
It's a little rude not to show your face, anyhow.  
  
**Jun：**  
I'm afraid my personal circumstances require keeping my face hidden.  
I mean no disrespect to yourself or Caon,  
nor toward beastfolk as a whole.  
  
**Jun：**  
The unfortunate incident that occurred  
was the result of an unauthorized and thoughtless act  
on the part of Nightmare's vice-captain, Christina.  
  
**Jun：**  
She carried out the attack using her own judgment,  
and your guild was harmed as a result.  
  
**Jun：**  
Christina has already been heavily disciplined for her misconduct.  
If at all possible, we would like that to be the end of this.  
I too begin to tire of these endless discussions.  
  
**Jun：**  
Of course,  
I doubt Chris is at all repentant for her actions...  
  
**Jun：**  
And though officially she's being disciplined,  
I hear she's actually left Landosol already,  
on some kind of secret orders from Her Majesty...  
  
**Maho：**  
You're hopin' to drop the whole thing without even a public apology?  
I hope you realize some of our guild members were injured.  
Some are even havin' trouble sleeping for fear of another attack!  
  
**Jun：**  
I'm sorry to disappoint you...  
But given our position, it would not do  
for Nightmare to issue an official admission of guilt.  
  
**Jun：**  
Our guild directly represents the throne.  
To blame us is to blame our entire nation.  
  
**Jun：**  
It would harm our standing with other countries,  
as well as cause unrest among our citizens.  
  
**Jun：**  
The ruling class must always appear powerful and just.  
Even if it does leave me personally with a guilty conscience.  
  
**Jun：**  
At any rate,  
I believe Christina has already paid a hefty sum  
as compensation for the damages to the Caon guildhouse.  
  
**Jun：**  
She has also paid reparations to the injured.  
  
**Jun：**  
I'm afraid Christina is monumentally rich, you see...  
She agreed to pay without a moment's hesitation.  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh, you think this is a question of money?  
We're talkin' about good faith. About regaining lost trust.  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm...  
If we were to make an offering of Christina's severed head,  
would that be sufficient to satisfy you?  
  
**Maho：**  
N-nobody's askin' for anything that brutal!  
  
You're a bloodthirsty old lot, ain't ya?  
  
**Jun：**  
I'm afraid Nightmare has long been accustomed  
to dealing with matters of life and death.  
  
**Jun：**  
This is a highly politically-charged affair.  
Would it not be best for both our sakes to brush it aside  
as a freak rampage on Christina's part?  
  
**Maho：**  
I mean, you're not wrong, but...  
You expect the rest of my guild to just accept that?  
  
**Maho：**  
Ahhh, my head's almost ready to split open...  
But still, I gotta stand my ground here.  
  
**Maho：**  
If I let these folks settle this whole thing with money,  
sure, that might make this one incident go away...  
But then who's to say the same thing won't happen again?  
  
**Maho：**  
If we were to see a repeat of this nasty business,  
war really would be in the cards...  
  
**Maho：**  
It'd be humans against beastfolk, no doubt about it.  
And that would mean bloodshed like nothin' we've ever seen.  
  
**Maho：**  
I can keep the folks at Caon from gettin' too feisty,  
but the rest of the Menagerie will be hungry for justice.  
Us beastfolk can get awful hotheaded sometimes...  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh, what am I gonna do...? I gotta settle this peacefully...  
But we can't pretend like the whole thing never happened.  
Somehow I've gotta shift the flow toward peace, not war...  
  
**Maho：**  
The beastfolk living here in Landosol  
have spent a long time makin' a peaceful life for themselves.  
That took a lot of effort, and a lot of restraint.  
  
**Maho：**  
We can't let all that hard work  
fall apart because of one little scuffle.  
We've got a duty to follow in our ancestors' footsteps.  
  
**Maho：**  
And yet...  
I can't help but wonder if I've got it in me  
to shoulder all that responsibility myself...  
  
**Maho：**  
Someone like me, who even wound up runnin' away  
from my own family situation...  
  
![200400101.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/200400101.webp)  
**Saren：**  
Maho... Sorry to change the subject,  
but do you have any news on your investigation into the Shadows?  
  
**Maho：**  
Huh?  
Oh...  
 Kasumi from our guild is still lookin' into that.  
  
**Maho：**  
Right now, it looks like they've only been sighted inside the city.  
So if anyone's really worried about runnin' into Shadows,  
I'd suggest headin' somewhere outside the city for now.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hmm...  
That might be a good call, actually.  
Some of the children at the Orphanage are really quite scared.  
  
**Saren：**  
Until we have more information on the Shadows,  
it might be best to evacuate them to a safer location.  
  
**Maho：**  
Then would you be interested in recommendations?  
There's a farming guild called Elizabeth Park  
who we have a pretty close relationship with at Caon.  
  
**Maho：**  
They live a slow-paced life, a ways out in the mountain regions.  
Their guildmaster's human, but they get along well with beastfolk too.  
So you could call them safe, neutral territory.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hmm... That does sound like an appealing option.  
Could I trouble you to get us in touch with them?  
  
**Saren：**  
First you investigate the Shadows for us, now this...  
I really can't thank you enough.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm in agreement with your stance on the incident, too.  
If avoiding war is your goal,  
 you have my full support.  
  
`image display end`  
**Jun：**  
Wait a minute.  
Isn't the Sarendia Orphanage supposed to be a neutral party  
in this matter, Saren?  
  
**Saren：**  
Well, the Sarendia Orphanage  
is a Princess Knight guild, after all.  
So technically we're biased towards your side.  
  
**Saren：**  
Wouldn't you say showing our support for the beastfolk  
balances that out and makes us *more* neutral?  
  
**Jun：**  
What a way to interpret things in your favor...  
You always were a quick-witted one.  
I've never been a great debater myself, so I envy you that.  
  
**Jun：**  
But no matter. Peace is a cause I too can support.  
Let's untangle this mess carefully  
and find a solution that will keep everyone safe.  
  
**Jun：**  
Though our time is not unlimited,  
there is no need to rush to conclusions.
