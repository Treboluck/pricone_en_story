## Subtitle: Interlude 5
  
**Ameth：**  
And that’s the end of that chapter.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ahaha, you really do look like you've been hard at work!  
I suppose that's to be expected,  
 after your little hiking expedition.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Although to be fair,  
you've actually been hiking out in the mountains before now,  
making deliveries to earn your keep in Landosol.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's how you met the folks  
from Elizabeth Park in the first place, you know?  
If you don't recall, maybe you should go hunting in your memories.  
  
**Ameth：**  
At any rate...  
After all that hiking, you must have built up a bit of stamina.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You're growing into a stronger person.  
I'd say you did pretty well backing up Pecorine and the rest.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Still, it really was a full-on disaster you wandered into this time.  
Burning buildings, ravaged fields...  
Bloodshed and screams ringing out across the land...  
  
**Ameth：**  
The people at that farm usually live such a peaceful life,  
which makes it all the more sad to see them in this state.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Let's hope we can restore that peace sooner rather than later.  
In fact, supporting them in their recovery  
is going to be one of your goals in the days ahead.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So do your best to put those smiles  
 back on everyone's faces.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Now, then.  
I'm not entirely sure  
 if I should talk about this just yet...  
  
**Ameth：**  
But these conversations are only dreams to you, anyway...  
I'm sure you won't end up recalling much of this...  
So, whatever. I'll just come out and say it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's a problem you'll have to face at some point, regardless.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So. You headed to the farm together with Pecorine, didn't you?  
What do you think about her, hmm?  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's a funny one, isn't she?  
Of course, I hear you've formed a guild together—the Gourmet Guild—  
so you must get along pretty well.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Mm...  
If you don't know what I'm talking about there,  
you really should try a little harder to remember.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But anyway.  
Pecorine seems like a lovely girl full of boundless positive energy,  
but there are mysteries surrounding her, too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You've probably noticed it in some of the things she's been saying.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The truth is, she has a very heavy fate of her own to bear.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And what's more...  
That fate has made her the target of a terrifying force.  
You've seen how monsters seem to show up whenever she's around.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Those are deliberate attacks from someone who wants her dead.  
Every day and every night,  
she has to worry about those creatures coming for her life.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And to think she finds the time to smile and worry about others!  
She really is like a perfect little princess.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But the real issue here  
is that the person who's behind all these attacks on Pecorine,  
the one known as \"Her Majesty,\" is using Karyl as her pawn.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's right.  
The very same Karyl you know and love.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Your good friend, and the fourth member of the Gourmet Guild  
along with yourself, Pecorine and Kokkoro.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's been given a special power by this mysterious \"Majesty.\"  
One that lets her control monsters.  
Though it looks like she isn't very good at using it just yet.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And it looks like one of Karyl's main objectives  
is to assassinate Pecorine.  
  
**Ameth：**  
After all, if she happened to fall prey to a pack of monsters,  
it would be easy to dismiss as an accident, right?  
Even if those monsters were really doing Karyl's bidding.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So that's what's really going on. A string of failed assassinations.  
Though of course, Karyl isn't doing this because she wants to.  
She's just following \"Her Majesty's\" orders.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So, that's the real relationship between those two girls.  
An assassin and her target.  
The hunter and the hunted.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So I'm sure you can imagine...  
The closer you all become to one another,  
the more difficult things will be down the line.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Today was yet another of Karyl's attempts  
to assassinate Pecorine, but...  
She certainly didn't seem to be enjoying it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's not a bad girl at heart, you know.  
Who would really want to take the life  
of a good friend they share meals with every day?  
  
**Ameth：**  
But alas, it looks like she can't say no to this \"Majesty.\"  
At this rate, tragedy is inevitable.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So I'm asking you.  
Since you happen to be by their side every day...  
Watch over them, and see what you can do to help.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And if there's any way to avoid a tragic outcome, try to find it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Only you, who have become a friend...  
...no, more like family to both of them...  
can hope to do this.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Of course, it's not going to be easy.  
But do your best. I'll be cheering you on.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And do try to be careful.  
It looks like this \"Majesty\" isn't exactly a paragon of patience.  
After all these failures, she might just try to do the job herself.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's a terrible being who almost destroyed the world once already.  
I can't ask you lightly to defeat her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But at least try to survive. That's the least I can pray for.  
Because as long as you're alive, there's still hope.
