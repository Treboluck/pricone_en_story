**Karyl：**  
Oh, shoot...!  
Pecorine is heading this way!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I thought I saw them meeting up  
with the members of Elizabeth Park...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I guess one of them must have good eyes,  
or at least a sharp sense of intuition.  
They've figured out where I am!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, I'm sure they don't know it's me...  
They must've just put two and two together  
and guessed there was someone controlling the monsters...  
  
**Karyl：**  
But this is bad!  
I've used up all my energy trying to control those useless beasts!  
If I fight Pecorine one-on-one, I won't stand a chance!

**???：**  
You seem to be in a spot of trouble,  
little miss.

**Karyl：**  
...?!  
Christina!  
  
**Christina：**  
My my, we're on first-name terms now?  
You're feistier than usual today... I like it!  
  
**Christina：**  
Normally, you're all \"Vice-Captain\", with a stony face to match.  
I was beginning to tire of all that formality!  
Ahahahahahah! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
What the heck are you doing here?  
Did Her Majesty send you?  
  
**Christina：**  
You could say she did, or you could say she didn't.  
I'm here on a royal mission of my own,  
quite separate from yours.  
  
**Christina：**  
After the stunt I pulled the other day,  
it's inconvenient for me to be in Landosol right now.  
  
**Christina：**  
So today I'm here, outside the city,  
taking care of some rather special business.  
  
**Christina：**  
You see, it looks like we've tracked down the base  
where that secret society \"Labyrinth\" is hiding.  
So Her Majesty sent me to annihilate it.  
  
**Christina：**  
Though she did ask me  
to check how your job's coming along, while I'm here.  
  
**Christina：**  
I suppose she must not have the greatest faith  
in your abilities, or your loyalty.  
  
**Christina：**  
If she trusted you, she'd leave you to do your own job.  
She wouldn't need me to keep tabs on you.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Well, look, I'm doing my job just fine!  
I'm doing as Her Majesty instructed, aren't I?  
  
**Christina：**  
Are you, now?  
It looked to me like you were about to burst into tears.  
Did you get lost in the woods, poor baby?  
  
**Christina：**  
Villains like us should enjoy ourselves a little more!  
Ahahahah! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
I don't have time to stand around chatting with you!  
So stay out of my way! I've got work to do!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Go tell Her Majesty I'm working hard! End of conversation!  
I don't need you hanging around, Christina!  
  
**Christina：**  
No need to get all hysterical.  
Nobody likes a short-tempered young lady!  
  
**Christina：**  
Now, ah... \"Karyl,\" was it?  
Calm yourself for a moment.  
Would you care to strike a deal?  
  
**Karyl：**  
A... deal...?  
  
**Christina：**  
Indeed. I'll give you a hand with this job of yours.  
To be more specific, I'll take care of that girl  
who's currently closing in on your position.  
  
**Christina：**  
I'll capture her alive in no time at all!  
Or if you'd rather I kill her, say the word.  
She seems like quite a fighter, but she's got nothing on me.  
  
**Christina：**  
It's a simple enough job.  
You can just hide yourself in the bushes  
and watch how a pro gets things done.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...I suppose that's an appealing offer.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But then... If you're calling it a \"deal,\"  
you must want something out of this, right?  
What exactly are you after?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Money?  
Treasure?  
Political power?  
  
**Christina：**  
All I ask for is a little information.  
In this modern age, that's the most valuable treasure of all.  
  
**Christina：**  
Give me some pieces of intel  
that are known to yourself and Her Majesty,  
but that I haven't been made aware of yet.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Are you asking me to betray Her Majesty?  
  
**Christina：**  
I wouldn't go that far.  
I'm only asking you to tell me as much as you feel able to share.  
  
**Christina：**  
At the end of the day,  
all of this is just a way to pass the time  
in this tiresome existence.  
  
**Christina：**  
But I sense there's something Her Majesty isn't telling me.  
And what kind of fool wants to put their life on the line  
for someone who won't tell them why?  
  
**Christina：**  
I want to know what I'm fighting for.  
I won't deny that I'm the sort who likes to indulge  
in fleeting moments of ecstasy...  
  
**Christina：**  
But my life, my time in this world, is limited.  
That's one of the few truths  
that applies equally and universally to everyone.  
  
**Christina：**  
I'd rather not waste my limited time  
on anything that's not worth my while.  
  
**Christina：**  
So you'll understand  
if I'd like to shed some light on a few of these unclear details.  
  
**Christina：**  
I have no intention of becoming anyone's pawn.  
No matter how tiresome and insipid this life may be,  
it still belongs to no one but myself.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I always thought you were just a carefree psychopath...  
But I guess you have an intellectual side.  
  
**Christina：**  
Indeed I do.  
A slave to pleasure I may be, but I'll be slave to no other.  
That's all the policy I need, little miss.  
  
**Christina：**  
So... What'll it be?  
If you don't make your mind up, my offer might just expire.  
  
**Christina：**  
Better to regret a choice you made for yourself  
than to regret letting an opportunity pass you by.  
Take that as a word of advice.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...All right, then.  
Let's call it a deal.  
I'm willing to accept your conditions.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'll go and conceal myself nearby.  
So when Tiana makes it to this location,  
you decide how to deal with her.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But just so we're clear,  
you'd better not kill her or anything!  
  
**Christina：**  
\"Tiana\"?  
Hahah... So that's how it is, eh?  
That name alone is more than enough reward for this little job!  
  
**Christina：**  
Well, well, well...  
 How fun life can be!  
Ahahahah! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, give it a rest, would you?!  
Well then, I'll be seeing you around.

**Karyl：**  
Does she think I don't want to enjoy my life?  
To eat delicious food  
and laugh the days away with some good friends...  
  
**Karyl：**  
But I can't.  
This life of mine...  
doesn't belong to me!
