## Subtitle: A Not-So-Peaceful Farm
  
**Narration：**  
{player} and Pecorine have successfully defeated  
the monsters that were attacking Rin.  
  
**Narration：**  
Responding to Rin's pleas for help,  
they follow her in the direction of the farm.  
  
**Narration：**  
But a terrible scene awaits them...

**Pecorine：**  
Whoa?!  
What the... What exactly is happening here?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's monsters upon monsters as far as the eye can see!  
Not that that's anything new for me personally...  
But even I'm not used to encountering *quite* this many.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I suppose I should ask just to make sure, but...  
This Elizabeth Park guild of yours  
wouldn't happen to be a monster farm, would it?  
  
**Rin：**  
Of course not! We're an ordinary farm!  
We just raise normal animals! Well, we might have  
one or two monsters, but mostly, it's just cows and stuff!  
  
**Rin：**  
Ahhh, how did all this happen?  
I-I swear everything was normal here yesterday!  
  
**Rin：**  
This morning, I overslept like I always do...  
And when I woke up at lunchtime, it was like this!  
I-I didn't know what to think!  
  
**Rin：**  
Lima said I should go call for help,  
so I went scrambling down the mountain...  
*sniff* And that's when I found you guys...  
  
**Rin：**  
I'm the only one who made it out...  
Everyone else is still back at the farm!  
Y-you've gotta help them!  
  
**Rin：**  
Please! I'll do anything!  
Here, you can even have the prize acorns I was saving up!

### Place: Mt. Ural
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh, acorns! They can be pretty tasty!  
Especially these days, when they've been bred for flavor...  
Anyway, don't you worry! I'll take care of this!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
{player},  
you and Rin know each other, right?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Yep, we're friends.  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Excellent!  
Then you take her with you,  
and hurry back to Landosol to fetch some backup!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll stay here  
and rescue the people still stuck inside the farm!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
There really are an awful lot of monsters,  
so it might be a bit of a struggle...  
But hey, I'll manage!  
  
**Rin：**  
I... I wanna fight too!  
Guarding this farm and defending it from danger  
is supposed to be my job!  
  
**Rin：**  
But look at me... Always slacking off and messing around...  
I was asleep when everyone needed me...  
  
**Rin：**  
After the guys at Elizabeth Park  
have done so much for me, too!  
They're gonna be OK, right? They're not dead, right?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I couldn't really say...  
I'd certainly like to hope they're all safe and sound...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But with all these monsters blocking our view,  
it's hard to say anything for sure.  
This really is a nasty little mess!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Call out to Pecorine.  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm?  
What's that, {player}?  
You want to fight too?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohh...?  
You're worried about everyone at Elizabeth Park,  
so you want to help?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha, what a plucky little weakling you are!  
Well, I suppose it wouldn't do wonders for your pride  
to run away and let a couple of girls do all the fighting!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Besides which...  
With all these monsters everywhere,  
it would be a bit tricky for you to escape, anyway.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Maybe it would be safer  
if both of you stayed close to me for the moment.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
All right, follow along and try to keep up!  
I'm going to go on a bit of a rampage!  
So make sure you don't get in the way of my sword, OK?  
  
![200400302.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/200400302.webp)  
**Rin：**  
Whoaaa, this lady's a toughie!  
Did she just send all those monsters flying with one hit?  
You sure do have some amazing friends, {player}...  
  
**Rin：**  
Uh-oh...  
I'd better keep my wits about me.  
There really are monsters swarming all over the place.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm? Hey hey, Rin, look!  
You see that smoke rising in the distance?  
Do you know what's over in that direction?  
  
`image display end`  
![200400303.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/200400303.webp)  
**Rin：**  
Over there? That's the barn...  
The smoke's a funny color, so maybe it's some kind of signal?  
  
**Rin：**  
Hang on, uhhh...  
I swear I learned about smoke signals  
in that training course we did at Caon...  
  
**Rin：**  
Uhhh... Ahhhh...  
Oh! I know! It's a distress signal!  
I guess someone over there must need our help?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Gotcha!  
In that case, let's make a beeline  
for the building that smoke is coming from!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ready, set, run!  
Everyone, go go go! ☆

### Place: Mysterion Woods
  
**???：**  
...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Haaahhh! *pant* *pant*  
Ugh! I can't control them!  
What's wrong with me?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Dammitall! This wasn't how it was supposed to go!  
I've really messed this up...  
 Her Majesty will be furious with me!  
Noooo... I don't want to be punished again...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Tiana... I mean, Pecorine and {player}  
were supposed to get here *before*  
I set the monsters on the farm...  
  
**Karyl：**  
But I lost control,  
and they went and started attacking too early!  
  
**Karyl：**  
They're not obeying orders... They've gone totally berserk!  
This isn't good... Pecorine is one thing,  
but I was specifically told to leave {player} alive!  
  
**Karyl：**  
And if possible,  
I'm supposed to capture Pecorine alive too...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm not supposed to kill her,  
but these stupid monsters won't listen to a thing I say!  
  
**Karyl：**  
At this rate,  
both of them will die for sure...  
  
**Karyl：**  
They're totally outnumbered...  
I know Pecorine is strong,  
but even she has limits!  
  
**Karyl：**  
That Royal Equipment she uses isn't energy-efficient.  
Sooner or later, she'll burn through her calories  
and completely collapse.  
  
**Karyl：**  
And then she'll die.  
There's hundreds upon hundreds of monsters out there.  
How can three measly people hope to tackle them all?  
  
**Karyl：**  
They're going... to die.  
They'll be trampled flat, torn to pieces,  
chewed up and eaten alive...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Why does that even bother me so much?  
I knew this day would come eventually.  
  
**Karyl：**  
So why is it that my chest is aching horribly?  
I'm supposed to be an empty doll...  
Not to have feelings like this!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Your Majesty...  
Am I really just a worthless, defective creation?
