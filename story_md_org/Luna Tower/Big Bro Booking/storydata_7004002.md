**Mimi：**  
Hoppety-hop, hoppety...  
 Wahh!  
Oww... I fell over...  
  
**Mimi：**  
I'm sorry, Misogi, Kyoka...  
It looks like I'm out this time...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Urghhh... Now it's two against two...  
Don't you worry, Mimi!  
I won't let your sacrifice be in vain!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Green Light... Red Light!

**Ayane & Kurumi：**

**Misogi & Kyoka：**  
...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ohhh... I'm getting all nervous...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wahhh?! I-I'm not... out, am I?  
  
**Misogi：**  
You were totally quivering all over!  
That just leaves one enemy! This should be easy!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Urgh...  
I-I've got to do my best...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hmm?  
Hang on. If there's only one enemy left...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Green Light... Red Light!  
`Tag 3`  
**Ayane：**  
*freeze!*  
  
**Misogi：**  
Take this! Misogi's funniest face!  
Blegh-heh-heh!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Pfft...  
 Ahahahah!  
Th-that's a dirty trick, making the opponent laugh!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi!  
Sure, you got Ayane out, but what's the use if you had to move?!  
You're just as out as her!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Heheh...! And that just leaves you, Kyoka!  
It's a victory for Little Lyrical!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Th-that's not fair...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi, that's not how you're supposed to play...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Urghhhh...  
Sure, I guess I moved, but Pukichi didn't, did he?!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"You betcha! I didn't move a single muscle!\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Well then, Pukichi, we're counting on you now!  
  
**Misogi & Kyoka：**  
Whaaa...?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
H-hold on a minute!  
Pukichi isn't capable of moving in the first place!  
That's not fair at all!  
  
**Ayane：**  
It's totally fair!  
Pukichi's my friend, so he gets to play too!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Yes, that's right!  
  
**Misogi：**  
T-talk about clever...  
I can't believe she outdid me, the Prank Master, at trickery...  
That Ayane's one to watch out for...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Misogi?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Kyoka, you're not thinking he's not a real friend, are you?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Huhhh?! O-of course not...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Now now, Kyoka. It's not nice to pick on people's friends.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I-I wasn't trying to do anything like...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Urghh... A-all right, then.  
I suppose I'll acknowledge Pukichi...  
  
**Narration：**  
In the end, Pukichi didn't move a muscle for the whole game,  
winning the match for Ayane and Kurumi.
