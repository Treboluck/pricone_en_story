 Let's face off in a game of tag!

All right!

**Misogi：**  
OK then—{player}, you're It!  
Ready, set, go!

Wahhh!  
D-don't touch me anywhere funny!  
I'll sound my Siren Amulet!

**Mimi：**  
Hoppety-hop, hoppety-hop~! ♪  
Hey, mister, catch me if you can!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
C-come on, {player}! Over here...!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hey, mister!  
Chasing after us is all well and good,  
but watch where you step!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Got him! He fell for my ultra-strong instant glue trap!  
Now he's not going anywhere!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi...  
If he can't move from that spot,  
how are we supposed to play tag?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahh! Good point...  
When I see {player}, I just can't resist pranking him...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Misogi! Are you trying to ruin the game?!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I think... you can escape if you take off your shoes.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Then we can get back to playing tag!  
Hey, mister! Can you catch me~? ♪  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahahah! This time he fell into the pitfall trap!  
That's my big bro!  
He's a regular genius at falling into traps!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Misogi! You're not helping us settle the contest!  
  
**Mimi：**  
H-hey, mister, are you OK?!  
Here, I'll pull you out of that nasty hole!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I'll help pull, too.  
Heave-ho, heave-ho, heave-ho...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Heave-ho...  
A-are you all right?  
If you'd like, you can rest your head in my lap for a little while...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Oh, I've got some water!  
Here you go, mister. I'll help you drink it.  
  
**Ayane：**  
...N-no fair! I wanna look after him too!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ohhh! Me too, me too!  
Here, \"big bro,\" have some water!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Bueerghh!  
`Tag 4`  
**Misogi：**  
Ahahahah!  
 Wait, no...  
Th-that was my ultra spicy prank juice...  
Are you OK, mister?!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so the game of tag ended without a winner.
