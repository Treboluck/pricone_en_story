**Kurumi：**  
Hey, do you guys  
 always play games like this together?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Yup! We gather in Landosol to play—  
I mean,  
 to do guild activities!  
Us and our big bro!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
That sounds fun!  
Would it be OK if I joined in too sometimes...?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Of course that's fine!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Kurumi! We're having a battle, remember?!  
We've gotta take our big bro back from Little Lyrical!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh... yeah, that's right...  
A battle... A battle...  
 I-I have to do my best...  
  
**Mimi：**  
I think we should all play hide-and-seek next!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yeah, sure!  
Then let's say {player} is It, as usual!  
  
**Misogi：**  
{player}, you gotta count to a hundred,  
then look for us, OK?  
 Not that you'll ever find me!  
  
**Mimi, Misogi & Kyoka：**  
...  
  
**Ayane & Misogi：**  
...  
  
**Everyone：**  
...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Aaaaahhhh!  
  
**Mimi：**  
M-mister... Heeelp!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
We tried to hide in a dark spot, but this monster appeared!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Wh-wh-wh-what now? What should we do?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Don't panic!  
`Tag 1`  
**Misogi：**  
Huh?  
I should throw my Trick Bomber explosive?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Then I can hit it with my Pukichi Fullswing?  
  
**Misogi：**  
All right!  
I'll try doing it just like you said!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Here goes! Trick Bomber!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Pukichi Fullswiiiiing!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahhh! The monster's looking wobbly!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Now's our chance to attack while it's weakened, right?  
H-haaahhh!  
  
**Mimi：**  
M-me too!  
Bunny Blade!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Just like you said,  
their attacks have thrown it off balance!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Time for the finishing blow.  
 I'm ready for this!  
Cosmo Blue Flaaaaaash!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Misogi：**  
All riiight!  
Take that, monster!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
W-we really beat it  
 all by ourselves...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Huh?  
That's because we all worked together?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yeah. You're right!  
When we work as a team, we can do anything!  
  
**Narration：**  
Thanks to their battle together as allies,  
the two groups found themselves becoming friends.
