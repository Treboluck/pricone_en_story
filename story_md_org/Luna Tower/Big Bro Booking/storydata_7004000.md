## Subtitle: A Battle for the Ages
  
**Ayane：**  
Hey, hey, {player}!  
You free right now?  
We're gonna play house, so you should join in!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"I know you might be a bit too old  
to play a baby game like house, kid,  
but you'll do it for Ayane and Kurumi, won't ya?\"  
  
**Kurumi：**  
...Huh? You can't, because you're going exploring today?  
Oh... that's a shame...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Heeey! Misteeeer! We're here to pick you up!  
Are you ready to explore, or aren't you?!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Huh? It's the girls from Little Lyrical...  
When you said you were going exploring, did you mean with them?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Exploring is one of our guild activities!  
Misogi says we should explore the Tower of Luna today!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ohhh, huh.  
So it's not a real exploring job or anything.  
  
**Ayane：**  
C'mon, \"big bro\"! ♪  
Forget all that exploring stuff,  
 and come play house with us instead!  
  
**Misogi：**  
\"Big bro\"?  
If he's anyone's big bro, he should be mine!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Eheheh... You'll be my big bro, right?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Stop that, you two!  
How many times do I have to tell you  
he's a very suspicious creep?!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I don't think our big bro is suspicious or a creep at all...  
  
**Ayane：**  
That's right! He's our awesome big bro!  
  
**Misogi：**  
No he's not!  
He's our big bro, not yours!  
  
**Misogi：**  
That does it.  
We'll decide which guild makes the best little sisters  
the old-fashioned way!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh, a battle? I'm game for that!  
 You'll never beat us!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh? Huh? Huuuuh?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
You're not taking our Mr. Nice Bro!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I can't just let you steal him...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ummm...  
I'm actually quite fine with not being {player}'s sister...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Then we'll settle this at the Tower of Luna!  
If you think you're taking our big bro, think again!  
  
**Narration：**  
So it was that the Tower of Luna  
became the stage for a grand battle of wits  
between Little Lyrical and the Sarendia Sisters!
