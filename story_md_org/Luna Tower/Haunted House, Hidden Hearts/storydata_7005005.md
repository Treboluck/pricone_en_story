**Tsumugi：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
We've climbed quite a long way now, haven't we?  
  
**Rei：**  
You're right.  
Though I hate to admit it, I think I've just about reached my limit.  
  
**Rei：**  
Thank you again, {player}.  
We only made it all the way here  
thanks to the energy you lent us.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Huh? What's that lying on the ground?  
  
**Rei：**  
It looks like some sort of fragment...  
Whoa! It suddenly started glowing?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Aaaaahhhh!  
  

---  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Reiiiiiii!  
  
**Rei：**  
Really, Tsumugi!  
Can you please not surprise me with hugs out of nowhere?  
  
**Rei：**  
I know our different grades are working together for this project,  
but it's still real schoolwork.  
I've told you before about minding your manners.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I knooow, but I never dreamed that my class  
would be assigned to work with *yours*  
to put on a haunted house for the school festival!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
For this brief time,  
 it's almost like we're classmates!  
Ohhh, I'm just bursting with joy!  
  
**Rei：**  
*sigh*... Of all the classes I could have drawn from that box...  
Still, I can't keep dwelling on that forever.  
Tomorrow's the day of the festival itself, after all.  
  
**Rei：**  
Thanks to both our classes' hard work,  
it looks like we'll be able to deliver quite the experience.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I worked hard myself to design a wonderful costume for you!  
Just look at this white kimono!  
 I made about a thousand adjustments  
to ensure it would show off your beautiful body perfectly!  
  
**Rei：**  
That's not quite what I gave you my measurements for...  
Still, I heard you made costumes for all the other actors, too, right?  
I really should thank you.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
No problem!  
 I'd do anything for my beloved Rei!  
And of course, you're the star who'll make or break the experience,  
so your costume needs to stand out!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ahhh, Rei as an icy yuki-onna...  
She'll look gorgeous beyond belief...  
  
**Rei：**  
Um... You do understand  
we want to scare the customers, not charm them, right?  
I'm hoping to make this a haunted house to remember.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I know, I know!  
That's why you invited him, isn't it?  
  
**Rei：**  
Yes, we need an impartial opinion.  
I'm hoping he'll give us his impressions before the public opening.  
  
**Rei：**  
I even applied to get him a visitor's pass for the occasion.  
I was hoping he'd be arriving about now...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Honestly, the nerve of that boy, keeping my beloved Rei waiting!  
...  
Wait, huh? Is that him walking this way?  
  
**Rei：**  
You're right!  
Hello—I'm glad you came.  
Sorry to take up your precious time like this.  
  
**Rei：**  
As I explained over the phone,  
we'd like you to try out the haunted house we've created.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I've been looking forward to it!  
**Choice: (2)**  Horror isn't my strong suit...  
`Tag 1`  
**Rei：**  
I think it should meet your expectations—  
we're quite proud of our work.  
Prepare to be truly terrified.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
And if you don't look scared, I'll tie you up!  
So be prepared for that too!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Rei：**  
Ahh... You scare easily?  
I'm sorry... I wish you'd said something sooner.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
What's with all the coward talk? Man up a little!  
Take this as an opportunity  
to get over that silly weakness, why don't you?!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rei：**  
By the way, I was actually hoping  
to get impressions of the experience from both genders.  
So I'd like you to go in there with a girl, if possible. Is that all right?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
A-a girl?!  
But then they'd be like some kind of couple!  
Absolutely not! We can't trust a pervert like him!  
  
**Rei：**  
No need for name-calling, Tsumugi.  
Don't worry. He's really not like that at all.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Well... I guess it's got nothing to do with me!  
So, who's it gonna be?  
Which unlucky lady has got to pair up with Mr. Knight?  
  
**Rei：**  
It's you,  
 Tsumugi.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ehhhhhhhhhh?!  
Why, where, which, who, whaaaat?!  
What did I do to deserve this?!  
  
**Rei：**  
You spent all your time on the costumes, didn't you?  
So you're the only class member  
who hasn't seen the actual attraction yet.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Urgh... This is the worst!  
...  
I blame you for everything, Mr. Knight!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  How is this my fault?  
`Tag 4`  
**Tsumugi：**  
It's your fault because I say so!  
Since it's Rei's request,I suppooose I can play your girlfriend this once,  
but if you try anything, I'll tie you up on the spot! Are we quite clear?  
  
**Rei：**  
...No one said you had to be his girlfriend, Tsumugi.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ooh, this is a bit fancier than I expected!  
These gravestones are really intricately designed...  
Oh, and look at the artwork on the walls!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Yup, yup.  
 This classic Western horror style  
should really get the visitors in the mood to be spooked.  
Of course, you won't catch *me* getting scared so easily!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Hey, can you not walk so close to me? It's dark in here.  
I need to keep pervy stalkers at arm's length!  
  
**Rei：**  
It looks like they appreciate the decor.  
I knew it was worth getting the whole art club to help out.  
  
**Rei：**  
Tsumugi seems to have some hang-ups with him,  
so I hope this will help smooth things out a little.  
Although some big reactions to our scares would be even better.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh, look. Here's a suspicious coffin already.  
I bet there'll be a zombie or something inside.  
Might as well stand around until it pops out, I suppose.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...It's not nice to keep customers waiting!  
Knock knock! Hellooo? Is anyone home?!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Tsumugi... Behind you.  
`Tag 5`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Huh? Behind me?  
Please—I won't fall for that.  
You're obviously just trying to put me on edge!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I'm not making it up.  
`Tag 6`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Yes, yes. Whatever you say.  
  
**Wolf Girl：**  
You won't find anyone in there...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Aaaaaaaaaagghhhhhhhh!!!  
A wolf! It's a vicious werewoooooolf!  
  
**Wolf Girl：**  
W-wait, Tsumugi?!  
...Ahhh, she ran off.  
I was only trying to be helpful...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Mr. Kniiiight! Get over here!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Urgh... Talk about a shock...  
I think that was just one of my classmates...  
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to panic and fall over...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Huh? I should hold onto your hand?  
Thank you, I suppose.  
I guess I'll take you up on that...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh—but this doesn't mean you can try any funny business!  
This is just an emergency measure, all right?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...I'm just messing with you. Haha.  
Mr. Knight, you can actually be pretty kind sometimes.  
Like when you went clothes shopping with me the other day.  
  
**Rei：**  
Now let's see...  
 Hmm?  
Is Tsumugi holding hands with him now?  
  
**Rei：**  
I was under the impression she didn't like him at all,  
so this is quite the improvement.  
  
**Rei：**  
And yet why do I feel oddly uncomfortable watching them?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh—now there's will-o'-the-wisps!  
Huh... I like the way they flicker.  
They're pretty calming to watch!  
  
**Rei：**  
Why aren't they scared?!  
That gimmick was a real struggle to set up!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
They're almost like fireflies!  
Shall we sit down for a rest?  
Hee hee. Sitting next to you, it's as if we're a real coup—  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Waaaaaaagghhhhh!!!  
 That's cold!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Something fell on my neck!  
Huh? Is this a piece of konnyaku jelly?!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Wooo... Spooky-spook!  
This isn't pudding at all...  
Well, no one can see me, so I'll search some more!  
  
**Rei：**  
Ahh... One of the hanging konnyaku strips broke and fell down.  
Tsumugi, you have the worst of luck...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Why the konnyaku attack?!  
That's just scary!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Owwwie...  
Geez... I can't believe I fell over again!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
But really, what kind of attraction  
throws slimy konnyaku at its visitors?!  
Argh, this had better be the last time!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I know! Mr. Knight, stand in front of me,  
so you can shield me from any projectiles!  
Isn't that the manly thing to do?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Come on—I'll hold on to you, so get moving!  
Don't you want to protect a maiden from danger?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh, you're suddenly into it now?  
Well, I suppose I can give you...  
 a little credit for that.  
  
**Rei：**  
Hm...? They're talking about something.  
Wait, now she's linking arms with him?!  
Isn't that going a little far?!  
 I-it's frankly scandalous!  
  
**Rei：**  
They're getting along so well,  
it's almost as if they're a real couple!  
Why does this make me feel so strange?  
  
**Rei：**  
Oh well... I'll have to switch plans and break out my secret weapon.  
This is my last chance to give them a real scare!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Nothing else has come flying at us, huh?  
We must be close to the grand finale by now.  
Ahhhh, I just can't wait!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Am I getting you all curious?  
This haunted house's star attraction is Rei as a yuki-onna!  
In the costume and makeup I designed, she's a beauty for the ages!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Why a Japanese ghoulie in a Western-style haunted house, you ask?  
Do the details really matter?  
As if anything's more important than Rei's sheer beauty!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Well, it *was* supposed to be Dracula  
before I insisted that we switch things up.  
My instincts were screaming  
 that Rei would look incredible in a kimono!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
There, you see—look at that willow tree!  
Could that be Rei hiding right behind it?  
Let's get closer and see!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Don't go rushing off on your own, now.  
**Choice: (8)**  This is kinda scary.  
`Tag 7`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Why the sudden concern?  
You're just trying to get in the way of my time with Rei, aren't you?  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Are you really that big of a coward?  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Well, all right then, whatever!  
We can head over there together.  
Go on, grab onto my arm.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh, Reeeei~! ♪  
Hurry and look this way!  
  
![700500501.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/700500501.webp)  
**Rei：**  
Do you wish to perish in an icy grave?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Aaaaaaaahhhh! Reeeeei!  
Hmm? Wait, that's not Rei!  
Who the heck *are* you?!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Um, that's Rei...  
`Tag 10`  
**Rei：**  
Th-that's right. I am Rei!  
Wait, why are you clinging to {player}?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Nooooooo!  
Stay back! Stay back!  
Rei would never wear such weird and uncanny makeup!  
  
**Rei：**  
Y-you don't mince words, do you?  
This is an alternate style I came up with myself!  
Anyway, stop cuddling up to him!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Huh? Why am I right up against Mr. Knight?!  
Nooooo!  
  
`image display end`  
**Rei：**  
Hey, don't just shove him at me!  
Wait, hold on... Where did you just touch me?!  
Could it be... you've been eyeing me up since the day we met?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Huh? Wait, so are you really Rei after all?!  
Then you mustn't cuddle Mr. Knight like that!  
  
**Schoolgirl A：**  
What's going on in here? What's all the fuss?  
  
**Schoolgirl B：**  
Aaaaaghhh!  
Tsumugi and Miss Shijo are tying up a strange boy!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Go on, Mr. Knight! It's high time you apologized!  
  
**Rei：**  
Wait a minute! This isn't what you think!  
  

---  
  
`image display end`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Mmmnnhh...  
Ahh! What was that?!  
  
**Rei：**  
Tsumugi, just drop the tape measure...  
Wait... huh? Was all that... just a dream?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
A dream? Then did I just share a dream with you, Rei?  
I remember grabbing on to Mr. Knight, and then...  
  
**Rei：**  
He came leaping towards me, and even touched my...  
Ah, no, forget that!  
It was all just a dream!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
So now we're seeing these things even in our dreams...  
  
**Rei：**  
Y-you make it sound like he's always on my mind or something!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
D-don't be ridiculous...  
 Hey! Mr. Knight, why are you smirking?!  
Don't you dare look at my Rei like that!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I won't allow it! I'm tying you up!  
  
**Rei：**  
Th-that seems best...  
 Take some time to cool your head!  
  
**Choice: (11)**  M-maybe you two should calm down...  
`Tag 11`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Hahah! Mr. Knight, prepare to meet your doom!  
  
**Rei：**  
Surrender yourself to justice!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ahh! Rei, he's getting away!  
You run ahead and cut him off!  
  
**Rei：**  
I'm on it!  
 Hey! Hold it right there!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so {player} found himself on the run.  
He managed to reach the tower's exit,  
but the girls caught him and tied him up in the end.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Why're you sitting out here all lonely?  
Get up now and give Miyako pudding!
