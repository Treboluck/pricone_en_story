**Tsumugi：**  
Owww... I think I scraped my arm.  
  
**Rei：**  
This is why I keep telling you to be more careful...  
  
**Rei：**  
You may have won this time, but monsters like that  
really ought to be taken care of as a team, remember?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ahaha...  
 I guess I was a little bit too careless...  
Oh! Mr. Knight!  
Are you tending to my scratch?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Thank you very much!  
...Wow,  
 you even have stick-on bandages handy.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Huh? I should thank your loyal helper for that?  
A sweet girl named Kokkoro?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Hmmm...  
Well, I suppose that's none of my business.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Wait, huh? Look at your sleeve! It's almost torn open!  
Hold it right there for a minute. I'll fix it up in a jiffy.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Geez, can you stop all that squirming?!  
Honestly, you're such a handful to deal with!  
  
**Rei：**  
...?!  
  
**Rei：**  
Is it just me, or do they seem close all of a sudden?  
And Tsumugi said she came here to protect me,  
but this whole time, she's only been talking to him...  
  
**Rei：**  
Actually, he's no better.  
Why does he only seem to care about Tsumugi?  
Whatever happened to looking up to me as a master?  
  
**Rei：**  
...Wait, am I getting jealous?!  
No, no, no. That's ridiculous...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Whoa... Rei is staring this way so intently!  
Is she still mad that I messed up in that battle?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Wait...  
 I was so focused on sewing,  
I ended up right in Mr. Knight's face!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Th-there you go! It's all done now. Now shoo!  
And make sure you don't ruin your clothes like that again!  
You can't always expect me to be by your side!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...Huh? Why am I saying all this...?  
  
**Narration：**  
Perhaps due to the stress of battle,  
Rei and Tsumugi both found themselves feeling  
less sure of themselves than usual.
