**Tsumugi：**  
Yaaaahhhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
 One monster down!  
  
**Rei：**  
Are you all right, Tsumugi?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Yes... It sure was a shock when that vicious monster  
  
crept up right behind me, though!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
If Mr. Knight hadn't spotted it quickly,  
I might have been in trouble.  
  
**Rei：**  
I'm very grateful to you as well, {player}.  
Thank you for saving Tsumugi.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Mr. Knight does do nice things occasionally, doesn't he?  
  
**Rei：**  
That's why I keep telling you—he's not a bad person.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I guess you might be right.  
The other day,  
 he even told me I've got what it takes  
to become a real idol.  
  
**Rei：**  
Yes... I feel sure that Tsumugi doesn't actually hate him.  
  
**Rei：**  
He accepted me for exactly who I am.  
If she gets to know him better, I'm sure she'll see...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ah, Mr. Knight!  
Why are you wandering off on your own?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Didn't I warn you about straying out of my sight for a second?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
If you can't cooperate, I might have to tie you up in thread!  
  
**Rei：**  
Though, well...  
It might take some time before they can be friends...
