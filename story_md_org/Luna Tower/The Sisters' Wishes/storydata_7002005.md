# Pure Sisterly Love
In a dream, Yori gets flustered when Akari recommends her some clothes in her own style, and they end up trying them on together. Touched by Akari's desire to share her sister's cuteness with the whole world, Yori begrudgingly agrees to be photographed.

\"Thanks for worrying about me\"? Urgh... I'm so stupid!
