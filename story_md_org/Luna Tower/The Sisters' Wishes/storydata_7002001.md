With Akari on the verge of collapse, Yori lends her a hand, but loses her own balance in the process, leaving {player} to catch them both. Yori tries to thank him, but ends up speaking much more harshly than she intended.

**Akari：**  
Ahh... Aaahhh...  
Oh, {player}... this is so tough on my body!  
  
**Akari：**  
The stairs are so steep, it makes me feel all dizzy!  
Gotta... keep going...  
  
**Yori：**  
You OK, Akari?  
Here, hold onto my hand!  
  
**Akari：**  
Thanks so much, sis!  
Hee hee, you're always so nice to me...  
 Hup!  
  
**Yori：**  
Waahh?! H-hey, don't pull so suddenly, or I'll lose my—  
  
**Yori：**  
H... huh?  
 I'm not falling... How come?  
  
**Akari：**  
You stepped in to support us both? Thank you, {player}!  
You're always such a hero! ♪  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh?! Waaahh! Y-you're right in my face!  
What's the big idea?!  
  
**Yori：**  
You better not have been trying to cop a feel or anything!  
Akari, you should be more careful about these things too!  
  
**Yori：**  
Nooooooo!  
Why couldn't I just *thank* him for kindly catching us?!  
Every single time, I just screw it up...  
  
**Akari：**  
Silly Yori. It's all right!  
Don't you know {player} is a proper gentleman? ♪  
  
**Akari：**  
Eheh... Keep it up, sis. You're doing great, I promise!  
  
**Akari：**  
If you keep on trying, I know you'll manage  
to express your true feelings eventually!
