# Muffled Jealousy
Yori asks {player} about the people he's previously visited the tower with, secretly squirming with jealousy. When Akari says she wishes he had invited them first, Yori almost agrees, but doesn't quite manage to get the words out.

**Yori：**  
By the way, this isn't the first time you've visited this tower, is it?  
Who did you come with last time?  
  
**Yori：**  
A couple of Caon members and that girl from Twinkle Wish...?  
H-huh... I see...  
  
**Yori：**  
You really do seem to know a lot of girls, don't you.  
  
**Yori：**  
N-not that I'm saying that's a bad thing or anything!  
I'm not saying that, but... I-it's just... Urghh...  
  
**Akari：**  
I wish you'd picked us for your first time instead!  
  
**Akari：**  
You think so too, don't you, sis?  
We'd have been ready and willing if he'd only said the word,  
 right?  
  
**Yori：**  
Well, yes...  
 Wait, wha—?!  
 H-heck no!  
Of course I wasn't thinking anything like that!  
  
**Yori：**  
Wh-why should it matter to me who you climb towers with?!  
That's obviously your own business, not mine!  
  
**Akari：**  
Really~?  
 Sure, it's his own decision,  
but that's no reason not to tell him how we feel, is it?  
  
**Akari：**  
Awww... She was so close!  
Still, she's definitely making progress!  
  
**Akari：**  
If she can keep it up...  
 I can't wait to see what happens next!  
  
**Akari：**  
Let's keep on doing our very best today! Right, sis?  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh?  
 R-right. Of course...  
...Wait, what're you even talking about?  
  
**Narration：**  
As Akari looked on happily, Yori didn't know what to think.
