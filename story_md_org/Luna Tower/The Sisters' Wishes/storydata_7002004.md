**Yori：**  
Hey, can we take a little break?  
  
**Akari：**  
Sounds good to me!  
 I can't walk another step!  
  
**Yori：**  
In that case... It's time!  
  
**Akari：**  
Hey, sis, what's that thing?  
  
**Yori：**  
Eheheh...  
This happens to be a brand-new gaming device  
that I just got my hands on this morning!  
  
**Yori：**  
See, it's optimized for portability.  
Perfect for little breaks like this, don't you think?  
  
**Akari：**  
Woooow!  
So now we can even do it outdoors?!  
  
**Yori：**  
That's the idea!  
...{player}? You're interested too, are you?  
Heheheh. I see that gleam in your eyes!  
  
**Yori：**  
Here, I'll let you have a try.  
I just got it, so I don't know all the controls yet, but...  
Let's figure it out together!  
  
**Akari：**  
...  
  
**Akari：**  
Hee hee. Look at her talking to him so happily...  
She's really in her element! ♪  
  
**Akari：**  
Aw, man... Now I wanna have lots of fun with him too! ♪
