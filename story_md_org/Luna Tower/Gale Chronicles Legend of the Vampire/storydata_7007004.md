# The Evil Eye Unleashed
Illya grows jealous of Anna's copious magical capacity, but Anna for her part is jealous of Illya being powered up through headpats. Embarrassed to be seen in such a situation, Illya makes {player} power up Anna in the same way.
  
## Subtitle: The Evil Eye Unleashed
  
**Anna：**  
Evil Eye, Open!  
Eternal Abyss Divider!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Illya：**  
You cast these great spells with the most remarkable abandon.  
Young Stechpalm, are your magic reserves without end?  
  
**Anna：**  
As long as I have Sigurd and the cursed energies of this Evil Eye,  
my will to fight is unceasing!  
Come, attack me freely if you dare, agents of the Syndicate!  
  
**Illya：**  
Agents? Are you two being hunted by an enemy force?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I don't really know either.  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
An enemy shrouded in mystery?  
 That sounds vexing...  
Well, I suppose facing hardships is the fate of those with power.  
  
**Illya：**  
I must say, though, I feel quite ashamed.  
My own magic barely lasts me a single fight.  
I must rely on my minion to return me to full strength over and over.  
  
**Illya：**  
Still, I can hardly leave all the hard work to Stechpalm.  
Grant me your aid, {player}.  
  
**Anna：**  
*glance*...  
  
**Anna：**  
Say, Sigurd...  
Why is it that when you power up Lady Ornstein, you touch her directly?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Becoming a grown-up is a tricky thing.  
`Tag 2`  
**Anna：**  
I... I see...  
 That does sound... complicated...  
  
**Illya：**  
Ahh...  
  
**Illya：**  
Whew...  
  
**Anna：**  
*glance*...  
  
**Illya：**  
I have noticed Stechpalm's gaze keeps flitting in our direction...  
Hmm. It is a little offputting...  
You may withdraw your hand now, minion.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I need to make sure you're fully powered up.  
`Tag 3`  
**Illya：**  
W-well, of course, but...  
Oh, please! Is all this rubbing necessary?!  
  
**Anna：**  
*stare*...  
  
**Illya：**  
Enough! Unhand me!  
Hmph...  
 I know!  
Stechpalm, come join us for a moment!  
  
**Anna：**  
Hm? What is it now, Lady Ornstein?  
Haven't you finished replenishing your magic?  
  
**Illya：**  
Now, pat Stechpalm's head for a change!  
Why should I be the only one humiliated?!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Pat her head.  
`Tag 4`  
**Anna：**  
Wh—what are you doing, Sigurd?!  
Patting my head isn't going to make me grow, you know!  
  
**Anna：**  
I... I wasn't glancing over at you two  
because I was jealous or anything!  
I-I swear I wasn't!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hahahah... Well, if you so fervently insist.  
Nonetheless, young Stechpalm...  
Does this sensation not fill you with strength?  
  
**Anna：**  
Well... my magic flow does seem stronger than usual...  
I see... So this is how you always feel, Lady Ornstein...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Illya：**  
Oh? Perfect timing.  
Let us give that monster a demonstration of our replenished energies!  
To battle, young Stechpalm!  
  
**Anna：**  
Yes, I quite agree!  
Evil Eye, Open the Extreme! Metamorphose: Annihilation Forme!  
  
**Illya：**  
Vermilion Bite!  
  
**Anna：**  
Apocalypse Dawn!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Illya：**  
Ho-hoh... Such remarkable capacity.  
You continue to impress, Stechpalm!  
  
**Anna：**  
Ah, but Lady Ornstein, your strike was honed to perfection!  
Technique befitting a legendary vampire indeed!  
  
**Both：**  
Hahahahahah!
