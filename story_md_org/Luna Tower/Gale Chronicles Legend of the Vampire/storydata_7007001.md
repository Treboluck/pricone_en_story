**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Anna：**  
Ahhh... There really are monsters inside!  
Will you be all right, Lady Ornstein?  
 Given your young age,  
perhaps it would be best if you stayed behind me with—  
  
**Illya：**  
Come, if you would do the honors, {player}.  
  
**Illya：**  
Heheheh... Hahahahah!  
Magical energy flows through me!  
Now, behold the Ruler of the Night's strength!  
  
**Anna：**  
Wha—? Lady Ornstein matured in an instant?!  
  
**Illya：**  
This is my own true power!  
Take this, wretch!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmph... Pitiful creature.  
...Is something wrong, Stechpalm?  
  
**Anna：**  
Lady Ornstein...  
 Is that still you?  
  
**Illya：**  
Yes.  
 Ah, did I surprise you, perchance?  
That diminutive body is but a false guise.  
This is the true form I originally hold.  
  
**Illya：**  
Ugh... Must I always return so soon?  
It is most inconvenient...  
  
**Anna：**  
She shrunk into a child again...  
If she can do all this, could it be she really is an ancient vampire?  
  
**Illya：**  
Hm? Is something wrong? You seem most flustered for some reason.  
  
**Anna：**  
No... It's nothing at all!  
  
**Anna：**  
Wait, I mean...  
 Most impressive work, Lady Ornstein!  
Your power is peerless! Ahahahahah!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmmm.  
 You really are an odd individual...
