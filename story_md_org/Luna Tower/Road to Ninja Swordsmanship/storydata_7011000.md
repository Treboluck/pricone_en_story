## Subtitle: A Clamorous Start
  
**Narration：**  
The Tower of Luna─a huge tower in the sea that soars to the heavens.  
Seeking clues to his lost memory,  
{player} visits the tower with Ruka.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Wow, this place sure is something.  
I take it this won't be a walk in the park.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hm? Don't look so worried.  
  
What did you bring me along for?  
  
**Ruka：**  
The rough stuff is my specialty.  
It's for your sake alone  
that I swing this sword without reserve.  
You're in safe hands, so leave all that to me.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Anyway, putting that aside...  
You've noticed it too, right?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hmm...  
  
**Ruka：**  
That girl's been following us since we left the city.  
She a friend of yours?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Yeah, I know her well.  
`Tag 1`  
**Ruka：**  
I see. You sure know a lot of people, don't you?  
Hey! You over there.  
Show yourself already.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Oh no! I was sneaky-sneaky, camouflaged the whole way from the city.  
I can't believe my cover was blown so easily!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Have you seen yourself? You look like you're going to a festival.  
And just who are you?  
For various reasons, you don't seem like  
a normal person.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ah!  
I'm a servant of the shogun over there.  
I am know as Ninon!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh, I didn't know you were a shogun.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  That's what she calls me.  
`Tag 2`  
**Ninon：**  
I heard that Shogun and Samurai Master are ascending the strange  
tower today,  
and I was unable to stop myself from joining in!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Please, I beg this favor! Allow me to accompany you!  
I wish to see Samurai Master's swordsmanship with my own eyes!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Huh? What's all this \"Samurai Master\" talk?  
I'm just a humble wanderer. Not at all impressive.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Such humility!  
Exterminating monsters devastating the sea, destroying a  
crime syndicate,  
and solving the case of the bewitched blade that had all  
of Landosol in its terrifying grip—  
your achievements know no bounds!  
  
**Ruka：**  
*sigh*... I guess my actions are attracting a bit too much attention.  
But all that trouble came looking for me.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Anyway, should we let her tag along?  
I'm your sword,  
so I'll abide by your decision.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I feel bad leaving a friend out.  
**Choice: (4)**  She's really dependable.  
`Tag 3`  
**Ninon：**  
Shogun!  
Gracious mercy! Terribly thankful candy sweets!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Ruka：**  
Is she now?  
...Well, even if you turned her away, I have a feeling she wouldn't listen.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Ninon：**  
Shogun, since you are allowing me to accompany you, along with  
Samurai Master,  
I'll make sure to serve you with my best exertions!  
  
**Ruka：**  
For the time being, could you quit calling me \"Samurai Master\"?  
It's making my skin crawl.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hmm?  
Then what should I call you?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  You can call her Boss Lady.  
`Tag 6`  
**Ruka：**  
Hey! Why did you tell her that?!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Oh! Boss Lady! That has a nice ring to it!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Look! This is what happens when you say such silly things!  
Sheesh, what a hopeless Shogun you are.  
  
**Narration：**  
Thus began the curious journey of a party  
united by their unusual relationships.
