# Peculiar Guilds
During their quest, Ruka and Ninon enjoy conversing about the guilds to which they belong. Ninon talks about the strong characters of the members of her guild as if she were different, to which Ruka inwardly retorts that Ninon is the same. However, she likes the fact that Ninon cares for her fellow guildmembers.

**Narration：**  
Ruka and Ninon are enjoying a friendly chat as they progress  
through the tower.  
The conversation eventually turns to their respective guilds.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Your guild, what was it again? ...Oh right,  
Toast Caramel!  
I heard it's a very, very famous guild!  
  
**Ruka：**  
We don't sound that delicious, do we?  
It's \"Twilight Caravan.\"  
Well, I wouldn't say we're famous.  
I think infamous would be more fitting.  
  
**Ruka：**  
You see, we have \"The Destroyer,\" \"The Collector,\" \"The One-Eyed  
Demon,\" and \"The Living Storm\"  
in our ranks. We're a motley crew of  
interesting types with even more interesting nicknames.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Being the master of a guild like that's pretty amazing.  
`Tag 1`  
**Ninon：**  
That's right! Samurai Master really is spectacular!  
  
**Ruka：**  
I'm just going with the flow.  
Besides, while they may have their quirks, they're not at all bad guys.  
  
**Ruka：**  
As long as I *make* them listen to me, they'll do exactly as I say.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Eeek! J-just now, I felt a sudden chill go down my spine...  
  
**Ruka：**  
So, how about your guild?  
I heard on the grapevine that the  
guildmaster of Weissflügel's a remarkable swordswoman.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Yes. Monika is but a child, yet she's a formidable soldier!  
She would make quite the match for you.  
  
Despite being so young, she's amazing!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Y-your guildmaster's a kid? And a soldier?!  
Is that even allowed? So many questions.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  She's not a kid.  
`Tag 2`  
**Ruka：**  
I-is she a kid or not? Good grief...  
Okay, how about the other members? What are they like?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Well,  
Kuka is a masochist, Yuki is a narcissist, and Ayumi is  
a stalker!  
  
**Ruka：**  
...Hold on one second.  
That series of disturbing descriptions is making my head spin.  
...What she says, is any of it true?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  It's all true.  
`Tag 3`  
**Ruka：**  
That's not the answer I was looking for!  
  
**Ninon：**  
It's true! Everyone is so peculiar,  
so Monika always has a tough time.  
She doesn't know how to handle them.  
  
**Ruka：**  
...Come on, don't you think you're a little on the peculiar side yourself?  
Don't make out as if you're suffering too.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  They're all great people.  
`Tag 4`  
**Ruka：**  
Hey you, don't you say the same about my guild members?  
You sure have a soft spot for girls, don't you?  
  
**Ninon：**  
I'm going to tell my whole guild about today's events.  
I'll tell Ayumi about climbing the tower with Shogun,  
and I'll tell Kuka  
about the monster that was teasing me.  
  
**Ninon：**  
For Yuki, I'll take something pretty as a souvenir, and for Monika...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ohhh... I completely forgot that today is training day...  
I'll get scolded when I return...  
And sent to solitary confinement...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Well, she's a little troublesome, but I don't dislike her.  
And a guild with someone like her in it  
can't be such a bad place.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Just say Shogun called you up on short notice.  
And if need be, I can even settle the matter for you.  
  
**Ninon：**  
B-Boss Lady...  
How considerate of you! I appreciate your kindness!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Geez, I guess I have a soft spot too.
