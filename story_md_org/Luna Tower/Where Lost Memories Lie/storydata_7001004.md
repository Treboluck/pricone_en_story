**Kasumi：**  
I hate to pry, but the two of you get along quite well.  
I presume you've known each other for a while?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yup. Me and Yui are childhood friends.  
  
**Yui：**  
Yeah. Nowadays, I consider Makoto one of my best friends.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Same here. It's thanks to Yui that I realized race doesn't  
matter when it comes to friendship.  
She's an irreplaceable friend to me.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Now that's heartwarming.  
I'm almost jealous, in fact.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Now for the big question.  
What's your relationship with my faithful assistant?  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh?! Err, uh...  
I...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Let's just say that Yui owes {player} a lot.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Does she now?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yup. And she's really, really, thankful to him.  
Right?  
  
**Yui：**  
I-I am.  
But you really don't need to announce it to the whole world like that.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Haha. Ain't a big deal, is it?  
Besides, he really is a good guy.  
  
**Makoto：**  
He's pretty passionate, you know?  
And he gets the job done in spite of appearances.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Hmm. I see.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
So to sum things up,  
the three of them are stuck in quite a... difficult relationship,  
to put it lightly.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Not that I'm about to bring that up with them personally.  
As they say, silence is golden. Hehe.
