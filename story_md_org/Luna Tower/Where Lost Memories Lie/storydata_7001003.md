# When a Theory Goes Wrong
{player} gives Kasumi a hand in climbing a flight of stairs. Yui arrives after the fact, making the assumption that they're in a relationship, and causing Kasumi to explain herself in a panic. Meanwhile, Makoto observes that Kasumi is much more adept than Yui at letting herself be spoiled.

**Makoto：**  
Hm... I ain't gonna complain about getting even  
better treasure from stronger monsters,  
but we're kind of coming up dry on leads here.  
  
**Yui：**  
Yeah. There hasn't really been anything  
related to Mr. Knight's memories so far.  
  
**Makoto：**  
How about you, Kasumi?  
Got anything...  
Hm? Where'd she go?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
*huff, puff*  
Good grief. Whoever made this tower needs to learn  
what an appropriate number of stairs is.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm? What is it?  
You want to give me a hand?  
Thank you. I'll take you up on that.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'm all about brains, not brawn.  
As you know, stamina isn't exactly my forte.  
  
**Makoto：**  
You okay, Kasumi?  
Sorry about that. Didn't realize we'd left you behind.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Don't worry about it, Makoto.  
If anyone should be leading the party, it's you.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Anyway,  
you notice anything in particular on your end?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Alas, no.  
And thus the investigation goes on.  
  
**Yui：**  
Wait up, Makoto... *huff, huff*  
Sorry for leaving you behind, Kasu—  
  
**Yui：**  
Wait, what?!  
K-Kasumi! Wh-why are you holding hands with Mr. Knight?!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Huh? O-oh! It's not what it looks like!  
He just helped me get up that flight of stairs!  
Nothing more, nothing less!  
  
**Yui：**  
R-right. Phew.  
That's a relief...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Dang.  
Kasumi's even more powerful than Yui somehow.  
Gonna have to keep my eye on her.
