**Narration：**  
{player}, Rino and Shiori's trek up the Tower of Luna  
is still progressing with very little trouble.  
  
**Rino：**  
We climb and climb, but it all looks the same...  
Almost feels like we're just going around in circles...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes, with so little change in scenery,  
I'm having trouble staying focused...  
Which isn't a good state of mind for archers like us.  
  
**Rino：**  
If only we had, like, some kind of boost  
to get us fired up to face the challenge...

**Rino：**  
Huh?! Wh-why are you lifting me off the ground?!  
To celebrate?!  
 Big Bro, isn't this getting out of hand?!  
I mean, I appreciate it, but...  
 No, this really is a bit scary!
