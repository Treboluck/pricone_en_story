# It Wasn't a Mistake!
Confused to no end by Rino's misspoken phrases, Shiori wonders if it's a new trend, and tries coming up with one of her own. But when Rino corrects her without missing a beat, it just makes her feel even more bewildered.
  
## Subtitle: It Wasn't a Mistake!
  
**Rino：**  
Mmm~!  
We're making great progress in this tower!  
  
**Rino：**  
It's all going without a hatch!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Huh?  
Um, I think...  
  
**Shiori：**  
She means \"without a hitch,\" doesn't she...?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Yep, no hatches here!  
`Tag 1`  
**Shiori：**  
Whaaa...?!  
  
**Rino：**  
If we keep this up,  
 you'll have your memories back  
before you know it, Big Bro!  
  
**Rino：**  
All our efforts are gonna be so worth it!  
We'll be making Mary tonight for sure!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Wh-who is Mary...?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
She means \"making merry,\" doesn't she...?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Good old Mary!  
`Tag 2`  
**Shiori：**  
No, really, who is that...?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm always behind on the latest trends from the city.  
Could \"mistakes\" like this be a fad that I don't know about?  
  
**Shiori：**  
In that case, I should try too...!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Still, it's a long climb ahead, so we should be careful.  
W-we'd... better all stay... on our fingers.  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahaha, that's not right, Shiori!  
I think you mean \"on our toes,\" don't you?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Huh...?  
 W-wait...  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh...  
Didn't I sound exactly like Big Sis Shizuru there, Big Bro?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Whaaaa...?  
  
**Narration：**  
And so the three of them continued their climb up the tower  
with Shiori feeling more bewildered than ever.
