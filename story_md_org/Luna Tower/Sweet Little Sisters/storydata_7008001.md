# Tales of Big Sisters
As they explore, Rino and Shiori share stories of their respective big sisters. Shiori explains how much she respects Hatsune, while Rino tells of how Shizuru always surprises her. As they make steady progress through the tower, it seems the two little sisters could go on chatting forever.

**Rino：**  
Hey, Shiori, didn't you tell me once before  
that you've got a sister?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes. A big sister named Hatsune, who belongs to the guild Forestier.  
  
**Rino：**  
So what kind of big sister is she?  
Is she a lot like you, or what?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Well... I suppose she's a kind person  
who worries a bit too much...  
And unlike me, she's always full of energy.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She falls asleep in the funniest places, too.  
`Tag 1`  
**Shiori：**  
Y... yes, she does.  
  
**Rino：**  
Full of energy...  
 but sleeps a lot?  
And in weird places?  
  
**Shiori：**  
She really can fall asleep anywhere.  
I've asked her to be a little more careful, but...  
  
**Rino：**  
She sounds so wild and carefree!  
I was imagining someone more gentle and refined like you, Shiori.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Wild... isn't quite how I would put it,  
 but she's very strong.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm hoping I can grow strong enough  
to protect her from harm someday.  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, Shiori...  
 You're so upstanding...!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Now that I think about it, haven't you mentioned a big sister before, too?  
What's your sister like, Rino?  
  
**Rino：**  
Urk... My \"big sister\"...  
That can only mean Big Sis Shizuru, can't it...?  
  
**Rino：**  
Hmmm... I mean, she is a kind of big sister,  
but we're not exactly sisters like you are.  
Like, sure, I can't deny we share a close bond...  
  
**Rino：**  
Anyway, I guess, in a word...  
 I'd say she's... on the eccentric side.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Eccentric?  
  
**Rino：**  
She's really strong, and super reliable...  
But when it comes to Big Bro, she can get a little scary...?  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, but she really is a kind person normally!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Big Sis Chop!  
`Tag 2`  
**Rino：**  
Ahhh... Those chops hurt more than you'd think...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hee hee. She sounds like such an interesting person.  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh yeah, speaking of Big Sis,  
 this one time she...  
  
**Shiori：**  
You'll never believe what Hatsune bought me...  
  
**Narration：**  
As the little sisters climbed steadily up the tall, tall tower,  
it seemed the tales of their big sisters might never end.
