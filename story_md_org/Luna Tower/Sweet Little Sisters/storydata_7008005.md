GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Rino：**  
Haaahhh!  
  
**Rino：**  
W-waaagh?! My arrow went way off course!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Rino! Get down for me!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Rino：**  
Thanks a bunch, Shiori!  
You saved my hide!  
  
**Shiori：**  
No, not at all... I'm happy to be able to help.  
Hmm? What's that lying on the ground?  
  
**Rino：**  
Looks like my wayward arrow, and...  
 some kind of shard?  
Ahh! Did I break something?!  
Am I gonna get chewed out?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Rino! Try to calm down!  
Actually, is something glowing?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh? Awaahh!  
What's going ooooon?!

Today I'm on a walk with Big Bro~! ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Go on! You gotta sing along too, Big Bro!  
Huh? You'd rather not?  
Hmph. Rejecting this perfect expression of my feelings?!  
  
**Rino：**  
It's just been so long since we went on a walk together!  
We've gotta enjoy it!  
  
**Rino：**  
On a walk with—  
 Wait, hmm?  
Who's that crouching down over there? She looks kinda sickly, huh?  
I'll go see if she needs anything!  
  
**Shiori：**  
*huff*... *puff*...  
  
**Rino：**  
Um... Are you feeling OK?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Huh? Oh...  
 I'm sorry. Did I make you worry?  
I'm not exactly healthy, so I often get dizzy like this...  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh! That's not good at all!  
Is there anything you need?  
Some water to drink, maybe?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ahh... I really am all right now...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hee hee. It's just like when Hatsune worries about me...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Huh? Is that {player} over there...?  
  
**Rino：**  
Uweh? Do you know this girl, Big Bro?  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh... You're a real avid reader, huh, Shiori?  
Maybe I ought to read a few more books myself...  
  
**Shiori：**  
So you're studying for your exams?  
And you love sewing and hope to become a fashion designer...  
That's so mature. I'm in awe...!  
  
**Rino：**  
M-m-mature?!  
I've never been called that before, Big Bro!  
What a bowlful of glue!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Bowlful of glue...?  
  
**Shiori：**  
...?  
 Oh! Does she mean a \"bolt from the blue\"?  
Still, \"bowlful of glue\"... That's actually kind of cute...  
  
**Rino：**  
Whaddaya think, Big Bro? Do I look mature?  
If we stood side by side, would we look like a couple?  
Wait, where did that scandalous idea pop out from?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
…\"Big Bro\"...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Yes?  
`Tag 1`  
**Shiori：**  
Oh! D-did I say that out loud?!  
N-no, you've got it wrong!  
  
**Shiori：**  
I, um... Rino sounds so happy when she calls you that,  
so I had a sudden urge to...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Call me \"dearest brother.\"  
**Choice: (3)**  Call me \"the Bro-ster.\"  
`Tag 2`  
**Shiori：**  
D-dearest brother...?  
Like that, do you mean?  
  
**Rino：**  
Big Bro... Is that what you're really into?  
'Cause if so, I guess I could...  
Wait, but Big Bro is my big bro, so...  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Shiori：**  
B-bro... st... N-no, I can't.  
It's so embarrassing, I can't say it...!  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, you can't do that, Big Bro! Forcing her against her will!  
I'll say it if you really want!  
B-Bro-ster?  
 Hmm... Gotta say, that one feels pretty weird...  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Rino：**  
I know! Hey, Shiori,  
we're on our way to this really cute place. You wanna come with?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Huh? ...A cute place?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Are you really sure I should be intruding?  
  
**Rino：**  
Do you not like desserts?  
  
**Shiori：**  
No, I do love them...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Just for today, it's your big bro's treat.  
`Tag 5`  
**Shiori：**  
Huh?! Oh, no,  
 I couldn't possibly—

Do you mean that, Big Bro?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Well then...! We'll have the Deluxe Pudding à la Mode,  
the Ultra Crepe with every topping, the Rainbow Cotton Candy...!  
And then, and then...!

**Rino：**  
Ahhh~! It's like something out of a dream!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Y-you're really... eating all of that?  
  
**Rino：**  
I sure am! It was my dream  
to feast on a whole table of sweet desserts!  
  
**Rino：**  
Besides, this is still just the top of the iced burger!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Burger?  
...  
Do you mean the \"tip of the iceberg\"...?  
  
**Rino：**  
Right, yes, that! You're so smart, Shiori!  
Now, why don't we dig in to this feast already?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
U-um... Is this OK with you, {player}?  
You've been staring at your wallet for a few minutes now...  
  
**Shiori：**  
A-are those tears in your eyes?!  
  
**Rino：**  
What're you waiting for, Shiori?!  
If you're too slow, I'll finish it all myself!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ummm, ahh... well...  
  
**Rino：**  
*munch munch* *snarf snarf*  
Mmmm, it's all so sweet!  
Three cheers for our generous Big Bro! ♪

**Shiori：**  
Mnhh... Was I passed out on the floor?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, not again... I've caused everyone trouble!  
Or so I thought, but were you asleep too, {player}?  
Then I'm guessing Rino is...  
  
**Rino：**  
Mmm... I can't eat another bite... ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Well, maybe... just one extra helping of gelatin! Eheheh... ♪  
  
**Shiori：**  
She looks so happy...  
 Perhaps Rino is having  
a dream just like the one I had just now.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I can't recall the details, but in the dream, I...  
I think I called you...  
  
**Shiori：**  
…\"Big Bro.\"  
  
**Shiori：**  
That part I seem to remember.  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahh!  
I sense a threat to my little sister position!  
  
**Rino：**  
Hmm...? But it feels like I just had a super happy dream...?  
  
**Rino：**  
I don't really remember,  
but somehow I'm feeling hungrier than ever!  
  
**Rino：**  
Big Bro!  
Let's call it a day in here and go eat some sweet treats!  
You, me, and Shiori! 'Kay?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Huh...? Is it okay for me to join you?  
  
**Rino：**  
Well, of course it is!  
You don't mind, right, Big Bro?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Just for today, it's your big bro's treat.  
`Tag 7`  
**Rino：**  
You mean that, Big Bro?!  
...Wait, Big Bro,  
 do you even have that much money?  
  
**Shiori：**  
You know... I'm not really sure why,  
but I'm in the mood to eat desserts as well.  
  
**Rino：**  
Well then, let's get out of this tower and feast!  
  
**Rino & Shiori：**  
'Kay, Big Bro? ♪

Not long afterwards, {player} found himself  
sitting in a cake shop and staring into his own empty wallet.
