# The Bonds We Share
Saren is feeling gloomy over being forced to attend a party. Akino and {player} appear in a helicopter to invite her out for yakisoba buns, which Saren initially declines. After being told that she should do as she pleases, though, the three of them fly off together.
  
## Subtitle: The Bonds We Share
  
**Narration：**  
The trio are about to deliver the final blow  
to a monster that appeared in their way.  
  
**Saren：**  
Prepare yourself! Haaah!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Saren：**  
*huff, puff*  
I think that was the last one...  
See anything related to {player}'s memories...?  
  
**Akino：**  
Over there!  
One of them dropped something!  
  
**Saren：**  
That might be what we're looking for!  
  
**Akino：**  
Then I'll be the first to obtain it!  
  
**Saren：**  
As if I'd let you!  
  
**Akino：**  
Ah. We both touched it at the same time.  
What do we do now...?  
  
**Akino：**  
Huh? What's this light emanating from it?  
  
**Saren：**  
I-it's so bright!  
I can't keep my eyes open!

**Attendant：**  
Now then.  
Please enjoy some tea while I prepare your outfit.  
  
**Saren：**  
Sure, sure. Have fun.  
  
**Saren：**  
Father got me good. I never expected him to contact thes  
chool directly to ensure I make it to tonight's party.  
He must be serious about it.  
  
**Saren：**  
I normally use the student council as an excuse to skip parties  
considering how much of a waste of time they usually are,  
but  
I guess I'd be better off taking part this time around.  
  
**Saren：**  
So much for inviting {player} out for some yakisoba buns.  
It just had to be on a day where I could finish up early, didn't it?  
  
**Saren：**  
The days where I didn't need to worry about this sort of stuff  
sure are long gone, aren't they? I swore I'd face all this head on,  
but now I just feel kind of lost...  
  
**Saren：**  
What am I even doing with my life?  
  
**Attendant：**  
Hey!  
What's that noise?!  
  
**???：**  
Ohohoho! I have arrived!  
From the sky, no less!  
  
**Saren：**  
Well that sure is a ruckus.  
  
**Saren：**  
Wait a minute. A helicopter?  
At this time of day, in this part of town, flying directly over my house?!  
  
**Akino：**  
{player}!  
There she is!  
Lower the rope!  
  
**Saren：**  
Akino?!  
And why's {player} with her?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Grab onto me.  
`Tag 1`

**Saren：**  
What's going on he—  
Aaaaahhhhh!  
  
**Saren：**  
H-hold on a minute!  
Just what in the world is going on?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll tell you later.  
**Choice: (3)**  Your turn, Akino.  
`Tag 2`  
**Saren：**  
Tell me *now*!  
Eeek!  
The wind's going to blow me off!  
Don't let go of me,  
{player}!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Akino：**  
Ohohoho!  
No time for chitchat! We must flee!  
Let's make haste, {player}!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Saren：**  
Oh, for the love of...!  
What is this mess, and why am I getting wrapped up in it?!  
  
**Akino：**  
Not one for being patient, are we?  
Then allow me the honor of explaining!  
  
**Akino：**  
I happened to get los—  
...Err.  
I bumped into {player} on my way back to the mansion.  
  
**Akino：**  
Twas a sad day for him indeed. Aware of how busy you've been lately,  
he sought to bring you a yakisoba bun to snack on.  
Yet he was turned away at the door after visiting your home.  
  
**Akino：**  
And far be it from me to leave someone in trouble be!  
Thus, here we are, ready to help!  
  
**Saren：**  
You could have just walked here, you know!  
There's no way he'd get turned back if you were with him,  
but here you are bringing a *helicopter* into the picture!  
  
**Akino：**  
On the contrary, why *wouldn't* I turn up in a helicopter?  
  
**Saren：**  
Y-you're beyond belief, you know that?  
*sigh* I've got a mouthful and more to say about this, but whatever.  
Hurry up and let me go back home, will you?  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh? Did you have a prior engagement, perhaps?  
The plan was to take you to what I believe was called a candy store  
and have you enjoy a freshly made yakisoba bun.  
  
**Saren：**  
Wait, you're taking me *there*?!  
Actually, no, you're not.  
I've got a party to attend tonight, so let me down.  
  
**Akino：**  
You? Attending a party?  
I don't recall there being anything special  
about the one taking place tonight.  
  
**Saren：**  
Look.  
There's times when a gal has to suck it up  
and go through with something she doesn't want to.  
  
**Akino：**  
Goodness gracious me! {player}!  
We've somehow gotten hold of an imposter!  
  
**Saren：**  
Wh-what made you come to that conclusion?!  
I'm real as can be!  
  
**Akino：**  
Then what say you just do as you please?  
This isn't how the Saren I know would act!  
  
**Saren：**  
I-I'd appreciate it if you didn't make me sound like an egomaniac!  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh.  
Now that's more like it.  
  
**Saren：**  
And now you're making it sound like I'm always angry!  
Hey, {player}! Stick up for me!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  It sure is fun when the three of us are together.  
`Tag 5`  
**Saren：**  
Wh-what?!  
Speak for yourself...  
  
**Akino：**  
Do you... disagree with that sentiment?  
  
**Saren：**  
E-err... Well...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Saren...  
`Tag 6`  
**Saren：**  
Argh! Ganging up on me isn't fair!  
...  
Of course I have fun when we're together!  
In fact, I want to go grab some yakisoba buns right now!  
  
**Akino：**  
Saren...!  
  
**Saren：**  
Whatever!  
I've already said it, so I might as well go through with it!  
We're getting those buns!  
  
**Akino：**  
Now *this* is the Saren I know!  
  
**Akino：**  
Let us bid adieu to those below, then.  
Saren's coming with us for the time being!  
  
**Saren：**  
Give my regards to my father!  
Now, {player}. You made a big flashy entrance,  
so it's only fair that you make your exit just as impactful!  
  
**Akino：**  
But more importantly, I went to quite the effort for you this time, Saren.  
It's only fair to say that you owe me one!  
  
**Saren：**  
Sure, sure.  
I appreciate the concern, so that's fine with me.  
  
**Akino：**  
Ohohoho! Then I'll be sure to make the most of it!  
First and foremost,  
any and all competitions I propose must be acce—  
  
**Saren：**  
Don't worry.  
I already plan on letting you off for intruding  
on school grounds in your little helicopter.  
  
![700600502.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/700600502.webp)  
**Akino：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Saren：**  
You flew it over {player}'s school without  
permission, right?  
Being from a powerful family doesn't mean  
you can just get away with that sort of stuff, you know.  
  
**Saren：**  
Our school received a formal complaint.  
And I'm the one that had to deal with it as student council president.  
  
**Akino：**  
I-I wasn't aware of this.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm surprised you didn't see it coming in the first place.  
Did I mention how many favors you owe me, by the way?  
I'll make sure to pick the perfect timing to remind you about them. ♪  
  
**Akino：**  
Urgh...  
She's gone right back to her usual self.  
And I have no comebacks for her!  
  
**Saren：**  
If this was anyone else, I'd tell them to shape up and learn their lesson already...  
  
**Saren：**  
But I guess pulling these sorts of stunts is what makes you who you are, Akino.  
  
**Akino：**  
Huh?  
  
**Saren：**  
It'd be boring if you became all meek and modest all of a sudden.  
I prefer you this way.  
  
**Saren：**  
Pull all the stunts you want.  
{player}'ll be there to back you up.  
A-and so will I.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Sure will.  
`Tag 7`

**Akino：**  
G-goodness...  
We really are the best of friends, aren't we?!  
  
**Saren：**  
Qu-quit it with the hugs!  
I'm gonna fall! I'm really gonna fall!  
  
**Saren：**  
No matter how tough it gets, they're always there for me.  
They always help me remember my true self.  
Thank you.  
  
**Akino：**  
No matter how much I push myself, no matter how many regrets I have,  
they're always there to support me. Thank you.  
  
**Saren & Akino：**  
The two of you mean the world to me.

**Saren：**  
Mmm...?  
Huh? This is the Tower of Luna, isn't it?  
I could swear we were in mid-air just a minute ago...  
  
**Akino：**  
Urgh... Wh-  
what in the world was that dream?  
I can't even begin to fathom that vehicle we were riding.  
  
**Saren：**  
Same here. It sure was noisy.  
  
**Choice: (12)**  Holding onto that ladder was hard.  
`Tag 12`  
**Saren：**  
Ladder? So you saw it as well?  
  
**Akino：**  
Does that mean we all had the exact same dream?  
Incredible! It's a miracle!  
  
**Saren：**  
Putting the logic behind that aside for a second, I can't believe I had  
to deal with your antics even during a dream... Anyway, I'm really  
hungry,  
so let's forget about our competition for now and go home.  
  
**Akino：**  
D-Don't be silly, Saren!  
I would never abandon a competi—  
  
**Akino：**  
Err. I can, uh, explain...  
  
**Saren：**  
You're hungry as well, right?  
  
**Akino：**  
F-fine.  
But this isn't over!  
  
**Saren：**  
Yeah, yeah. Let's settle the score some other time.  
  
**Saren：**  
Now then,  
how about we go get some yakisoba buns, {player}?  
  
**Akino：**  
What say we go for a meal, {player}?  
  
**Saren：**  
Akino? Mind explaining why you're holding his hand?  
  
**Akino：**  
I could ask the same question of you, Saren.  
  
**Saren：**  
I asked him first!  
  
**Akino：**  
I took his hand first!  
  
**Saren & Akino：**  
Grrrrrr!  
  
**Saren：**  
...  
  
  
**Akino：**  
...  
  
**Saren：**  
How about we all go together?  
  
**Akino：**  
Now that sounds like a plan! ♪  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus the three of them went out for yakisoba buns.  
  
**Narration：**  
Akino, beyond amazed at their deliciousness,  
caused a stir by attempting to buy out the store itself.  
Yet it was an event they would all think back on fondly.
