## Subtitle: Conflicting Passions
  
**Narration：**  
The Tower of Luna.  
A mysterious structure said to contain  
hints regarding {player}'s memories.  
  
**Narration：**  
On the tower's first floor,  
Saren awaits {player}'s arrival.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm... {player} said he'd come by after finishing his errands,  
didn't he? Oh well,  
no rush. He'll be here soon.  
  
**Saren：**  
Really, though.  
Why didn't he tell me about this sooner?  
I'm more than willing to help him out with recovering his memories!  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, here he comes.  
  
Hey, {player}! Over here!  
...Huh? Is that Akino with him?!  
  
**Akino：**  
Goodness, Saren!  
What are you doing here?!  
  
**Saren：**  
I could ask you the same question, lady!  
What's this all about?  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, I happened to get los—  
...Err.  
I bumped into {player} on my way back to the mansion.  
  
**Akino：**  
He informed me of a place that contains hints  
concerning his memories,  
so I offered to assist him.  
Just as one would!  
  
**Saren：**  
How do you go out for errands and come back  
with a girl on your arm?!  
I wouldn't be surprised if someone  
told me you're using some kind of magic to attract them!  
  
**Akino：**  
*staaare*  
  
**Saren：**  
What's with that look, Akino?  
Is there something on my face?  
  
**Akino：**  
I was aware that the two of you knew one another, but I must admit...  
Learning that you're this close comes as quite the surprise.  
  
**Saren：**  
C-close?  
W-well, I mean,  
we do go out to eat yakisoba buns and stuff now and then.  
  
**Saren：**  
That, plus he lives at the Sarendia Orphanage right now.  
It's, uh, only natural that we'd become a bit close...  
  
**Akino：**  
Wh-what was that?!  
The two of you are living together?!  
Under the same roof?!  
  
**Saren：**  
L-let's not get carried away here!  
It's not just us! Suzume and all the other children are there!  
H-he and I aren't really... N-never mind!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You've woken me up in the morning before.  
**Choice: (2)**  I remember that time you spoon-fed me.  
`Tag 1`  
**Akino：**  
Y-you went into a man's personal quarters in the morning  
and woke him up with a gentle shake, even though that's not your job?!  
That's no ordinary act. That's what a happy wife would do!  
  
**Saren：**  
Th-that imagination of yours is way too active for its own good!  
Calm down for a second, will you?  
I only woke him up because Suzume was too busy!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Akino：**  
Y-you spoon-fed him...? H-hold on a minute.  
This... this wasn't one of those \"Say 'ah!'\" situations, was it?!  
Saren! Did you do the deed?!  
  
**Saren：**  
D-don't put it that way!  
I just took care of him because Kokkoro wasn't around!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Akino：**  
I-I can't believe it. You're living together?  
Wh-what an enviable—  
Err,  
unseemly...  
No. Perhaps that's not fair, considering the children...  
  
**Saren：**  
And off she goes.  
If there's anything I've learned over the years,  
it's that she'll go on a while once the gears start turning.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Have you known each other for a long time?  
`Tag 4`  
**Saren：**  
Oh, right.  
I never did tell you, did I?  
We're... childhood friends, I guess?  
Both of our fathers are acquainted,  
so we would meet at parties often. Right, Akino?  
  
**Akino：**  
Urgh... This is terrible. What if they...?  
No. I won't let it happen.  
I can't be bested here!  
  
**Saren：**  
Uh-oh. I know where this is going.  
  
**Akino：**  
You leave me no choice, Saren!  
Let us compete, right here and now!  
  
**Saren：**  
Aaand there it is.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  What's going on?  
`Tag 5`  
**Saren：**  
We always end up competing against each other whenever we meet.  
Swordsmanship, sales, studying, even monster exterminating.  
I've been spared recently since we're both so busy, but here we go again.  
  
**Akino：**  
Saren! Today's competition is simple!  
Whoever locates clues regarding {player}'s  
memories first shall be the winner!  
  
**Saren：**  
I know you love these little contests, but let me be frank here.  
There's no reason for me to accept in the first place,  
plus it's just plain inefficient this time around.  
  
**Akino：**  
Y-you're sounding awfully like Mifuyu...  
How about this, then?  
The winner will receive tickets to  
the Wisteria Family's luxurious leisure facility!  
  
**Saren：**  
And where's the merit in that for you?  
Your family owns the resort, you know.  
Though I have to admit, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested...  
  
**Akino：**  
D-do you have a problem with our leisure facility?!  
We have hot springs, and even the highest quality food!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Call me interested.  
`Tag 6`  
**Akino：**  
Huh?  
Really?!  
  
**Saren：**  
How many tickets are we talking here, Akino?  
  
**Akino：**  
T-two tickets...  
  
**Saren：**  
So basically, if I win this competition and invite {player},  
we can spend some alone time at that leisure facility?!  
  
**Akino：**  
Inviting a man outright would be far too embarrassing,  
but if I win this,  
then I can casually give him the second ticket  
since it was originally a prize,  
can't I?!  
  
**Saren：**  
Okay, Akino.  
You're on.  
  
**Akino：**  
Neither of us can afford to lose, it seems!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus their passionate battle commenced,  
all while {player} looked on in a panic.
