# The Wisteria Creed
Though the competition continues, the trio find themselves with little to show for it. Each taking a break in turns, {player} questions Akino as to why she issues so many challenges to Saren, who takes the opportunity to explain her relationship with Saren.
  
## Subtitle: The Wisteria Creed
  
**Narration：**  
The trio continue to fend off monsters as they climb the tower.  
The further they climb, however, the more fierce the monsters grow.  
  
**Saren：**  
Phew... We'll be feeling this in the morning if we keep at this pace.  
Hey, Akino. How about we call this off for now?  
  
**Akino：**  
*huff, puff*  
O-oh? Giving in already, are we?  
  
**Saren：**  
I meant that we should take a break. Don't forget what we're  
competing over here.  
If we want to find clues about {player}'s  
memories, then climbing the tower is a must.  
  
**Saren：**  
And the biggest obstacle to that is the monsters we run across.  
If they're going to keep getting stronger, then we need to be  
in top condition.  
Efficiency is best for both of us,  
right?  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, if you say so.  
Let us take a little break.  
  
**Saren：**  
Thirty minutes should do.  
One of us can be on watch duty, and we'll swap every ten minutes.  
How does that sound?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  As good as can be.  
`Tag 1`  
**Akino：**  
No objections from me.  
  
**Saren：**  
It's a deal, then.  
I'll go on watch first,  
so you two get some rest.  
  
**Akino：**  
Honestly...  
That's one side of her that I can't match up against right now.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  How come?  
`Tag 2`  
**Akino：**  
I'm the one that needs rest, not her.  
But if you factor in the  
monsters in the upper stratums, she needs to conserve her strength as  
well. Hence she did this for my sake,  
but in a way that benefits us both.  
  
**Akino：**  
It's incredible.  
But I shan't yield!  
I'll assert my dominance after this break!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Why are you so obsessed with competing with Saren?  
`Tag 3`  
**Akino：**  
...This isn't something I divulge often, but...  
  
**Akino：**  
I was born and raised as the daughter of the Wisteria Family.  
But I didn't want to let that define me. I wanted to be  
proud of both myself as a person,  
and as a member of the household.  
  
**Akino：**  
That's why I worked relentlessly to learn everything I know now.  
From swordsmanship to the art of horse riding,  
I aimed to be the best I could be in every field.  
  
**Akino：**  
That, in turn, isolated me from my peers.  
I found myself alone more often than not...  
Until I met Saren, that is.  
  
**Akino：**  
We shared not only the same background, but also  
that desire to better ourselves. That's why I want  
to surpass her… No.  
I *must* surpass her!  
  
**Akino：**  
There's another reason as well, to be honest,  
but I'd rather not say.  
Think of it as my little secret. ♪  
  
**Akino：**  
Just watch, {player}!  
The road ahead may be long,  
but I will surpass her one day!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You're really determined, aren't you?  
`Tag 4`  
**Akino：**  
Huh?! U-um... I-I certainly didn't expect a headpat...  
H-how does one normally react in a situation like this?!  
N-not to imply that I'm against it, of course!  
  
**Akino：**  
It's a little embarrassing,  
but having my efforts  
acknowledged by someone else is a lovely feeling,  
indeed.  
  
**Akino：**  
{player}...  
I just spoke of why I don't want to lose to Saren, but...  
  
**Akino：**  
Lately,  
I've found myself with another reason.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hey, Akino. It's almost time to switch.  
  
**Akino：**  
A-ah, yes! Of course!  
I-it's my turn now, so please rest yourselves up!  
  
**Saren：**  
She looked awfully red in the face, didn't she?  
Plus she sure took off in a hurry.  
  
**Saren：**  
...Fess up, {player}.  
What did you do to her?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Nothing special, really.  
`Tag 5`  
**Saren：**  
So nothing happened, then. Right.  
This is as good an opportunity as ever,  
so let me give it to you straight.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'll never, *ever*  trust you when you say that \"nothing\" happened!  
  
**Saren：**  
So fess up, already!  
What did you do to her?!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus Saren's interrogation continued until  
it was {player}'s turn to be on watch.
