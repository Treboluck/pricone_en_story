## Subtitle: An Ideal to Aspire To
  
**Narration：**  
The trio proceed smoothly through the tower,  
yet they still find no sight of any clues  
pertaining to {player}'s memories.  
  
**Saren：**  
We might be best off taking a little break here.  
  
**Akino：**  
Then allow me to take up watch duty first.  
You two rest yourselves up.  
  
**Saren：**  
Take care, now.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm amazed she's still full of energy.  
Makes me even more curious about what a certain someone did to her.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let me try and remember...  
`Tag 1`  
**Saren：**  
I can hazard a few guesses, so don't waste your time.  
Back to Akino, though. Some people never change, do they?  
Trust her to turn this whole situation into another competition.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  When did you two first meet?  
`Tag 2`  
**Saren：**  
Hm, let's see... Ah, that was it!  
About a year after my family was given noble status,  
I'd say?  
I was desperately studying how to carry myself as a noble back then.  
  
**Saren：**  
And then came time for us to attend a party with our new status.  
It was full of adults that couldn't trust one another, plus people trying  
to get closer to my father through me. Just terrible all around.  
  
**Saren：**  
I did my best to deal with them for my father's sake,  
but they got more pushy as the party went on.  
  
**Saren：**  
I was about ready to burst.  
But just as I was seconds away from screaming,  
she appeared.  
  
**Saren：**  
\"Proper manners are of the utmost importance here.  
If you're foolish enough to force conversation on another,  
then take your leave right now!\"  
That's what she told them.  
  
**Saren：**  
Much as I hate to admit it, she was really cool back then.  
Her attitude was refined and flawless, but also noble.  
She defined what that word meant, and how we should all carry ourselves.  
  
**Saren：**  
That made me take my studies even more seriously.  I wanted to  
realize that same ideal.  
To be as splendid as she was.  
Never would  
have guessed that our relationship would develop like this, though.  
  
**Saren：**  
There's another reason we've been together for so long,  
but I'll keep that one a secret.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  The two of you are surprisingly similar.  
`Tag 3`  
**Saren：**  
Similar, huh... *sigh* I knew it.  
You had a discussion like this with her, didn't you?  
  
**Saren：**  
We're not similar, though.  
She's still an aspiration of mine at this point,  
so save that for when I can actually compare myself to her.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  That makes two people with real determination.  
`Tag 4`  
**Saren：**  
I hope you're not expecting anyth—  
Wh-what's with the headpat out of nowhere?!  
  
**Saren：**  
You did it because you get how hard I'm working?  
Ahh. You did this to Akino too, didn't you?  
That'd explain why she was so flustered.  
  
**Saren：**  
Here's a suggestion.  
Save that sort of stuff for Ayane, Kurumi and Kokkoro.  
I'm sure they'd really appreciate it.  
  
**Saren：**  
Now then, there's still some time left, but I'll go switch with Akino.  
  
**Saren：**  
Akino.  
You can go on break now.  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh? Are you sure?  
Then allow me to do just th—  
W-wait,  
did something happen?! Your face is bright red!  
  
**Saren：**  
Huh?! N-nothing happened! Nothing at all!  
I'm always like this!  
Nothing suspicious going on whatsoever!  
  
**Akino：**  
Th-that's an entirely suspicious statement in and of itself...  
  
**Saren：**  
A-anyway! You go get some rest!  
You know what I always say! Time is money!  
  
**Akino：**  
W-well, if you say so...  
  
**Saren：**  
...Okay, she's gone.  
  
**Saren：**  
*sigh* Patting my head out of nowhere is just cheating...  
Even worse, Akino saw me blushing.  
I-I wasn't grinning like an idiot, was I?!  
  
**Saren：**  
I can't believe I let *anyone* see me like that, let alone Akino...  
Arghhh! Seriously, what's his deal?!
