# To Date or Not to Date
Suzuna asks {player} out on a date, but Nozomi stops her. Undeterred, Suzuna asks Nozomi to go on a date with her instead, leaving Nozomi embarrassed about their different takes on the idea of a date.
  
## Subtitle: To Date or Not to Date
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hey hey, Nozomin.  
Do you go on dates and stuff?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Dates?!  
Well, uh... N-not really, I guess?  
Mind if I ask why?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Y'see, there's this other model I'm friends with.  
She's been super giddy lately.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Keeps talking about scoring a date with the guy she likes.  
Never seen her that excited before, you know?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
So I was kinda wondering if, like, everyone goes on dates?  
Am I the only one missing out?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Well I,  
uh, can't speak for everyone.  
That sort of stuff is a no-go for idols,  
so I don't have much experience with it...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Aww, man!  
Just remembering how excited she looked is making me all jelly!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh! Whiz-boy! Let's do a date when we get back to Landosol!  
Total brain genius idea, amirite?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh?! A date with {player}?!  
No way! That's not allowed!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
How come?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Errr, well...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
O-our image is important, you know?  
Just imagine all the weird rumors if someone caught you two together.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Urgh! It's like I'm telling myself off here...!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Ahh, right.  
Cool beans. Guess I'll drop it for now.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Actually. How about we go on a date, Nozomin?  
They won't care if it's two gals!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
The two of us?  
Uhhh... I-I think that'd be fine?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Yassssss!  
No take-backs!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
The fact that she called it a date had me on edge for a sec,  
but I guess she just meant hanging out.  
I think I might be a bit too self-conscious.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
That said... Going on a date does sound nice.  
Especially if it was with {player}...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
{player}?!  
Wh-what's wrong?! Why are you staring at me?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh?  
You're wondering why my facial expressions are all over the place?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
N-no reason in particular!  
Hey, come on! We gotta catch up with Suzuna!  
  
**Narration：**  
Her face bright red,  
Nozomi grabbed {player}'s hand and led the way.
