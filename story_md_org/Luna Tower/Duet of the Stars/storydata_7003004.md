# Sweet Regret
Nozomi can't hide her embarrassment after accidentally admitting how fun it is to spend time with {player}. Suzuna, caught in the heat of the moment, agrees with Nozomi, only to end up embarrassed herself. And thus their hollow laughs echo through the tower.

**Nozomi：**  
Oh yeah, I meant to ask.  
How did the two of you meet in the first place?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
You'll never believe it.  
We met at a candy store.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
His brain game was *seriously* on fleek that day!  
He went all percentage calculation mode on me!  
Like, straight up whiz-boy material, y'know?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
How about you, Nozomin?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
He helped me out when a group of fans were chasing me.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
The thing is, though,  
he didn't even know I was an idol at the time.  
That was pretty funny, thinking back.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
WHAT?!  
You gotta be kidding me, whiz-boy!  
Like, how could you not know who Nozomin is?  
Total bruh moment right there.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ahaha.  
It's okay.  
If anything, he helped me realize that I've still got a long way to go.  
And he's done nothing but help me since we met.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Plus, I feel like I can be myself around him.  
If that makes any sense!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I totes get it!  
And it's like, time just flies when you're with him, right?  
I wonder why?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, hey!  
It's not just me!  
I guess it's because we're always having fun when we're with him?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Whoa, hold up.  
This is heading into dangerous territory.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I was totes thinking that too!  
You and me are on hella same brain-lengths!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
S-Suzuna!  
Don't say any more!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
So I guess, like, the two of us consider him a super special—  
  
**Suzuna：**  
...Yikes.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
A-a super special... what?  
Aha. Ahah... lol.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wh-who knows?  
Haha, ahaha...  
  
**Narration：**  
Their hollow laughter was the only sound  
to be heard in the tower for a while.
