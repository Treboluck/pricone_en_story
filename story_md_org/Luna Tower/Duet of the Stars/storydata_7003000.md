**Suzuna：**  
OMG, check out the size of this tower. What an absolute unit.  
You can't even see the peak! What the heck!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I'd heard the Tower of Luna was huge, but this is something else.  
You know, this gives me a good idea for some lyrics!  
I'd better jot them down!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Your memories and stuff are here, right, whiz-boy?  
We'll help you gather them all up today!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Yeah. You've done nothing but help us,  
so this feels like the least we can do.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Gotta say, though.  
I never woulda figured that ol' whiz-boy was buds with  
Carmina's own Nozomin.  
Totes a shocker.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You're telling me.  
  
I never even dreamed that he'd be friends with a top model like you.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hehe.  
You never know what to expect when you're with him, do you?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I'd heard that {player} was working at  
one of the clothing stores I frequent, but I sure never expected  
to find the two of you chatting away when I popped by.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Much less that the three of us would end up going on adventure together like this.  
Today's just full of surprises.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
By the way,  
I noticed you've got a cute nickname for him.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
A cute nickname? You mean \"whiz-boy\"?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Yup, yup.  
That's the one.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Awesome! I knew you'd be into it!  
He's just like, hella whiz-boy, isn't he?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh?  
U-uhh,  
yeah! Hella whiz-boy!  
N-now if only I knew what that meant...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
All righty, whiz-boy. Let's get going! ♪  
Don't worry,  
we'll get your memories back in a flash!
