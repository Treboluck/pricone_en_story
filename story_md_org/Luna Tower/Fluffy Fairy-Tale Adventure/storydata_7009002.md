# The Kingdom and the Unicorn
Enchanted by Lima, Maho yet again tries to sign her up for residency in the Maho-Maho Kingdom, but Lima refuses, saying she does not wish to be treated like a horse. Maho then offers her the more favorable(?) option of becoming a unicorn of the kingdom. Negotiations are ongoing.

**Lima：**  
Hey, Maho.  
About that Maho-Maho Kingdom you keep mentioning. Just what is it?  
It's not a guild, is it?  
  
**Maho：**  
The Maho-Maho Kingdom is a kingdom where I'm a princess, and this fine fella here is a prince.  
  
**Lima：**  
A kingdom where you're a princess  
and {player} is a prince...  
  
**Maho：**  
That's right.  
It's a mighty nice country where folks from all walks of life  
live oh so happily.  
  
**Lima：**  
It must be a wonderful place, if it's your kingdom.  
You've piqued my interest.  
  
**Maho：**  
Then how 'bout you become a resident?  
You're more than welcome.  
  
**Lima：**  
Really?  
But I don't want you to treat me like a horse!  
  
**Maho：**  
Well then, how 'bout you become a unicorn?  
It's perfect for  
a strong gal like yourself.  
Havin' both my prince and  
Lima the Unicorn around would sure be  
somethin' special.  
  
**Lima：**  
I mean,  
unicorns *are* all fairy tale-ish and cute…  
  
**Maho：**  
Then by all means.  
  
**Lima：**  
Wait, what am I saying?! Hard pass!  
I don't even have a horn!  
  
**Maho：**  
You don't need no horn, darlin'.  
This here fluffy coat of yours is unicorn-grade enough.  
  
**Lima：**  
Ah! Stop petting me!  
The way you do it feels so good, I might accidentally  
take you up on your offer!  
  
**Maho：**  
Ain't no problem by me.  
  
**Lima：**  
It *is* a problem!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus, Maho continued onward through the tower,  
all the while pleasantly stroking Lima.
