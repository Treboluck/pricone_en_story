GRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Lima：**  
Eek!

Miracle Mahorin, twinkle twinkle hoy...☆  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Lima：**  
Thanks, Maho!  
You're a lifesaver...  
Wait, huh?  
It dropped something.  
  
**Maho：**

**Maho：**  
Well I'll be. My prince, what a coincidence.  
My, that's an awful lot of bags you got there.  
  
You on your way home from a li'l bit of grocery shoppin'?  
  
**Maho：**  
It's for supper?  
Lendin' a helpin' hand at home is admirable.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  How about you?  
`Tag 1`  
**Maho：**  
Me?  
Well, I heard that somewhere in this neighborhood  
there's a sweet little white horse, so I came a-lookin'.  
Have you seen a white horse around here, my prince?  
  
**Maho：**  
Ain't seen nothin'?  
Is that right...?  
I knew it, there ain't no horses in these parts.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's look for it together.  
`Tag 2`

**Maho：**  
A white horse...?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  It's not a horse.  
**Choice: (4)**  It's Lima.  
`Tag 3`  
**Maho：**  
It was a young'un what told me 'bout a white horse,  
so I reckon that's the source of this misunderstandin'.  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima, llima llima.  
(Come to think of it, earlier I did walk past a group of kids.)
