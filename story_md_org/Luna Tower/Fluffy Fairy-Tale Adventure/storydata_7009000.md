## Subtitle: Princess Charming and Her Trusty... Steed?
  
**Narration：**  
The Tower of Luna, a mysterious structure  
said to contain hints regarding {player}'s memories.  
A certain group has come to investigate.  
  
**Maho：**  
So this here is the Tower of Luna.  
What a mighty strange place.  
  
**Lima：**  
H-hey...  
I dunno why you brought me here.  
Where are we?  
  
**Maho：**  
This here's the Tower of Luna.  
We're lookin' for clues on how to get the prince's memories back.  
  
**Lima：**  
Are we?  
If that's the case, you should've told me, and I would have come of my own accord!  
  
**Maho：**  
Didn't I tell ya?  
  
**Lima：**  
No, you didn't!  
You suddenly said, \"I want you to be the Maho-Maho Kingdom's  
white horse,\" and just dragged me here.  
  
**Maho：**  
I beg your pardon.  
I guess you're such a darn perfect sweet li'l white horse,  
I plumb forgot to explain what I was up to.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You two don't know each other?  
`Tag 1`  
**Lima：**  
I'd heard about Maho from Rin and Shiori,  
who are on transfer from Caon... but this is our first time meeting, right?  
  
**Maho：**  
That's right.  
I'd heard all about Lima too,  
but actually makin' her acquaintance?  
This is the first time.  
  
**Lima：**  
I never thought I'd be treated like a horse out of the blue on a first  
encounter... though I am used to being treated like a monster.  
  
**Maho：**  
Monster?  
Ain't no way I'd say such a thing 'bout a lovely li'l white horse!  
  
**Lima：**  
L-lovely?  
Thank you...  
Wait, huh?!  
I'm not a horse!  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh... Truly... You're the ideal white horse...  
So lovely...  
  
**Lima：**  
Ahhh! Don't pet me with such a euphoric look on your face!  
  
Even if it does feel good!  
H-hey, {player}! Please make her stop!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Pet pet.  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm envious.  
`Tag 2`  
**Lima：**  
Hey, I didn't say you could join in!  
Ah, but I guess maybe it does feel a biiit nice!  
  
**Maho：**  
Hehe. You're really likin' her fur, aren't you, my prince?  
I'm getting a li'l jealous.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Maho：**  
What's this? You want me to give you a good stroke too?  
If that's the case, scooch on over here.  
Pet pet.  
  
**Lima：**  
Why is she petting you too?!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Lima：**  
A-anyway!  
Inside this tower there are clues about getting  
{player}'s memories back, right?!  
  
**Maho：**  
I reckon that's right.  
  
**Lima：**  
Then the three of us should climb it together!  
That way we'll find the clues more easily!  
I'll give it my all! ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Sounds like we're fixin' to have us some fun!  
My prince, my white horse, and li'l old me,  
on our very own adventure! Let's go! ♪  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus the curtain was raised on a perilous journey for {player} and company.
