## Subtitle: Princess Maho and Princess Lima
  
**Lima：**  
We've made it quite far in no time at all.  
But still, we haven't found anything unusual...  
  
**Maho：**  
You're right.  
There just ain't no clues about my prince's memories...  
  
**Lima：**  
I've thought this for a while now, but the way Maho uses the pet name \"prince\"  
is really nice...  
  
**Lima：**  
Maybe I'll call {player} \"my prince\"  
too, from now on.  
  
**Lima：**  
If I called him that, would he respond to me...?  
  
**Lima：**  
My prince...?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's up?  
`Tag 1`  
**Lima：**  
Eek! You answered!  
And you're so used to being called that, you didn't even hesitate!  
  
**Maho：**  
L-Lima...!  
Are you tryin' to take my prince away from me?  
I won't let you have him.  
  
**Lima：**  
Ah, eh, uh...  
No, that's not it at all. I just wanted to try calling him \"my prince.\"  
But I guess the likes of me calling him \"my prince\" is absurd...  
  
**Maho：**  
Lima.  
There ain't no need to say \"the likes of me.\"  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh?  
Uh, thanks...  
  
**Maho：**  
You're the Maho-Maho Kingdom's  
splendid unicorn!  
Have some self-confidence!  
  
**Lima：**  
I am not a citizen of the Maho-Maho Kingdom!  
And when did I agree to be a unicorn?!  
  
**Maho：**  
I thought you'd make a mighty fine citizen...  
But if you're targeting my prince, that makes you a princess from  
an enemy kingdom who's tryin' to take him from me.  
  
**Lima：**  
I've been upgraded from a citizen to a princess...?!  
Talk about a promotion! I'm so happy!  
  
**Maho：**  
So you aim to seduce him with all that soft fur...  
Ain't no way I'm gonna lose.  
I accept your challenge, Princess Lima. I'll take you head on!  
  
**Lima：**  
Do Princess Lima and Princess Maho really have to fight?!  
No, we mustn't!  
Let's find a peaceful, diplomatic solution!  
  
**Maho：**  
In that case, I can't let myself be outdone.  
The only way to settle this is to be the first to find hints about my prince's memories.  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh?!  
It's become that kind of competition?  
  
**Maho：**  
I gotta do my best for my prince, so just you watch me!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus, a bewildered Lima and {player} followed Maho onward through the tower.
