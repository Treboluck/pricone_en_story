**Misato：**  
So you're teaching language arts, Miss Io?  
You mentioned extracurricular history classes, so I thought...  
Regardless, do you read lots of books in class?  
  
**Io：**  
Yes, I always choose books that my students will enjoy learning from.  
I would be so happy if my classes were the reason a student fell in love  
with books.  
  
**Misato：**  
How wonderful!  
If you don't mind, I'd like to get your advice on my picture book.  
  
**Misato：**  
I often make picture books to read with the children,  
but recently, I've run  
out of new ideas...  
And there isn't anyone in the village with whom I can  
consult, so I'm really stuck.  
  
**Io：**  
Well, I'm your woman!  
For example, there's this novel that's all about...  
  
**Io：**  
...And then the heroine finally confesses her love to her crush on the last  
day of the school festival!  
  
**Io：**  
Of course it goes well,  
and the novel finishes with the two of them kissing!  
  
**Io：**  
Phew, it's so much fun just talking about it, I think I got carried away.  
But I suppose it's a bit too soon for the kids to be reading that kind of  
story...  
  
**Misato：**  
Actually, I don't think so.  
It was very interesting!  
  
**Misato：**  
I only ever read picture books for children,  
so it was refreshing to hear you talk about a more adult story.  
  
**Misato：**  
These days, kids are getting more and more precocious, so trying out  
slightly more mature themes once in a while might not be such a bad  
idea.  
  
**Io：**  
I'm glad to hear that.  
I have loads of recommendations for romance novels and manga,  
so I'm always open to giving advice!  
  
**Misato：**  
I'll start drawing as soon as I return to the village.  
I feel like I can make a picture book that the children will absolutely love...  
  
**Misato：**  
And when I'm done, I really hope that you will read it too, Miss Io!  
  
**Io：**  
Yay! Without a doubt!  
I'm already looking forward to when that day comes, Miss Misato.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I wanna read an adult picture book too.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misato：**  
Uh...  
  
**Io：**  
J-just a sec!  
\"Picture books for adults\"  
absolutely does *not* mean what you think it  
does...!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  What I think it does?  
**Choice: (3)**  Then what does it mean?  
`Tag 2`  
**Io：**  
Well, I mean... It's not something I could teach in class...  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Misato：**  
Oh dear, oh dear... What shall we do with you?  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Misato：**  
You shouldn't put your teachers on the spot like that,  
you naughty, naughty boy.  
  
**Io：**  
This conversation is over!  
Miss Misato, I swear, I never teach anything like that in class!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Anything like that? Like what?  
`Tag 5`  
**Io：**  
Why you! {player}!  
I want to see you in the teachers' lounge later! We need to have a word!  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear...
