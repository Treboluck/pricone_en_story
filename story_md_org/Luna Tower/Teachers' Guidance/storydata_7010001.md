**Misato：**  
Oh my, so this is what it's like on the inside.  
There's no need to rush, so let's take it one step at a time.  
  
**Io：**  
{player}, it's a little dark in here. Can you manage?  
I'll be right here by your side so that you don't get anxious.  
  
**Misato：**  
Heheh, it seems the two of you are quite friendly.  
  
**Misato：**  
{player} even calls you Io.  
I would go as far as to say that you're friends,  
not simply teacher and  
student.  
  
**Io：**  
Well, I'm still new to the whole teaching thing. In order to  
grow with my students, I think it's important to get along like friends  
and learn about the world together.  
  
**Io：**  
And because of that, all my students drop the \"Miss,\"  
and simply call me Io.  
  
**Io：**  
But of course, when it comes down to it,  
I become the absolute definition of a reliable adult.  
  
**Misato：**  
My, my, what a wonderful ethos!  
  
**Misato：**  
That goes for me as well. In order to be a great teacher,  
I first must endeavor to be a decent adult.  
  
**Io：**  
I'm happy that you think the same way as me.  
Perhaps we will become good friends today as well.  
  
**Misato：**  
There's no knowing what lies ahead,  
so let's take care not to get hurt!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let me handle it!  
**Choice: (2)**  Both of you, get back!  
`Tag 1`  
**Misato：**  
Oh my, a little monster.  
Eheheh, no need to worry.  
  
Jump to tag 3

**Io：**  
Ah! A monster?  
Well, aren't you sprightly, mister!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Io：**  
Awww, did we startle you into showing yourself?  
So sorry we surprised you.  
  
**Monster：**  
─Grrr... ♪  
  
**Misato：**  
There, there. That's it, good boy...  
Don't worry, everything's all right.  
  
**Monster：**  
*whine* ♪  
  
**Io：**  
Take care!  
  
**Io：**  
Heheh,  
It's so dark in here that I was feeling a little scared,  
but playing with that cute little monster made me feel better!  
  
**Misato：**  
My, my,  
what a fun day this is turning out to be.  
Of course, I haven't forgotten the real reason we're here.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Please remember this is a dangerous place...  
`Tag 4`  
**Io：**  
Again with the danger?  
Forget all that, and let's climb this tower!  
Stay close, and make sure you don't fall behind.  
  
**Misato：**  
But you have to tell me if you get tired, okay?  
Don't push yourself.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Yes, ma'am...  
`Tag 5`  
**Misato：**  
Oh dear, that response was a little lackluster.  
Are you already feeling weary?  
  
**Io：**  
That just won't do. We literally just started climbing.  
I know you can do better than this!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Yes, ma'am...  
`Tag 6`  
**Misato：**  
Excellent reply! Such a good boy! ♪  
  
**Io：**  
Great! Keep up that attitude!  
All right, stay close to your teachers!
