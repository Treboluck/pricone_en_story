**Monster：**  
Grrr... ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What is it this time...?  
`Tag 1`  
**Misato：**  
My, my. What do you have there for us?  
Let me see...  
  
**Io：**  
{player}, isn't this what you climbed the tower in search of?  
What a windfall!  
  
**Io：**  
It's so sparkly and beautiful.  
But what an unusual sensation...  
  

---  
  
**Io：**  
I've brought in a special speaker for today's career guidance.  
Her name is Miss Misato Aikawa, and she works at a nursery school.  
  
**Misato：**  
Pleased to meet you. I'm Miss Aikawa.  
Today, I'm going to tell you all about my job as a nursery teacher.  
I hope you'll learn a lot.  
  
**Io：**  
Misa—... Ahem. Miss Aikawa and I both graduated from the same junior  
college, so I made use of that connection and invited her here today to  
give you a special lesson.  
  
**Misato：**  
I'm very happy to be here in Miss Hasekura's classroom.  
I hope we can get along well with each other today.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Yes, Miss Misato!  
`Tag 3`  
**Misato：**  
Oh my.  
{player}, you're one of Miss Hasekura's students?  
  
**Io：**  
What a coincidence!  
So you two know each other.  
I wonder how that came about.  
  
**Io：**  
...Huh? She's looking after you along with the nursery children...?  
What do you mean...? Never mind—some things are better left unasked…  
  
**Misato：**  
Today, I was thinking of having everyone get some hands-on experience. Would you like to take on  
the role of the child for my demonstration, {player}?  
  
**Io：**  
Sounds like fun.  
Since you don't come here often, would you mind if I joined in too?  
Maybe I could even learn a few tricks to use as a high school teacher.  
  
**Misato：**  
Of course you can.  
All right. First, let's go outside and get physical!  
  
**Misato：**  
Okay, is everybody here?  
  
**Male Student 1：**  
Yes, ma'am!  
Everyone in Io's class is present and accounted for!  
  
**Misato：**  
Heheh, what a lovely response.  
Well then, let's start off with a nice, friendly game of tag.  
  
**Misato：**  
...But  
does anyone know what we have to do before that?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Warm-up exercises!  
`Tag 5`  
**Misato：**  
Yes, that's absolutely right. Clever boy.  
  
**Misato：**  
Okay, when you're ready.  
...One, two, three, four.  
Yes, just like that!  
  
**Misato：**  
Come on, join in, everyone.  
Follow {player}'s lead.  
  
**Male Student 1：**  
Hngh! Hngh!  
Miss Misato, like this?!  
  
**Misato：**  
My, my. It's wonderful that you're so full of energy.  
But you don't want to push yourself too hard and pull a muscle.  
  
**Male Student 2：**  
Ugh! Aiya!  
Miss Misato! Miss Misato!  
Check out my abs too!  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my, what muscles.  
But we're still only on warm-ups, so don't go all out yet, okay?  
  
**Io：**  
True, we're only stretching.  
But {player}, you're going to  
have to do a little more than that. I mean, all you do is play games on  
your mimi every day. Your body's bound to be stiff.  
  
**Io：**  
See, your shoulders are really tight.  
Here, let me give you a hand.I'll loosen you right up.  
  
**Io：**  
Goodness, look at that belly...  
You've gained a bit of weight.  
See? It's all jiggly.  
Exercise once in a while, would you? I can be your running buddy.  
  
**Io：**  
That goes for everyone—if you're not exercising enough,  
be careful, okay?  
  
**Male Students：**  
Yes, ma'am!  
  
**Misato：**  
All right, seems like we're all warmed up now!  
Well then, let's all have fun playing tag!  
  
**Misato：**  
Okay, I'll be the first to be \"it.\"  
Ready? Run, run away! I'm coming to get you!  
  
**Male Students：**  
Wahhhh!  
  
**Misato：**  
My, my.  
You're all too fast. I can't catch anyone.  
As expected of high school students.  
Slow down.  
  
**Male Student 1：**  
Yes, ma'am, I'll wait!  
Actually, I'll come to you!  
...Wah!  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh dear, look out!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Ouch...  
`Tag 7`  
**Io：**  
Are you both all right?!  
Are you injured?  
  
**Male Student 1：**  
Sorry, {player}!  
Are you okay?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  I'm all good.  
`Tag 9`  
**Misato：**  
Lovely. How mature of you both for not getting into a fight.  
But it looks like you've grazed your leg.  
Can I take a peek at it?  
  
**Io：**  
It might not be bleeding, but it's best to go to the infirmary, just in case.  
You have to get it disinfected properly.  
  
**Misato：**  
Does it hurt?  
If you can't walk, I'll give you a piggyback...  
I see... That's right, you're a big boy, aren't you?  
  
**Male Student 1：**  
Does he really need two escorts...?  
  
**Male Student 2：**  
Nothing to do with us. Anyway, let's keep playing tag!  
  
**Io：**  
Listen, I really think I should take a better look.  
  
**Misato：**  
Miss Hasekura, examining {player} that closely  
is bound to make him feel embarrassed.  
  
**Io：**  
Is that so? Well, let me just finish off with this...  
  
**Io：**  
And you're all bandaged up, so we're good!  
  
**Io：**  
All that worrying has me exhausted.  
No one will mind if I take a short rest... *yawn*

**Misato：**  
My, oh my.  
Miss Hasekura...  
  
**Io：**  
*snore*...  
  
**Misato：**  
Heheh. I imagine that her fatigue has less to do with playing tag  
and more with her concern for you.  
There, there.  
  
**Misato：**  
Miss Hasekura's...  
Or rather,  
Io's hard work and dedication really touched me today.  
  
**Misato：**  
It's amazing how much everyone in her class adores her.  
She's really doing her best as a teacher.  
  
**Misato：**  
Everyone calls her Io because she thinks that she's too  
inexperienced as a teacher, right?  
Heheh. She hasn't changed a bit since college.  
  
**Misato：**  
Even though I was her junior, when we first met, she told me she wasn't senior-like in any way,  
so I could just call her Io.  
  
**Choice: (11)**  That's so like her.  
`Tag 11`  
**Misato：**  
Isn't it just?  
  
I'm sure it's that quality that makes her so popular with children your age.  
  
**Misato：**  
It's funny—I came here today as a guest lecturer,  
but it's been a learning experience for me instead.  
  
![701000502.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/701000502.webp)  
**Io：**  
Mnn, mnnh...  
Goodness, was I sleeping...?  
  
**Misato：**  
Yes, quite soundly.  
Are you feeling refreshed at all?  
  
**Io：**  
What?! On your lap, Misato? ...Oh!  
Eheheh, I just called you Misato even though I promised to call  
you Miss Aikawa in front of everyone today…  
  
**Misato：**  
My, my. It's okay, Io.  
{player} is the only other person here right now,  
  
so you can call me Misato.  
  
**Io：**  
Thank you, Misato.  
Mmmmm.  
Your lap is so comfortable.  
I want to stay like this for a little longer...  
  
**Io：**  
Misato, thanks for coming today.  
Being a nursery teacher is tougher than I thought.  
Running around with kids like that all day—you're pretty amazing.  
  
**Misato：**  
No, not really.  
I also learned a lot from being here today. I'm so glad I came.  
Thank you for inviting me, Io.  
  
**Io：**  
What did you learn? I thought you came here to teach.  
  
**Misato：**  
Hehe. It's a secret.  
...Right?  
  
**Io：**  
Well, we'd best head back to the field...  
But your lap is so comfy, it's sad to say goodbye.  
  
**Male Students：**  
Wahhhh! Wait up!  
  
**Misato：**  
Heheh. I don't think there's anything to worry about, seeing as  
everyone's having so much fun. Maybe the three of us should just take  
a nice little siesta right here.  
{player}, come and lie down.  
  
**Choice: (13)**  Yes, ma'am!  
`Tag 13`

**Io：**  
Huh, you too?  
Hold on a second. You're going to take a nap on Misato's lap?  
  
**Misato：**  
Yes, that's right.  
Like he always does.  
  
**Io：**  
Like he always does?  
O-okay, we can come back to that later.  
But anyway, I'm already lying here.  
  
**Misato：**  
My, my, what's the problem?  
I have two legs...  
You can both take a nice, friendly afternoon nap together.  
  
**Io：**  
No matter how you look at it, lying with a student in an infirmary bed  
is definitely not okay!  
Don't get ahead of yourselves!  
  

---  
  
`image display end`  
**Io：**  
*yawn*... Huh?  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh dear...  
It seems like I also suddenly fell asleep...  
I had a dream that I made you two sleep on my lap.  
  
**Io：**  
And I had a dream that you made me sleep on your lap...  
So, does that mean we had the same dream?  
Huh? Whose lap is this?  
  
**Misato：**  
My, oh my.  
It's {player}'s lap.  
I wonder if he woke up first and has been quietly watching over us.  
  
**Io：**  
It feels a little strange sleeping on a student's lap.  
It's actually quite reassuring.  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh right, we were searching for a gemstone earlier,  
weren't we?  
So does that mean your memory has returned?  
  
**Io：**  
Let's give him a test...  
Hey, how are you feeling right now?  
  
**Choice: (15)**  I'm curious about that adult picture book.  
`Tag 15`  
**Io：**  
So nothing's changed at all...  
We've ascended the tower this far, and it's all for naught.  
What a shame.  
  
**Io：**  
But...  
  
**Io：**  
Since this means I'm able to continue teaching you,  
I actually feel a little relieved…  
  
**Misato：**  
You can stay by my side as a child for a little longer.  
  
**Io & Misato：**  
My, my.  
...Heheheh.  
  
**Choice: (17)**  What are you two laughing about?  
`Tag 17`  
**Io：**  
Oh my, nothing at all!  
As your teachers, We're going to impart to you as much knowledge  
as we can...  
So don't you worry.  
Isn't that right, Miss Misato?  
  
**Misato：**  
Yes, absolutely.  
Now, let's go home and take a well-deserved rest.  
You're always working so hard. What a good boy!  
  
**Narration：**  
With two reliable teachers taking him by the hand,  
{player} left the Tower of Luna, until another day.
