Kaya and Inori are captured by a band of gangsters.

## Subtitle: Welcome to the Dragons' Nest!
  
**Narration：**  
Kaya, a brawler who operates outside the law,  
usually makes a living from one-on-one fistfights,  
but today, she finds herself facing a whole crowd of burly men.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, I see. I thought there were a lot of spectators,  
but you're all after me, huh?  
  
**Man：**  
That's the deal.  
 Even you won't be able to handle  
this many opponents at once.  
  
**Man：**  
We thought about handing you over to Nightmare,  
but it's more profitable to capture and sell you off ourselves!  
  
**Kaya：**  
\"Nightmare,\" huh...?  
Hey. There never used to be a guild like that on this continent, right?  
  
**Man：**  
Huh? What're you talking about?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Also, how come Mount Verio's so far from the city?  
I'm pretty sure it oughtta be within a few minutes' walk.  
  
**Man：**  
...Hey. Anyone know what this weirdo's on about?  
Well, I guess not! Hahahahahah!  
Realizing she's done for must have driven her completely crazy!  
  
**Kaya：**  
*sigh*... I knew that'd be your reaction.  
Sorry for sounding crazy. Forget I said anything.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Now, let's get started. Who's facing me first?  
Or what, you all doing this together?  
Either way... I'll pound you to the ground and grind you into dog food!  
  
**Man：**  
Gutsy words, girl... Let's do this, guys! Take her down!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Where am I?  
Owww...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh... right. Guess I got myself captured...  
I coulda sworn I took down a decent number of 'em...  
  
**???：**  
Oh, you're finally up. You lazybones.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Uh, hi... Wait, are you a dragongirl?!  
  
**???：**  
Well, yes.  
 Are you so stupid you can't tell?  
  
**Kaya：**  
I see! Crazy luck, finding one of my kind in a place like this.  
Hey, what's your name?  
  
**Inori：**  
I'm... Inori.  
 This room was less crowded without you.  
Why don't you get lost? You idiot dragon...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Wow, this midget hates me already...  
No, is she just foul-mouthed in general?  
  
**Inori：**  
At any rate, why'd you get captured?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Me?  I work as a not-exactly-legal brawler,  
but I got betrayed by a client and jumped by gangsters.  
  
**Inori：**  
Pfft! Captured by the client you were fighting for?  
How pathetic can you get?  
  
**Kaya：**  
I know, right? I even had to laugh at myself.  
How 'bout you?  
  
**Inori：**  
Huh? Y-you mean me?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Well, obviously. There's nobody here but me and you.  
How'd you get caught?  
  
**Inori：**  
W-well, um... Pretty similar to you, I guess.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, huh. Similar how?  
  
**Inori：**  
Aughhh! Wh-why do you need to know all that?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Well, I was just a little curious.  
Does it matter why? Can't hurt to tell me, can it?  
  
**Inori：**  
Aurghh... Well, I guess not, but...  
I was... and... they grabbed me.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Sorry. Didn't quite catch that.  
Tell me one more time?  
  
**Inori：**  
L-like I said! I was walking down a back alley and they grabbed me!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...That's it?  
 Are you being serious?  
  
**Inori：**  
Well, I mean, there were tons of them! It was scary!  
S-so I guess I panicked a bit and got caught...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Pfft... Ahahahah! Now who's pathetic?!  
  
**Inori：**  
Aurghh! O-of course I'm not pathetic!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Then tell me, why're you still stuck in a place like this?  
This all part of your plan?  
  
**Inori：**  
Urghhhh...! You're a mean old bully hag!  
I don't like you at all!  
  
**Kaya：**  
I'm not a hag, I'm Kaya.  
Nice to meet you, pathetic little Inori!  
  
**Inori：**  
Aughh... I just told you I'm not—!  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
Heheheheheh. Feeling better now you're with your own kind?  
  
**Inori：**  
Eurghh! D-d-d-d-don't come near me!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey. You the gangster boss?  
You've got some nerve, duping me like that.  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
You won't make us feel guilty.  
 We're all bad guys to the core!  
We're gonna sell you two for a hefty price!  
Ahahahahah!  
  
**Inori：**  
...When we get out of here, I'm gonna kick that guy's ass  
and feed him to monsters.  
  
**Kaya：**  
*If* we get out.  
  
**Kaya & Inori：**  
...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Actually...  
Isn't it an issue for the two of us to be stuck in a cell like this?  
  
**Inori：**  
Huh...? Well, of course it's a big problem!  
At this rate, we'll both be sold to some creepy rich pervert!  
  
**Kaya：**  
No, I don't mean that...  
 You've heard the rumors too, right?  
About a mystery dragongirl searching for her fellow dragonfolk.  
  
**Inori：**  
Well, um...  
 sure, I've heard them.  
  
**Kaya：**  
I thought so.  
 Ever since I heard that, I've been trying my best to find her.  
  
**Inori：**  
Same here.  
I thought it might help me learn the truth...  
  
**Kaya：**  
About... whether this world's a fake, right?  
The map I remember and this world's map are way too different.  
The volcanoes and mountains should be much closer to Landosol.  
  
**Inori：**  
Yes, that's... right... Then you remember it too?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hearing it from you was the last proof I needed.  
Something's definitely not right.  
 With this country... no, this world?  
  
**Kaya：**  
I tried talking to other races,  
but everyone thought I was crazy.  
 You?  
  
**Inori：**  
I was the same...  
I even thought I might actually be the crazy one...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Yeah, right?  
 That's why I wondered.  
What if I could find more dragonfolk like me?  
Maybe they'd make sense of this.  
  
**Inori：**  
K-Kaya-P...!  
  
**Kaya：**  
So I kept searching for others,  
but I didn't think I'd run into one here.  
  
**Inori：**  
That's just what I'm saying.  
We've gotta get out of here and find our real family!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Yeah...  
 Huh?  
Wait, aren't *you* the dragongirl who was searching?  
  
**Inori：**  
It's not me. If you were trying to find her too,  
there must be one more.  
 Another dragongirl like us!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Aw, man...! If we don't find her soon,  
she might get snatched up like us.  
  
**???：**  
Hello~! Your fellow dragongirl is right here~! ☆  
  
**Inori：**  
Hyeughh!  
 Wh-who the heck are you?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Another dragongirl, huh?!  
So, what? Are you the one from all the rumors?  
  
**Homare：**  
Correct~! ♪ You're so smart, Kaya!  
I'm Homare, the leader of a guild just for dragonfolk: Dragons' Nest.  
  
**Homare：**  
I heard gangsters had captured some dragongirls,  
so I came to help. You'll both be safe and welcome in my guild.  
  
**Inori：**  
I-is that right...?  
  
**Homare：**  
Something wrong?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey... Tell me, how'd you get in this cell?  
Hard to imagine those gangsters would let you just stroll on in.  
  
**Inori：**  
G-good point! There should be guards just outside!  
You're way too suspicious, weird lady!  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh, if that's all...  
I just asked this little fellow to grab the key for me!  
  
**Dragon：**  
Growwrrr!  
  
**Inori：**  
Hyeughh! Th-that makes sense...  
He must be pretty smart!  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh, he is~! ☆ He's a good boy who does everything I ask!  
Anyway, shall we make our escape before we're discovered?  
  
**Kaya：**  
I'm in.  
 If I lie around here too long,  
I might wind up out of shape.  
  
**Inori：**  
Aughhh!  
Please nobody find us... Please nobody find us...  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
Ahh! Why, you... How'd you get out here?!  
Attack! We're under attack!  
  
**Inori：**  
Awaaghhh! We've been spotted already!  
  
**Homare：**  
Well, we're in the middle of their turf, so it's to be expected!  
Hmm... What shall we do now?  
  
**Kaya：**  
...I'll keep the gangsters busy. While I do, you two run.  
  
**Inori：**  
Kaya-P?! A-aren't you still injured?  
  
**Homare：**  
Kaya... You're sure you can handle this?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Yeah. This is my chance to pay 'em back.  
I'll cause a scene, like a real brawler should!  
  
**Inori：**  
Aurgh...  
 Kaya-P...  
E-even if they beat you to a squishy pulp,  
make sure you survive! U-understood?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Yeah.  
 You got it!  
  
**Homare：**  
I'll keep a channel open to support you, so don't overdo it.  
Let's go, Inori.  
  
**Kaya：**  
What kind of support's she planning to give...?  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
Hey! Two of them ran for it! Capture 'em!  
...If you give yourself up and return to your cell, I won't hurt you.  
  
**Kaya：**  
No thanks. I'm gonna find the guy who duped me and punch him.  
And just for capturing Inori, I'm bashing you all up too!  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
Oh, really?!  
 We were planning to sell you off,  
but it looks like you need beating into submission!  
Men, take her out!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Heh. That's good, real good! I'm getting fired up!  
All you punks are in for a beating!  
I'll make you wish you never picked a fight with a pro brawler!  
  
**Inori：**  
*pant*... *pant*... K-Kaya-P...!  
  
**Homare：**  
Don't stop running.  
As long as we can hear that noise, Kaya is fighting for us.  
Do you want her efforts to go to waste?  
  
**Inori：**  
U-uerghh...! I... I just...!  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
Found 'em! Thought you could escape, didja?!  
  
**Inori：**  
U-uwaaghhh!  
I'll show you all my bite's just as bad as my bark!  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
Aaaghhhhhhhh!  
  
**Homare：**  
My, my, Inori. You're more of a fighter than I expected~! ♪  
Things seem all right here, so I'll help Kaya out next...  
  
**Homare：**  
Kaya? Two approaching from behind you.  
And watch out on the sides, too.  
  
**Kaya：**  
R-right!  
 Yahhhh!  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
Guahh! I can't hit this girl!  
Does she have eyes on the back of her head?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, awesome!  
 At this rate, I can handle any number of 'em!  
Yah-yah-yah! Come and get me already!  
  
**Homare：**  
Next, three from in front. One atop the building.  
The two behind you are getting to their feet too, so be careful.  
  
**Homare：**  
Inori,  
 I think we're out of the woods here.  
Let's hurry to the guildhouse.  
  
**Inori：**  
I-incredible...!  
Can you actually see Kaya-P with those eyes of yours?  
  
**Homare：**  
Yes, I can!  
 It's a skill called Wyrmsight.  
It doesn't last long, but it lets me see distant things perfectly~! ☆  
  
**Inori：**  
That's so cool!  
 O-okay... Time for us to turn the tables!  
I'll turn you all into spicy barbecue, so wait right there!  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
Waaaaghhhh! This girl... She even breathes fire!  
  
**Inori：**  
N-now's our chance!  
  
**Homare：**  
Not far now to the guildhouse! Let's press on!  
  
**Inori：**  
Th-this is the guildhouse...  
We made it...  
  
**Gangster 3：**  
Heh heh heh heh!  
  
**Inori：**  
Hyeugh! Wh-why're there people from other races here?!  
And they're all the most blatant villains I've ever seen!  
  
**Gangster 3：**  
Oh, boss! Good work out there!  
You made it back already?  
  
**Homare：**  
Yes. Well done setting things up!  
  
**Inori：**  
\"Boss\"?! Th-then, could it be...  
You were the gangsters' real boss all along?!  
  
**Inori：**  
This is too crazy! We were hoodwinked like dummies!  
What now...? I can't leave Kaya-P to her fate back there,  
so I have to do this alone somehow...!  
  
**Homare：**  
And with that, your test is over!  
 Both of you pass~! ☆  
  
**Homare：**  
Everyone, gather in the guildhouse!  
Stay on the down-low so Nightmare and Caon don't find you~! ☆  
  
**Inori：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
Understood, boss!  
 Well, that's that, girlie.  
We're all surrendering now. Sorry for the trouble!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Huhhh?!  
 What's the big idea, guys?!  
I was still enjoying that fight!  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
The boss will tell you the details.  
Come with us to meet her in the guildhouse.  
 Men, let's move!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Inori! Phew... you're really OK!  
  
**Inori：**  
Aurghh... Well, of course I'm fine...  
I'm just glad to see you're not hurt!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hah, that was nothing for me!  
More importantly... I hope you're gonna explain yourself.  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh, of course~! ♪  
 First, the gang that locked you both up?  
It's actually long gone!  
 I took it over! ☆  
  
**Inori & Kaya：**  
Whaaaaa?!  
  
**Homare：**  
What happened is,  
both of you were actually captured by separate gangs,  
but I convinced them to hand you over to us.  
  
**Homare：**  
Inori already had a price tag attached,  
but for Kaya, I got in earlier and snagged her for free~! ♪  
  
**Inori：**  
Then... what was that whole escape just now?  
  
**Homare：**  
My little test! ♪  
I thought it would be nice to check what you two can do.  
Wasn't it thrilling?  
  
**Homare：**  
By the way, you can both just call me \"boss.\" It's nice to meet you!  
Now then, let's throw a welcome party, shall we?  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
Sure! We'll get everything ready!  
  
**Kaya：**  
H-hold on a minute! Was the guild stuff a lie too?  
Was this guildhouse stolen from a respectable guild as well?  
  
**Inori：**  
Yes, good question! Did you steal it with sneaky methods  
just like you tricked both of us?  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh, the guild is real. I'm welcoming you both as members.  
But I will assign you gangster work too, so good luck on both fronts! ☆  
  
**Inori：**  
Aurghhh! No waaaay!  
Just when we thought we were free, we're roped into a gang...  
K-Kaya-P, what will you do...?  
  
**Kaya：**  
I'll join up, sure.  
It beats a life where I don't even know if tomorrow will come.  
Might even be able to legalize my brawler activities!  
  
**Kaya：**  
But Inori, you're basically in debt now, right?  
I bet that boss'll chase you to the ends of the earth to get her dues.  
  
**Inori：**  
Aurghh! Y-you're right! Waaahhh!  
At this point, what've I got to lose?! I'm joining up too!  
  
**Homare：**  
Wonderful~!  
 With that settled, let's welcome Kaya and Inori  
as our two newest members!  
 Hip hip, hooray!  
  
**Gangsters：**  
Hooray!  
  
**Narration：**  
Though they had found the new guild they were looking for,  
Kaya and Inori were filled with very mixed feelings  
as they looked around at a room full of gangsters cheering for them.
