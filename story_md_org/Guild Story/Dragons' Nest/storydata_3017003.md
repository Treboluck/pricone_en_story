# Dragons' Nest Episode 3
Inori grows more and more frustrated with following the boss's orders. Hearing about this, Homare offers her the opportunity to try doing the boss's job herself. Inori tries her best to act the part, but realizing how difficult Homare's work really is, she ends up surrendering the position.
  
## Subtitle: To Be a Boss
  
**Narration：**  
With their Elpis Island expedition complete,  
{player} and co. are back to their regular life in Landosol.  
One day, Inori gathers them in the guildhouse.  
  
**Inori：**  
I've had enough of this nonsense!  
Kaya-P, {player}, are you both listening to me?  
  
**Kaya：**  
I'm listening.  
 Well, a lot did happen on Elpis Island.  
I get why you might be frustrated.  
  
**Inori：**  
Aurghh! I feel sick just remembering it all!  
I thought we were done for at least a thousand times!  
  
**Inori：**  
But that woman just stands back and barks orders...  
She needs to be stopped!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Well, isn't that what it means to be a leader?  
...I know!  
 Why don't you become the boss, Inori?  
  
**Inori：**  
Ahhh! Amazing, Kaya-P!  
Even though you barely use your brain,  
 you hit on the perfect plan!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Well, thanks.  
But can you make up your mind  
whether you're complimenting or dissing me?  
  
**Inori：**  
It's time to stage a revolution! We'll drag that woman down  
from her throne in this guild and gang, and make her our gofer!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are you including us in this?  
**Choice: (2)**  But how?  
`Tag 1`  
**Inori：**  
Well, obviously!  
 We're all in this together, aren't we?!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Inori：**  
Aurgh...  
 I-I still need to work out the details!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kaya：**  
Hold up—when did I agree to this?  
I mean, not to say it doesn't sound like fun...  
  
**Homare：**  
It *does* sound like fun~! ☆  
I'd love to join in too! ♪  
  
**Inori：**  
Pyeughh?! Th-th-th-th-the boss?!  
How long have you...?  
  
**Homare：**  
I thought I heard something about a gofer,  
but what was that about, exactly~?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Inori wants your job, that's what.  
  
**Inori：**  
Kaya-P?!  
 Y-you dirty traitor!  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh, I see~! ♪  
 Inori did seem even more nervous than usual.  
Is that why? I mean, she has been plotting this for a while...  
  
**Inori：**  
Aurghh?! How did she know?!  
  
**Homare：**  
Sure, you can be the boss.  
  
**Inori：**  
Huh...? D-did you just say I can be the boss...?  
  
**Homare：**  
That's exactly what I said! ♪  
  
**Inori：**  
Aughh... I don't know if you've gone crazy or what,  
but if you're offering, I'll take it!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Is this gonna be OK?  
  
**Homare：**  
Well, in that case, let's get you settled in.  
For the guild, you'll need to manage our jobs and rewards,  
and oversee Kaya's brawler work on the side...  
  
**Homare：**  
For the gang, there are negotiations to handle  
with neighboring institutions,  
and then there's our finances and recruitment...  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh, and you can't miss the regular admin meeting!  
I'm omitting the smaller details, of course,  
but you can handle it all yourself, can't you?  
  
**Inori：**  
Aughhh...  
 Y-you do all that stuff every day?  
  
**Homare：**  
Well, of course~!  
 A gangster family is full of rowdy thugs,  
so they need a tight leash to keep them under control!  
  
**Inori：**  
It's sounding tougher than I thought, being a boss...  
  
**Homare：**  
Ahh...! I hope you didn't think all I ever do  
is stand back and bark orders at people~?  
  
**Inori：**  
O-o-o-o-o-of course I don't think that!  
Not a chance!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  She heard that part too, huh...  
`Tag 4`  
**Kaya：**  
Yeah... Must've heard the whole thing...  
  
**Homare：**  
Well then, little Inori, the job's all yours starting tomorrow~! ♪  
  
**Inori：**  
T-tomorrow I've got, um...  
 other work, so...  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh~? How strange...  
I didn't assign you anything for tomorrow, did I?  
  
**Inori：**  
Eurghhh! I-it's not a job you'd know about yet!  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh, I see! You're keeping busy!  
Thenmaybe I'll ask Kaya to handle things instead~! ♪  
  
**Kaya：**  
Me?  
 Come off it, boss.  
You know leading an organization's not my style.  
  
**Homare：**  
That's actually why you'd be a good fit...  
I'm sure everyone would happily follow you.  
  
**Inori：**  
Urghhhh...! All right, fine!  
I'm gonna go and ask everyone who they think is best!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey, Inori?!  
 Ah, geez... Off she goes.  
Boss, try not to tease the girl too much, will ya?  
  
**Homare：**  
Okay~! ☆  
  
**Inori：**  
Hey, excuse me!  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
Oh... Inori. What's up?  
  
**Inori：**  
Answer me this!  
Who would be a better boss? Me or the boss?!  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
...The boss.  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
Well, yeah. The boss.  
  
**Gangster 3：**  
Who else but the boss?  
Don't go asking dumb questions, Inori.  
Here, take this candy and go back to the boss now.  
  
**Inori：**  
Aurghhhh! Everyone's too awful!  
Waaaahhh! Kaya-P~!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Aw, you poor thing. Even got shooed off with candy, huh?  
  
**Inori：**  
*sniffle*... F-fine then. I'll give up on being a gangster boss...  
But the seat of guildmaster is still gonna be mine!  
  
**Homare：**  
Hmm, what now~?  
Oh, how about we use this new job I just accepted as a test for you?  
  
**Homare：**  
It's just to explore some newly discovered ruins,  
but these ruins are covered in dragon emblems.  
Could lead to clues about our dragonfolk roots, don't you think?  
  
**Homare：**  
It's a chance to learn about ourselves or other dragonfolk out there,  
so I told the Guild Association we'd handle it!  
  
**Inori：**  
Sounds pretty important... OK, just watch!  
I'll prove I can do better work than you, boss!  
  
**Kaya：**  
That's settled, then. Let's all get ready to head out.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'm going too.  
`Tag 5`  
**Homare：**  
Thank you~! ☆  
 I'm sure we'd have been fine on our own,  
but having you around makes it certain. I can't wait~! ♪  
  
**Homare：**  
Well, here we are! ♪  
There might be monster traps around, so be careful where you tread!  
  
**Inori：**  
Uerghh...!  
 I-I could crush a few measly monsters in my sleep!  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh, yes—I suppose I shouldn't take the lead this time.  
Inori, the job's all yours!  
  
**Inori：**  
O-of course!  
 Leave it to me!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Good luck.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  You can do it!  
`Tag 6`  
**Inori：**  
I don't need you to tell me that! ...You just watch and learn!  
  
**Inori：**  
Aurghh! I think I just heard a weird noise!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Really? Probably just the wind or something.  
  
**Homare：**  
Inori? Are you sure you shouldn't pick up the pace?  
At this rate, we'll be here until tomorrow...  
  
**Inori：**  
I-it'll be fine! ...  
Kaya-P, take the lead for me!  
I heard a monster voice up ahead!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Sure. Let's move, then. Try not to fall behind, you guys!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Inori：**  
Pyeughhh! I knew there were monsters!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Yahhhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRUOOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Geez, down in one hit? What a bore.  
  
**Homare：**  
Nice work there, Kaya!  
Inori, you should follow Kaya's example.  
  
**Inori：**  
Wh-what about you, then, boss?!  
Now that I think about it, I've never really seen you fight!  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh? Are you sure~?  
 Then this time, how about I take the lead?  
  
**Inori：**  
Eheheh... She'll be too scared to even move.  
  
**Homare：**  
...Hold on a moment!  
  
**Kaya：**  
What's up?  
  
**Homare：**  
I spotted a monster just up ahead.  
Largo, that's your cue.  
  
**Largo：**  
Growwrrr!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRUOOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Homare：**  
Thank you! ☆  
The coast's clear now. Let's all keep moving!  
  
**Inori：**  
Th-that's not fair! Who said you could do that?!  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh? You think so~?  
If you're jealous, why don't you find your own dragon pet?  
  
**Inori：**  
Ughh...!  
 I suppose... you have a point...  
  
**Homare：**  
Actually, since we've made good progress...  
Inori, why don't we switch back now~?  
  
**Inori：**  
W-well, obviously!  
I'm going to show you all I can handle this alone!  
  
**Inori：**  
Please no more monsters... Please no more monsters...  
  
**Homare：**  
Inori~? What's the holdup?  
Do you need Kaya to take over for you?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Don't tease her, boss.  
 Inori's got her own way of doing things.  
Let's just watch and let her do her thing.  
  
**Homare：**  
Aww... But at this rate, we'll never finish the job~!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Inori：**  
Pyeughh?! A-a-a-a-a-a monster!  
Y-you just watch... I can take you!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Inori：**  
I'll take you down all by myseeeeelf!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRUOOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Inori：**  
Go down! Yah! Yah-yah!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Inori：**  
Wh-why are you getting up?!  
At this rate, I'm gonna be...!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Inori! Follow my timing!  
  
**Inori：**  
Kaya-P?! O-okay!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hiyaaaahh!  
  
**Inori：**  
Yaahhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRUOOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Inori：**  
...We did it...  
But Kaya-P, why did you...?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Can't let you do everything on your own, can I?  
I'm not the type to let my guildmaster shoulder all the load.  
  
**Inori：**  
K-Kaya-P...!  
  
**Homare：**  
Yes, yes, it's all so touching~!  
But Inori... I'm afraid you just earned a failing grade!  
  
**Inori：**  
Aughh! No way~!  
  
**Homare：**  
Actually, from the moment you put Kaya in the lead,  
you had no chance of passing.  
  
**Inori：**  
Wh-what do you mean?!  
  
**Homare：**  
Since you're so quick to use your allies as a shield,  
you may not be quite ready to be a guildmaster.  
  
**Inori：**  
Aughh...  
 I-I'm sorry...  
  
**Homare：**  
No, no. It's me who should apologize.  
I'm the one who made you feel uncomfortable.  
  
**Homare：**  
With our gangster work, I do end up barking orders a lot,  
but that's because taking charge is important in that world.  
  
**Homare：**  
To earn the full respect of our men,  
I have to play the imposing leader sometimes.  
Can you understand that?  
  
**Inori：**  
...I do get that. I'm not stupid...  
  
**Homare：**  
But in our guild, I try to treat you both  
as the rare and precious dragonfolk companions you are.  
  
**Homare：**  
It seems like I wasn't doing the best job there.  
...Still, for us dragonfolk to make a life for ourselves,  
being an ordinary guild isn't quite enough.  
  
**Inori：**  
Boss...  
  
**Homare：**  
We need to become as strong as we can.  
And to find out what really happened to this world.  
  
**Homare：**  
That's why I hope you'll keep lending me your help.  
...Please.  
  
**Inori：**  
...W-well, if you're that desperate, I can't say no!  
I'll help you out!  
  
**Inori：**  
You just watch! Even if monsters attack us again,  
I'll crush them all by myself next time!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Boss...  
 Inori's very impressionable, so be careful with her.  
  
**Homare：**  
Of course~! ♪  
You're so kind to her, Kaya! ☆  
  
**Kaya：**  
Well, we're in this together. ...All three of us, right?  
  
**Homare：**  
Hmm, what makes you so sure~?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Losing the repentant attitude already...?  
Well, treat me how you like, but be nice to Inori.  
  
**Homare：**  
All right!  
Oh yes—Inori? There's a trap zone just ahead, so be careful~!  
  
**Inori：**  
Huh?  
  
**Inori：**  
Yeeearghh!  
Somebody help meeeee!  
  
**Kaya：**  
You OK there, Inori?!  
  
**Homare：**  
...Well, as you see, those two still seem to have their hands full  
looking after themselves,  
 so I think I'll have to stay guildmaster for now!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  We should go and help them.  
`Tag 7`  
**Homare：**  
Okay~! ♪  
 Don't worry, though. With how fast they're running,  
none of the traps seem likely to catch them!  
  
**Inori：**  
*sigh*... In the end, there weren't any clues about dragonfolk  
or about this world... Those ruins were just useless...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Cheer up, Inori. Learning they're empty is still progress.  
  
**Homare：**  
True enough! I'm sure we'll find other ruins.  
So be ready to work hard when we do!  
  
**Inori：**  
Yes, I will...  
I'll work hard until I can take over this guild and this gang!  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh, you still haven't given up?  
Then I suppose I'll look forward to the day you're successful! ☆  
  
**Kaya：**  
Still, the ruins were a dud, huh?  
Aren't there *any* other dragonfolk out there...?  
  
  
**Inori：**  
Don't be so silly, Kaya-P.  
As if we'd stumble across them that easily!  
  
**Homare：**  
...It might be easier than you think.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Boss...!  
 Was that girl just now...?!  
  
**Homare：**  
Yes, that was a dragongirl...  
Perhaps we should chase her~! ♪  
  
**Inori：**  
Aughh! W-wait for me~!  
I said wait up, you big dummies!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so the three dragongirls hurried off in pursuit  
of the passing mystery girl,  
in hopes of recruiting a new guild member.
