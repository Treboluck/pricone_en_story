**Narration：**  
A little while after signing up for Homare's combination guild and gang,  
Kaya and Inori take care of the work their boss has assigned them.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Thank you, come again...  
  
**Inori：**  
Th-thank you, come again...  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Man, I'm bored.  
  
**Inori：**  
Bored is the word...  
  

---  
  
**Homare：**  
Starting tomorrow, I'm assigning you both jobs! ♪  
First up, you'll be patrolling the gang's turf for me!  
  

---  
  
**Homare：**  
Good work today! Tomorrow, you're on guild work!  
Our street stalls are a little short-staffed,  
 so I need you two to help out!  
  

---  
  
**Kaya：**  
She's assigned us all sorts of odd jobs, but...  
  
**Inori：**  
It's so quiet.  
 Every day's so quiet, it makes me paranoid  
that we're still being tricked.  
All the jobs are easy and safe...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Some of the gang work does get a *little* bit spicy.  
Still, I didn't think she'd keep us so far away from danger.  
  
**Inori：**  
Maybe we'll really be able to have a peaceful life after all!  
Well, you might not want that, Kaya-P...  
  
**Kaya：**  
I got permission to keep up my brawler work, so I'm good.  
Still, I guess it's not so bad to kick back and relax for a while.  
  
**Homare：**  
Good work again today~! ♪  
 This may be a little sudden,  
but starting tomorrow, we're heading out of town for work!  
  
**Inori：**  
On a trip? Where to?  
  
**Homare：**  
This information is still secret,  
 but a new continent's been discovered!  
We're going to be joining a crew sent to explore it~! ☆  
  
**Kaya：**  
A new frontier, huh? If I don't know about it, I guess none of us do.  
Which means it's well worth investigating! OK, boss, I'm in.  
  
**Inori：**  
I just hope there aren't scary monsters...  
W-well, even if there are,  
 I'll turn them to ash with my fire breath!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey, boss! We're done loading the cargo!  
  
**Inori：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
 T-talk about hard labor...  
I'm not being paid enough for this...  
  
**Homare：**  
Good work~!  
Now, we're waiting for one more person...  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh—here he is. Hey~! Over here~!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's good to meet you all.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm ready to work hard.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaya：**  
Huh? Bud, you know the boss as well?  
Either way, it's good to have you along!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Inori：**  
Huh? What the heck are *you* doing here?  
...The boss invited you?  
 *sigh*... You've definitely been duped.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kaya：**  
If you're here, I *know* this job'll be interesting.  
  
**Inori：**  
Well, do your best to avoid dropping dead.  
If anything happens, I'll be around to save your hide!  
  
**Homare：**  
What's this? You two already know him too~? ☆  
What a funny coincidence! ♪  
  
**Homare：**  
We needed to fill a sudden gap in the crew,  
and he seemed the best option at short notice! ♪  
  
**Kaya：**  
Huh...  
 I gotta ask though, boss. Is he cut out for this voyage?  
  
**Inori：**  
Good point. He's not exactly what I'd call strong.  
  
**Homare：**  
That's true...  
But it would be hard to find anyone else at this stage...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  If you're in trouble, I want to help.  
`Tag 4`  
**Homare：**  
Thank you~! As you see, he says so himself.  
And this seems entertaining... so he's hired!  
  
**Inori：**  
Well, if he really insists,  
 I won't stop him.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Let's work together, bud. I'll be counting on you.  
  
**Homare：**  
Great! Looks like we're all prepared, so let's set sail~! ☆  
To the island of Elpis!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Tch... Are we still not there yet?!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Ehhh? 'Course we aren't, ya big moron!  
  
**Man 1：**  
What was that?! You looking for a fight?!  
  
**Inori：**  
...Um, Kaya-P? I can't help but notice something.  
  
**Kaya：**  
That's funny.  
 Something's bugging me too.  
  
**Inori：**  
The ship itself is rough, but the people on board are even rougher.  
  
**Kaya：**  
You think so too, huh? There's something weird about this job.  
Let's go ask the boss about it.  
  
**Kaya：**  
...So spill it, boss. Is there something you're not telling us?  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh~? Did I not mention?  
This fleet's crew is mostly made up of gangsters and outlaws.  
  
**Inori：**  
Gangsters?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Outlaws?  
  
**Homare：**  
Well, of course~!  
 I mean, why would any ordinary citizen  
sign up to come on a voyage like this to an unexplored frontier  
full of dangers beyond imagining?  
  
**Homare：**  
Who knows if we'll even make it back alive?  
  
**Inori：**  
Aughhh?! Nobody told us about that!  
  
**Kaya：**  
You have gotta be kidding me...!  
  
**Homare：**  
It's no joke.  
And I didn't mention it before because nobody asked, that's all!  
Don't worry, I'm sure we'll be fine~!  
  
**Inori：**  
Aurghhh... Our boss really is a demon...!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Nah, Inori, it's us who let our guard down.  
We should've asked more questions to begin with.  
  
**Inori：**  
Kaya-P?! You can't just accept this stuff as your fault!  
We have to stand up to this madwoman!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...I mean, is it so bad?  
When there's no turning back, that gets me fired up!  
  
**Inori：**  
Aughh... I should have remembered Kaya-P  
is a musclehead with brawn instead of brains...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Either way, now that we've come this far, we're in it for the long haul.  
Let's just focus on staying alive, shall we?  
  
**Inori：**  
*sigh* You're right.  
We need to make sure he gets home safely, too.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Well, you heard, boss.  
 Me and Inori are prepared.  
We'll get back to work.  
  
**Homare：**  
Okay~! ♪ Try not to fall overboard, both of you! ☆  
  
**Sailor 1：**  
Captain! The new guy's collapsed from seasickness!  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh, bring him over here~!  
I'll look after him!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Yeesh, there he goes already.  
 You OK, bud?  
  
**Inori：**  
What a hopeless guy...  
Boss, you'd better take good care of him.  
  
**Homare：**  
Of course! Leave it to me~! ☆  
Come on, {player}.  
Rest your head here on my lap and get comfortable.  
  
**Homare：**  
I know. While you lie there, you can hear me out.  
That Kaya and Inori, they keep acting as if  
I tricked them into all this!  
  
**Homare：**  
Is it my fault if I didn't answer questions I wasn't asked?  
Oh, but isn't this a sign that they've grown to trust me? ♪  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'm glad I decided to come.  
`Tag 5`  
**Homare：**  
...Interesting. So you saw through me.  
If you knew it was dangerous, why did you agree to tag along?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I was worried about you guys.  
`Tag 6`  
**Homare：**  
Are you including me?  
Hee hee. You really are such an interesting young man~! ☆  
  
**Homare：**  
But for now, just worry about yourself.  
If we're going to need you, it'll be a bit further down the line.  
  
**Narration：**  
From there, the voyage proceeds relatively smoothly,  
until, just ahead of their forecasted arrival at Elpis Island,  
the deck falls into a sudden confusion.  
  
**Sailor 1：**  
All hands on deck! Everyone get a move on!  
  
**Inori：**  
Could it be we're almost at the island?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Preparing to land? No, that's not it.  
I see people readying weapons.  
Hey, boss, is something going on?  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh, yes~! ♪  
You'll see for yourselves soon enough!  
  
**Inori：**  
Pyeughhhh! Wh-what's this all of a sudden?!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, wow...! That thing's huge!  
  
**Sailor 1：**  
I-it's really coming for us!  
Fire! Open fire!  
  
**Sailor 2：**  
Hruaaarrghhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Inori：**  
Hyeughh! That didn't even scratch it!  
Boss! What even is this great big monster?!  
  
**Homare：**  
Actually, this is the reason I brought you two along~!  
It's as if it's guarding Elpis Island, don't you think?  
  
**Homare：**  
All previous fleets have failed to reach the island  
because of this guy blocking the way.  
That's why I decided to accept this as an official guild job~! ☆  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hah! So that's what's up!  
Well, now I'm really getting all fired up!  
  
**Inori：**  
Don't get fired up, dummy! You need to fall overboard  
and cool your head off, you battle addict!  
  
**Homare：**  
Well, I'm counting on you two. Good luck~! ♪  
  
**Inori：**  
Us two?! Did you just say \"two\"?!  
Hold it, you demon hag of a boss! You better not abandon us here!  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh, of course I won't, silly!  
I just need to focus on protecting the fleet and its crew!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Even if we beat it, we don't want to end up shipwrecked, I guess.  
C'mon, Inori!  
 Let's take down this brute together!  
  
**Inori：**  
Oh no... It's no use!  
There's no talking to Kaya-P when she gets like this!  
  
**Inori：**  
Looks like it's do or die!  
Waaaaaghhhhh!  
  
![301700201.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/301700201.webp)  
**Inori：**  
Hiyaaahhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Kaya：**  
My turn next!  
 Yaaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Kaya：**  
I'm not done yet!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRRAAAAAOOOGGHH!  
  
**Inori：**  
You did it! That's our Kaya-P!  
  
**Kaya：**  
No, my attack barely scratched it!  
It's gonna strike back! Dodge, Inori!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Kaya：**  
*pant*... *pant*... What a massive strike.  
  
**Inori：**  
Pyeuuughh! I can't take it!  
Boss, Kaya-P, anyone, just help meeee! I'm gonna diiiie!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I won't let that happen!  
`Tag 7`  
**Kaya：**  
I'm filled with more power than normal...!  
 Nice one, bud!  
With this, I can smack that thing in its big face!  
  
**Inori：**  
I-I almost feel like we can do it, too!  
Kaya-P, go get the big brute!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Don't mind if I do!  
 Hrrruaaaghhhh!  
  
**Inori：**  
H-hurry up and drop dead! Yahhhhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRRAAAAAOOOGGHH!  
  
**Inori：**  
Kaya-P! You can finish it off!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Sure! Leave it to me!  
You're going down in pieces, you big dumb monster!  
  
`image display end`  
**Monster：**  
GGRRAAAAAOOOGGHH!  
  
**Sailor 1：**  
Whoaaa! Those two actually did it!  
  
**Sailor 2：**  
All right! Now we can finally land on the island!  
  
**Sailors：**  
Yeahhhhhh!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Ahhh, that was hot stuff!  
Heheh...  
 How's that? My fist packs a punch, right?  
  
**Inori：**  
Aurghhh... I-I'm so worn out...  
I can't moooove... I never wanna do that again...  
  
**Homare：**  
Hmmm... I thought it would be a bit more of a challenge.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Are you disappointed?  
`Tag 8`  
**Homare：**  
Actually, I am. I was secretly hoping  
this fight would awaken those two to their full dragonfolk powers.  
  
**Homare：**  
Dragonfolk, you see, have a hidden strength deep within,  
and the only known way of tapping into it  
is to face an unbelievably arduous challenge.  
  
**Homare：**  
But... thanks to the strength you lent them,  
neither of them awakened at all! ☆  
  
**Homare：**  
Well, not that it wasn't fun in its own way... ♪  
  
**Homare：**  
Okay, rise and shine, you two!  
We're almost at the island, so I need your help unloading cargo!  
  
**Inori：**  
Y-you big ogre! Demon! Evil dragon!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Lemme just rest a few more minutes...  
  
**Homare：**  
Mm... nope! ♪  
 You three are going to work hard together~! ☆  
  
**Narration：**  
So after a mighty struggle, {player} and his companions  
arrived on the shore of Elpis Island.
