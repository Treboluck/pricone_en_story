Aoi is chosen to join Forestier, the elvenfolk guild that protects the forest and its inhabitants. She initially refuses due to a lack of confidence, but joins as an apprentice after helping deal with some poachers.

**Narration：**  
In the Elven Forest, Aoi converses with the plants.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ha ha ha. I feel most relaxed when I'm with you all.

**Aoi：**  
Huh? I should talk with other people, too?  
B-but that's really...  
  
**???：**  
Oi! Aoi!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Eep! S-someone's coming!  
I've gotta hide!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I can survive this if I fool them with some bird calls, right?  
Tweet, tweet, tweet!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Found you, Aoi!  
Surprise! It's me, Hatsune!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Eeep! O-oh,  
Hatsune.  
Umm... Do you need something from me?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Yup! Something major, actually!  
Aoi, you've heard of Forestier, right?  
'Course you have.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Y-yes.  
Umm...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
It's a guild of us elves that's protected the forest,  
and all the birds and animals and stuff that live here,  
for ages!  
  
**Aoi：**  
And you're a member, right, Hatsune?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Sure am!  
And guess what? Drumroll, please!  
Badadadadada...  
dum! You've been chosen as a  
candidate for membership, too! Way to go!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? U-umm, who got picked for  
what now?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Listen. You, Aoi, were selected to become a member  
of Forestier.  
Well, technically not a full member.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Wh-wh-whaaaat?!  
Wh-wh-why me?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Who knows? They just told me to tell you.  
Oh, and they said there'll be an apprentice membership  
qualification test, too.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Good luck, Aoi!  
I've got guild stuff to take care of. See ya!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Th-this can't be happening! Me, a member of Forestier?  
What am I gonna do?  
  
**Aoi：**  
I'm terrible at working with others, I have no idea how  
to make friends, and they want me to join a guild?  
I'm going to annoy everyone, I just know it.  
  
**Forest Critters：**  
♪♪♪  
  
**Aoi：**  
But I can't.  
I-I can't! Oh, I know!  
I have to turn down the offer.  
  
**Aoi：**  
E-excuse me, Miss Misato?  
Hello.  
  
**Misato：**  
My, my, my! It's been quite some time, Aoi.  
Have you been well?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Yes... Thank you.  
  
Miss Misato, you're the Forestier guildmaster, right?  
  
**Misato：**  
I am indeed.  
Is this about your being chosen to become a member?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Well, err, not exactly...  
  
**Aoi：**  
I'm losing momentum.  
I have to say it now!  
Come on, Aoi! Do it!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Y-yes! About my selection as a candidate...  
I'm sure I'd just be an annoyance and a bother to  
everyone if I joined,  
so I'd like to withdraw my name. Please!  
  
**Misato：**  
My, my. Look at you, expressing your feelings so openly.  
That must have been hard.  
I'm very proud of you.  
  
**Misato：**  
Still, I'd be even prouder if you would focus that  
determination  
on protecting our forests.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Miss Misato...  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my, I'm sorry. Did I upset you?  
Please, though, think about it a bit longer, won't you?  
  
**Aoi：**  
*sigh* I didn't quite manage to refuse all the way.  
Guys, what am I supposed to do?  
You don't know either, do you...  
  
**Forest Critters：**  
♪♪♪  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh?  
Somebody's coming this way?  
  
**Girl：**  
*pant, *pant* *cough, cough*  
Can't... go on...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh no!  
A-are you all right?  
  
**Girl：**  
*cough, cough*  
I-I'm fine...  
  
**Aoi：**  
But you look like you're in a lot of pain!  
Hold on, I'll use my healing magic.  
  
**Girl：**  
It won't work.  
I've got a severe illness that magic can't cure.  
  
**Aoi：**  
O-oh no...  
  
**Girl：**  
But I heard there were plants in this forest that the  
doctors could use to make medicine.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Did you come all the way here from the town by yourself?  
I'm so sorry, but you can't just take plants from the forest.  
  
**Girl：**  
Oh... I can't?  
I'm sorry, I didn't know.  
  
**Aoi：**  
If it's medicinal herbs, I can ask for you.  
For now, you'll need to go back to the t—  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? A m-monster, now of all times?  
This is dangerous—we need to run!  
  
**Boy：**  
Bye-bye,  
Miss Misato!  
  
**Misato：**  
Bye-bye! Be careful walking home!  
  
**Young Man：**  
Miss Misato, is my sister here?  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my, your little sister?  
Come to think of it, I haven't seen her today.  
  
**Young Man：**  
I see. When I got home from work, she wasn't home.  
  
**Young Man：**  
I'm finally able to afford her medicine, and she was just  
starting to recover. If she went out alone and ends up having  
a total relapse, I don't know what I'll do.  
  
**Misato：**  
Your poor sister has been worried about you.  
She thinks you're overworking yourself just to be  
able to afford her medicine.  
  
**Misato：**  
Of course, you have to care for your sister,  
but you mustn't do so at the cost of ignoring  
your own health.  
  
**Young Man：**  
Miss Misato, I'd brave the forests alone to save her if I...  
  
**Young Man：**  
Wait, she's heard there are medicinal plants  
in the Elven Forest. She might've gone there!  
  
**Misato：**  
To our forest? That could be dangerous.  
We have monsters  
appear there quite regularly.  
We must go look for her.  
  
**Monster：**  
SKREEEEEEEE!  
  
**Aoi：**  
*pant, pant*  
At this rate, it'll catch us!  
  
**Girl：**  
I'm sorry... *cough, cough*  
I can't... run anymore...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Wh-what do I do now?  
I don't think I have any choice but to fight.  
  
**Aoi：**  
But fight that monster?  
Me? I don't stand a chance!  
  
**Girl：**  
It's okay... You can leave me. Just run.  
I don't want you to get eaten, too...  
  
**Aoi：**  
*gasp*  
  
**Aoi：**  
The poor little thing is trembling.  
She's terrified, but she's trying to be brave for my sake.  
  
**Aoi：**  
If a young child like her can show that much courage,  
then how could I possibly run away?  
  
**Girl：**  
Huh? But... But why?  
The monster's coming!  
  
**Aoi：**  
*inhale* *exhale*  
I-it'll be okay!  
I'll save you, I promise!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Whew! Now that work's done, it's time to check on Aoi!  
She's probably all freaked out about the guild thing,  
so as her  
soon-to-be mentor I should give her some sage advice.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh? Someone's in the forest?  
Come on, people. Don't you know how dangerous it is?  
  
**Baddie 1：**  
Our mark's little sis went into the woods  
to look for the medicinal herbs.  
  
**Baddie 2：**  
He might figure out we've been poaching herbs from  
the forest and selling 'em to him at sky-high prices.  
  
**Baddie 1：**  
We gotta find his sister before she ruins our racket!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Afternoon, gents! Looking for someone?  
Maybe you'd like a little help?  
  
**Baddie 1：**  
Wh-who are you?!  
And whatta ya mean \"help?\"  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I can solve your problem in an instant with my magic!  
Get ready!  
Sha-shing!

**Hatsune：**  
Nailed it! A flawless teleportation! Love and peace!  
Huh? Hey, it's Aoi!  
Yoo-hoo!  
  
**Aoi：**  
H-Hatsune?!  
Behind you! Watch out!  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Baddie 1：**  
Whoa! What the hell? There're monsters everywhere!  
Where'd you bring us?  
Take this, ugly!  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Yikes. That didn't do a thing, did it?  
If anything, you made it angrier.  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Th-there are monsters crawling out from everywhere!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ugh, it must've called its friends.  
Aoi, let's work together and chase them all off!  
  
**Aoi：**  
R-right!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Urgh... Nothing's working.  
Now we're surrounded with nowhere to run!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I could take them out with a full-power magic blast,  
but then I'd obliterate our surroundings, too.  
What're we gonna do?  
  
**Aoi：**  
We can't give up.  
We have to protect this little girl!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wow, Aoi's being really brave!  
Okay, I'm with you all the way! Hi-yah!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Still no effect! They're getting closer!

**Misato：**  
My, my, my.  
You mustn't make mischief,  
you little scamps.  
  
**Monsters：**  
...!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Miss Misato?  
Huh? Hey, the monsters are all  
turning docile.  
  
**Misato：**  
This is our home.  
You should return to yours now.  
  
**Monsters：**  
HREEEEEEEK!  
  
**Aoi：**  
All those wild, vicious monsters turned and  
ran away?  
  
**Misato：**  
I cooked up a fragrance that repulses them.  
I'm relieved to see you're all safe.  
  
`image display end`  
**Young Man：**  
Oh, thank heavens!  
How could you go out on your own?  
I was worried sick!  
  
**Girl：**  
Brother... I'm sorry.  
  
**Baddie 1：**  
H-hey, this is bad. He's here.  
We'd better run before he recognizes us.  
  
**Baddie 2：**  
Urgh!  
I can't move!  
What is this?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Where're you going, gentlemen?  
Look, the person you were searching for is right here!  
  
**Young Man：**  
Oh, those two are the medicine merchants!  
  
**Misato：**  
Is that so?  
That's strange. Our guild acts as an intermediary  
for all Elven Forest herb usage,  
but I don't believe we've  
met before.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wait a sec. Are you guys poachers?!  
You're not going anywhere!  
  
**Baddie 1：**  
W-we're sorry! When we realized how much money  
we could make, we couldn't stop ourselves!  
  
**Misato：**  
Shame, shame. Bad boys have to be  
punished.  
The herbs you poached were one of the ingredients in my  
monster repellent. You mustn't ever take them again.  
  
**Misato：**  
Now, think about what you did and answer, please.  
Did you understand everything the teacher just said?  
  
**Baddies：**  
Yes, ma'am! We'll turn ourselves in.  
Goodbye, Teach!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
That  
 \"punishment\" turned the bad guys  
into  
completely different people!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Miss Misato, you're awesome.  
  
**Misato：**  
I really am relieved everyone got out of that unharmed.  
The little girl wanted me to thank you, Aoi.  
You certainly rose to the occasion.  
  
**Aoi：**  
*sob, sob* Waaaah!  
Miss Misato!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I was so scared, but I had to save her!  
But I was so, so scared! Waaah!  
  
**Misato：**  
You worked up all your courage.  
Aoi, you were marvelous out there.  
  
**Misato：**  
Do you think maybe you could work up that courage again,  
and take the apprentice qualification test?  
  
**Aoi：**  
*sniff* Miss Misato...  
Yes. I'll take the test!  
  
**Misato：**  
Ding ding ding! Congratulations, Aoi.  
You just passed.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh?  
 Whaaaat?!  
P-passed?  
The test?!  
  
**Misato：**  
Who needs a test?  
I saw your bravery as you helped  
a child in need. Let's both do our best to keep  
helping others, shall we?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Yippee! Congrats, Aoi!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Hyaaaah!  
Th-thank you very much!  
  
**Misato：**  
My, my, my. I can see the guild will be much livelier now.  
How nice!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so, accepted as an apprentice guild member,  
Aoi embarked upon a new chapter in her life.
