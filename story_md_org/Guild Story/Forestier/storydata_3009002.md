# Forestier Episode 2
As part of her training, Aoi is assigned as {player}'s forest guide. Hatsune's example feels too difficult to follow at first, but by answering {player}'s gentle leading questions, Aoi passes with flying colors.
  
## Subtitle: Forest Guide Seminar
  
**Narration：**  
Apprentice Forestier member Aoi attends daily training sessions  
in order to fulfill the requirements to become a full  
member of the guild.  
  
**Misato：**  
And that's why I've invited {player} to join us today!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Wh-wh-why did it have to be {player}?!  
  
**Misato：**  
Our guild has many responsibilities, including guiding visitors  
to our forest.  
So I asked {player} to play the role  
of visitor for today!  
  
**Aoi：**  
P-please, no. I have enough trouble talking to people  
as it is.  
The thought of messing up in front of {player}  
is too much!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Do your best.  
`Tag 1`  
**Aoi：**  
Ah, ah-wha-wha-wha-wha?!  
T-tweet tweet tweet!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Aoi, you're totally freezing up.  
You okay?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? Oh,  
wh-what was I doing?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
All right! As your mentor, I'll give you a quick demonstration  
of what to do!  
  
**Misato：**  
Very good. Aoi, pay close attention to Hatsune's body language,  
as well as what she says.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Y-yes, ma'am! Hatsune,  
whenever you're ready.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Can do!  
And we're off!  
Sha-shing!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Well, this is where the Elven Forest begins.  
We elves have watched over and protected this place  
for a long time!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
All the plants in this forest have unique powers, which  
makes them useful for medicines. Possibly because of the  
elves' stewardship!  
Isn't that awesome?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
But if they're not harvested using special methods that only  
the elves know,  
their effectiveness gets severely weakened.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
And that's the end of our tour!  
*yawn* All that formal guidance and commentary sure does  
tire you out.  
I need a quick break. *snooze*  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my, she's fast asleep.  
Well, Aoi, what did you think?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Hatsune's explanations were very easy to understand.  
I, umm, I don't think I'll ever be able to talk like that.  
  
**Misato：**  
It will be all right, Aoi. The first step is to have  
a little more confidence in yourself.  
Now, if you please, {player} is waiting for you.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Y-yes, ma'am.  
Let's begin  
 our tour.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Umm, so, this...  
H-huh? What do I say first?  
I'm drawing a total blank!  
  
**Aoi：**  
J-just... just a moment, please!  
Umm, uhh...  
  
**Aoi：**  
*whimper* I knew it, I can't do this!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Tell me about the best parts of the forest.  
`Tag 2`  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? The best parts?  
 I would say...  
The tranquility and calmness,  
in my opinion.  
  
**Aoi：**  
The plants and animals are all gentle and kind.  
When I'm surrounded by this peaceful atmosphere,  
it always puts me at ease.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh, but there's much more, of course.  
There are lots of wonderful sides to our forest.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Tell me more.  
`Tag 3`  
**Aoi：**  
Okay.  
The forest has a long history. We elves have watched  
over and protected it for a long time. That may be why  
all the plants here have unique powers.  
  
**Aoi：**  
And that concludes our tour.  
Umm, what did you think?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You had a nice smile.  
**Choice: (5)**  It was easy to understand.  
`Tag 4`  
**Aoi：**  
H-huh?!  
I was smiling?  
Oh gosh, I'm so embarrassed!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Aoi：**  
I-I'm glad to hear that.  
It was much easier for me once you started asking questions.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Misato：**  
Aoi, you did a wonderful job. I'm so proud.  
You pass your guide training!  
  
**Aoi：**  
P-pass? Me? Really?!  
Are you sure? I wasn't even trying to act like a tour guide.  
Should I really get to pass?  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh, absolutely.  
In fact, it's much more important to treat the  
visitor like a dear friend than try to play the role of guide.  
Always remember both what you said today, and how you said it.  
  
**Aoi：**  
I will! Thank you very much!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Mmmph. I got a great sleep.  
What's going on? Aoi, did you pass?  
Yay! Congrats!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Whoa! H-Hatsune,  
thank you,  
but please don't  
hug me out of nowhere! I'm happy and all,  
but you're making me flustered!  
  
**Misato：**  
My, my, my. What good friends you two are.  
  
**Narration：**  
Guided by Misato's and Hatsune's leadership, Aoi was able to grow as an apprentice guild member.
