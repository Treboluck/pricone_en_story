# Forestier Episode 3
Hatsune worries she's failing Aoi as a mentor. So when Aoi gets upset over a small mistake, Hatsune teaches her an easier way to do things, to Aoi's delight. The day gets even better when Misato makes Aoi a full member.
  
## Subtitle: A Reliable Mentor
  
**Narration：**  
{player} sees a familiar face while walking down the road.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
*sigh* What could I be doing better?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, hey, {player}!  
Heh heh. What a coincidence! Sha-shing!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hmm? I looked frustrated?  
Yeah, you got me. I've got a lot of my mind.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
See, I feel like I'm not really being much of a mentor to Aoi  
yet.  
I was trying to think of something I could do or say to  
help her succeed.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You'd have to ask her.  
**Choice: (2)**  So you want to do something she needs?  
`Tag 1`  
**Hatsune：**  
I guess you're right.  
I've gotta just ask her up front.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Hatsune：**  
Yeah, but... what does she need help with?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Hatsune：**  
Know what?  
I'm gonna go find Aoi and talk to her right now.  
{player}, you come too!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
So long story short, we're here to talk to you, Aoi!  
  
**Aoi：**  
You can't say long story short when you didn't have  
a story in the first place. And why is {player} here too?  
P-p-please don't stare at me like that!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh geez, I'm so sorry!  
I promise, I'm not trying to freak you out.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh, no. I, umm, I'm not freaking out.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Well, okay then. There's something I've been dying to ask you.  
See, I'm really bad at this whole mentor thing.  
So I was hoping  
you could tell me what you think would help you succeed!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh?  
You're asking me?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
You bet I am!  
Take the whole forest guide thing. I fell asleep  
right after I gave my speech, and that's seriously not mentor  
behavior!  
It's been weighing on my mind ever sense.  
  
**Aoi：**  
I understand. Well, I don't think you're a bad  
mentor, Hatsune. I think... Um,  
I think you're  
setting a great example.  
  
**Aoi：**  
If anyone here needs to get their act together,  
it's definitely me.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hmm? What's the matter, Aoi?  
Did something happen?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Well... I was supposed to document all the goods we traded  
today.  
But I messed up some of the numbers.  
  
**Aoi：**  
I wound up causing trouble for a lot of people...  
I was actually on my way to go fix it right now.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Aww, geez...  
Hey, I know! Do you have all the docs on you now?  
Lemme take a look!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? Yes,  
right here! Go ahead.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Thanks!  
Now what've we got here?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Sha-shing! I knew it. See here? That's where the problem is.  
Elven Forest goods trade at different prices in different  
towns, but they're not listed in order of price on these.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
So don't try to add them in one big ball of numbers. Try  
sorting them by exchange rates and tally them separately.  
Then  
you can take those sums and put 'em together at the end!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh... I get it!  
You're right! That's so much easier!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Thank you so much, Hatsune. I'm sure I won't make any mistakes  
next time.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Great! Glad I could help.  
  
**Aoi：**  
W-wait,  
Hatsune!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hmm? What's up?  
Something else you need help with?  
  
**Aoi：**  
No, it's not that...  
I just wanted to say, you're an amazing mentor!  
You're always coming to my rescue like this.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Really?  
 Hee hee hee! Yay!  
Hearing you say that  
means the world to me, Aoi!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Whaa! P-p-please don't hug me without a warning!  
I can see how happy you are!  
  
**Misato：**  
My, my, my. You two are such close friends.  
Aoi, have you finished correcting the trading documents?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh, I'm sorry!  
I'm almost done!  
J-just give me another minute!  
  
**Misato：**  
There's no need to rush. You have plenty of time.  
I'm just here because I have something important to tell you.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Important?  
Oh no, am I f-f-f-fired?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
You can't! Firing her over a little math mistake  
is way too harsh!  
 Please, I promise to be a better  
mentor to her. Can't you overlook this?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Hatsune!  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. What's gotten into you two?  
Relax. I'm not here to fire anyone.  
  
**Misato：**  
Aoi, your apprenticeship period is over.  
I'm officially  
promoting you to a full-fledged Forestier member.  
Congratulations.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Whaaaat?! M-me, a real member?!  
But wait, what about that huge mess I caused today?  
  
**Misato：**  
All of us make mistakes. When we do, the most important  
thing is for guildmates to help one another, like you two  
did today.  
That's what friends are for.  
  
**Misato：**  
If you're in trouble, seek help. If someone seems like they  
need help, reach out.  
Keep working hard, and remember  
that lesson.  
  
**Aoi：**  
*sob, sob* Miss Misato!  
Thank you so much. I promise I'll do my very best!  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my, my, my. Still breaking down into tears?  
Crying makes a mess of that adorable little face.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Congrats.  
`Tag 4`  
**Aoi：**  
*sniff*  
Thank you s-so much.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Aoi! Oh my gosh, congrats! Congrats a million times!  
We've got a lot of work to do together,  
so let's do our best!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Yes! I'll be looking to you the whole way!  
  
**Narration：**  
In the middle of her crying and sobbing,  
Aoi replied with a wonderful, genuine smile.
