**Rino：**  
Zzz, zzz... ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hey, Rino?  
  
**Rino：**  
Mmm, mmm...  
Ehehe, I couldn't possibly beat anymore... ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Err, okay?  
 Really though, get up.  
You shouldn't be sleeping in a monster-infested cave like this.  
Unless you have a death wish, of course.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Okay, how about this?  
I'll give {player} a big smooch if you don't. ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
H-hey, what about our pro—  
Wait, Big Sis?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, sleeping beauty awakes.  
A good morning to you. ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Uh, yeah, good morning...  
W-wait a minute.  
Where in the world are we?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
First things first,  
calm down. You just woke up,  
so I get that you're in a panic,  
but this cave's rife with monsters.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You know how they are. They'll come swarming if they hear  
any loud noises.  
 Not that they're especially strong,  
but our priority right now should be conserving our energy.  
  
**Rino：**  
Err...?  
  
**Rino：**  
Gimme a second.  
I need to process what's going on.  
  
**Rino：**  
Let's see... Oh, now I remember.  
I wanted to get the materials for Labyrista's apron,  
so we went out to collect them together.  
  
**Rino：**  
I'm not exactly swimming in money,  
so buying them in stores wasn't an option...  
  
**Rino：**  
Monsters, on the other hand,  
pretty much give them out for free.So we decided to roll with that.  
Fur, threads, dyes. All that good stuff.  
  
**Rino：**  
You and Big Bro {player} ended up coming along with me,  
from what I remember.  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, right.  
 It was because Big Bro {player}  
takes on a lot of material-gathering work,  
so he's more used to it than me.  
  
**Rino：**  
Yeah, that's it.  
And then he offered to show me some efficient spots.  
  
**Rino：**  
But then, for some reason,  
Big Sis Shizuru decided to tag along as well.  
  
**Rino：**  
Man, that sucks.  
There I was, all excited for a picnic with just the two of us.  
So much for that.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hey, now you're the one ignoring our promise!  
Besides, material gathering's always quicker with more people.  
  
**Rino：**  
Well, you're not wrong...  
Here's the part that confuses me, though.  
Didn't he take us to a regular old field?  
  
**Rino：**  
Either I'm going crazy,  
or we're smack-dab in the middle of a cave.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yup, that's the biggest mystery. I'm not sure what happened,  
but the scenery just kind of... changed all of a sudden.  
First we were in the field, then we were here.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
If I had to wager a guess, I'd say it's related to the guildmaster's weird  
ability. What was it, object manipulation? She probably used that.  
The scenery's changed, but the monsters are still the same.  
  
**Rino：**  
Wait, really?  
But why? Doesn't make sense to me.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Who knows...  
Nothing she does makes sense, if I'm being honest.  
Much as I hate to think it, it could even be her way of pranking us.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
On that note,  
I've been trying to get in touch with her. No luck so far, though...  
Chances are we'll have to find a way out of here on our own.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Looks like it's more of a labyrinth now, too.  
Weak as they might be, there's still a lot of monsters.  
It'd be a struggle on my own, so I need you in full gear.  
  
**Rino：**  
Sure, no problemo.  
Now that I think about it,  
Big Bro {player} isn't exactly a prized fighter.  
  
**Rino：**  
Guess it's up to us to protect him!  
Like the great sisters we are.  
  
**Rino：**  
Ehehe,  
we can even gather materials while we're at it.  
Two birds, one throne. ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Stone, not throne.  
By the way, {player}'s out cold,  
so I'll have to carry him on my back.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Do you mind dealing with monsters until he wakes up?  
It'd be a big help.  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, huh...  
So I wasn't the only one that passed out?  
That's kind of a relief.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yup. That's the thing with her object manipulation...  
It takes a pretty big toll on anyone caught up in it.  
If you're not used to it, then you're almost guaranteed to pass out.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Not to be the bearer of bad news, but you're bound to experience it  
even more now that you're a member of Labyrinth.  
So get used to it. Or...  
else! ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Sure, sure,  
Honestly, it shouldn't be too bad.  
Not after getting used to your constant headbutt warnings.  
  
**Rino：**  
Trust me when I say this.  
You're way scarier than any monster.  
  
**Rino：**  
*pant, pant*  
F-finally! I thought we'd be in there all day.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Phew. You're telling me.  
I'm exhausted.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Meanwhile,  
{player} spent the entire time passed out.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I've experienced a lot,  
but having someone wrapped to my back while fighting?  
That sure is a first.  
  
**Rino：**  
Is he, uh, okay?  
D-Don't tell me he's dead...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Don't worry,  
he still has a pulse.  
He's just out cold.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hey, wait a minute.  
I know this place.  
It's the same plaza where Labyrista's stall is, isn't it?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
We just got out of the cave, so how come we ended up here?  
There are no caves connected to town, as far as I remember.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
What if she did something funky with the terrain again?  
I wouldn't put it past her.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Bingo!  
You've got a good head on those slender shoulders.  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, there you are. And you're still trying to make sales in that getup, I see.  
Didn't I already tell you that you're scaring potential customers away?  
  
**Rino：**  
Don't worry, though.  
I'll fix you up an apron right away!  
  
**Rino：**  
Dealing with all the monsters in that cave was a nightmare,  
but it wasn't all bad.  
Now I've got plenty of materials on hand. ♪  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Oh, so that's what you went out for?  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Well, now I feel bad for doubting the two of you.  
I figured you decided to go rogue and go flirt with  
{player},  
 you know?  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Can you blame me, though?  
I know you've been going on dates and stuff behind my back.  
Not that I don't get how you feel, but let's avoid that for now.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
We're still in the early phases, so you'll just have to deal with it for now.  
Really,things could get pretty messy otherwise.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Then again, though.  
It's a bit too late for that,isn't it?  
And it wouldn't be fair to force things back to how they were, either.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
So... I figured it was best to take another approach.  
Rather than force you to keep your distance,  
we'll focus on analyzing how he responds to the two of you.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
The plan was to start doing that a little bit down the line,  
but it can't hurt to speed things up a bit.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
That's why you ended up in that maze.  
And why all the monsters started coming for you.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
If there's one way to get a reaction out of him,  
it's through my object manipulation.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
A cheeky little experiment, if you will. ♪  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Thing is, I forgot to account for how skilled you two are.  
Which is great in and of itself,  
but you ended up getting out of it without him even waking up.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
At least I've got that data now,  
so I can make the next experiment a bit more difficult.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh...?  
Well, thanks for filling us in beforehand.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Let's make one little detail loud and clear.  
Anyone that puts {player} in danger will face the consequences. Yourself included.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
I know, I know.  
Don't worry, I'm making sure there's no real danger involved in them.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
As for that one just there,  
I'd have gotten you out of there if things got hairy.  
Worst case scenario, I'd have joined you.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Just remember, though. I'm not some omniscient, all-powerful being.  
There's plenty that even I don't know .  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Research. Observation. Experimentation.  
You'll never get the full picture without them.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
I'm not against the two of you staying in contact with him.  
But you'll have to deal with the experiments in exchange.  
So long as you keep that in mind, we're all good.  
  
**Labyrista：**  
And hey,  
this'll get me way better data in the long run. ♪  
  
**Labyrista：**  
More importantly, you two hungry yet?  
 I just whipped up some  
new crepes, so feel free to dig in. Not like there's any other  
customers, so might as well get some use out of these ingredients. ♪  
  
**Labyrista：**  
Really, though. We're fronting as a crepe store, but at this rate we'll go  
bust before we even get to the bottom of everything.  
 Your stomachs  
are the key to ensuring Labyrinth's survival, my friends. ♪  
  
**Labyrista：**  
One last thing, too. The wheel of fate's already started turning,  
with {player} at its dead center.  
Your patience's going to pay off very soon, that much I can guarantee.
