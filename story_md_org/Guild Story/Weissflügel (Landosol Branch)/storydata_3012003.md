## Subtitle: Our First Combo
  
**Narration：**  
Monika's guild, Weissflügel, faces its greatest crisis to date.  
  
**Monika：**  
I have a serious problem with the current situation.  
  
**Ninon：**  
It's not good to be a picky eater.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I knew I should've made dessert.  
  
**Monika：**  
Indeed, something sweet to cap off this meal would—  
  
**Monika：**  
Wait,  
no!  
I'm not talking about the food.  
  
**Monika：**  
I want to have a discussion about this guild's obvious  
shortcomings.  
  
**Yuki：**  
We've been getting steady work, and we're doing great with it.  
What's there to be dissatisfied with?  
  
**Kuka：**  
I agree.  
We wouldn't be eating so well if things  
were going poorly.  
  
**Monika：**  
You all seem to have gotten the wrong impression.  
  
**Monika：**  
Why do adventurer's guilds exist? For the members to hone their  
battle skills to the highest level. 20/Why do that? So they can  
fight strong monsters, raise their rank, and protect civilians.  
  
**Monika：**  
If we spend all our time doing material-gathering jobs  
from sunrise to sunset, we'll never be able to fulfill  
our true purpose!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Come on! I say this all the time—I don't want to fight in any  
intense battles.  
The slightest scratch to my porcelain skin  
would be a national crisis.  
  
**Kuka：**  
I... I'll fight some plant monsters!  
Ones with lots of vines!  
Eh-heh... Gueheheh...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Kuka, please watch yourself.  
You're drooling all on the food!  
  
**Kuka：**  
*gasp*  
P-pardon me.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Arigato for understanding.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Go easy on that, Ninon!  
That's the hottest sauce they have here.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Tsk, tsk, tsk. This is nothing. A little bit of heat will not  
faze me!  
*slurp*  
  
**Ninon：**  
M-mouth! On fire!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I tried to warn you...  
I'll go get some water.  
  
**Monika：**  
Why did you all want to join a guild in the first place?  
  
**Monika：**  
You say something too, lad.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Everything's fine.  
**Choice: (2)**  Give it up.  
`Tag 1`  
**Monika：**  
Ugh, you would say that.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Monika：**  
Not you, too.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Monika：**  
Ahem. Moving on.  
Tomorrow, I'm putting you all through an  
intense boot camp out on the Prano Plains!  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day...  
  
**Yuki：**  
*pant, pant*  
Look at me, all flushed and dripping with sweat.  
I'm such a sexy little minx.  
  
**Kuka：**  
A-are you planning to exhaust me until I can't move a muscle,  
then have your way with me?  
Eh-heh, Gueheheh...  
  
**Ninon：**  
I will put my arms back and run like the wind,  
so that my waistcloth does not touch the earth!  
Shapapapan!  
  
**Monika：**  
I was told monsters were few and far between out here, so we  
would be able to focus our energy on training.  
But I don't think any of them even know how to be serious.  
  
**Monika：**  
Hey! If I catch any of you slacking off, I'll add extra reps!  
  
**Monika：**  
Hmm? What is it?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  There's a huge monster coming!  
`Tag 4`  
**Monika：**  
Please, that's impossible.  
There are no...  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Eeek!  
I-it's a monster!  
  
**Monika：**  
What on earth?  
There shouldn't be monsters anywhere near  
that fearsome out here.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
*gasp* I just remembered.  
I've heard that since the boss  
of the forest is gone, more powerful monsters have been  
appearing as of late.  
  
**Monika：**  
What?!  
  
**Monika：**  
If that's true, I've made a grave error in judgment.  
What a fool I was.  
  
**Monika：**  
But we can save the talk about what went wrong for the debrief.  
Everyone, we need to get out of here!  
We don't stand a chance against that thing.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Ahh, what a face.  
Cool, calm, and cute, even with a ferocious  
monster rapidly approaching.  
  
**Monika：**  
This is no time for self-admiration!  
Run away before you get killed!  
  
**Yuki：**  
I'll be fine.  
I can charm most monsters with a bat of my eyelashes.  
Right? You wouldn't harm little old me, would you?  
  
**Monster：**  
SKRRREEE!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
A-amazing!  
It's running away from Yuki!  
  
**Monika：**  
But in the wrong direction!  
Kuka, the monster's headed your way!  
  
**Kuka：**  
A-a fierce monster attacks. Suddenly, Mr. Sadist saves me and  
says,  
\"You know how you're going to repay me, don't you?\"  
*squeal*  
  
**Monster：**  
SKRRREEE!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
W-wait, now it's running away from Kuka, too.  
  
**Monika：**  
For whatever reason, it's deciding that it's better off  
staying away from them.  
But now it's moving straight towards Ninon!  
  
**Ninon：**  
What is all the commotion?  
Is it a matsuri?  
  
**Monika：**  
Ugh, I've had enough.  
I'll handle this.  
Back me up, {player}!  
  
**Monika：**  
Ninon, it's a monster!  
Run away while I draw its attention!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Huh? Monster?  
Oh, Monika, you had better stay back!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
The monster vanished?  
What in the world just happened?  
  
**Monika：**  
Wait, is this... a pitfall trap?  
Whew, that was close.  
One more step and I'd be down there with the monster.  
  
**Ninon：**  
*sigh* Now my meal-catching trap has gone to waste.  
Unless...  
Is this monster edible?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
N-no, um...  
I doubt it's suitable for cooking.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Grrr! No one gets away with taking food out of Ninon's mouth.  
Die, monster!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Ninon：**  
*sigh* My katana has been wasted on such a worthless target.  
  
**Monika：**  
I'm at a loss. What just happened?  
Sheer coincidence or not, the three of them just defeated  
that powerful monster.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
They're incredible.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Heh heh heh!  
  
**Yuki：**  
That's what happens when you threaten me.  
  
**Kuka：**  
H-huh? Where did the monster go?  
  
**Monika：**  
Maybe the members of my guild  
actually have incredible  
amounts of untapped potential.  
  
**Monika：**  
If nothing else, I finally have something legitimate to  
report to my homeland.  
  
**Monika：**  
Success! Yes! *Yes!*  
Ha ha ha!  
  
**Narration：**  
After a rocky start, a faint glimmer of hope  
now illuminates the future of Weissflügel.
