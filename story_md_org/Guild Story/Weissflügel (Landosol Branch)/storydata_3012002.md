# Weissflügel Episode 2
Sensing someone has been following him for several days, {player} asks Weissflügel for help. They set a trap and lure out Ayumi, {player}'s semi-stalker. Impressed by her stealth skills, the guild tries to recruit her.
  
## Subtitle: Sadly, You Must Die!
  
**Narration：**  
While working on a quest in the forest, {player}  
is surrounded by Monika and her allies.  
  
**Monika：**  
Don't resent us for this, {player}. Your power is a  
double-edged sword. If it fell into the hands of another  
adventurer, or worse, a villain, it would threaten us all.  
  
**Monika：**  
As a proud soldier of Weissflügel, I have no choice but to  
strike you down.  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-I'm sad that I won't be subjected to any more of your  
cruel humiliations, Mr. Sadist...  
  
**Yuki：**  
Such is life.  
A threat to my well-being is nothing less  
than a threat to all mankind!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Shogun, rest assured that I  
 will conquer the land in your  
stead.  
  
**Monika：**  
On my signal, attack!  
{player}, prepare yourself!

**???：**  
D-doooon't!  
  
![301200202.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/301200202.webp)  
**???：**  
H-huh?  
They... actually stopped?  
  
**Monika：**  
Hmph.  
So you finally show yourself, vile assassin.  
  
**Monika：**  
{player}, do you recognize this girl?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Nope.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kuka：**  
Not the kind of person I expected.  
  
**Yuki：**  
I'll say.  
I was hoping for a scraggly old man,  
so my exquisiteness would stand out more.  
  
**Ninon：**  
A kunoichi!  
Very cool!  
  
**???：**  
...Huh?  
  
`image display end`  
**Monika：**  
Don't get complacent, everyone.  
Remember, we're dealing  
with someone who can completely erase her presence  
and strike from the shadows at any moment.  
  
**???：**  
H-huh?  
Wait, was this...  
  
**Monika：**  
Now, squad!  
Capture her before she has a chance to escape!  
Attack!  
  
**???：**  
It's a trap!  
Waaaah!  
  
**Monika：**  
{player} told us he's felt like someone's been  
watching him for a few days now.  
  
**Monika：**  
Of course, it wasn't hard to imagine why. His powers are  
certainly special enough to warrant being targeted by  
ne'er-do-wells.  
  
**Monika：**  
After discussing it, we decided an open assault was too risky,  
and developed an alternative strategy.  
  
**Monika：**  
Clearly, if one were after {player}'s power,  
it wouldn't do to let him be killed.  
So, we staged a mock falling out, and then...  
  
**???：**  
*whine*  
*whimper*  
*sob*  
  
**Monika：**  
All right, enough sniveling.  
Time to come clean and confess.  
  
**Monika：**  
Why are you after {player}? Who hired you?  
Another country? A guild?  
And who *are* you?  
  
**???：**  
Well... Umm... Err...  
Y-you see... Well...  
  
**Monika：**  
I see. Tight-lipped, are we?  
Have it your way. We have ways of making you talk.  
Ninon!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Leave it to me.  
Ninpo: Tickle Hell Jutsu!  
  
Shapan!  
  
**???：**  
Huh? Oh, oh...  
Ah ha ha!  
Stop, stop! Ha ha ha ha ha! That tickles!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Tickle tickle!  
  
**???：**  
No, stop, stop!  
Ha ha ha ha!  
  
**Monika：**  
This continues until you divulge what you know.  
Of course, if you think you can take it...  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-I can take it!  
Let me tag in!  
  
**Monika：**  
You stay put!  
  
**???：**  
I'll talk! I'm sorry!  
Please, please stop!  
*whimper*  
  
**???：**  
I didn't mean any harm.  
Please believe me.  
  
**Monika：**  
You didn't mean any harm, but you followed him 24/7?  
That's the best excuse you could come up with?  
I don't believe a word.  
  
**???：**  
It's true! I,  
umm, just...  
W-wanted to... *mumble*  
  
**Monika：**  
Hmm? Speak up.  
I can't hear you.  
  
**???：**  
I-I have... a...  
*mumble*  
  
**Kuka：**  
Whatever it is, it must be hard to admit.  
  
**Yuki：**  
All right, step aside.  
I'll lend her my ear.  
  
**Yuki：**  
What's that?  
You just wanted to look at him?  
  
**Kuka：**  
L-look at him? Is it because you have a...  
  
**???：**  
Y-yes...  
  
**Monika：**  
What?!  
  
**???：**  
Ahh!  
Please, don't say it out loud!  
  
**Yuki：**  
There, there. Don't fret. I know exactly how you feel.  
To be perfectly frank,  
I'm in the same situation.  
  
**Yuki：**  
No matter where I am or what I'm doing, I long to look at  
my adorable features so desperately, it's unbearable.  
For you see, I am madly in love with myself!  
  
**Monika：**  
What's your name?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
...Ayumi.  
  
**Monika：**  
Ayumi. You swear on your life that was your only motivation?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Yes.  
  
**Monika：**  
Then that means...  
  
**Monika：**  
You're just a common stalker!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
S-stalker is a strong word.  
I'm just happy to watch over  
{player} from afar.  
  
**Monika：**  
Which is commonly referred to as \"stalking.\"  
  
**Monika：**  
All that over nothing. I was convinced you were an assassin  
from a rival guild or foreign nation. We wasted an obscene  
amount of time, and for what? *sigh*  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Umm... Am I free to go?  
  
**Monika：**  
Yes, yes. Run along now.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Thank you.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Not so fast! You have a great talent of ninjutsu.  
Join me in my quest to conquer the lands!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh?  
  
**Monika：**  
Huh? Hey, don't scout people without my approval.  
I'm the guildmaster here.  
  
**Yuki：**  
I'd be fine with it, personally.  
It's one more person to do  
the fighting,  
which gives me that much more mirror time.  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-I don't mind, either.  
I feel like Ayumi and I are like  
two peas in a pod. A tight, binding pod...  
  
**Monika：**  
The last thing I need is another one of them to corral.  
  
**Monika：**  
Wh-what about you, lad? Remember, this is the girl  
who's been tailing you for days on end!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It's fine.  
`Tag 2`  
**Ayumi：**  
{player}!  
  
**Monika：**  
This can't be...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!  
I promise I'll do whatever I can to help.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Nhuh? Wh-what are you doing?  
You want to shake hands?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
*squeal*  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ayumi has fainted!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-is she all right?  
  
**Monika：**  
*sigh* I can already see how this is going to play out.
