**Narration：**  
Inside the Mercurius Foundation guildhouse,  
Akino and Tamaki kneel on the floor before Mifuyu.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Your wasteful spending is out of control!  
That goes for both of you!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
You, Miss Akino, have always been a reckless spender,  
while you, Tamaki, are buying way, way too much cat food!  
  
**Yukari：**  
I don't want to come down on you too hard,  
but if the two of you don't change your ways, we'll need  
to dip into the funds reserved for investments and loans.  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, this is the only lifestyle I've ever known...  
I hardly think I can change it now.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myeah, and I just can't say no when I see  
those cute little kitties begging me for food!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
No excuses!  
For the time being, both of you can consider your wages cut!  
  
**Akino：**  
*sigh*  
Well this is certainly awful.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyo kidding.  
Without those rupies, all my little feline friends  
are gonna go hungry.  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh? Isn't that...?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hey, {player}!  
Over here! You gotta hear this!  
Mifuyu's gone too far!  
  
**Akino：**  
She said we've been spending too much,  
and slashed our wages by a hefty sum to compensate...  
Oh, whatever are we going to do?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Use the money you have left wisely.  
**Choice: (2)**  Find another line of work to make more money?  
`Tag 1`  
**Tamaki：**  
Use our money wisely...  
Mya-ha!  
That's it!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Tamaki：**  
Myake more money, eh?  
I've got an idea!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyice one, {player}!  
If we're running short on funds, then we just have to find a way to myake what we have grow!  
  
**Akino：**  
Yes, that's true, but...  
How exactly are we going to do that?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I know the purr-fect place!  
Follow me!  
  
**Akino：**  
Should I be noticing something special about this restaurant?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
The truth is, there’s some gambling going on in the back.  
I’m paw-sitive we can rake in the rupies if we play!  
  
**Akino：**  
A backroom gambling den, eh...  
Are you sure this is all right?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It's only the customers playing together,  
so there's nothing illegal about it!  
The fact that I haven't busted it up is good proof of that!  
  
**Akino：**  
You do have a point. If everything weren't on the up-and-up,  
you certainly wouldn't vouch for it.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
That's right! So let's get this show on the road!  
The game is five-card draw!  
 I'll tell you everything  
you need to knyow, Akino. First, let's get you some cards.  
  
**Akino：**  
Full house.  
I win!  
  
**Onlooker：**  
Whoa!  
That girl's won the last ten hands in a row!  
  
**Akino：**  
With my good fortune, winning at cards is child's play!  
Deal the next hand!  
  
**Opponent：**  
Heheheh... Three of a kind.  
Sorry kiddo, looks like I win this time.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyot so fast! This guy's a dirty cheat!  
He switched his cards!  
You'll find the proof in his sleeve!  
  
**Opponent：**  
D-dammit!  
How could you tell?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyahaha!  
Nothing slips past this cat's eyes!  
  
**Akino：**  
The two of us together truly are unbeatable, Tamaki.  
At this rate we'll never lose!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myeah, that's right! Now it's time to really clean house!  
  
**Narration：**  
A few days later.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
That's odd.  
I thought the two of them would be crawling back  
sobbing for forgiveness by now...  
  
**Yukari：**  
On the contrary, they seem to be in really high spirits lately.  
Like they're really living it up...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
This isn't right... They're up to something.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Sorry, {player}. We didn't ask you to come help us shop  
just to fill your ears with this nonsense.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
No, {player} is actually a key witness.  
He's friends with Akino and Tamaki, too, after all.  
That's why I asked him along today!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
So, got any idea what those two are up to?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Spill the beans.  
`Tag 4`  
**Mifuyu：**  
They're making money by gambling?!  
What a pair of absolute idiots!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Gambling is the bane of frugality!  
Yukari, I need your help!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Sure, but with what...?  
  
**Akino：**  
Ohohoho! I win again!  
At this point, even *I'm* frightened  
by how much fortune favors me!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
And with me by your side, you'll nyever have to worry  
about cheaters pulling one over on you!  
We'll be laughing all the way to the bank!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Miss Akino? Tamaki?  
What're you doing here?  
  
**Akino：**  
Mifuyu?!  
T-this is, well... It's not what it looks like!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
No need to be a fraidy-cat, Akino!  
We're nyot doing anything wrong, after all!  
We can spend our own money however we please!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Maybe so, but gambling is out of the question.  
Your father asked me to make sure you learn how to live  
life in an honest, respectable manner.  
  
**Akino：**  
But, surely you can see we aren't losing?  
I would have thought that our making all this extra money would please you.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I hear you two talking about all this money you're making,  
and yet your coin purses seem a little light, don't they?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Y-yeah, well...  
We spend most of the money we make right away.  
That's just how it goes.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I slashed your pay so that you'd learn to spend your money  
wisely.  
This undermines everything I'd hoped to teach you.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Grr... But this is money we won ourselves!  
That means we can use it however we want!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
All right. I can see you're set in your ways.  
So, how about Yukari and I take you on in a round of cards?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I'll put all of my savings on the line. Here, I even wrote it up  
in a contract.  
 And as an added bonus, if you beat us  
you can keep on gambling all you want.  
  
**Akino：**  
That's, well, um... Are you sure that's okay?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
In return, I want you to bet an equal sum.  
And then if we win, you'll never, ever gamble again!  
Got it?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyow you're talkin’! We'll make you regret the day  
you sat across the table from us!  
  
**Akino：**  
Two pair!  
I'm afraid it was quite foolish of you  
to pit yourselves against Tamaki and me.  
  
  
**Tamaki：**  
We've got the early lead.  
Nyow let's finish 'em off!  
  
**Customer 1：**  
Woohoo! Go get 'em, Akino!  
  
**Customer 2：**  
Take 'em for everything they've got!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yukari. You still good to go?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Yes. I'm fine.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyehehe...  
Look like you've still got plenty of money on the table. ♪  
Hey Akino, I think it's time to raise the bet!  
  
**Akino：**  
Agreed!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Full house.  
  
**Akino：**  
One pair.  
And a fat lot of good it does me!  
  
**Customer 1：**  
Hey, don't sweat it! The night's still young!  
  
**Akino：**  
True. I've lost worse and still come back before.  
This time things will end differently!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
A pair... I guess this means I win.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hey, hold up!  
They've turned the tables on us somehow!  
What gives?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Straight flush.  
I think it's safe to say we cleaned your clocks.  
  
**Akino：**  
B-but how?  
You've got us completely beaten!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Simple. I memorized which cards were which  
by looking at the scratches on their backs.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyone of these cards are *that* scratched up!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Well, they're made of paper, so they tend to get nicked  
with heavy use, right?  
 See, like this mark here.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
But that's nyothing!  
You're saying you kept track of *that* all through the game?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Of course.  
Letting Yukari and I play on the same side  
was a bad move, too.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Yes, I know your mannerisms very well,  
so I could read your faces and movements  
to tell what you had in your hands.  
  
**Akino：**  
I never would've thought of that...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Lastly, we had the audience on our side.  
We paid for all of their drinks before they arrived.  
  
**Akino：**  
You did what?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyo... something's still off.  
I would've sniffed you out if you were cheating!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
We wanted you to win a bit and get overconfident,  
so we had everyone egg you on. The two of you  
let your guard down partway through, right?  
  
**Yukari：**  
All the people here did was cheer you on  
while having some free drinks and snacks.  
It still proved pretty effective though, huh?  
  
**Customer 2：**  
Hey, Yukari! Come drink for real next time, okay?  
This was the first time I'd seen you sober like this in ages!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, haha. Sure, next time I'm in the mood.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I-I've been had...  
It wasn't quite cheating, so it slid completely under my nyose...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
So, now that we've won,  
I trust you remember your part of the deal?  
  
**Akino：**  
Fine.  
We will never, ever, dabble in games of chance again.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Aren't you forgetting something?  
We wagered all of our savings, remember?  
That means the two of you lost more money than you have.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
This is quite a sum. Think your wages will cover it?  
If not, I guess you'll have to take out a couple of loans. ♪  
And as it happens, our guild is in the money lending business.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyoooo, nyot a loan! Anything but thaaat!!!  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day—  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I-I finished the job...  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, the paperwork is complete.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Okay, next I want you to clean the office.  
And after that, I've got some new business plans  
I need your help with.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oof... This is overkill!  
Down with unfair labor practices!  
We have rights, too, you knyow!  
  
**Akino：**  
I fail to understand why we must be oppressed so!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I'd work more and complain less if I were you,  
otherwise you'll never get out of the hole.  
Don't forget  
your pay was reduced even more as punishment for gambling.  
  
**Yukari：**  
And it's true that we're a bit shorthanded  
now that our guild has grown.  
I'm finishing up early today,  
so I'll leave the rest to you.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Thanks for your help, Yukari.  
Until you've paid what you owe, I'm the acting guildmaster!  
C'mon, let's pick up the pace! Time is money!  
  
**Akino：**  
*huff, huff*  
I'm never,  
 *ever*, touching a deck of cards again!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myaaargh, I hate being in debt!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so it was that Akino and Tamaki  
swore in their hearts to never gamble ever again.
