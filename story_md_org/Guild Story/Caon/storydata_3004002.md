**Kaori：**  
La-la-la. ♪  
Hard to beat a nice walk with the crew. ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Not to dampen your spirits here,  
but let's not forget that we're on patrol.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Enjoy yourself as much as you want, sure.  
Just make sure to keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary, too.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Yeah, yeah. I know.  
Don't sweat it. ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
You sure about that?  
Honestly, sometimes I really can't tell with you.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Whatever, though.  
Ain't no issue if I just keep my head in the game.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha!  
Gotta say, though. It's rad that you're with us tonight.  
Normally you just rush right home. ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yeah, sorry about that.  
I gotta help out with my parents' restaurant usually.  
We're closed today though, which is why I'm here.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ah, shoot. Let's slow down a little bit.  
We're gonna leave our dear Princess and Kasumi in the dust at this rate.  
  
**Maho：**  
Yup.  
Be a li'l more careful for our sakes, okay?  
  
**Maho：**  
Seems like Kasumi's sight ain't quite that right at night, either.  
Last thing we want is her trippin' over,  
so let's take it nice and slow. ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha!  
That's why you gotta get your head outta the books,  
Kasumi.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's worth highlighting that my vision is, in fact,  
perfectly fine. You lot are just monsters in comparison.  
Well. I'm a *little* nearsighted. Just a little, though.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I can amplify my vision with magic should the need arise,  
but don't take that as an invite to speed back up.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
More importantly.  
Is there any need for us to stick together  
in such a big group in the first place?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Landosol's as big as they come.  
If anything, we should assign specific areas to  
each of us and split up from there.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aww, but that's no fun!  
We should stick together!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Fun isn't our priority here, my dear.  
  
**Makoto：**  
We can't go treading on other guilds' turf, though.  
 Our route mainly  
keeps us within a certain distance from the guildhouse itself.  
In other words, districts where other beastfolk live.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Worst case scenario is one of us having a  
run-in with Nightmare while we're alone.  
They ain't exactly fond of us, as you know.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Would kinda defeat the whole purpose of patrolling  
if we end up in a scrap with another guild.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hmm.  
A surprisingly solid point.  
You lot really do work well on instinct, don't you?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Not a fan of this \"you lot\" stuff.  
You're as much a member of Caon as we are.  
You gotta open up a bit more!  
  
**Kaori：**  
We can be besties! Oh so besties! ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Whoa! Quit hugging me out of nowhere!  
You *really* are a bit too touchy-feely, aren't you?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Urgh.  
I appreciate that they're willing to interact with a  
socially awkward weirdo like me, but...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I need to get my act together and stop lashing out.  
I'm not doing things solo anymore.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I've got friends now.  
Reliable companions. I should be treating them with more care...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hmm?  
Hey. I'm pretty sure someone's hanging  
out in that alley over there.  
  
**Maho：**  
Wow!  
Well spotted, Kaori.  
You're such a good gal, you know that? ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ehehe. ♪  
I'll go check what the deal is.  
The rest of you stay here!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey there. No need to run off on your own.  
Let's deal with this together.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Princess, Kasumi.  
You two stay put, just in case.  
If worst comes to worst, then give us backup.  
  
**Maho：**  
Okay-dokey.  
Stay safe now, you hear?  
  
**Maho：**  
I know everyone thinks Landosol is as safe a place as can be,  
but there's Shadows an' all sorts these days.  
Can't hurt to be extra careful.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I hear ya.  
Hey, you over there!  
Raise your hands slowly and get on your knees!  
  
**Makoto：**  
We're from Caon, so don't try anything either!  
What're you doing around here at this time of night?!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hey, wait a minute.  
It's just our good pal  
{player}! ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh man, so it is.  
Come on, dude. What're you doing in a place like this?  
  
**Maho：**  
Y'all okay?  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh! It's my one and only prince!  
A good evening to you. ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I assume you're all familiar with this fellow?  
  
**Maho：**  
Gosh, Kasumi.  
You might be the only gal in Landosol that's never met him before.  
  
**Maho：**  
He's my darlin' prince.  
Came all the way from the ends of eternity just for  
li'l old me. ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Err...  
Fiction should be kept strictly within books, I say.  
  
**Maho：**  
Ehehe. ♪  
That's the thing, Kasumi.  
All it takes is one person's belief to turn fiction into nonfiction.  
  
**Maho：**  
So what brings my prince to a place like this, anyhow?  
Searchin' for a li'l fairy and its love-colored scales, mayhaps?  
  
**Maho：**  
If that's the case, then you oughtta be a bit more careful.  
Everyone knows that fairies should be kept safe in a nice, purdy cage. ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
For those who didn't quite catch that,  
I'm almost positive that she just told him to be more  
careful with where he puts his money.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I have to say, though.  
Our lovely guildmaster has quite the... flowery language at times.  
Though it's well within my ability to decipher it.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Anyway.  
How about you fill me in on the particulars, my boy.  
If anyone can help you find lost belongings, it's me.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Same here.  
I can amplify my sense of smell a few hundred thousand-fold for a while.  
Tracing your scent'll be easy.  
  
**Makoto：**  
So what did you drop, anyway?  
Assuming that's the issue here, of course.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hmm...  
Not really good at that sorta stuff myself,  
so I'll send you all some good and chill vibes. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
No dancing now, ya hear?  
Those mighty feet of yours  
might knock his belongings out of the country.  
Always appreciate your cheery support, though. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm... This *is* my prince we're talkin' about here, though.  
He's the sorta fella that could drop somethin' and watch as it  
rolls off into a portal to another dimension.  
  
**Maho：**  
Poor li'l prince of mine.  
Only the power of our eternal love  
can pull it back to this dimension. ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sorry. You lost me.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hmm. Wait, for real?  
This is a regular thing for you these days?  
Stuff like clothes and smaller belongings just  
vanish out of thin air?  
  
**Makoto：**  
One of your bags went missing today, too?  
 Man, this ain't good.  
We've been getting a bunch of reports like that recently.  
Since when did Landosol become some sorta den of crime?  
  
**Makoto：**  
There haven't been any casualties or anything at least,  
but I'm starting to get a real bad feeling about all this.  
Hey, Princess. It's about time we take action, don't you think?  
  
**Maho：**  
Aye.  
We've had awfully similar incidents in our own guildhouse, too.  
  
**Maho：**  
Even my lovely li'l lace-knit handkerchief just up and disappeared recently.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yeah...Same thing's been happening at my parents' place.  
A few customers started accusing each other and almost got into  
a scrap 'cause of it. Figured it was just them being clumsy, too.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hmm. These sorts of incidents have only been on the rise as  
of late, if I recall correctly. I'm starting to think there may be some  
connection between them and the appearance of Shadows.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
In fact, there's a clear link between when both started to  
become prominent. There's even plenty of reports of Shadows appearing  
near robbery sights nowadays.  
  
**Makoto：**  
So...  
It's the Shadows themselves that're stealing stuff,  
maybe?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The current theory is that they have no real will or any semblance of intelligence.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
If we follow that train of logic,  
then there's little reason to believe that they would be  
stealing anything with a purpose in mind.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Just because there's no purpose behind the action  
doesn't discount the possibility of them carrying it out, however.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hey!  
Mind if I butt in for a sec?  
  
**Makoto：**  
What is it?  
We're kinda trying to concentrate here.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha! Don't waste time on that.  
More importantly, there's a Shadow right over there.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Whoa! You're right!  
Those eyes of your are insane, Kaori.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sure looks like it's holding something, too.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh.  
That's what you were looking for, {player}?  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm...  
So it really was the Shadows going  
around and takin' people's belongings?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Still a bit too early to assume that, I'd say.  
Either way, let's catch this one for now.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Don't worry, {player}.  
We'll get your stuff back in no time. ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha! First come, first serve!  
You all have fun with thinking. I'll stick to physical labor!  
Hey-ho!  
  
**Maho：**  
Kaori!  
Don't go buck wild now, okay?  
Don't want to see you getting hurt.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That, plus we don't want to be the ones causing any issues in town.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
These Shadows truly are perplexing, though.  
They're treated as a species of monster,  
but something just feels incredibly... off about them.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And now they've even taken to a bit of light crime on the side, too.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You're the guildmaster, Maho.  
I'd like to suggest that we carry out a full-scale investigation  
before things develop for the worst.  
What say you?  
  
**Maho：**  
Aye. We'd be awfully foolish to leave it be.  
*sigh* Things sure have gotten strange around here, though.  
  
**Maho：**  
We'll hafta work real hard if we want life to go back to normal.  
Back to the days where strollin' didn't mean patrollin'.
