# Lucent Academy Episode 3
Misaki and Suzuna argue over who should teach {player} instead of naive, oblivious Io. While they both fail, Io is delighted to see both girls motivated to study harder so they'll be able to tutor him someday.
  
## Subtitle: Who Gets to Tutor?
  
**Narration：**  
It's been several days since {player} transferred into  
Lucent Academy. Another day, another class with Io.  
  
**Io：**  
Okay everyone, time's almost up.  
  
**Io：**  
Oh, {player}. You haven't made much progress.  
You look a little flushed, too. Are you feeling okay?  
  
**Io：**  
Let me check your temperature.  
I'll just put my forehead to yours, and...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Io!  
No taking temperature by touching foreheads.  
You're way too close to him!  
  
**Misaki：**  
No fair trying to seduce him! That's playing dirty!  
  
**Io：**  
Seduce? Dirty?  
What're you talking about?  
  
**Misaki：**  
You mean you're actually oblivious?  
Unreal. She's invincible...  
  
**Io：**  
Huh? What?  
Did I do something wrong?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I dunno, but that big brain of his isn't gonna be getting  
enough blood to be able to focus on his work  
 with you all  
nuzzled up on him like that.  
  
**Io：**  
No?  
 I was just trying to check if he had a fever.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Io, real talk. You're like, legit defenseless.  
When you lean over with that wide-open top on,  
everyone can see like, everything.  
  
**Io：**  
H-huuuh?! You can see them?  
Oh, geez, I'm so embarrassed!  
  
**Io：**  
But normal clothes are so tight in the chest,  
it hurts to wear them...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Are you freaking kidding? What's your problem?!  
You trying to pick a fight with me?!  
  
**Io：**  
No! Misaki, why are you getting mad at me?  
It's the truth.  
I was just trying to explain myself.  
  
**Misaki：**  
You *are* that oblivious!  
A sexy, ditzy, genuinely  
nice teacher. What an opponent…  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Okay, settle down, Misaki.  
You'll develop sooner or later.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Anyways, Io, with you next to him, whiz-boy can't concentrate.  
I don't mind teaching him, though!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Ha! Nice try, Suzuna!  
If she's tutoring you, so am I.  
  
**Io：**  
Umm. I don't know...  
Do you two really think you can teach?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Totally! We got this.  
 I'll go first!  
All right, I'll teach you your times tables.  
Repeat after me.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
One times one is seven...  
  
**Io：**  
You got the very first one wrong!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I-I just got a little tongue-tied is all.  
But if I just change  
to start from the sevens row, it works, right?  
  
**Io：**  
No, it's still wrong!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Listen whiz-boy, when it comes to multiplication,  
you gotta watch out for that sevens row!  
It's devil emoji hard!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
It's like, the last boss of the times tables.  
But once you whoop that bad dude,  
you've basically  
got the whole thing mastered!  
  
**Io：**  
Traditionally, we teach multiplication tables up to twelve...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Aww, man. Dude,  
seven is hard enough. Eight and nine are like,  
impossible! I still don't really get them.  
  
**Io：**  
Then you can't teach them.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Yeah, that's right, {player}.  
  
If you use that variable, the odds increase.  
  
**Io：**  
Oh, Misaki,  
are you teaching {player} statistics?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Nah.  
I'm educating him on an extracurricular subject.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Strategies for romance!  
  
**Misaki：**  
You listening? Like I was saying, you have to vary your  
approach and avoid laying it on thick every time.  
That's the way to increase your odds!  
  
**Io：**  
That subject's not in the curriculum.  
  
**Misaki：**  
B-but  
 I'm not good enough at any subject to be able to tutor  
people.  
  
**Misaki：**  
But it was still useful, right {player}?  
You got something out of it, didn't you?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I want a review, too!  
What'd you think of my times table lesson?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Y-yeah, they were... good.  
**Choice: (2)**  None of it made any sense.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misaki：**  
Why're you looking off to the side?  
You're totally lying.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzuna：**  
I see...  
Guess teaching's harder than it looks.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Misaki：**  
Rats.  
I guess we've gotta give up for today.  
Io, we'll leave the teaching to you.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Yeah, it's for the best.  
It'd be cool if I was  
smart enough to tutor you someday though, whiz-boy!  
  
**Misaki：**  
It would be cool.  
We'll have to study extra hard if we're gonna  
make that happen!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Makes sense. You gotta study lots and lots if you're gonna  
teach other people.  
All right, let's do our best, Misaki!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Right!  
I'll study like no one's ever studied before!  
  
**Io：**  
Aww. Look at how motivated they are now.  
I'm so happy to see them excited to learn.  
This is all thanks to you, {player}.  
  
**Narration：**  
Io smiled warmly at the sight of Suzuna and Misaki  
with their noses buried in their textbooks.
