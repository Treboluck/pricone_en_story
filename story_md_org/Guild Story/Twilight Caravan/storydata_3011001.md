**Narration：**  
Somewhere in the city of Landosol, a lone traveler  
walks down a street with several men in tow.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Wow... I'd heard this city was big, but they sure weren't kidding.  
I should be able to get plenty of info around here.  
  
**Young Man：**  
Why, hello there, miss. If you're hungry from your journey,  
why don't you come grab a bite with me?  
I'm great company, I promise.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh... Actually, I am somewhat hungry,  
but I'm afraid I'll  
have to decline your offer. I have business to attend to.  
  
**Injured Men：**  
Unghh... Urghhh...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh, these guys?  
Just a couple of fugitives I captured.  
Actually, do you know where I can turn them in for  
the bounty?  
  
**Young Man：**  
Uh... I think you might want the knights' station?  
Anyway, you seem busy, so I'll take a rain check on that lunch.  
  
**Ruka：**  
If it's meant to be, we'll meet again.  
...By the way, you have an interesting scent about you.  
It smells quite sweet and delicious...  
  
**Young Man：**  
Ha ha ha.  
Truth is, I just finished eating lunch myself.  
  
**Ruka：**  
You only just ate, and you asked me out anyway?  
  
You're a funny guy.  
Could you point me towards the restaurant you went to?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hmmm.  
I like the atmosphere of this place. I can't wait  
to see what they serve here!  
Those bounties fetched a  
pretty penny, so I may as well cut loose and eat my fill.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Say, my dear young lady.  
Would you mind if I use this seat?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Please, go ahead. Tell me, are you a regular?  
I'd be interested to hear what dish you recommend.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
That depends on what you like, but I'd recommend  
the pudding for dessert.  
I'm Mitsuki, by the way.  
Nice to meet you.  
  
**Ruka：**  
I'm Ruka. It's a pleasure.  
Pudding, you say? I've never  
had it before,  
but I'll save room for after. While we're talking,  
do you know any work around here that pays well?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Ahh, that's what you're really after?  
Well, there's work if you know where to look.  
I can tell from the looks of you that you're highly capable.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Well, that makes things relatively easy.  
So, what've you got?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Slow down.  
Let's get to know each other first.  
Myself, I'm a scientist by trade, but I play doctor on the side.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
And lately, people have been bringing in the oddest patients.  
All totally drained of stamina and magic.  
I was curious, so I  
looked into it, and it led me to a piece of magical equipment.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Magical equipment... As in weapons and such enhanced  
with magic, herbs, alchemy and so forth?  
I thought they were  
rare treasures that *boosted* magic and stamina.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Sadly, this one has quite the opposite effect.  
I searched one  
patient's home, and found a bracelet he'd bought on the black  
market.  
Advertised as boosting physical and magical skills...  
  
**Ruka：**  
...But instead, everyone who tried to use these items  
had an adverse reaction. And that's how they wound up as your  
patients?  
All right. So what do you want me to do?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I need you to find the people who are distributing them.  
These items seem to be made with medicinal herbs,  
so they could give my own herbal studies a bad name.  
  
**Ruka：**  
If that's all, you can consider it done.  
You can always count on me to see a job to completion—  
  
  
**???：**  
Heh heh heh... Hahahah... Hah hah hah hah!

**Stechpalm：**  
Your game is up, outlaw!  
It is I, Hecate of the Gale! Annerose  
von Stechpalm!  
Also known as Grand Regent of the Order of  
Gehenna Immortals!  
Surrender yourself to my cruel justice!  
  
**Ruka：**  
A bounty, in a place like this?  
Ah well, can't get distracted.  
Mitsuki, tell me the details.  
I want as much info as I can get before I start.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
We're likely dealing with someone who doesn't know this  
city's underbelly too well.  
I'd say our main lead is going to be  
the herbs they're using.  
These herbs have a very unique—  
  
`image display end`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Hey...! Quit ignoring me already!  
I was talking to you, stranger draped in outlandish garb!  
Look upon this \"Wanted\" scroll and despair!  
  
**Ruka：**  
I can't deny that does look like me.  
However, unfortunately for you, you've got the  
wrong person.  
I only just arrived in town today.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
You really call that an excuse? You're wanted for circulating  
magical equipment!  
 As long as I have this scroll in hand,  
you have no hope of escaping justice!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Easy there, girl.  
Why would I ever do a thing like that?  
  
Besides, like I said, I only just—  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
The time for talk is past!  
Perish in the clutches of my Flames of Purgatory!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Whoa there!  
I see you're the type who casts first and asks questions later.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Impressive, fiend!  
It takes skill to dodge my Raging Storm Deathflame Slash.  
However, I won't miss again!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Are we still doing this? Normally I'd take you out and  
be done with it, but let's at least leave the restaurant first.  
We're bothering the other customers.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
H-hey, wait up! How dare you run!  
Stand and fight, coward!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Anna, my dear, let me step in and help.  
If we're going to sort  
this out, I think we need to ask her a few questions.  
Of course, if she really is the culprit, we'll show no mercy.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh, come on. Now you're doubting me, too?  
Seriously...  
Isn't anyone around here interested in my side of the story?  
I never even heard about this magical equipment 'til just now.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I wouldn't say I completely doubt you.  
But if you wish to  
prove your innocence, would you mind accompanying me  
to Caon?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Nobody's going to trust me, huh?  
Good grief...  
Looks like I'll have to hightail it!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Whoa-oa-oa! That was close!  
...Ah! OMG! Crashing into a pretty  
girl running around the corner?! That's like Romcom 101!  
Shoot, all I'm missing is a piece of toast in my mouth!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Thus did the destined lovers first meet...  
So cliche!  
But that's the best part! And we're both girls, too,  
so bring on that yuri goodness!  
Wahey! Get hype!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Ehmm... I have no idea what you're saying,  
but I apologize. Excuse me—I'm in a rush.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Still running, are you?! Accept your fate!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ohohoh? It's Anna! What a co-winky-dink!  
I was coming to  
return that book you loaned me!  
You know, the one that's  
all about the mysterious secrets of ancient magical equipment?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Ah, my trusted ally Nanaka!  
A fortuitous arrival!  
That woman is an outlaw! Assist me in claiming her bounty!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Oh, noice! So that's our script.  
You got it!  
We'll split the reward 90-10!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
You only want ten percent?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Tsk, tsk, tsk. It's only natural that I,  
the totes adorbs ultimate magical girl Nanaka,  
should receive the ninety percent! You know it!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
That's way too much! At least make it, uhh...  
fifty-fifty?  
Thing is, I kinda bought way too many books this month,  
and now I can't pay my bills...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
...And as they bickered over the bounty,  
the target slipped away without a trace.  
⇦ To Be Continued!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Curses! I can't let her escape like this...  
We'll discuss the split later. For now, get after her!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Roger that, cap'n! Ka-shing!  
Wait, huh? Hang on, isn't that way...  
  
**Ruka：**  
A dead end, huh?  
Well, isn't that rotten luck.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Hah hah hah! You've dug your own grave, fugitive!  
Every last person in this city knows that this way leads  
to a dead end!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
\"Every last person\" might be a bit of an overstatement,  
but it is fairly well-known.  
Ruka, could I ask you to come quietly?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
...Hm? Hmmm? Hmmety hmm?  
Wait, now... Little Miss Outlaw... could it be...?  
All righty! Take this!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Alas! It seems my hand slipped,  
and my book with all  
that info about making magical equipment with herbs  
fell right at our fugitive's feet!  
  
**Ruka：**  
There we go.  
For a so-called \"slip of the hand\",  
you sure seemed to throw it with all your might...  
And with pinpoint accuracy in my direction, too.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Nanaka, you buffoon!  
Why'd you throw my book at the enemy?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Oh, you know how it is! To put it in your terms, I felt a...  
\"tingling in the fires of my soul,\" or something?  
Point is,  
if I'm not mistaken, this lady can't make magic equipment.  
  
**Ruka：**  
What's all this? What a bewildering book...  
I can't understand what it's talking about at all.  
I can read the words, but... Fusion...? Boiling...  
Atomizing?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...What can this mean?  
Isn't she the one making all that nefarious magical equipment?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Sorry, but you've been wasting your time.  
I can barely even use magic,  
let alone craft it into equipment.  
I've never even seen such an artifact.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Come to think of it, even sitting next to you, I sensed  
next to no magic power.  
So... You're really not the mastermind, then.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Are you mad, Mitsuki?! The scroll doesn't lie! She's an outlaw!  
And the wicked must face justice! Taste my ultimate magic!  
Behold! Evil Eye: Unleash! Geas Apocrypha, Tyrant Code: Set!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
That incantation... Anna, stop!  
Are you trying to wipe out the whole surrounding area?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Feel the full force of Hecate of the Gale's wrath!  
Eternal Abyss Divider!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Guess I have no choice. I really didn't want to draw my blade.  
Haaah!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Wha... Sh-she cut through my magic?! Impossible!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Slicing magic with a sword?!  
I am all about this!  
Ooohhh, you're the coolest!  
I'm saving that one and backing it up for later!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
This is no time for joking around.  
She's even stronger than I anticipated.  
If we're not careful, she'll obliterate all three of us.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Wipe that yellow streak from your back!  
I swear I will not yield! On my honor as Hecate of the Gale!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
C'mon now, Annie-girl. Every bounty hunter needs  
negotiation skills.  
What could be cooler than making a  
fugitive surrender without lifting a finger?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
F-fair point...! Fine, we'll do it your way.  
I suppose a peaceful resolution's not unacceptable.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Finished with your huddle?  
As I've been saying, I have nothing  
to do with this situation. But if you still insist on fighting,  
I'll take you on.  
What'll it be?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Have no fear, everyone.  
I can prove this stranger's innocence.  
  
**Ruka：**  
When did you—?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee.  
I've been standing here the whole time.  
Didn't you notice me?  
Let me introduce myself. My name is Eriko.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Nobody has ever crept up on me undetected before...  
Who, or what, are you?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Don't pay it much thought. I'm just an ordinary florist.  
Teehee...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Eriko,  
you say you can prove Ruka's innocence?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Indeed. I may have no evidence,  
but I can offer a solid defense.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Anna, that wanted poster you have was only just printed.  
However, Mitsuki and I have been hunting the culprit for some  
time.  
Our reagent-mixing book has been stolen once before.  
  
**Eriko：**  
The perpetrator stole it, and used its techniques in illicit ways.  
It was this assumption that led us to recruit Anna and Nanaka  
to help us achieve our goal of tracking down the culprit.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Yet before we could find our target, Anna was given a  
brand new wanted poster  
sending her after the traveler Ruka.  
Doesn't this all seem a little too convenient to anyone?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
So what you're suggesting is, the creator of that  
wanted poster is the real culprit.  
Am I correct?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Whoever they are, they got one over on all of us.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Given Ruka's lack of magical knowledge,  
that makes far more sense.  
Forgive my suspicion, Ruka.  
I've had reason to doubt others lately.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Me, I knew she was innocent from the start!  
When I first saw her, I thought,  
\"That's not the face  
of a criminal!\" Man, how awesome am I?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Whoa, whoa, wait a second!  
Sure, the scroll was an anonymous posting,  
but there's still zero evidence she's innocent!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Are you dissatisfied with my explanation?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Huh?  
No, it's just, uhhhhh...  
  
**Eriko：**  
*stare*  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
A-actually, never mind...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teeheehee.  
I'm glad we cleared up this little misunderstanding.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Good grief...  
Eriko, was it? You saved me lot of trouble.  
Thanks a lot.  
I really didn't think I'd get wrapped up in  
such a messy situation on my first day in the city.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Yikes. My stomach's growling now.  
Come to think of it, I never did get anything to eat, did I?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
After all the trouble we caused you,  
I'd be happy to treat you back at the restaurant!  
  
**Ruka：**  
*glug... glug...*  
Ahhhh...!  
So tell me. These magical bracelets.  
How're they made, exactly?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
The bracelets are just ordinary metal.  
They're cast in a  
magic circle, then quenched in water infused with herbs.  
The resulting artifact retains the herbs' distinctive scent.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Speaking of which, this is the herb in question.  
I thought it might come in useful, so I brought some with me.  
  
**Ruka：**  
*sniff* Hmm?  
For a medicinal herb, that's a very appetizing scent.  
...Wait a minute. This sweet scent seems familiar...  
  
**Young Man：**  
...H-huh?!  
What are you doing in here?  
  
**Ruka：**  
I know you... We met this afternoon.  
Weren't you the one who told me about this place?  
So I came here to eat. What's so strange about that?  
  
**Young Man：**  
W-well, yes, but you've got a...  
Actually, sorry, I've gotta be somewhere.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Now I remember!  
The scent of this herb...  
I smelled it on you when we met earlier!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
The same scent as the herb...  
Hey, handsome, I've got a few questions I'd like to ask you.  
  
**Eriko：**  
We'll need to make sure you're being honest...  
Luckily, I have a serum that should do the trick.  
Teeheehee...  
  
**Young Man：**  
...W-waaaghhh!  
Somebody help!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
He ran away!  
 Ah... Does this mean... That guy's the real culprit?!  
Everybody move! Don't let him escape!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Well then, shall we go apprehend the criminal  
and teach him a proper lesson?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Found him! Over there!  
  
**Young Man：**  
That was too easy.  
  
Now, boys, take those women out!  
  
**Minion 1：**  
Roger, bossman! You got it!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Could those be some real nasty-looking sorts I see  
lying ready and waiting for us?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
An ambush, eh? You're more cautious than you look.  
  
**Young Man：**  
How do you think I got away with it for this long?  
Playtime's over. Get 'em, boys!  
  
**Minion 1：**  
Heh heh heh...  
Hey boss, we can do whatever we want to 'em, right?  
I think I'll start with the little one!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee.  
You're awfully passionate. I like that in a man.  
But I'm afraid my heart already belongs to someone else.  
  
**Minion 1：**  
Ungh!  
  
![301100101.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/301100101.webp)  
**Minion 2：**  
How's that waif swinging that huge axe like it's nothing?  
H-hang on... Giant axe, creepy smile...  
Could she be... the strongest maniac in town? The Destroyer!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Heh heh heh! Look at all these new lab rats.  
I just developed a new potion, too. What luck!  
Perhaps I'll let my other \"eye\" out to play for once!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Hah hah hah! Your lives are forfeit, villains!  
Tremble at the name of Annerose von Stechpalm,  
Grand Regent of the Order of Gehenna Immortals, and—  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Kyuu-pi-ping! Pretty Nanaka, the world's cutest magical girl,  
is here to punish evil! If you've got any rare books, I'll give you  
an exclusive upgrade  
from Headbonk City to Sleepytime!  
  
**Minion 3：**  
It ain't even just the Destroyer?! That's the One-Eyed Devil...  
and Stechpalm, the \"Living Storm\"! And that last one,  
ain't she the \"Collector\"?!  
  
**Minion 2：**  
You're kiddin' me. Every one of 'em's a contender  
for the scariest psycho in town! F-forget it!  
I didn't sign up to fight these monsters!  
Run for it!  
  
`image display end`  
**Young Man：**  
Hey, hold it! Where're you going?  
Get back here!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Must be tough having such useless underlings.  
Now it's time for you to pay for trying to frame me.  
  
**Young Man：**  
Don't take me lightly! I've powered myself up with my own  
magical equipment! Eat this!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Good grief. I'm disappointed.  
You rely on fancy knickknacks,  
and this is still the best you can do?  
  
**Ruka：**  
This time, you're treating me to lunch for real.  
With the bounty on your head!  
  
**Young Man：**  
GUAAAARGH!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ahem... Well then!  
Here's to a case well solved! Cheers!  
  
**Everyone：**  
Cheers!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
We apprehended all the culprits, and destroyed their  
magic bracelets.  
And we owe it all to you, Ruka. Thank you!  
  
**Ruka：**  
My pleasure. I came out of this with a pocketful of  
bounty money, too!  
 I can never have too much  
in the way of funds for my travels.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Ah, of course. You stopped by here in the middle of  
a journey, right?  
Are you going somewhere in particular?  
  
**Ruka：**  
I don't suppose you've heard of the \"Twilight City\"?  
I'm on a search for a blade that was forged there.  
Go ahead  
and laugh. It's silly, someone my age believing in fairy tales.  
  
**Eriko：**  
...Well, well, well.  
Teeheehee...  
This can only be the work of destiny.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Destiny?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
You must swear not to let this intel reach the Syndicate's ears,  
but actually, we're searching for the Twilight City too!  
So I would never laugh! The Twilight City exists for sure!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
See, the four of us all met during our own searches for info  
on the Twilight City!  
And now we have a new party member?  
Like, whaaat? That's the hypest thing I ever heard!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
A new party member...  
That sounds wonderful! Now that  
we're five, why don't we form our own guild?  
It'll make info-  
gathering much smoother, and help with our work, to boot!  
  
**Ruka：**  
A guild, huh?  
I like the sound of that. I was thinking I might  
stay in this city for a while anyway, and I'd be thrilled at the  
chance to get more information.  
You can count me in.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Heh... You require my untold abilities?  
Then what choice do I have?  
Hecate of the Gale will lend you her forbidden powers!  
  
**Eriko：**  
I'm on board as well. I hope this works out for all of us.  
By the way, who's going to function as our guildmaster?  
  
**Ruka：**  
That's a good question...  
Wait, hold on a second.  
Why are all of you staring straight at me?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Well, y'see, we're all the most infamous troublemakers in  
Landosol! Pretty sure none of us have what it takes to be  
guildmasters, or lead a formal group!  
It's gotta be you, Ruka!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Nanaka hit the nail on the head.  
We've all got our reasons.  
I'm an underground doctor, Eriko's a bodyguard,  
Anna's a bounty hunter.  
We can't just openly form a guild.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Wait a second, did you say underground doctor?!  
I never heard anyone mention that!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Didn't I tell you?  
Of course it was only ne'er-do-wells  
who'd be using those bracelets! In exchange for finding  
the culprit, I made them agree to be my guinea pigs!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Good grief... I see there's a lot more to all of you  
than I first thought.  
But it is what it is. Very well, then.  
I'll be your guildmaster!
