The group deals with cursed vases that summon terrible archfiends. With {player}'s help, they resolve the turmoil, and discover the now-deceased culprit learned the summoning spell from someone from the Twilight City.
  
## Subtitle: Archfiends in Vases
  
**Narration：**  
The members of Twilight Caravan are gathered for a  
routine guild meeting.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Another day without a single new lead on the Twilight City...  
Anything else to report?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Heh heh heh! Finally, the time has come to reveal  
the secrets concealed in my past!  
Listen well—  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Allow me to interpret, because I speak Anna!  
\"I've got one little tidbit! Yesterday, me and Nanaka  
caught a weaselly scam artist! ♪\"  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Nanaka? Are you doing this on purpose?  
Ahem!  
We subjugated a foul swindler peddling counterfeit artworks  
to wealthy magnates for obscenely inflated prices!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
\"Oh, and there was one little vase the scammer held on to  
until we finally caught him.  
Since it's just a silly fake, we thought we'd keep it as a little memento!\"  
 And that's a wrap!  
  
**Eriko：**  
You say \"little\" vase, but it's a bit large for your  
average flowers...  
  
**Ruka：**  
It's only a fake. So it's got no real value, right?  
Best to either sell it for whatever you can get,  
or else just throw it out.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Aww, why? There's no need to dispose of it.  
I have herbs that would fit it perfectly, so why don't I take it?  
It's just what I've been looking for!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Please, go ahead! If you want it, it's all yours!  
Every square inch of my room's full of books,  
so I've got nowhere to put it.  
How about you, Anna?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
My hoard of treasures and dwelling in this world  
is in a similar state.  
Do with it as you will!  
In fact, I would be most grateful if you would take it!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Don't mind if I do.  
It's a little big to carry home myself, though.  
  
**Eriko：**  
I'll help you to transport it.  
I was hoping to discuss a few points with you  
about our latest sleep potion formula anyway.  
  
**Ruka：**  
That sounded much more sinister than it should have,  
but ah well. Meeting adjourned!  
Thanks for another great week, everybody!  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day, at Eriko's request, the guild gathers at  
the restaurant. They find Eriko with an uncharacteristically  
troubled look on her face.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Everyone... Thank you all for coming on such short notice.  
  
**Ruka：**  
This is pretty sudden. What's going on?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Hang on, we're missing someone.  
Unless... the enemy is confounding our minds?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Nope, I think you're right, Anna.  
Mitsuki's not here yet.  
Eriko, did you forget to call her?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Actually, Mitsuki's absence is the topic at hand.  
Everyone,  
please listen and remain calm.  
Yesterday, I found Mitsuki  
unconscious in her house. She seems to have been attacked.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Are you sure?!  
It's hard to imagine some random assailant  
getting the better of Mitsuki.  
  
**Eriko：**  
I went home after delivering the vase, then returned to find  
her knocked out. The room was also in disarray, so I took her to a safe clinic just in case.  
She had just awakened when I left.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
There can be no doubt... This is the Syndicate's doing!  
Are they plotting to eliminate the Darkest Knights  
once and for all?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
If you're right, we're in deep doo-doo!  
Oh, but wait,  
if that was true, you'd be their only target. Nope, methinks  
it's someone else!  
But who would attack Mitsuki?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Whoever it is, we've got to take our revenge.  
Otherwise, Mitsuki won't be able to rest in peace.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
How very rude! I'm not dead yet!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Mitsuki?!  
Should you be up and moving?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I'm fine. I had a little fainting spell and collapsed, that's all.  
After my rest in the hospital, I'm as good as new.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
We were worried that someone ambushed you!  
So this was just a farce where Eriko had the wrong idea?  
  
**Eriko：**  
No... This is no simple misunderstanding.  
Before entering Mitsuki's house, I clearly sensed a presence.  
But once inside, nobody was to be seen but Mitsuki herself.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Of course not.  
Nobody lives there right now but little old me.  
Why didn't you say anything when we talked just now?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Well, you being you, I thought you might be holding  
a \"guinea pig\" prisoner for a new experiment.  
In which case, it would be rude of me to pry!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
...You do have a point!  
Thank you for being so considerate. ♪  
  
**Ruka：**  
That is not an acceptable answer!  
Good grief, don't any of you have any common sense?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Common sense in this guild is rarer than an SSR  
in a single-pull!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Hecate of the Gale does not abide by the feeble laws  
of the mortal realm!  
  
**Ruka：**  
...Right. Of course.  
At any rate, if Eriko's right about this, Mitsuki could be  
attacked again. We need to be proactive.  
  
**Eriko：**  
In that case, I could stay at Mitsuki's house for awhile.  
If the same presence appears again, I'll be able to  
sense it coming.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
That would be most appreciated.  
I'm sorry to impose.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Now then...  
I was a little worried, so I came to Mitsuki's street, but...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Looks like we all had the same idea! Obvs!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
W-worry? Not I!  
I was training my stealth capabilities  
to better evade the Syndicate's agents.  
I just *happened* to pass by here by sheer coincidence!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Aww, Annie-girl.  
You're such a little tsundere, ell-oh-ell!  
I can't get enough of you! Lemme pinch those cheeks!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I... I'm deathly serious!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Damn it, are we too late?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
It seems my time to shine has come!  
Any villain who dares harm my allies  
will feel the heat of my Flames of Purgatory!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
R-running ahead alone? Talk about a death flag!  
Now I'm predicting three victims tonight!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Enough jokes!  
We have to follow her!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Mitsuki, Eriko!  
Are you all right?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Ruka? Thank goodness.  
I can't believe I'm saying this, but this one's too much  
for just the two of us.  
  
**Ruka：**  
A threat too great for even you to handle?  
Who in the world—  
  
**???：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Ruka：**  
What in the world is that?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I can't even... Is that an archfiend?!  
Wait, wait, wait!  
How'd something that dangerous get summoned in the  
middle of town?! Mitsuki, Eriko, deets pls!  
  
**Eriko：**  
I have no idea.  
It just lunged out from the vase.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
The vase we retrieved from the swindler?  
It can't be true!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Huh? Does that mean... it's all our fault?  
I'm innocent! I'm exercising my right to remain silent  
until I speak with my lawyer!  
  
**Archfiend：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Ugh!  
We can't let that thing rampage one second longer.  
Everyone, attack together and take it out!  
  
**Archfiend：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
The vase shattered.  
I guess because we defeated the  
archfiend that it summoned?  
  
**Ruka：**  
I don't know what the story was with that vase,  
but that's Mitsuki's attacker taken care of, right?  
Then I'd say this case is closed.  
Good work, everyone.  
  
**Narration：**  
The morning after vanquishing the archfiend,  
the members of Twilight Caravan ask {player}  
to meet them at the restaurant.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Looks like we can't call this case closed just yet.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Guildmaster! We've gotten word that other archfiends  
just like the one we beat last night are rampaging  
all over town!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Wherever one appeared, a vase was present as well.  
We've confirmed the destruction of all vases sold in  
this district,  
but we can't let our guard down yet.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
The counterfeits that the swindler was peddling, huh...  
They must have had a fearsome curse  
to summon archfiends of that level.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
\"Awesome! A surprise subquest!\"  
 ...is what I'd normally say,  
but I'm legit shocked that the vase really was cursed.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Our guild's been hired to find the source of the curse  
and prevent any further incidents. {player},  
I'd like to ask for your help.  
Don't worry, I'll pay your share.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's find the culprit together.  
**Choice: (2)**  I want to make sure you're all safe.  
`Tag 1`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Splendid! My comrade Sigurd! So we fight side by side!  
This takes me back... Remember the day we stood together  
to battle the Immortals of Eisenberg?!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Ruka：**  
You really are  a nice guy. I certainly appreciate your  
saying that, but if you're helping, I hope you'll take your  
share of the reward.  
I won't take no for an answer, okay?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Eriko：**  
Ahhhh... With my beloved offering his assistance,  
we'll have this little distraction resolved in no time!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Well then, shall we get to work immediately?  
Once we find the true creator of these counterfeits,  
I'll gladly punish them until they swear off villainy forever...!  
  
**Ruka：**  
...A-anyway, let's split up and see what info we can find.  
Good luck out there, everyone!  
  
**Narration：**  
The group splits into two teams.  
{player} goes with Nanaka and Anna  
to search for bounties related to the counterfeit vase scheme.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
This is Nanaka, on the scene.  
We are currently  
investigating to see if there are any active bounties  
on people who could be behind the vase situation.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Wrongdoers can never truly escape their crimes.  
Something similar to this must have happened before!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Brilliant deduction, Master Detective Anna!  
  
Your loyal assistants are here to support your search.  
  
We'll find a clue and crack this case yet!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Lead the way, Detective Anna!  
**Choice: (5)**  You're a master detective?  
`Tag 4`  
**Stechpalm：**  
E-enough flattery!  
But yes, have faith.  
Hecate of the Gale, wielder of the all-seeing Evil Eye,  
shall use her powers to unravel this mystery!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Not in my previous life, but in an earlier one, yes!  
...I mean it!  
...Really! I'm not kidding!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Nanaka：**  
Detective Anna, {player},  
I'm counting on the both of you!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hmm? Hmmm?  
Holy heck, I just found a super duper clue-per!  
Look, right here!  
Check out this wanted poster, you two!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Let me see...  
Suspected of trafficking counterfeit artwork...  
Wanted dead or alive...  
This was first put out over ten years ago.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
So they were never caught!  
This is S-U-S, extremely sus!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
So you see, we all agreed  
it's worth pulling on that thread  
and seeing where it leads.  
  
**Ruka：**  
I see. We found some leads of our own as well.  
I still can't believe you know the people who operate  
the city's black market...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Really? This request came from less-than-respectable types  
too, you know?  
Anyway, we met with the scam artist you two  
turned in.  
Looks like those vases were all made by one man.  
  
**Eriko：**  
They call him... the Maestro.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
You don't think he could be...  
the same guy as the one on the scroll we dug up?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Well, if we want to find him, we can just follow  
the vases' trail, starting with the sellers.  
  
Now that we've got a plan, let's get back to it!  
  
**Antiques Dealer：**  
Ehhh?! I dunno who you're talking about.  
Now get lost! Window-shoppers ain't allowed in—  
  
**Eriko：**  
You mustn't tell lies.  
  
**Antiques Dealer：**  
Guerkhh!  
A-all right! I'll talk, I'll talk!  
I'll tell you about the Maestro, so please don't kill me!  
I just bought those vases from a guy I know, I swear!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
What should we do with him?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Sorry if my friend was rough.  
But if you'd only told the truth from the beginning,  
it would've been a lot less painful.  
 Nanaka, patch him up.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Aye aye, ma'am!  
Okie dokie, now hold nice and still!  
History's cutest magical girl, Pretty Nanaka,  
knows how to heal a thing or two!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Now, try taking a whiff of this.  
It'll help you to forget everything you've just been through.  
The pain you felt, the details you told us... everything!  
  
**Antiques Dealer：**  
Uhh... What... was I just...?  
Who're... you guys, again?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee.  
I see our new aroma formula works perfectly.  
Now, shall we head to our next destination?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Suffer the frigid hells of absolute zero!  
Cocytus Vein!  
  
**Bandit：**  
NGHHAAAHH! I-I can't move a muscle!  
That dirtbag... He must've sung like an Alto Bird!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Heh heh heh! Oh, he sang, all right.  
Sang the rhapsody of his death rattle!  
And now you're going to sing for me, too!  
  
**Ruka：**  
I should warn you, my friends don't know how to hold back.  
Now, tell us where to find the Maestro. We'd rather avoid  
getting any rougher with you than we have to.  
  
**Bandit：**  
Damn you...!  
All right, already.  
He lives up in the mountain town.  
In a dilapidated old ruin of a shack. You can't miss it.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Was that so hard?  
Let's go, guys!  
By the way, Anna, how did you know what he meant  
by \"sung like an Alto Bird\"?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Ruffians like that use the word \"sing\" to refer to  
giving up information.  
 The way you used it against him  
was marvelous!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Y-  
yes, of course! The dirty parlance of common  
ruffians is no barrier to me!  
...I'd better write that one down in my grimoire later...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Are you sure this is really the place?  
I can barely see a soul around.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Indeed...  
Oh, wait. There's a little girl over there.  
  
**Girl：**  
Hello!  
Wow, not many people come all the way here.  
Are you here to visit Grandpa's grave?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Grave?  
  
**Girl：**  
Grandpa said if anyone ever comes looking for him,  
I should give them this letter. Here!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
...It's from the Maestro!  
It looks like he dreamed of becoming a famous sculptor.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
But all of his creations were derided as knockoffs of past  
works.  
 After being rejected one too many times, he found  
his skills were better suited to making actual counterfeits.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
But his fakes weren't just ordinary copies.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
No. They were cursed.  
In exchange for giving up his soul after death,  
he gave them the power to summon archfiends.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
That would explain why such a great number of archfiends  
appeared in the city.  
He spent a decade offering his soul to  
countless demons, to bring chaos to the world after his death.  
  
**Eriko：**  
It must have been a kind of revenge for him.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
But it looks like he regretted his choices in the end.  
\"I know I was wrong. Someone... anyone.  
Please destroy everything I've created.\"  
  
**Ruka：**  
That's human nature.  
Right before the curse activated, he lost his nerve.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
He repented at the very end, but alas, it was too late!  
  
Sounds like some kind of final boss!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Good grief... Sounds like another job.  
Who else is there to fulfill his  
request but us?  
 Let's smash every last one of his tainted creations!  
  
**Narration：**  
Ruka and the group spent the next several days  
traveling across the land, destroying the Maestro's works.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
*pant* *wheeze*  
Th... That was... a HECK of a lot... of cursed vases.  
The Maestro was a fearsome foe indeed.  
  
**Eriko：**  
We've learned the hard way how popular his art was,  
fake or otherwise.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Everyone did an awesome job,  
but I'm afraid I've got some bad news!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
We went back and found this journal in the Maestro's home.  
When I got to the part about the curse, it said...  
Drumroll!  
\"It was taught to me by a traveler from the Twilight City!\"  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
The Twilight City?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
You're kidding me!  
If only he was still alive,  
we could've questioned him about its whereabouts...  
  
**Eriko：**  
We seem to have missed a huge opportunity.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
No need to get so gloomy and blue about it!  
There's good news as well. That little girl we met in the  
mountain town gave us this!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh...? Now *that* certainly is a beautiful vase.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
This nose of mine smells a whiff of treasure!  
Could it be a priceless artifact?!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I doubt it'll fetch a high price, no.  
This vase was made by  
the Maestro in his youth. According to the journal, it's the  
last piece he created before turning to forgeries.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Is that true? Its style is so creative. I've never seen  
anything quite like it...  
Not a drop of magic in it, either!  
It's simply a beautiful work of art.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Well, I'll be. So you could make real art after all.  
Rest in peace, Maestro. You never had to make counterfeits.  
You were a true artist.  
  
**Narration：**  
Mitsuki placed the Maestro's vase on display in her home,  
where it now attracts lots of compliments from her guests.
