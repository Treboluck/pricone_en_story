**Matsuri：**  
Aaahhhhh!  
It's finally here! The day of the festival we've all been waiting for! ☆  
  
**Matsuri：**  
C'mon, Tomo! Hurry up!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
The hero show's gonna start without us!  
We gotta get the best seats, and quick!  
Ahhhh, I hope I can get one right next to the stage!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Then there's a chance I might be one of the chosen ones  
who get called onto the stage to play a hostage kid or something!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Even if I don't, I'll get to see Jun do battle  
all up close and personal! ☆  
  
**Tomo：**  
You'll fall over if you rush, Matsuri.  
  
**Tomo：**  
And please don't tug on me like that.  
There's plenty of time, and the stage won't run away.  
I already got tickets for the best seats in the house.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Besides which, the hero show doesn't exactly  
attract a packed audience.  
  
**Tomo：**  
The world's been at peace for a long time.  
Even we members of Nightmare haven't experienced  
a real battle in quite a while.  
  
**Tomo：**  
So there's not much demand for these things.  
Once upon a time, they may have been a grand spectacle,  
but today's hero shows are just a way to keep kids entertained.  
  
**Tomo：**  
There'll be plenty of space wherever you want to sit.  
So calm down and be a good girl, would you?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Roger that!  
I wouldn't have these tickets if it weren't for you!  
So I'll do whatever you say!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Seriously, thanks a bunch for inviting me today!  
I appreciate it!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Well, it's a perk of the job... To be honest, we had tickets going to waste.  
There were only so many I could sell to friends,  
so I bought a couple myself.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'm glad you know how to say your thank-yous.  
Good girl, good girl!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Uwehh?!  
Hey—hands off the head!  
The head's off-limits!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahh...  
Why is it that the more you complain,  
the more I want to pat it? ♪  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Stoooop! Injections and headpats are my weaknesses!  
Hero's Code, Rule the Thirteenth!  
\"Every hero has a weak point!\"  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh...?  
What would mine be, I wonder?  
Well, I suppose I'm not ready to call myself a hero just yet.  
  
**Tomo：**  
...Hmm?!  
  
**Jun：**  
...  
  
**Christina：**  
Captain!  
What's all this fun you're having here?!  
Why didn't you invite me to join you?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Be it war, revolution or senseless slaughter,  
I will lend you my aid in any endeavor!  
  
**Christina：**  
As long as you keep me entertained, I am yours to command!  
  
**Christina：**  
That was our agreement when you asked me to stay  
as your guest in the ranks of Nightmare!  
  
**Christina：**  
But if you bore me too much, I will gladly tear your ambitions apart!  
Ahahahahah! ☆  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ohhh?!  
What's going on there? Someone's going on a rampage!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
D-did the hero show already start without us?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
No... This is no show!  
That madwoman... What is she thinking?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Those attacks are no feints!  
Is she trying to stain this festival with blood?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I know her... That's the villainess-looking woman  
who's always in the Nightmare guardhouse for some reason!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Does she have a part in today's hero show as well?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Just so you know, she's a member of Nightmare.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Though she certainly doesn't seem the \"justice\" type,  
so I don't like to think of her as a guildmate either.  
  
**Tomo：**  
You stay right here, Matsuri.  
...Captain Jun! Allow me to aid you!  
  
**Jun：**  
No need for that.  
  
**Jun：**  
The audience is already seated.  
Tomo, my dear... I mean, Tomo, head to the stalls  
and ensure that no harm comes to them.  
  
**Jun：**  
If worst comes to worst, you must lead the evacuation.  
  
**Christina：**  
Taking me lightly, are you?  
Surely the worst has already come to the worst!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah!  
Isn't this fun?! Just look at the children's faces!  
  
**Christina：**  
See them despair as the forces of absolute justice they believed in  
are effortlessly trampled beneath my feet!  
  
**Christina：**  
Let me teach you a lesson, my dear little ones!  
There are no absolutes in this world!  
  
**Christina：**  
I have sought after them for a long time now,  
but I have yet to find hide nor hair of a single one!  
  
**Jun：**  
Absolutes do exist.  
You need not search, for they are present all around us.  
  
**Jun：**  
So please, do not look so forlorn...  
My dear Chris.  
  
**Christina：**  
The only ones allowed to call me \"Chris\"  
are my closest friends!  
  
**Christina：**  
Tell me, are you willing to become a friend of mine?  
  
**Christina：**  
Of course not! Who would befriend a twisted woman like me?!  
  
**Christina：**  
It's \"absolutely\" unthinkable!  
So if you won't be my friend, at least become my enemy!  
  
**Jun：**  
You see? Even you believe in absolutes, deep down.  
So please, calm yourself.  
  
**Jun：**  
Because justice will always prevail.  
  

---  
  
**Christina：**  
...Ohh?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Brilliant!  
Vice-Captain Christina, with her powers of Absolute Offense  
and Absolute Defense, can evade any attack.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I've never landed a clean strike on her,  
in training or in the field!  
  
**Tomo：**  
But that's exactly why...  
Our captain, Jun, cleverly lured Christina onto a wooden box  
on the stage, then kicked it out from beneath her!  
  
**Tomo：**  
If she herself isn't the attack's target, she can't dodge!  
She's not invulnerable!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Still, such an attack requires impeccable timing!  
Thanks to her finely-honed experience,  
Jun was able to identify and seize the perfect moment!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Simply masterful!  
I still have so much left to learn from that captain of ours!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Whoaaaa!  
That's awesome! The coolest!  
True heroes really can do anything!  
  
**Christina：**  
Tch...  
What's this? I'm the villain now?  
  
**Christina：**  
Dear me...  
I did think our captain was the only one putting up a fight...  
Could it be this is some kind of staged farce?  
  
**Jun：**  
It is a hero show.  
One of the duties we must fulfill,  
to protect the children's hopes and dreams.  
  
**Jun：**  
If you wouldn't mind, I would appreciate your help.  
My dear Chris.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmph. As if I could play the hero.  
You can leave me out of your precious little games.  
  
**Christina：**  
Well, the moment's over.  
I'll let you have  
your pointless fun for today.  
  
**Christina：**  
But watch your step on the streets after dark!  
That dirty trick won't work on me a second time!  
  
**Jun：**  
...Phew.  
Thank goodness she was willing to withdraw.  
  
**Jun：**  
That woman is a little too strong.  
It's a constant struggle just keeping her in check.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Jun! You really are the greatest!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Not only did you repel Christina's attack,  
you incorporated it into the hero show too!  
A perfect performance! You have my applause!  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm... Do you think so?  
As you can see, my role is that of an \"evil dark knight\".  
  
**Jun：**  
You see—I look quite the villain, do I not?  
  
**Jun：**  
But the other Nightmare members playing the hero roles  
couldn't stand up to Chris in the slightest.  
She defeated them all in an instant...  
  
**Jun：**  
So I had no choice but to step up and defeat her myself.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Whaaaa?! Ah, you're right!  
There are people in hero costumes collapsed all over the stage!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Wh-what does that mean  
for the hero show? Will it have to be cancelled?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ehhh?! We can't have that!  
It'll be months before the next one comes around!  
  
**Jun：**  
Yes, you're right...  
Tomo, my dear, could you take the stage?  
  
**Jun：**  
You look the part of a gallant hero of justice...  
And you have the skills to improvise the role, do you not?  
  
**Jun：**  
Starting today, your name is Tiger White! ☆  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Whoaa! The birth of a brand-new hero!  
It's an honor to be present at this historic moment! ☆  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ehhhh...?  
Well, I suppose I could...  
This is part of our duties, after all.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Still, though...  
I have a long way to go before I can call myself  
a real hero of justice.  
  
**Tomo：**  
When Christina attacked, I could barely do anything but watch.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I apologize in advance if my imperfect skills cause any issues...
