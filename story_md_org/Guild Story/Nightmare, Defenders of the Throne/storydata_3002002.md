**Jun：**  
All knights, attention!  
  
**Jun：**  
We are already within the monsters' territory.  
Investigate the area with the utmost care.  
  
**Jun：**  
These caverns are an entirely different beast  
from the city where we usually operate.  
  
**Jun：**  
Think back to your training, and consider your actions carefully.  
  
**Jun：**  
Prioritize your own safety and that of your comrades,  
and if you encounter hostile monsters, be sure to engage them  
only with a numerical advantage.  
  
**Jun：**  
Remember, there is no need to kill all the monsters.  
We need only find their queen and eliminate it.  
  
**Jun：**  
If the mission becomes too perilous, we will need to regroup,  
so be sure to prepare a path of retreat.  
  
**Jun：**  
That concludes our briefing.  
I wish you luck on the mission!  
  
**Jun：**  
...Phew.  
I must confess delivering speeches like this  
is not exactly my forte.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahaha.  
You did a great job, Captain Jun!  
  
**Jun：**  
Thank you. Though of course, we have only just arrived here,  
and the mission lies ahead of us, so this is no time for rest.  
  
**Jun：**  
The real challenge awaits.  
Let us gather our spirits and accomplish what we came to do.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Roger!  
I'm feeling ready for some action!  
Yaaay! Finally I get to go on my first real mission! ☆  
  
**Tomo：**  
You weren't actually invited, were you, Matsuri?  
Honestly, can't you learn to follow instructions?  
  
**Tomo：**  
As your officially assigned supervisor,  
your actions are my responsibility too, you know...  
  
**Jun：**  
Ah well...  
Though she is still but an apprentice,  
young Matsuri is a member of Nightmare.  
  
**Jun：**  
Not a citizen for us to protect, but a comrade to rely on.  
We cannot keep her away from all forms of danger.  
  
**Jun：**  
We must allow her to gain experience,  
so she may grow into her role.  
  
**Jun：**  
This mission is not especially perilous,  
so you might call it a valuable opportunity for her.  
  
**Tomo：**  
You're always soft on children, Jun...  
  
**Tomo：**  
It's still dangerous here, you know.  
Next time, you should at least consult me first.  
I won't dismiss you out of turn, Matsuri.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Roger that!  
I appreciate your consideration!  
I'm sorry for my disobedience!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Are you really, though?  
Still, now that we've come all the way down here,  
it's not like I can ask you to run along home.  
  
**Tomo：**  
We're not here to play around, you know.  
I hope you're ready to act with extreme care.  
  
**Jun：**  
You're hardly brimming with experience  
at missions like this yourself, are you, Tomo?  
You're both still new recruits, so let's be cautious.  
  
**Jun：**  
I'm counting on you to take good care of young Matsuri.  
  
**Jun：**  
You can be surprisingly hotheaded yourself,  
but I'm sure you won't make any rash moves  
when you have a charge to protect.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Yes, yes...  
Lately, this seems to be all I do...  
It's like I'm a mother now.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Mommy!  
Look, look! There's flowers blooming in this passage!  
  
**Tomo：**  
You call that being cautious?  
And hang on. I'm definitely not your \"mommy\", Matsuri.  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm?  
Hold on. What did you just say?  
  
**Jun：**  
In an underground labyrinth far from the sun's rays,  
there are flowers blooming? Does that not seem strange?  
  
**Tomo：**  
I suppose some seeds brought by monsters from outside  
must have grown using magical energy...  
  
**Tomo：**  
In other words, the monsters that use this passage  
have a route to the world above?  
  
**Tomo：**  
You may be onto something, Matsuri.  
This passage could be a part of the main route used  
by the monsters we were sent to take care of!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hmm?  
Hang on, I don't really know the details yet.  
What kind of monsters are we actually looking for?  
  
**Tomo：**  
They're a mutant breed of insect monster.  
Not too strong individually, but they swarm in huge numbers.  
  
**Tomo：**  
They've been invading the town nearby and stealing people's food,  
so they're proving quite the nuisance.  
  
**Tomo：**  
It looks like their nest lies somewhere in this cave system.  
So the local residents hired us to come and eradicate them.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Uerghh... Bug monsters?  
I'm not too great with bugs... They're so creepy!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But if they're evil monsters,  
someone's gotta take 'em all out, right?  
  
**Jun：**  
No, we need only force them to leave.  
Our duty at Nightmare is to protect the peace of the city.  
  
**Jun：**  
So we take only those measures necessary to keep the city safe.  
  
**Jun：**  
According to our reconnaissance,  
it seems the monsters in question function similarly to a beehive,  
with the entire population serving a single queen monster.  
  
**Jun：**  
If we can take care of the queen,  
the remaining monsters will disperse...  
or so the theory goes.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So we beat up the boss, and that's the end of that, huh?  
Sounds nice and simple!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Let's hope it actually goes that smoothly.  
  
**Tomo：**  
...Well, well, we may have hit the jackpot.  
There's a cave just beyond this passage,  
and I'm sensing something strange inside.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ah—you're right!  
There's this really sweet smell...  
Makes me feel kind of hungry!  
  
**Jun：**  
...Hmm.  
Tomo, I'd like you to round up the other guild members.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Understood.  
Though communication magic isn't reliable this deep down,  
and we can't use smoke signals...  
  
**Tomo：**  
And using loud noises like a horn around here  
could easily cause a cave-in...  
So getting in touch could be tricky.  
  
**Jun：**  
Ah well.  
There's not much use complaining.  
Let's work with the hand we've been dealt.  
  
**Jun：**  
No matter the situation, we do what we can.  
First of all, I'll go ahead and scout out the situation inside.  
  
**Jun：**  
I won't make any moves until reinforcements arrive,  
but try to gather the others as quickly as you can.  
  
**Jun：**  
Young Matsuri, you can come with me.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Roger that!  
I won't let you down, Captain!  
  
**Jun：**  
...Good. I'll trust in your words.  
  
**Jun：**  
The ground is uneven, so be careful not to trip.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Got it!  
Eheheh... I really appreciate how you all  
keep looking out for me!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But that's why I've gotta do everything I possibly can  
to help you all out!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hero's Code, Rule the Third!  
\"One for all, and all for one!\"  
  
**Jun：**  
Quiet, now.  
We're about to enter the cave.  
The queen monster is just ahead.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Whoaaaa...  
Look at that thing—it's huge!  
Is that the enemy boss?  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm?  
Young Matsuri, are my eyes deceiving me all of a sudden?  
  
**Jun：**  
It looks to me as though that monster is holding an egg  
with a certain young {player} inside it.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wha...?  
Oh! You're right!  
That's totally him!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
What could he be doing inside an egg?  
Hey, {player}!  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmmm...  
From the looks of it, the monster may be using him  
as a source of nutrients for its young.  
  
**Jun：**  
I see pieces of meat and fish and various other foods  
embedded in the egg alongside him.  
  
**Jun：**  
If we leave him be, he will be drained of his vitality  
and perish in this den of monsters.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Th-that sounds pretty bad!  
We gotta save him!  
  
**Jun：**  
Indeed.  
However, the question is how.  
  
**Jun：**  
The egg containing young {player}  
is firmly in that great monster's grip.  
  
**Jun：**  
If we directly attack the beast, it might well cause him injury.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hmmm...?  
So what, that thing's holding him hostage?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Should I sneak up real close  
and rescue {player} before it notices?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'm pretty small, you know, so it probably wouldn't notice me!  
  
**Jun：**  
No, that may not be an option.  
It seems the enemy has already noticed our presence.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wha...?!  
Wh-wh-whoa! Where'd all these little monsters come from?!  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm.  
They are the same species...  
  
**Jun：**  
I suppose if that boss is the \"queen bee\",  
that would make these its royal soldiers.  
Loyal knights in service to their monarch, as it were.  
  
**Jun：**  
We too have our position as knights to uphold.  
It seems we may have to face them in battle  
with our knightly honor on the line.  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha... This is like something out of a children's story.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Is this the time to be chuckling about it?!  
More and more of them are closing in!  
  
**Jun：**  
Fall back, young Matsuri.  
For the moment, I will face them.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Whoa—you're too cool!  
Captain Jun, you're taking down so many of them!  
  
**Jun：**  
They are not especially strong monsters.  
However, I fear we are outnumbered nonetheless.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'll help you fight!  
Hiyaaahhhhh...! ☆  
  
**Tomo：**  
Captain Jun!  
I brought the other Nightmare members!  
Let me fight as well!  
  
**Jun：**  
Excellent timing, my dear Tomo.  
  
**Jun：**  
...For the moment, could you lend me your intellect?  
It seems young {player} has been captured by our foes.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Huh? Whoa, you're right!  
  
**Tomo：**  
What the heck does he think he's doing?  
Ahahah... He always does take me by surprise!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Still, this is a problem.  
With {player} in the way,  
we can't really attack the queen.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
That big old bug knows the greatest tactic to foil a hero!  
Hostages are a real brain-stumper to deal with!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Cutting down the enemy, {player} and all,  
isn't exactly an appealing option.  
  
**Tomo：**  
If we were to only succeed in our mission thanks to his  
noble sacrifice, it would leave a seriously bad taste.  
  
**Jun：**  
But that doesn't mean we can do nothing.  
And there isn't time to regroup and form a new strategy.  
  
**Jun：**  
Every moment we waste, {player}'s life is draining away,  
bringing him closer to death.  
  
**Jun：**  
We're at an impasse. What to do...?  
  
**???：**  
Ahahahah!  
You hopeless softies never do change!  
  
**Christina：**  
But fear not!  
Your reliable comrade Christina is here to save the day!  
  
**Christina：**  
Watch and learn as I miraculously overcome this hopeless situation!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Christina!  
You think you can just stroll in here now...?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Weren't we all told that this mission was the highest priority,  
and all Nightmare members were to attend aside from the few  
left to guard the palace?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Why must you always slack off, you wretch?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh, calm your squealing, little girl.  
You'll give me a headache.  
  
**Christina：**  
What do you expect?  
If I were to go wild in a dusty old hole like this,  
my favorite outfit would get terribly dirty.  
  
**Christina：**  
However...  
I was getting bored just lazing about in the city above,  
so I thought I'd drop by and lend you a hand.  
  
**Christina：**  
Really, you should be thankful.  
I'd like to see my pay doubled, at least.  
  
**Christina：**  
Still... Do you not have a lick of sense between you?  
Why are you dillydallying in front of the enemy, you fools?  
  
**Jun：**  
An all-too-valid question.  
But look—the beast has taken a hostage.  
  
**Jun：**  
If we are to uphold our mission of defending justice,  
we cannot afford to endanger an innocent citizen with our actions.  
  
**Christina：**  
How tedious a life that sounds.  
But use your heads a little, you dolts.  
  
**Christina：**  
There are no witnesses here,  
so who will know if you slaughter foe and hostage alike...  
  
**Christina：**  
Then bury the body where it will never be found,  
and come up with a flawless cover story?  
  
**Christina：**  
Well, I suppose a bunch of goody-goodies like you  
wouldn't have the nerve for that!  
Ah well, no matter. I'll do it for you instead!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hey! Stop!  
I can't allow you to do that, Christina!  
  
**Christina：**  
Since when do I need your permission?  
I do as I please—no more, no less.  
  
**Christina：**  
Don't get in my way.  
Those little monsters buzzing around the place are irritating,  
so take care of them for me, yes?  
  
**Christina：**  
I'm sure even grunts like you can handle that much.  
  
**Christina：**  
Now then, let's settle this case in style!  
Here goes!  
  

---  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Whoaaa?!  
That Christina lady's really something!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
She's dodging all their attacks  
and closing in on {player} in a flash!  
  
**Jun：**  
Let's lend her our support!  
While she's dragging young {player} out of the egg,  
Chris herself will be defenseless!  
  
**Jun：**  
Really, I swear... Must she always be so rash?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Nghh... You leave me no choice!  
I'll open a path for you, Christina!  
  
**Christina：**  
Don't call my name so lightly!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ugh, I could do without all this dirt and sludge...  
This egg's contents are going everywhere, and staining my clothes.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah well.  
We can't let {player} die just yet,  
so I'll do what I can for now.  
  
**Christina：**  
There. Hostage secured.  
I'll get him to safety while you deal the coup de grace.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Don't order me around!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Still, I can't miss this perfect chance!  
Hiyaaaahhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
SKREEEE!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Urgh, too shallow!  
This creature's encased from head to toe in a tough shell.  
A single blow will never take it down!  
  
**Jun：**  
No, you've done enough.  
The injury you dealt the monster has frightened it into fleeing.  
  
**Jun：**  
For the moment, the coast is clear.  
I think we can say our mission has been accomplished.  
  
**Jun：**  
Good work, everyone.  
  
**Christina：**  
You're as soft as ever, Captain.  
Who's to say that beast won't come back and try the same thing?  
You should give chase and end it once and for all.  
  
**Jun：**  
If the monster causes trouble for the city in the future,  
I will gladly end its life.  
But this is the first time, so let's make do with a warning.  
  
**Jun：**  
It seems to me that the creature needed the town's supplies  
to feed its unborn offspring.  
  
**Jun：**  
It fought in earnest for its child. To preserve its own line.  
Is that an evil worth punishing so harshly?  
  
**Jun：**  
Since it was causing trouble for our citizenry,  
we could not let it go unchecked.  
But if possible, I would rather not do it undue harm.  
  
**Christina：**  
Your sickly sweet soft attitude makes me want to throw up.  
  
**Christina：**  
...Speaking of sweetness, the contents of that egg  
have a rather syrupy scent.  
Could it be a form of rare and potent honey?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hmm?  
Hey, look! {player}'s saying something!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh? I see...  
It sounds like that monster has the ability  
to produce rare foodstuffs in the form of eggs.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Those eggs are what {player} was hunting for  
when he wandered into these caves and got captured.  
  
**Christina：**  
How deeply pathetic.  
But the tale intrigues me. I'd like to hear the details.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ohh...?  
So the more nutrients it consumes,  
the more delectable the contents of the eggs it produces?  
  
**Christina：**  
We may have struck gold, my dears!  
What do you say we capture the beast and try farming it ourselves?  
  
**Christina：**  
Let it gorge on cheap fodder, and harvest the delicacies it lays!  
We can sell them to the market for handsome profits!  
  
**Christina：**  
After all, that monster came to town  
in search of the nourishment it lacked.  
  
**Christina：**  
If we offer it sustenance, it will no longer need to trouble anyone...  
And we can reap the rich rewards of its banquet!  
  
**Christina：**  
The world has been tediously peaceful of late.  
This may help to pass the time... And if you leave it to me,  
I swear I will make it a roaring business!  
  
**Christina：**  
Nightmare has struggled with reduced funding in recent years,  
but now we can turn that around! A fine idea, wouldn't you say?  
  
**Jun：**  
In some ways your plan seems crueler than simply ending  
the monster's life... But I'll admit it has merit.  
  
**Jun：**  
And if you have a business venture to occupy you,  
it might keep you out of trouble for a while...  
I'll assign you the resources you need, so please do give it a shot.  
  
**Christina：**  
You need say no more!  
I have a flair for making profit.  
I'll make this the finest operation in Landosol!  
  
**Narration：**  
True to her word, Christina's business proved highly successful,  
and her luxury tidbits became the talk of the palace.  
  
**Narration：**  
This valuable source of income  
was exactly what Nightmare needed  
to bolster their waning finances.
