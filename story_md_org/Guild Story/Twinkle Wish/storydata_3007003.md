**Narration：**  
Rei, having cleared up a request on her own,  
returns to the guildhouse with a tired expression on her face.  
  
**Rei：**  
I'm back...  
Is Hiyori still out?  
  
**Yui：**  
Welcome back.  
If you're looking for Hiyori,  
she just left.  
  
**Rei：**  
I didn't even see her.  
Please tell me that  
she hasn't gone out to find some more requests, though.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Heyo! I'm back!  
Great news!  
I've found someone who has a request for us!  
  
**Yui：**  
W-welcome back...  
  
**Rei：**  
I knew it.  
Oh well. It'd be rude to chase them off, so let's hear them out.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
You're the best, Rei!  
Hey, come on in!  
  
**Man：**  
I'm sorry for troubling you  
when you're already so busy...  
  
**Rei：**  
Don't worry about it.  
More importantly,  
what is it you need from us?  
  
**Man：**  
There's a rare species of flower that only blooms  
during this season.  
I'd like you to escort me  
to and from the volcano where it's located.  
  
**Yui：**  
I've heard of it before. It stands out for its brilliant red color,  
and if gifted to the one you love, it's said to tie you together for life.  
  
**Man：**  
That's correct.  
I... I want to use it when proposing to the woman I love.  
  
**Yui：**  
A proposal?! I love it!  
Hey, Rei. I think we should—  
  
**Rei：**  
*sigh* One day you'll stop to think, Hiyori. As nice as it sounds,  
Twinkle Wish isn't some charity foundation.  
As for you, Yui,  
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't let your emotions get the best of you.  
  
**Yui：**  
S-sorry...  
  
**Rei：**  
That said, turning a request like this down wouldn't  
be the best idea in terms of our reputation.  
So we'll accept it.  
  
**Yui：**  
Rei...!  
  
**Man：**  
Thank you so much!  
You have no idea how much this means to me!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
You really are the best, Rei!  
Not gonna lie, part of me thought you'd say no.  
Eheheh.  
  
**Rei：**  
Honestly now...  
There's one condition, though. When this is done,  
we all have to take the next day off. Understood?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Got it! Right troops, off to Mount Verio we go!  
  
**Rei：**  
Hah!  
  
**Monster：**  
Rrrrghhhhh!  
  
**Rei：**  
Phew... I think that was the last one.  
There's a lot more monsters  
around here compared to the areas near town.  
Probably thanks to how little people come here in the first place.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Good work, as always.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rei：**  
Monsters on that level are barely any effort.  
More importantly, I should thank you for coming along with us.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
The flower store person said that we should  
be able to find it if we're this high up!  
Let's get this wrapped up in a jiffy!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Woo!  
`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
W-  
woo. ♪  
  
**Man：**  
I'll do everything I can to help!  
  
**Narration：**  
A few hours later...  
  
**Rei：**  
Still nothing, in spite of our best efforts...  
I suppose it's not classified as a rare species for nothing.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  It's too early to give in.  
`Tag 4`  
**Hiyori：**  
We're almost at the restricted zone...  
But yeah, you're right! We're sure to find it if we keep at it!  
Let's gooo!  
  
**Man：**  
Look!  
Look over there!  
I... I found it! I really found it!  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh wow, you're right!  
Congratulations!  
  
**Man：**  
Thank you! Thank you so much!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
So that's what it looks like!  
Honestly, it's amazing that a flower can even bloom on a volcano!  
  
**Rei：**  
Indeed. Just the idea of a flower being able to grow in a place  
like this makes you think about  
how mysterious life can be.  
  
**Man：**  
...There we go. If all goes well, I'll come back with her to plant  
a new seed.  
That'll give someone else a chance to come in  
the hopes of getting their feelings across.  
  
**Rei：**  
That's a good plan, actually.  
Anyway. We should leave before more monsters surface.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Rei, look!  
There's some people coming up this way!  
  
**???：**  
Hey, you lot! That's the rare flower that only  
blooms here, isn't it?!  
I know it is!  
Would you mind letting us have it?  
  
**Man：**  
U-uhh...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Umm, is there any specific reason that you want it?  
I think you—  
  
**Rei：**  
Hiyori, Yui. Take a better look at them. No normal group  
would come here decked out with that many weapons. They're  
mercenaries. We should distance ourselves from them right away.  
  
**Yui：**  
R-right!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hmm... They don't seem that threatening to me,  
but okay!  
  
**Rei：**  
We're not looking to give this away, I'm afraid.  
  
**Mercenary：**  
Hey, wait up! Listen, we're mercenaries. Our reputation will be  
in the trash if we don't get our hands on that!  
If you want money,  
then we've got it! So come on, at least hear us out!  
  
**Rei：**  
Not one for giving in, I see.  
Take our client and get him away from here as quickly as possible.  
We'll keep them busy for a bit before withdrawing.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Don't put yourselves in danger.  
**Choice: (6)**  Make sure you catch up, no matter what.  
`Tag 5`  
**Rei：**  
Thanks.  
You take care, too!  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Rei：**  
We will. Sorry to keep relying on you.  
But also, thanks.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Rei：**  
Now go! We'll handle things here!  
  
**Mercenary：**  
H-hey, hold up!  
  
**Yui：**  
Forgive me!  
  
**Mercenary：**  
Whoa, my eyes! It's too bright!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Now's our chance! Let's go!  
  
**Yui：**  
Phew...  
We should be able to escape at this rate.  
  
**Mercenary２：**  
Huh?  
Hey, you lot!  
Did another group come up this way? They were with us.  
  
**Rei：**  
Shoot! There was more than one unit!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
U-uhh...  
Nope. Never seen another person in my life.  
  
**Yui：**  
Come on, Hiyori!  
You couldn't have made that any more obvious!  
  
**Mercenary：**  
Come on, wait up!  
Hey, you lot finally caught up!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Uh-oh,  
now we're surrounded!  
  
**Man：**  
I'm sorry, this is all my fault.  
I never should have made the request in the first place.  
We might as well just hand it over to the—  
  
**Woman：**  
Just what do you think you're doing?!  
You're supposed to negotiate with them, not provoke them!  
Please accept my apologies on their beha—  
  
**Man：**  
...Why are *you* here?  
  
**Woman：**  
Darling?! Wait, that flower...!  
  
**Mercenary：**  
Oh, for real? Didn't think you were all friends with our Miss!  
You should have just said so! Would have made life easier!  
  
**Woman：**  
I'm so, so sorry!  
The truth is...  
  
**Man：**  
Your father is the leader of these mercenaries...?  
  
**Woman：**  
I always wanted to tell you, but... I just wasn't sure if you would  
accept me in spite of it. That thought had me paralyzed with fear.  
That's why I decided to tell you after gifting you that flower...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
So that's what was going on!  
I was wondering why mercenaries would want it,  
but now it all makes sense!  
  
**Mercenary：**  
She tried to come here all on her own, so we chased after her in a  
panic! We wanted to buy the flower off of you after noticing that  
you had it, but then you all cut and run! Talk about a rough day.  
  
**Yui：**  
We really can't apologize enough.  
We had the completely wrong idea about you all...  
  
**Rei：**  
I'm ashamed of myself...  
  
**Mercenary：**  
Don't sweat it!  
All that's left to do now is watch over those two from afar.  
  
**Man：**  
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't surprised.  
But my feelings for you haven't changed in the slightest.  
So please, take this flower!  
  
**Woman：**  
...  
With pleasure!  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh, excellent! Things worked out!  
  
**Mercenary２：**  
It happened! It finally happened!  
Our little Miss has come so far!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Congratulations!  
Hip hip hooray!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Rei：**  
Monsters! They must have reacted to all the noise!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Let's get these two to safety first!  
`Tag 8`  
**Yui：**  
Um... Do you mind if we ask for your help, too?  
  
**Mercenary：**  
Not a problem!  
We'll do anything to help the Miss out!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Nothing better than helping each other out!  
Right-o! Time to wipe out some monsters!  
  
**Narration：**  
Needless to say, the group succeeds in fending off  
the onslaught of monsters. A few days later, a letter from  
their client arrives at Twinkle Wish's guildhouse.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
\"I want to ensure the best possible future for us, so I've decided  
to have her father train me up so I can succeed his position as  
leader at some point.  
Thank you once again for all your help.\"  
  
**Yui：**  
Good to hear that they're both happy.  
I bet none of us expected things to turn out like this  
after we first came across those mercenaries.  
  
**Rei：**  
*sigh* I'm still in shock over it all.  
That's the sort of mistake Hiyori would make...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Cheer up!  
Aren't you happy to be more like your best bud Hiyori?  
  
**Rei：**  
There's a gross misunderstanding going on right now.  
  
**Yui：**  
Heheh...  
Oh, sorry.  
I couldn't help myself.  
  
**Rei：**  
Don't laugh!  
I regret it enough as it is already!  
  
**Narration：**  
As laughter filled the guildhouse, the three of them could feel  
that their time spent taking on requests together had  
helped them grow much closer to one another than before.
