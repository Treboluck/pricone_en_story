## Subtitle: On a Warm Back
  
**Rin：**  
*yawn*  
Morning...  
  
**Lima：**  
Hmm?  
Good morning, Rin.  
You're up early today!  
  
**Lima：**  
You mustn't yawn with your mouth wide open like that,  
though.  
It's not very ladylike!  
  
**Rin：**  
Ugh... You're way too energetic at this hour, Mali.  
Your voice is making my sleep-deprived ears ring.  
Can you lower your volume a little?  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh?  
Wait, do you still not know my name?  
  
**Lima：**  
Wow, and I thought we were getting to be friends.  
That stings.  
My name's not \"Mali,\" it's \"Lima!\"  
  
**Rin：**  
Nah, I know your name.  
But my name's Rin, right?  
Rin, Lima, they're kind of similar, right?  
  
**Rin：**  
So when people say \"Lima!\"  
sometimes I think  
they're calling me,  
 and I'll turn around to see.  
I don't wanna deal with it anymore.  
  
**Rin：**  
So, starting now, your name is Mali, okay?  
  
**Lima：**  
Yeah, no, I don't want to change the name my parents gave me  
just because you want me to.  
  
**Lima：**  
If anything, you should change your name, Rin.  
Mali sounds more like Mahiru than Lima does Rin.  
  
**Rin：**  
Argh. All right, we're getting nowhere.  
I'm tapping out.  
Lima's fine. I just wanted to give Mali a shot.  
  
**Lima：**  
Ah ha ha.  
Well, Mali *is* a very cute name, I'll give you that.  
  
**Lima：**  
Anyways Rin, you look really sleepy again.  
Were you playing one of those games all  
night again?  
  
**Rin：**  
Mm-hmm. {player} came to the farm last night, remember?  
  
**Lima：**  
Yep. He's been coming here from time to time to deliver  
letters and packages and whatnot from town, right?  
  
**Lima：**  
I guess it's a side job to earn a little extra money?  
  
**Rin：**  
Yup, exactly.  
But it's too risky to try to walk down the  
mountain in the dark, so he spends the night here  
before he heads back.  
  
**Rin：**  
He and I get along pretty well,  
so we always end up playing  
all night.  
  
**Rin：**  
I like {player}. He'll play as long as I want without a  
single complaint!  
Actually, I don't think he's left yet.  
I wonder where he's at?  
  
**Rin：**  
There's this map I can't solo, so I was hoping he'd  
play co-op with me.  
No offense Lima, but it's one of the  
few things where I just can't rely on you.  
  
**Lima：**  
Ah ha ha. Well, it's too hard for me to handle  
that game controller thing, anyway.  
  
**Lima：**  
I think I saw {player} a little earlier taking care of  
the pasture.  
He must be helping Mahiru with her chores.  
  
**Lima：**  
He's such a nice guy. And a hard worker, too!  
Hee hee. He'd make a great hubby!  
  
**Rin：**  
Ugh. What is it with you people and work?  
I don't get the appeal.  
But whatever floats your boat.  
  
**Rin：**  
Lima...  
I really don't feel like walking over to the pasture.  
Will you carry me?  
  
**Lima：**  
Geez, you always ask me to carry you around!  
I'm not your personal packhorse!  
  
**Lima：**  
Rin,  
you need to be a little more self-sufficient.  
  
**Rin：**  
Sure, I'll do that when I'm in the mood to.  
In the meantime, carry me?  
  
**Lima：**  
No can do! I've already got a passenger.  
See? I'm giving Shiori a ride.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Zzz... Zzz...  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh, Shiorin!  
How come she gets to sleep on your back like a little baby?  
  
**Lima：**  
Well, at first she was in the pasture helping {player}  
and Mahiru with the chores.  
  
**Lima：**  
I guess she got worn out. I noticed she was out on her feet,  
so I was carrying her back.  
  
**Lima：**  
She could catch cold if she sleeps out in the open air.  
Her body's really susceptible to that sort of thing.  
We need to be extra considerate of her health.  
  
**Lima：**  
And my back is very soft and fluffy,  
so I'm sure she's nice  
and warm! Hee hee!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hmm? H-huh?  
Did I fall asleep?  
  
**Lima：**  
Good morning, Shiori!  
I'm sorry, were we talking too loudly?  
  
**Rin：**  
Morning, Shiorin! You're in my nap spot. Can you get off now?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Huh? Oh,  
I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to trouble you.  
I know you don't like being treated like a packhorse, Lima.  
  
**Lima：**  
It's all right! I give Rin piggyback rides all the time.  
I'm used to it now!  
  
**Lima：**  
Sleep as long as you like, Shiori.  
I'll take you back to your bed.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh... Thank you.  
I'm not in very good shape today.  
I've felt weak and woozy all morning.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I don't think I could make it by myself, so if you would  
carry me, I'd be very grateful.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hee hee. Plus, you're so soft and fluffy, Lima.  
You give the comfiest piggyback rides.  
  
**Rin：**  
Yup, agreed.  
 Lucky you, Shiorin!  
  
**Rin：**  
I'm so tired I don't think I can walk on my own either.  
After you drop Shiorin off, can you come back  
and pick me up?  
  
**Lima：**  
Quit being so spoiled! Time to go, Shiori.  
I'll try not to shake you around too much.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Okay.  
Thank you again, Lima.  
  
**Rin：**  
*sigh* Fine, I don't care.  
I'll get someone else to carry me.  
  
**Rin：**  
Let's see.  
{player} is right over there in that pasture.  
  
**Rin：**  
Jackpot. I'll get him to carry me.  
Boys have stamina to spare, anyways.  
Hey, {player}?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, Rinrin!  
Shocker to see ya up this early.  
Finally decided to start makin' hay while the sun shines?  
  
**Rin：**  
Heck no. As if I'd ever do that.  
But what's up? You're running around like a headless chicken.  
  
**Rin：**  
Was there some kind of incident?  
That'd be a real drag.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Nah, it ain't nothin' that serious.  
Just havin' trouble gettin' the milk out.  
  
**Rin：**  
Mahiru!  
You have a baby?!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
No, no, I ain't talkin' about *my* udders!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wait, was that a setup? Dang it! Lately I'm lettin' all these  
great joke setups go right over my head!  
'Course, normally I'm the one doin' the settin' up!  
  
**Rin：**  
What? I don't get it...  
Anyways, I know you look young, but you're still twenty  
and all. I figure it wouldn't be weird for you to be married.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Nope, this gal's single.  
Seems like there ain't any men  
with the gumption to come live way out here in the boonies.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Enough gossip, though.  
Lately, this poor cow  
hasn't been makin' much milk.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm gettin' worried. That can be the initial symptom of a  
serious disease.  
If somethin' like that spreads to the rest of  
the animals, I'll be in a heap 'o trouble if I handle it wrong!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
And worse, if it can spread to people,  
Shioshio's health could be at risk.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
So I'm givin' her a full exam and lookin' into what it  
might could be.  
{player}'s pitchin' in, too.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
She gets madder 'n a wet hen when I try to take a look at her,  
though. It's been a rough mornin'.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Rinrin, reckon you could help me keep her pinned down?  
You're a security guard, so you gotta be tough as nails!  
  
**Rin：**  
Yeah, umm...  
I haven't trained in a long time.  
I'm totally out of shape.  
  
**Rin：**  
Eep! What the heck?  
This big heifer's licking me all over!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
No, she ain't lickin' you, Rinrin.  
She's after that white... fur, or whatever it is  
on your clothes.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wait, is this Lima's wool?  
  
**Rin：**  
Hmm, probably. Lima's so cuddly, I always give her a  
big hug whenever I run into her.  
Some of her fur must've rubbed off on me.  
  
**Rin：**  
Ewww.  
All this licking is giving me the creeps.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hmm. Y'know, the look in her eyes...  
I think she might could be lovesick.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I can tell these things, bein' born an' raised on a farm 'n'  
all.  
Maybe that's why she's havin' trouble makin' milk?  
  
**Rin：**  
Slow down. If she makes milk, then she's a female.  
And in case you forgot, so is Lima.  
  
**Rin：**  
Not only is Lima also female, she's a completely  
different species.  
I'm pretty sure she's just hungry.  
  
**Lima：**  
Did somebody call?  
  
**Rin：**  
Whoa, good timing.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey, Lima. We were just trying to decide whether or not  
this cow's madly in love with you.  
  
**Lima：**  
Wait, what?  
Th-this is so sudden. I don't know what to say!  
  
**Lima：**  
I-it's nice to have an admirer,  
but I don't think I'm ready for a relationship!  
  
**Lima：**  
Umm...  
I'm sorry, Miss Cow.  
Can I have some time to think about this?  
  
**Rin：**  
Lima, you can talk to cows?  
Actually, it's probably weirder that you can talk to us, huh?  
  
**Rin：**  
No one mentions it, and I kinda don't really care one way or  
another, so I guess I never bothered to ask.  
  
**Lima：**  
Well, for whatever reason, I can speak normally with people.  
But unfortunately, I don't speak cow.  
  
**Lima：**  
Hee hee. It's nice that she likes me, though!  
Here, Miss Cow, I'll brush your hair.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Aww, well she just looks as pleased as punch now, don't she?  
Hopefully them udders get back to makin' milk like normal.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You put me through the wringer, girl!  
  
**Rin：**  
Ha ha ha.  
I think it's nice that this kinda stuff  
is all we have to worry about.  
  
**Rin：**  
I hear things are really going downhill back in the city.  
It's bad. We're talking crime and gangs left and right.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Yeah, true.  
Sometimes you really put things in  
perspective, Rinrin.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I wish that peaceful days like this,  
where the worst thing that happens is we get all  
worked up over nothin',  
could last forever.
