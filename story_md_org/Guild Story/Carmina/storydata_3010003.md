**Narration：**  
The day of Carmina's debut concert—  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Here we go! It's showtime!  
{player}, thanks for helping us out backstage!  
  
**Chika：**  
It's reassuring to have you here, {player}.  
Thank you.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Mr. Knight, are you sure you don't mind?  
If it's too much for you to handle, just say the word, okay?  
I-it's not like I'm relying on you or anything.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Thanks for worrying about me.  
`Tag 1`  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'm n-not worried about you!  
I just don't want the concert to get canceled!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You're a real softie, Tsumugi.  
After all your protests,  
you even managed to learn the choreography!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
It's not like that!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Take a look, guys!  
The audience is absolutely packed!  
We've gotta get this show on the road!  
  
**Chika：**  
W-we're really going to perform in front of all those people?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Hold on.  
So does \"we\" ultimately include me as well?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Sure it does!  
Of course, no one's forcing you to do it...  
But don'tcha you want *him* to see you  
dancing in that costume?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Wha-what are you talking about?  
Well, there's no point in backing out now!  
Besides, it'd be a waste not to show off the costume I made.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hehe. Glad you're on board!  
Okay then, let's make our debut concert a blast!  
Carmina,  
on stage!  
  
**Carmina：**  
Let's go!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hello, everyone! Thanks for showing up today!  
Coming at you with a dazzling smile—  
I'm everyone's idol, Nozomi!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
We've got an amazing concert for you today,  
and nothing would make us happier  
than to see our music put a smile on your face!  
  
**Fan：**  
Woooooo!  
Nozomi!  
  
**Chika：**  
Miss Nozomi really knows how to work the crowd.  
So *that's* an idol.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Come on,  
Chika and Tsumugi, greet the audience!  
  
**Chika：**  
Me?!  
Well, um...  
  
**Chika：**  
N-nice to meet you. I'm Chika.  
I'm, well... not used to performing in front of so many people.  
  
**Chika：**  
That's why, I...  
Um, Miss Nozomi? What else am I supposed to say?  
  
**Fan：**  
Ahahah!  
Man, Chika is adorable!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Miss Nozomi, it's time to perform the first song!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Right!  
Whoops, my bad.  
Boy, Tsumugi, having you on stage  
is like having my own personal timekeeper!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Well, *someone's* gotta keep you in check!  
Now let's get into our starting positions.  
  
**Fan：**  
So that's Tsumugi, eh?  
She's super cute!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Why, thank you. ♪  
Wait, never mind me!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
We'll now perform our first number.  
Hope you folks enjoy it!

**Fans：**  
Woooooo!!!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
How did we do?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You know what? I think that went really well.  
The audience is loving it!  
  
**Chika：**  
Everyone does seem to be having lots of fun.  
I can't believe we've made so many people smile with our music!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I never expected  
such an enthusiastic response either.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
See?  
Concerts can also make people happy too.  
Don't tell me you're not impressed.  
  
**Chika：**  
I am.  
I could perform like this again and again.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
All right! Let's keep this energy going!  
Here’s—our next song!  
  
**Woman：**  
Aaahhhh!  
A monster!  
  
**Man：**  
Everyone, run!  
A monster has breached the gate! It's inside the city!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Did he just say \"monster?\"  
  
**Monster：**  
Grrrghhh!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I-it really is a monster!  
What's it doing here in town?!  
  
**Chika：**  
And why now in the middle of our concert?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Actually,  
it's a good thing it showed up now.  
After all, we are—  
  
**Nozomi：**  
—the singing, dancing, *fighting* guild!  
Let's do what we can to protect our audience!  
  
**Chika：**  
Understood!  
Together, we'll defeat the monster!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Classic Miss Nozomi.  
Chika, start preparing your Song Summoning!  
Until then, the two of us will figure something out.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Tsumugi, try and stall the monster. I'll get our fans to safety.  
Everyone, keep calm, follow the staff's instructions,  
and evacuate the premises!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Can't believe my secret binding threads for self-defense  
are actually coming in handy...  
Better safe than sorry, eh?  
Well, here goes nothing!  
  
**Monster：**  
Grrrghhh!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
No way! It just snapped my threads!  
This monster isn't messing around!  
  
**Monster：**  
Grrrghhh!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh, crap!  
Not that way!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Chika! Run!  
  
**Chika：**  
Huh?  
Aaahhh!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm coming to save you!  
**Choice: (3)**  We'll protect you!  
`Tag 2`  
**Chika：**  
You mustn't!  
Forget about me,  
and run while you can!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Chika：**  
What? Who's \"we\"?  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Fan：**  
Get baaack!  
We're not letting you touch her!  
  
**Fan：**  
We can fight, too!  
And Chika is ours to protect!  
  
**Monster：**  
Grrrghhh!  
  
**Chika：**  
Everyone...  
Thank you so much!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Incredible!  
They're actually holding it back!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Just look at how many of them there are.  
Even if they can't defeat it,  
they can at least stop it  
in its tracks.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
*Now*, Chika! Use your Song Summoning!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Go on, Chika! Sing the song only you can sing!  
I'll join you! With my own song!  
  
**Chika：**  
Okay!  
~~~~♪  
  
**Chika：**  
I'll use my song to protect everyone!  
  
**Spirit：**  
—♪  
  
**Fan：**  
Whoa... So this is Chika's Song Summoning!  
Amaaazing!  
  
**Chika：**  
O divine spirit, lend us your strength!  
  
**Spirit：**  
—♪  
  
**Monster：**  
Grrrghhh!  
  
**Fan：**  
They’re holding up against the monster!  
Looks like we might have a chance!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wow, Chika!  
All right, here I go as well!  
I'm sending energy to all of you! ~~~~♪  
  
**Fan：**  
It's Nozomi's solo song!  
I feel heat coursing through my body!  
Now, *we* can take this monster on!  
  
**Fan：**  
With the help of that divine spirit, we're gonna take out that monster!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'm here to help as well! Let's defeat the monster together!  
  
**Fan：**  
If Tsumugi's got our backs, I ain't afraid of anything!  
Let's go, boys!  
  
**Fans：**  
Woooooo!!!  
  
**Spirit：**  
—♪  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
This... should finish it off!  
  
**Monster：**  
Graaarghhh!  
  
**Everyone：**  
Hurray!  
We took out the monster!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Yes!  
We did it, Tsumugi! Chika!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
We really did...  
Although I was worried there for a second.  
  
**Chika：**  
Me too. But we managed to protect everyone's smiles!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
We fight monsters to protect others,  
and perform as idols to make them smile.  
It's a sweet deal, isn't it, Chika?  
  
**Chika：**  
It is.  
 Being an idol is a wonderful job.  
I'd like to keep doing it... with you, Nozomi. And you too, Miss Tsumugi,  
the three of us together.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Whew! I was worried you might be sick of it already.  
Wait. Chika, did you just call me Nozomi?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Hey, no fair!  
If you're gonna do that with Nozomi,  
the you gotta call me Tsumugi as well!  
  
**Chika：**  
What? O-okay...  
Tsumugi?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
That's me!  
I sure was hoping you'd drop the formalities sooner rather than later!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wait. You haven't exactly dropped them yourself, have you?  
Time to follow suit, I'd say.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'm the youngest, so I don't count!  
Forget about that, though. Can't you two hear them  
shouting out there?  
  
**Fans：**  
Encore!  
Encore!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Our fans are waiting for us.  
Chika! Tsumugi! Are you ready?  
  
**Chika：**  
Yes!  
Let's sing and sing and sing some more!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Sure thing.  
We're gonna take their energy to the next level!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Everyone! Thank you so much!  
Let's restart this concert from the top.  
Think you can all keep up?  
  
**Fans：**  
Woooooo!!!  
  
**Carmina：**  
Carmina, on stage!  
  
**Narration：**  
Despite the setbacks,  
Carmina's debut concert was a smashing success,  
helping to spread their name across the continent.
