# Carmina Episode 1
Chika sees Nozomi's recruitment notice and expresses her interest in joining. Nozomi is excited, but they're accosted by thugs. Tsumugi saves them, and seeing this as a sign, Nozomi invites her into the guild as well.
  
## Subtitle: Sing! Dance! Fight!
  
**Narration：**  
A lone girl stands in front  
of the guild member recruitment board.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hmm... It's been a while since I put up the notice,  
but the response has been underwhelming, to say the least.  
I wonder why.  
Is it because it's \"girls only\"?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Sure, my own idol career is going well enough...  
But I'd love to put together a group instead of limiting myself to  
solo performances.  
 I really hope *someone* applies!  
  
**???：**  
Um. Excuse me.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I want to form a guild that sings, dances, and fights (against sadness) for others!  
Are any girls out there interested?  
Or not...  
  
**???：**  
Excuse me!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Whoa! You startled me.  
Hi there! Can I help you with something?  
  
**???：**  
\"Looking for guild members who can sing, dance, and fight.\"  
Did you put this notice up?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Er...  
Y-yeah.  
It was me. And you are...?  
  
**???：**  
Well, I don't know how to dance, but I am interested in learning.  
Are you still looking for members to join your guild?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hold on. You want to join my guild?  
Of course—you're more than welcome!  
I'm Nozomi, by the way! Nice to meet you!  
  
**Chika：**  
I'm Chika. Nice to meet you, too.  
Do you usually take the vanguard?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Well, I'm more of a center gal, if I do say so myself!  
Now if we could just get one more member to join, it would give our group a little more pizzazz...  
  
**Chika：**  
Center? Pizzazz?  
I'm not quite sure I follow.  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Well then, mind if we join in on the fun?  
We're real strong, you know?  
Something you're bound to appreciate.  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Man, you ladies are fine!  
How about we get to know each other better?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
So sorry. We're only recruiting girls.  
Although you're welcome to join if you can dress yourselves up in cute little outfits and dance?  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Us?  
Nah. We'd rather see you girls  
dressed in those cute little outfits.  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Without any guild members, you must be bored out of your pretty little minds!  
Come play with us. Don't be shy!

**Chika：**  
Who are you people?  
Please, let go of me!... That does it.  
~~~~♪  
  
**Spirit：**  
...!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
That voice!  
Hold on, did her song summon this little cutie?  
  
`image display end`  
**Ruffian 1：**  
What the hell! Where did this thing come from?  
Just get over here and—  
Waah!  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Don't go all soft on me now—  
Aargh!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Honestly...  
There's nothing worse than a guy creeping on a girl who wants nothing to do with him.  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Damn it! My body's all threaded up, and I can't move a muscle!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Unless you want to live out your days as a spool,  
I suggest you make yourself scarce.  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
N-no, please!  
We're sorry!  
  
**Chika：**  
Thank you.  
We're okay now.  
  
**Spirit：**  
—♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Boy, that was a close call.  
I can't thank you two enough!  
  
**Chika：**  
Don't thank me. I really didn't do much.  
If she hadn't stopped them in their tracks, we'd still be in harm's way.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I just did what any decent person would do.  
Men like that, they won't take no for an answer.  
You've gotta show them what \"no\" means.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You're one heck of a reliable gal, you know?  
Right! This has gotta be some kind of sign.  
Would you like to join our guild?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Your... guild?  
I mean, technically I could join since I'm not a member of any other, but...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Let's go somewhere quiet where we can talk!  
I'll tell you all about it there!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Up 'til now, I've done pretty much everything I can do as a solo idol.  
Still, I always felt like there was something more  
I could achieve.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Instead of going at it alone,  
I want to put together an idol group to find the answers I'm looking for.  
So whaddya say? Let's become idols!  
  
**Chika：**  
Aren't idols people who cheer others up with songs?  
That's not exactly what I had in mind.  
 Your notice said you  
were looking for guild members who can \"sing, dance, and fight.\"  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Singing and dancing *is* our battle.  
With our smiles,we try to wipe away  
the sadness others endure  
in their daily lives!  
  
**Chika：**  
I'm not sure you can call that a battle.  
I was under the impression that your guild protects people from monsters through singing and dancing.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But we idols *can* protect the smiles of others that way.  
Of course, it would be nice if we could actually defeat monsters by singing too.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
As if anyone could pull off a trick like that...  
Anyway, guilds are indeed meant to fight monsters,  
but ultimately, isn't it dangerous for girls to fight?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
If we're going to join a guild, it's better if it's one  
where we get to work in cute outfits!  
Isn't that right, Nozomi?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Spot on, Tsumugi!  
I mean, you're a girl as well, Chika.  
Wouldn't you get tired of fighting all the time?  
There's no need to actively seek danger.  
  
**Chika：**  
You need not fear. I possess the power to deal with danger.  
As a Song Summoner, I can summon spirits with my voice. Have you heard of that before?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
A Song Summoner?! I sure have!  
Hold on, so what you did earlier...  
Chika, you really are a Song Summoner!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
That's incredible!  
So there *are* people who can pull off a trick like that!  
  
**Chika：**  
Yes. Ever since I can remember, I have sung to protect the peace.  
Any other form of singing does not really appeal to me.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Really?!  
Judging by your outfit, I assumed you were a bard.  
  
**Chika：**  
Me, a bard?!  
I've never even considered that.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
It's a shame really.  
With the two of you together,  
you'd be able to make any man fall for you based on your looks alone.  
And that song you sang? I mean, come on. That's practically cheating!  
  
**Chika：**  
I'm... not sure I know what you mean.  
To be honest, I've never paid much attention to the opposite sex.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
You gotta be kidding!  
I mean come on, Chika.  
 Your proportions are  
32—24—32 from top to bottom, right?  
 I'm sure there've been tons  
of men who've approached you based solely on that figure of yours!  
  
**Chika：**  
W-wait... Why do you know my three sizes?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I can see what anyone's proportions are, to the inch, just by glancing at them!  
The body doesn't lie, after all.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Anyway,  
if the two of you performed as idols together,  
I guarantee you'd garner a lot of attention!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Exactly! It's such a waste to only sing when fighting!  
Songs also have the power to cheer people up and make them smile.  
Isn't making everyone smile just as important as protecting the peace?  
  
**Chika：**  
You... might be right about that.  
But...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
You need money to maintain the role of protecting others, don't you?  
And fighting all the time to earn money just isn't healthy.  
If you can earn money by singing or dancing, you should do it.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Besides, if your singing is so good that you can summon spirits,  
you ought to let more people hear it!  
You also want to hear Chika sing more too, don't you, Tsumugi?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Absolutely.  
And if you're wearing one of my custom-made costumes  
while you sing, all the better.  
I'm sure others will love your singing just as much as us, Chika.  
  
**Chika：**  
But...  
But I–  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Let's try this! I'll help you slay your monsters.  
And you'll help me out with my idol work!  
That's fair, right? Come on!  
Please?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
If you'll wear my costumes,  
I'll also help you with whatever you need too, Chika!  
  
**Chika：**  
...  
Very well then. I can assist you in your endeavors  
during breaks between slaying monsters.  
I look forward to working with you, Miss Nozomi.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
All right!  
Let's do our best together!  
  
**Chika：**  
R-right.  
Still, the purpose of my music is to protect the peace.  
Please don't forget that.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Of course! You can count on it. I'll do my best when it comes to slaying monsters as well!  
After all, battles are part of being an idol!  
  
**Chika：**  
Is that so? I'm a little worried.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Are you going to join our guild too, Tsumugi?  
After everything you said, you will, won't you?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
No need to ask twice. If you need a hand backstage, I'll be happy to help.  
However! I do happen to be a tailor,  
so I am really picky when it comes to  
costumes.  
 If I'm going to do this, I'll have to make proper stage outfits!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Great! I really lucked out finding myself a costume designer as well!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
My mind is teeming with ideas for the costumes  
I'm going to dress the two of you in!  
Oh, they'll be a regular feast for the eyes!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Tsumugi, snap out of it.  
You've got a weird look on your face!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oops! My bad,  
I got a little carried away.  
I'm okay now!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I look forward to working with both of you!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Same here!  
  
**Chika：**  
A-as do I.  
  
**Narration：**  
And so Carmina was formed—a guild whose members perform as idols  
to save others from their sorrows through singing and dancing.
