**Narration：**  
{player}, Mimi, Misogi and Kyoka are on an outing  
to the Elven Forest where Kyoka lives.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Wowww! So this is the Elven Forest!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
That's right. Though the Elven Forest is a big place.  
The village where I actually live is much further inside.  
  
**Mimi：**  
It's all so new and interesting!  
You know, I haven't been outside of Landosol much before,  
so today is pretty exciting for me!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I see {player} is looking around rather curiously, as well.  
Although he's pretty much the same even back in Landosol...  
  
**Mimi：**  
I wonder where Misogi is, though. She's kind of late...  
It's already past the time we said we'd meet up...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Honestly, Misogi has no concept of a proper schedule!  
I expect somebody caught her playing a silly prank,  
and she's busy getting lectured right now!  
  
**Mimi：**  
I'm not sure if that would hold her up this long...  
You don't think something bad might have happened to her, do you?  
Like, um... she got attacked by a monster, or something?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
What...?  
D-don't be ridiculous. That couldn't possibly...  
  
**Monster：**  
Graaaaaarghhh!  
  
**Mimi & Kyoka：**  
Aaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!  
  
**Monster：**  
Ahahahahah!  
You should've seen the looks on your faces!  
That was hilarious!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Th-that voice! Is that you, Misogi?!  
This monster... Don't tell me it's just a costume?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
'Course it is!  
Whewww, that was too much fun!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi! Not only do you show up late,  
but you play a prank to make it worse?!  
Why do you always have to pull this kind of stunt?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
'Cause it's funny!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Urghhh... N-not that again...!  
If you keep pulling these ridiculous pranks,  
you'll get eaten by a real monster one of these days!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Aw, come off it! That's never gonna happen!  
Right, Mimi?  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOORGHHHH!  
  
**Misogi & Kyoka：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Wh-whoaaa!  
Your costume's even better than mine, Mimi!  
Where the heck did you buy it?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Even Mimi is pulling outrageous pranks now?!  
That's quite enough, I say!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Costume? I didn't bring any costume.  
Right, mister?  
  
**Misogi & Kyoka：**  
But... Then that means...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH!  
  
**Misogi & Kyoka：**  
I-It's the real thing?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
What do we do?! What do we do?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
F-for the moment, we should run!  
Misogi, Mimi, {player}, follow me!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Th-this is scary! Waaahhhh!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Mimi! This is no time to stand around crying!  
You need to move!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Protect Mimi.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mimi：**  
Th-thanks, mister!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
{player}, watch out!  
You need to get out of there!  
  
**Misogi：**  
You gotta run too before the monster gets you!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAAARGHHH!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hey, mister?! Are you OK?!  
Ahhh! Look, you're bleeding...!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
A-are you quite all right, {player}?!  
You can't try to fight a beast like that on your own!  
  
**Mimi：**  
M-mister...  
  
**Monster：**  
RRRAAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Mimi：**  
I'm...  
 not running away!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Mimi?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Mr. Nice Guy protected me from the monster...  
Now it's my turn to protect him as well!  
  
**Misogi：**  
...Nicely said!  
I'm not running from that thing either!  
We gotta protect Mr. {player}!

**Kyoka：**  
I-I'll join you as well!  
Let's protect this big idiot, the three of us together!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRROARGHHH!  
  
`image display end`  
**Mimi, Misogi & Kyoka：**  
Take thiiiiiiis!!!

**Monster：**  
GGRRRRUOOOGHHHH...  
  
`image display end`  
**Kyoka：**  
...W-we beat it?  
  
**Misogi：**  
All riiiiight!  
We totally did it, you guys!  
 Didja see that, mister?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Th-that was so scary!!!  
Waaaaaahhhh!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
S-something isn't right here...  
Even working together, how could the three of us  
defeat such a large monster?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Actually, I did feel like I was stronger than normal...  
I was moving around super fast, too!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Tell them about your sword.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kyoka：**  
...You're saying you used this sword to power up  
all of our abilities?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I had no idea such a thing was possible...  
Just who in the world are you, really?  
Suspicious doesn't even cover it at this point...  
  
**Mimi：**  
But I guess this means it was thanks to you  
that we all got out of there safe!  
Thanks so much, mister!  
  
**Misogi：**  
You're amazing, mister!  
With you on our side, there's nothing we can't do!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hey, mister, you gotta keep playing with us!  
We'll have the most fun, like, ever!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Misogi's right!  
I want to have all sorts of fun chats with you, too!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
M-Misogi?! Mimi!  
What have I told you about trusting this guy too easily?!  
Can't you see he's a...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Can't we see he's...  
 a what?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
He's... a big idiot... who saved our lives,  
 I guess...  
  
**Narration：**  
That was the day this very little guild  
finally welcomed a not-so-little member into its ranks.
