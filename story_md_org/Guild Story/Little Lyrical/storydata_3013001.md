**Mimi's Mother：**  
Mimi, dear!  
Could you go and fetch some ingredients for dinner?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Sure! I'll go buy them!  
What's for dinner today?  
  
**Mimi's Mother：**  
We're having stew today!  
Here. These are the ingredients, and this is where you need to go.  
There's a merchants' caravan passing near Landosol today!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Wowww!  
You mean, I get to go shopping outside Landosol?  
I've never gone outside the city on my own before!  
  
**Mimi's Mother：**  
Be a good girl and take care, okay?  
Remember to follow the path, and whatever you do, don't wander off.  
Good luck, dear!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Okay! I'll be careful!  
See you at dinnertime!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Shopping for a stew~♪ Shopping for a stew~♪  
Buying lots of yummy things to make a yummy stew~♪  
Dinner today is going to be the best~!♪  
  
**Mimi：**  
Fluffy potatoes, crunchy carrots, squishy mushrooms too~♪  
Boil them all together in a pot of meaty stew~♪  
Bubbly-wubbly, steamy-smoky, let the stew pot sing~！♪  
  
**Mimi：**  
B... Bubbly-wubbly...  
 Steamy-smoky...  
  
**Mimi：**  
W-waaaahh! Where am I?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
I-I don't know which way to go!  
Mommyyyy! Daddyyyy!  
Waaaaaahhhhh!  
  
**???：**  
Ehm... Are you all right?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahh...?  
U-umm... Who are you?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
My name is Kyoka. I'm an elf.  
I heard your voice crying in the distance, so I came to have a look.  
Are you lost, by any chance?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Y-yes, I am... I came from Landosol to buy some ingredients...  
But I don't know which way I'm supposed to go...  
Waaaaahhhhh!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Th-that's quite enough crying! H... How very odd.  
At school, we were taught that beastfolk are ordinarily  
more untamed and confident in character...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I don't suppose you have some kind of map to your destination?  
And, ah... It would be helpful to know your name.  
  
**Mimi：**  
*sniff*... *sniff*... My name's Mimi...  
Here, this is the note my mommy gave me...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Let me have a look. Ehmmm...  
It looks like you've come the wrong way completely!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
It will be fastest to go all the way back to Landosol and start over.  
Come on, Mimi, I'll check this note and lead the way,  
so you follow behind me.  
  
**Mimi：**  
You're going to come along with me?  
Thanks!  
Eheheh... I love you, Kyoka!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Hippety-hop, hippety-hop~!♪  
Going for a walk together~♪ Just a lovely walk~♪  
Under the shiny-shiny sun~♪  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...For a girl who was completely lost, you seem rather carefree.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Well, yeah! Up till now I was all on my own,  
but now I'm with you, Kyoka!  
I feel so much safer now!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...What a carefree sort of girl.  
We were taught at school that beastfolk are more wild and rough...  
Perhaps she's an unusual one among her own kind?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahh! What if when I least expect it,  
she shows her true colors as a dangerous beast?!  
  

---  
  
**Mimi：**  
Grrrrrrr!  
Roarrrrr!  
  

---  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ummmm... P-perhaps that isn't very likely.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh... A fork in the path.  
 Let's see, what does the sign say?  
This way should lead to Landosol.  
And at the next turn...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I-I think we're lost!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ehhhh?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
B-but this isn't right at all! I know I followed the right path!  
See, even on this sign, it says that Landosol is...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Hmmm?  
Something about this sign... seems not quite right.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
From what I can recall, Landosol should be farther down this  
right-hand path.  
 But the sign indicates we should go left to get there.  
It's not right at all...  
 Actually, I think it's been altered.  
  
**Mimi：**  
R-really?  
Somebody changed it? But who would do a thing like that?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Ahh!  
 C-come to think of it...!  
I-in my home village, where my fellow elves live,  
there have been similar incidents happening just recently.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Like all the ripest fruits in the forest vanishing without a trace,  
or long grasses being tied together to form traps that trip people up.  
People have even stumbled into pitfall traps!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ohhh! Actually, it's the same for us beastfolk!  
I've heard about weird things happening recently too!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Like a sheep-type person had his wool sheared off in his sleep!  
And one cow-type person woke up with a ring in his nose!  
There were pitfall traps, too!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...I'm sure this nasty trick with the altered sign  
must be the work of the same culprit!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Who could be doing all this stuff?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
If they're mounting attacks on both elves and beastfolk...  
It can only be demonfolk!  
 Perhaps even the Legendary Demon Lord  
who I read about in my picture books!  
  
**Mimi：**  
L-Legendary Demon Lord?!  
Wh-what should we do, Kyoka?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
We will have to defeat him ourselves!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Whaaaaaa?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
At this rate, we have no hope of making it back to Landosol.  
Defeating the Demon Lord is our only chance!  
  
**Mimi：**  
O-oh nooo! Th-that's way too scary!  
I-I don't wanna fight demons!  
Waaaaahhhh!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I was always taught that beastfolk are a fearless race...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Well, I always heard that elves are more kind and gentle!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I-I'm being as kind as I can!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
But I'm beginning to think the words in our textbooks  
can't always be trusted...  
 What a shocking revelation...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahhh!  
Th-there's someone over there! Hidden behind that tree!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
So, you show yourself, Demon Lord!  
I will put an end to your evil ways!  
  
**Mimi & Kyoka：**  
...

**???：**  
Waaaahhhh!  
  
**Mimi & Kyoka：**  
Aaaghhhhhhh!  
  
**???：**  
H-help me out here!  
Somebody get me down!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wh-who in the world might you be?!  
Why are you hanging upside down?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Y-your ankle appears to be caught in a coil of rope,  
which is dangling you from that tree.  
 A fiendish rope trap indeed...  
Hang in there for a minute! I'll let you down gently!

**Misogi：**  
Thanks, you guys! You really saved my butt!  
I'm Misogi!  
And you're... an elf and a beastgirl?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Yup! My name's Mimi!  
And this is Kyoka!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
You must be a human, I take it?  
Did you also fall foul of one of the Demon Lord's tricks?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Demon... Lord?  
Huh? What're you talking about?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Recently, we elves and beastfolk  
have been under attack from a terrible lord of the demonfolk!  
And thanks to this Demon Lord, we lost our way in these woods...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Seriously?!  
 Sheesh, talk about nasty!  
You just wait, Demon Lord! Misogi's coming to get you!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
How very gallant! We will join you in battle!  
If we all fight together, we can surely defeat the menace!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Huh? All fight together...? You don't mean...  
M-me too?  
All I wanted was to buy some ingredients for dinner...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahah! That's so cool!  
We're like one of those guild thingies that the grown-ups do!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
A grand suggestion! The three of us should start our own guild!  
This is all getting rather exciting!  
  
**Misogi：**  
All righty then!  
From this day forth, we're the Misogi Defenders!  
  
**Mimi & Kyoka：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi, that name is hardly appropriate.  
 This guild belongs to all  
three of us, so it should not bear your name alone.  
If we were  
to include a name, it should at least be that of our leader.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Well, yeah, duh! That's why I'm the guildmaster!  
Everyone knows the strongest member gets to be leader!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
The strongest?  
Personally, I would have thought Mimi with her sword would be strongest...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Tch, tch, tch!  
You can't judge my strength from appearances alone!  
'Cause it's not my style to rush in and fight the enemy head-on!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
You don't fight the enemy head-on?  
Then what exactly is your fighting style?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Well, I set up sneaky traps, or play tricks while the enemy's sleeping!  
Oh! And I dig some neat pitfalls, too!  
  
**Mimi & Kyoka：**  
...Whaaa?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Y'know, I was hanging from that tree just now, right?  
That's because I accidentally stepped in one of my traps  
after I finished setting it up!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Could it be that you altered the road signs around here as well?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Yup!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
So! All the trouble was because of you!  
The Demon Lord's true identity is Misogi!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? Wha? What're you on about?  
Oh... Don't tell me the two of you  
were mad about the sign stuff?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Of course we were!  
And we were not only angry, but also quite disrupted!  
Why in the world would you do such awful things?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
'Cause it's funny!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
D-did you say... "funny"...?!  
Th-that's the whole reason?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I was always told that humans  
are a shrewd and calculating race...  
I cannot believe they are actually so foolish!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
That does it!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I have decided we will go on adventures to discover  
the truths of the world that our teachers and textbooks do not tell us!  
Me and Mimi together, as a little guild of two!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Our guild will be known as Little Lyrical!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Huh? M-me too?  
Ummm... Actually, I'd rather just finish my shopping trip...  
  
**Misogi：**  
That sounds fun! I wanna join too!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Absolutely not! Demon Lord Misogi... Your wicked ways end here!  
Cosmo Blue...  
  
**Mimi：**  
L-let's not fight, let's go back to Landosol!  
I still didn't manage to buy any ingredients!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Y-you have a point...  
Misogi! Show us the way to the city!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh?  
 C'mon, that's too easy.  
You just gotta follow this sign and...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
That sign is the problem! You altered its information, didn't you?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh, right. Then we should go the opposite way... Then when we  
get to the next turning...  
 Hmm? Did I flip this one round?  
Or did I leave it?  
 Eheheh! I totally forgot!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Y-you don't remember?!  
Then how are we supposed to find our way home?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
My shopping! I'm so hungry! I wanna go home!  
Mommyyyy! Daddyyyy!  
Waaaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Narration：**  
This fateful encounter led to the creation of a very little guild.  
Its first humble mission: to buy ingredients for Mimi's dinner.  
A task that proved much more difficult than it might first have seemed...
