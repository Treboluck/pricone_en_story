# Diabolos Episode 2
Trapped in the form of a child, Illya is attacked by her own summoned bats. But when {player} saves her, she briefly regains her original form. Apparently, being close to {player} causes her to revert.
  
## Subtitle: Diabolos Is Formed!
  
**Narration：**  
A few days after her grand revival,  
Illya summons Yori and the others to her ancient castle.  
  
**Illya：**  
I have called you here to begin our conquest of the world!  
We are Diabolos, the new demon horde!  
  
**Everyone：**  
...  
  
**Illya：**  
Why the dull reaction?  
Explain your incredulous expressions at once!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Forget that boring stuff! Bring Miyako back to life now!  
  
**Akari：**  
Now now, Miyako. Illya already told you she can't do that.  
  
**Illya：**  
I never said I cannot!  
This diminutive form is merely lacking in magical energies.  
  
**Illya：**  
No, I should say it is that lack of energies  
that has reduced me to this unfortunate state.  
  
**Yori：**  
I can't believe the \"legendary vampire\"  
is just a powerless little girl...  
I guess our wishes aren't getting granted, either.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Illya. I think it would be borderline impossible  
for just the five of us to conquer the world.  
  
**Illya：**  
Indeed. Were I possessed of my full power, 'twould be trivial,  
but in this sorry state...  
Still, do not fret!  
Today I have brought an accomplice to aid in our mission!  
  
**Illya：**  
{player}!  
Come forth at once!  
  
**Everyone：**  
Ahhhhh!  
  
**Yori：**  
{player}? Wh-what're you doing here?  
Do you know Illya too?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ohhh! It's {player}!  
Did you bring pudding for Miyako?  
Gimme, gimme, gimme!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Hello, {player}.  
Incidentally, your fortune for today is...  
the worst possible luck. Please be careful.  
  
**Akari：**  
Ooh, {player}! I'm sooo happy to see you!  
My heart's pounding against my chest.  
See? Can you feel it beating?  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmm? What's this?  
You have all met {player} already?  
My, my. You're quite the salacious one.  
  
**Illya：**  
Still, he is my handpicked servant.  
Such bewitching charms may be only natural!  
Ahahahahah!  
  
**Illya：**  
Moving on. In summary, Diabolos has added a secret weapon  
known as {player} to our ranks!  
  
**Yori：**  
Some secret weapon that is!  
How's he going to help us conquer the world?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Agreed. That still makes only six of us,  
so I can't really see us achieving world domination.  
  
**Illya：**  
Heh, heh. Our numbers concern you?  
Well, it is true that an army's size is an important factor  
in determining its might. I understand your concerns.  
  
**Illya：**  
But they are misplaced. I have my own minions of the night!  
Once I call them into action, an army of darkness  
will be ours to command!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Army of darkness?  
Are they really strong?  
  
**Illya：**  
Heheheh. Seeing is believing, yes?  
Come forth, my bats!  
  
**Bad Bats：**  
SKRRREEE!  
  
**Yori：**  
Eek! W-whoa! What a huge swarm!  
She really is a vampire!  
  
**Illya：**  
Fwahahahahah! There! You see?!  
For now, my faithful bats, you may rest your wings  
over yonder.  
...Hmm? I-is there a problem, my minions?  
  
**Bad Bats：**  
SKRRREEE!  
  
**Illya：**  
O-ouch! Whaa?! What are you playing at?!  
S-stop this at once!  
  
**Illya：**  
Stupid bats... Why do they not obey my words?!  
Can my abilities truly have declined to such an extent?!  
  
**Yori：**  
Illya... How are you going to conquer the world  
if you can't conquer your own bats...?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I do wonder if she really is the legendary vampire...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Rescue Illya.  
**Choice: (2)**  Grab Illya and run away.  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
Whoa! {player},  
e-excellent work!  
Truly, you are a faithful servant!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
Wh-what are you doing, {player}?  
...A tactical retreat?  
Th-that seems wise.  
Let us regroup in a safe location!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hey! Wh-what's this now?!  
Don't pick me up like that!  
Th-this makes me look like a powerless child!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Illya：**  
I... I see you are... more reliable than I had thought.  
You have my praise, {player}.  
My... somewhat reluctant praise!  
  
**Akari：**  
Hey, Illya, your face has gone bright red!  
  
**Illya：**  
I-I am not blushing at all!  
All this fuss must have taxed this childlike body. I certainly  
was not swept off my feet by this oaf's show of manliness...  
  
**Illya：**  
Urgh... Wh-why is it that my heart races so?  
I feel peculiar all over... This is so strange!  
Unghhhhh!  
  
**Illya：**  
*gasp*  
  
**Yori：**  
I-Illya! You're... back to normal!  
  
**Illya：**  
Wh... Why, you're right! My true form has returned!  
But why now?  
  
**Bad Bats：**  
SKRRREEE!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmph. I suppose it matters little.  
For the moment,  
I must deliver punishment to these filthy flying rats.  
Vermilion Bite!  
  
**Bad Bats：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Yori：**  
O-oh, wow...  
She defeated all those monster bats with a single spell.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
So this is the legend's true power.  
  
**Illya：**  
Please. That was nothing but a parlor trick.  
I expect it will be some time before I regain my true strength.  
But for now,  
this will certainly do.  
  
**Yori：**  
Her magic's restored?  
Does that mean...  
She can grant our wishes now, then?!  
  
**Akari：**  
Really?  
Yay!  
  
**Illya：**  
From this moment forth, with my body and magic restored,  
I shall commence my conquest of the world!  
Hahahahahah!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hahahahaha...  
haah...?  
  
**Yori：**  
Sh-she turned right back into a kid.  
  
**Illya：**  
Wh-whyyyyyyy?!  
Is my magic power still too depleted?!  
  
**Illya：**  
B-but in that case, how did I wield it just moments ago?  
This makes no sense! It... It happened just after  
{player} rescued me from...  
  
**Illya：**  
H-he saved me from...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Oh.  
She's all red again!  
  
**Illya：**  
*gasp*  
  
**Everyone：**  
...  
  
**Yori：**  
Does this mean the trigger for the transformation is...  
{player}?  
  
**Illya：**  
...  
*gulp*  
  
**Narration：**  
Today, Illya learned that {player}  
can help her to regain her adult form.  
  
**Narration：**  
It's enough for her to fight in battle,  
but world domination still seems quite a way off...
