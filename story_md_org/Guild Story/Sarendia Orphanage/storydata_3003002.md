Kokkoro and {player} have come to stay at the Sarendia Orphanage. As everyone is preparing dinner, Saren comes home. She seems even more motivated to work after taking in the joy of having a new family.
  
## Subtitle: The Roles We Play
  
**Saren：**  
I'm hooome! ♪  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wagh! You startled me!  
Welcome home, milady!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I know you said you'd be home early,  
but I didn't think you meant this early.  
  
**Suzume：**  
It was such a sudden loud noise, I nearly had a heart attack!  
I could have died! ♪  
  
**Saren：**  
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.  
I think this door might be on wrong.  
That's why it makes such a loud noise when you use it.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'd like to do something about it.  
But I'm just not sure I'll have time to get to these smaller things,  
you know?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Yes, that makes sense.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, maybe {player} could help.  
He might have that manly intuition!  
I'll ask him about it later, okay?  
  
**Saren：**  
Wait, but doesn't he have amnesia?  
I don't know. Do you think he'd retain that sort of thing?  
  
**Saren：**  
Well, worst comes to worst,  
I can hire someone to take care of it.  
No need to force him if he can't.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Yes, ma'am!  
More importantly,  
work must have gone quite smoothly for you today, milady!  
  
**Suzume：**  
You're just in time. We were right in the middle of making dinner.  
I'll go ahead and get yours ready as well, milady!  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm really sorry, but I don't think I have time to eat.  
I'm actually still in the middle of work.  
I'm only taking a quick break.  
  
**Saren：**  
I just had some documents I needed to pick up here.  
That's the main reason I came back.  
  
**Saren：**  
Besides, I wanted to see how you all were doing, too.  
How are the kids?  
Getting along well, I hope?  
  
**Suzume：**  
They sure are.  
No need to worry.  
The Sarendia Orphanage is as peaceful as ever!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Not to mention,  
{player} and Kokkoro are a big help as well.  
  
**Suzume：**  
In fact, the kids seem to be quite taken with them, too.  
You should have seen them.  
They were playing all day today!  
  
**Saren：**  
Wow...  
That's really great to hear.  
  
**Saren：**  
Especially considering {player} is the only boy here.  
I was worried he might feel out of place,  
you know?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hee hee.  
Maybe in this case,  
his amnesia is a blessing in disguise.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I think they see him as more of an oddity  
than a boy.  
In fact, I'd say they're treating him more like a pet than anything else!  
  
**Saren：**  
Ahaha...  
I'm not sure how I should feel about that.  
  
**Saren：**  
Anyway, I hate to ask this of you,  
but could you go up to my study  
and fetch those documents for me?  
  
**Saren：**  
They're in the third safe from the right. I need all of them.  
In the meantime,  
I'm going to go see how the kids are doing.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Your wish is my command, milady!  
  
But you know, if all you needed was paperwork,  
you could have just called me and I would have brought them to you!  
  
**Saren：**  
Yeah, um... Sorry, but  
I'm not sure it's the best idea to put  
something that important in your hands.  
  
**Saren：**  
Don't get me wrong!  
It's not that I don't trust you,  
okay?  
  
**Saren：**  
It's just...  
You're a bit of an accident waiting to happen.  
Trouble seems to come to you whether you like it or not.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Urgh...  
I wish you weren't so right about that.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh,  
but you're in a hurry, so let me get those documents for you.  
Just leave it to me, milady!  
  
**Saren：**  
All right. I really appreciate it.  
  
**Saren：**  
Now then,  
where might those kids be?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hmm, hmm, hmm... ♪  
  
**Saren：**  
Well, well!  
It certainly seems like you're in good spirits today,  
Kurumi!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Eep!  
  
I-I...!  
I was just, um... You know!  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh,  
I'm so sorry.  
I didn't mean to scare you. Are you all right?  
  
**Saren：**  
It looks like you were in the middle of cooking.  
I hope your poor fingers are okay.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I'm... I'm okay!  
Welcome home,  
Mama Saren!  
  
**Saren：**  
Why, thank you very much.  
  
**Saren：**  
Mmm, that sure smells good!  
So tell me, what's for dinner?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hey...!  
No snacking before dinner!  
It's bad manners, Mama Saren!  
  
**Saren：**  
I couldn't help myself.  
I'm just starving!  
  
**Saren：**  
I've been having to deal with my old guild, Nightmare, all day.  
It's been meetings nonstop. The stress has been killing my appetite,  
so I haven't eaten anything until now.  
  
**Saren：**  
It's all because the other day,  
I wound up having to step in  
when they had their little dispute with Caon.  
  
**Saren：**  
Honestly, it's been such a mess.  
I really don't want to have to drag this out any longer,  
but what am I supposed to do?  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, geez.  
What am I doing complaining to you about it?  
I'm so sorry, Kurumi. You don't need to hear all this.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-it's okay,  
Mama Saren.  
I'm happy to listen if it makes you feel better.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
A-actually,  
I like knowing I can help.

**Saren：**  
Oh, thank you so much!  
Oh, I just can't get over what a sweet girl you are!  
  
Who's a good girl, now?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ah, oh no!  
  
Please be careful... I-I'm still using the stove!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hey, no fair!  
How come Kurumi's getting all the love,  
huh?!  
  
**Ayane：**  
I want headpats too,  
Mama Saren!  
  
**Saren：**  
Of course.  
Suzume told me all about how good you were today.  
I'm so proud of you.  
  
**Saren：**  
Come on over here,  
Ayane. Who's a good girl, now?  
  
**Ayane：**  
It's me! I am!  
Hee hee,  
don't forget to give Pukichi some love, too!  
  
**Saren：**  
How could I?  
There you are. Who's a good boy?  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"You call that a headpat?  
Where's all the love, huh?  
Where's all the oomph, Saren?!\"  
  
**Saren：**  
Yeesh, somebody's picky.

`image display end`  
**Saren：**  
You're not cooking, are you, Ayane?  
So is Kurumi doing it all alone?  
Where are all the others?  
  
**Ayane：**  
I-I'm not slacking off, I swear! It's just, you know, it's hard to  
cook and hold Pukichi at the same time.  
 So I've been sitting here  
reading Kurumi the recipes and taste-testing for her!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh, and by the way,  
{player} noticed that the trash was starting to pile up,  
so he went to take it out.  
  
**Ayane：**  
And Kokkoro saw we were out of some of the ingredients we needed,  
so she's out getting them for us.  
  
**Saren：**  
I see...  
As much as I wish the other kids here could help,  
I think they're a bit too young for that.  
  
**Saren：**  
So then,  
you've essentially split up the housework among everyone who can help.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Uh-huh.  
'Cause if we let Suzume do it,  
I think she'd catch the whole house on fire.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Earlier today, she was out weeding the garden,  
and she wound up waking up some underground monster.  
Do you have any idea how bad that sucked? Really bad!  
  
**Saren：**  
O-oh.  
How did that even happen?  
Monsters don't tend to show up in town.  
  
**Saren：**  
Honestly,  
only Suzume could manage something that crazy.  
I swear, she's a walking magnet for trouble.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Y-you're talking about me,  
aren't you, milady?!  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, it was nothing bad.  
That didn't take long at all.  
Do you have my papers?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Yes, ma'am!  
Your workspace was so neat and tidy,  
I found it in a heartbeat!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Is this everything,  
milady?  
  
**Saren：**  
Let me check.  
Yep,  
this is perfect. Just what I needed.  
  
**Saren：**  
Thank you so much, Suzume.  
Who's a good girl, now?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I-I don't need headpats!  
I'm not a little kid!  
  
**Saren：**  
Hehe.  
Sorry. I just can't help myself.  
  
**Saren：**  
All righty,  
now I just need to pass these along.  
Man, here's hoping this'll give us a little bit more space to breathe.  
  
**Saren：**  
I swear,  
I don't know if it's because Nightmare's been around for so long,  
or what, but...  
  
**Saren：**  
They just want paperwork for literally everything.  
It's such a pain!  
Like, are they gonna die without it, or what?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hahaha!  
That sounds pretty rough.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hm? Oh, welcome back, {player}!  
Thanks for taking the trash out for us.  
  
**Suzume：**  
You can wash your hands right over there. Now let's see,  
all that's left now is to wait for Kokkoro.  
 Then we can put the  
rest of the ingredients in the stew, and we'll be all done, I think!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wagh! Um...  
P-please don't touch the stew,  
Suzume...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Aww, but I want to cook too...  
Come on, I promise I won't mess it up!  
So please? Please?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
No...  
I-I'm sorry, but no...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Just this month,  
you blew up the kitchen three whole times,  
and you ruined our stew ten times on top of that!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I...  
I can do this, so just let me handle it!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Fine...  
I guess I can't be too upset.  
It'll be a big help if you guys can learn to help out around the house.  
  
**Suzume：**  
More importantly, milady...  
If you're still good on time,  
maybe you can have dinner with us after all!  
  
**Suzume：**  
You know,  
getting to eat with the ones you love makes the whole meal taste even better.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yeah!  
It even says it here in the recipe.  
See?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wow!  
Who would have thought a recipe could have such foresight?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I should mention,  
{player} got this recipe from a friend of his.  
The dish is so simple, even a total beginner could make it!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Y-yeah...  
It's easy enough that I can make it too.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Well, that's 'cause you're pretty much a pro chef!  
Actually, you're good at just about everything.  
I could learn a thing or two from you!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I think you could do it if you try.  
Why don't we make one together tomorrow?  
  
**Saren：**  
Well, in that case,  
I'll be sure to come home nice and early tomorrow.  
  
**Saren：**  
I just know having a nice meal surrounded by the ones I love  
will make all my stress from work fly right out the window!
