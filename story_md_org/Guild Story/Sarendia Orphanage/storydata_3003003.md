**Ayane：**  
I'm hooome! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Eep!  
Y-you scared me...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Where were you, Ayane?  
I feel like you've been going out more often lately.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Um...  
Let's just say I had some stuff to do!  
  
**Ayane：**  
I've been going out to see my parents lately, but...  
I feel like maybe I shouldn't bring that up to Kurumi.  
Her parents are Lost, after all.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Poor Kurumi.  
She doesn't have a mom or dad to go home to.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
W-what's the matter?  
Ayane?  
You look really sad...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Huh?  
Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Anyway,  
you never gave me a welcome back! Go on now!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
O-okay.  
Welcome back,  
Ayane. Hee hee.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hey, come on, where's the oomph?  
It's me, your big sis!  
  
**Ayane：**  
I get to be the big sis  
'cause I'm older than you.  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Yeah, that's right.  
And speaking of!  
You should call me your big bro!\"  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um, but... it just  
doesn't really feel like you're older than me.  
I mean, um, I can try though...  
  
**Ayane：**  
No, it's fine. I'm not gonna force you.  
See, I'm not gonna complain 'cause I'm a big girl!  
Hee hee.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Anyway, whatcha guys doing?  
It looks like you're just  
sitting on the floor with {player}.  
  
**Ayane：**  
If you guys are playing something,  
Pukichi and I wanna play too!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um...  
Well,  
Mama Saren and Suzume are busy with work, so...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
{player} has been playing with me  
all day long!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Wow!  
So you've been keeping Kurumi company today,  
{player}?  
  
**Ayane：**  
What a sweet thing for you to do!  
C'mere, you! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hee hee.  
I don't think it's appropriate for a kid like you to be treating {player} like a kid.  
Even if it is funny.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Well,  
it doesn't FEEL like he's older than me, so it's fine, right? ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Anyway, whatcha doing?  
It looks like you're playing with plushies.  
Are you playing pretend?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Kinda. We're playing house.  
I'm, um...  
Hee hee, I'm the new bride, and  
{player} is my beloved husband.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh, D-darling...  
Tonight we're having stew.  
Say, \"Aah!\" ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Wowie, that sounds fun! I wanna play too!  
You're cool with that, right? You can tell me to buzz off if you don't want me to butt in, though.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wha—I would never...  
Um, who do you wanna be?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hmm...  
  
Okay, I'll be the mom!  
And Pukichi will be the dad!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hee hee.  
I know it's just pretend...  
but this way, I can let Kurumi feel like she's with her parents again!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Okay...  
If you're the mommy,  
then I'll be the daddy's mistress.  
  
**Ayane：**  
His WHAT?!  
W-where the heck did you learn a word like that?!  
Who's poisoning your mind?!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh?!  
It was in a book I read the other day...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I already read all the picture books here,  
so I got one from Mama Saren's collection...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Mama Saren...  
Maybe don't leave those kinds of books lying around where we can find them...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh, um!  
It's not what you think! It was classic literature!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I wasn't, um, reading anything dirty. I promise!  
It was a really good book, actually. Um, do you wanna read it, Ayane?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Well...  
Nah, I don't like books. They make me sleepy.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Anyway, are we playing or what?  
What about {player}?  
Who do you wanna be?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
He can be, um... the doggy, maybe?  
Hee hee. {player},  
shake!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Holy smokes, Kurumi.  
I can't believe some of the stuff that comes outta your mouth sometimes.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Are you okay with that, {player}?  
You really wanna play the doggy, even though you're older than us? You can say no, y'know!  
  
**Ayane：**  
You're fine with it, huh...  
Well, I guess {player} is gonna be our dog!  
I'm the mom, and Pukichi is the dad!  
  
**Ayane：**  
And, uh...  
You, uh, sure you wanna do this whole mistress thing?  
You could be our precious, one-and-only daughter instead!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Uh-uh. I wanna be the mistress.  
It just sounds like it'd be fun.  
  
**Ayane：**  
D-does it?  
Well, let's get started then!  
Hee hee. It's been so long since I played house!  
  
**Saren：**  
We're home! ♪  
You all had better be playing nice in here!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Good to be home again. ♪  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm still really sorry.  
I can't believe both of us had to go somewhere at the same time...  
  
**Suzume：**  
We wanted to get out of it, but we just couldn't.  
I hope you weren't too lonely without us!  
  
**Saren：**  
I don't think they were.  
See?  
{player}'s been keeping them company the whole time.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, they look like they're having so much fun.  
I wonder what they're playing?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Do you think I'm stupid?!  
Why is SHE here?!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Don't you lie to me!  
You swore you were going to leave her!  
Then we could finally be together!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I'll kill you,  
you dirty, lying, cheating...!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Whoa, whoa, whoa!  
W-what in the world is going on here?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Kurumi's always such a little sweetheart!  
I've never heard her say something so vicious in my life!  
A-and she's trying to rip Pukichi to shreds too!  
  
**Saren：**  
H-hey, no fighting, you guys!  
What's gotten into you, Kurumi?  
  
**Saren：**  
My goodness, it sounded like you were having a real lovers' spat in here!  
Don't tell me... you're not fighting over {player}, are you?!  
  
**Saren：**  
{player}, you scoundrel!  
What did you do to them?!  
I thought you were better than this!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh?  
Oh, I'm so sorry!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-it's not his fault! We were playing house...  
I was just acting!  
  
**Suzume：**  
What?! That was all an act?  
R-really?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Well, why didn't you say so in the first place?  
My goodness, I thought we'd walked straight into a war zone!  
It sounded so real!  
  
**Saren：**  
Yeah, that's for sure.  
Kurumi, I think you might be a little actress in the making!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wha?  
I-I might be a what?  
There's no way... I can't get up on a stage!  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh right, you get really bad stage fright, huh?  
That's a shame... I was really hoping you'd be okay with it.  
We could use a budding actress right about now.  
  
**Saren：**  
See,  
I just took up an job offer to go greet the nearby senior home.  
  
**Saren：**  
Things have gotten a lot more stable for us at the Sarendia Orphanage,  
so I'd like us to go out and do some things as a guild.  
  
**Saren：**  
I was thinking, if the kids put on something like a school play for them,  
I just know it would make all those nice grandmas and grandpas really  
happy.  
 Don't you agree?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh, that sounds fun!  
I wanna act!  
I wanna be, um...  
I wanna play a princess!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I can't... I just can't.  
Playing pretend is one thing,  
but I'd have to get up on stage and act in front of a bunch of strangers.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
J-  
just thinking about it is making me so nervous, I might puke all my guts out...  
  
**Saren：**  
All of them?!  
  
**Saren：**  
It's okay. It was just one idea.  
I'm not gonna force you into anything.  
  
**Saren：**  
All I care about  
is whether all of you children are happy and healthy here.  
  
**Saren：**  
Now, more importantly, I bet you're all really hungry.  
Suzume, let's get ready for dinner.  
  
**Suzume：**  
You got it, milady!  
You kids,  
play nice until dinner's ready, okay?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh...  
Mama Saren, you're so nice to me.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I know  
you'd never do anything to make us feel bad...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
And  
I'm always asking you to take care of things for me...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But I can't keep doing that forever.  
I've never really thought about acting before...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I get so anxious in front of others,  
I can't even think straight...  
It's my biggest weakness.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But maybe if I practice for a play,  
I can get over my fear...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Maybe one day, I can stop being so scared in front of others...  
And maybe then I'll be able to speak with confidence?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Mama Saren never tells lies or says stuff just to make you feel better...  
If she says she thinks I could be an actress,  
then she definitely means it.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I'm always relying on her for everything...  
I want to show her that she can count on me too!  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm?  
What's up, Kurumi?  
Do I have something on my face?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
No, that's not...  
Um!  
You just look really pretty today!  
  
**Saren：**  
O-  
okay...  
I'm not sure where this is coming from, but  
thank you?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
*whimper*  
I can't believe I said something so weird...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I don't wanna be this way...  
I'm still scared,  
but I want to try practicing for a play.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I bet if I asked,  
Ayane and {player}  
would probably help out too.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I wanna work hard and get over this social anxiety...  
I want to be able to say the things I want to say.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I had no future ahead of me  
after my parents were Lost...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But everyone at the Orphanage took care of me, loved me, and taught me what happiness was again.  
That's why...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
All I want  
is to be able to tell them thank you for everything.
