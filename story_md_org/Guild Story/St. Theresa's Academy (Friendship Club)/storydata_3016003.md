# St. Theresa's Academy (Friendship Club) Episode 3
With their group finally registered as an official guild, the members of St. Theresa's Academy (Friendship Club) face their next challenge: providing a material demonstration of their friendship. In other words, a group project. But sadly, they arrive at the conclusion that their friendship has no form. In the terms of the layfolk, they flunk it.
  
## Subtitle: The Project Pursuers
  
**Narration：**  
Though the members of St. Theresa's Academy (Friendship Club)  
had failed miserably in their first guild registration attempt...  
  
**Narration：**  
As promised, they returned to fight another day,  
and today, through some rather forceful negotiation,  
their attempts have finally proven successful.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Let's hear it  
 for our brand-new guild!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Wooo! Bang bang toot toot!  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Toot.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That's great news!  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuni：**  
Now, young {player}. Officially speaking, this guild is  
subordinate to St. Theresa's Academy.  
 As an experimental  
transfer student, we were unable to include you in the registration.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Still,  
 this is merely a formal technicality.  
  
**Yuni：**  
In our guild activities going forward,  
precious few will be likely to pose objections  
if we count you among our constituent members.  
  
**Yuni：**  
In other words, forget the formal paperwork!  
Let me say loud and clear:  
the four of us united are the Yuni-ettes!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, not this again.  
 Slipping it into some grand statement  
does *not* let you necro that reject name outta the trash heap.  
  
**Chieru：**  
By the way, what *did* we end up putting down  
for our guild's \"goals and objectives\"?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Beats me. All I heard was Yuni rattling off  
a buncha random BS that seemed to get the job done.  
  
**Yuni：**  
\"BS\"? Perish the thought!  
 Why, \"harmonious facilitation  
of micro-societal collaboration in an academic context\"  
is the very essence of our guild's raison d'être!  
  
**Chloe：**  
That's a lotta long words for an \"essence.\"  
  
**Yuni：**  
Forgoing clarity for decorum is an entirely valid mode of expression.  
An advanced literary technique. Call it flexibility, if you will.  
  
**Chieru：**  
AKA being deliberately vague.  
  
**Chloe：**  
In other words, \"random BS.\"  
  
**Yuni：**  
Finesse is what holds society together.  
I merely presented our given task of \"becoming friends\"  
in the most appropriate terms for the situation.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yuni's right, Chloe!  
Who even cares what our objective is on paper?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, you're the one who asked.  
Don't switch sides and make me the bad guy.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Anyway!  
Point is, we're all in the same buddy bunch together now!  
So! Let's be the most chellerific buds we can be!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Yeah!  
`Tag 2`  
**Chloe：**  
...Yeah, sure, I guess.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Good day, girls.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Our scholarship seekers are...  
 yes, all present, it seems.  
Well then, please take your seats.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Now...  
I trust you have all now come to terms  
with the nature of the goal you have been tasked with.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Indeed.  
We are to deepen our social bonds,  
with one another and with that young man.  
  
**Yuni：**  
And on that front, you need not worry. All is going well.  
So well, in fact, that we have already formed a guild together.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Very good.  
 Then one week hence,  
I and the other teachers will carry out your final test.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Test. Huh. Of what.  
  
**Teacher：**  
We will seek to assess the strength  
of the bonds you have formed with this transfer student  
by judging your performance together in person.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I see.  
 And if we pass this test,  
the scholarship funds will be ours to claim.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hm? So what exactly happens in the test, then?  
What do we need to do to convince you?  
  
**Teacher：**  
I cannot answer that.  
Finding the answer for yourselves is an important part of the task.  
  
**Teacher：**  
In other words, the test has already begun!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Blech, not this again...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Deliberately vague.  
  
**Chloe：**  
What she said.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Well, that concludes today's meeting.  
I shall see you all in a week. Good day.  
  
**Yuni：**  
So, my dear fellows.  
Let us commence our second  
Emergency Scholarship Qualification Meeting.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Just as before, we Yuni-ettes must face the daunting task  
of proving our friendship to the academy.  
  
**Chieru：**  
True enough.  
Just as before, we of St. Theresa's Academy (Friendship Club)  
must face the daunting task of proving our friendship to the academy.  
  
**Yuni：**  
As such, maximizing the visibility of our bonds  
should be the Yuni-ettes' next objective.  
  
**Chieru：**  
That's right!  
Maximizing the visibility of our bonds  
should be the St. Theresa's Academy (Friendship Club)'s next objective!  
  
**Chloe：**  
So, uh, I gotta say...  
What's the deal here. Déjà vu?  
Didn't we have literally this same conversation the other day.  
  
**Yuni：**  
We did.  
That was what led us to the conclusion of forming our own guild.  
But it seems our judges are, alas, not so easily satisfied.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Which brings us to our so-called final test.  
As usual, Mother Hilda's explanation was most vague, but...  
Have we any thoughts?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Mm, well... If we're playing this straight...  
Some kinda arts or crafts? Like, a group project?  
That's what you'd expect from this kinda deal. At least, I would.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, I see.  
A most scholastic of traditions indeed.  
Yes, let's try pursuing that angle.  
  
**Chieru：**  
So we draw a pretty picture together?  
  
**Yuni：**  
That would be one example.  
Hrm, what other options might we have?  
Theatrical drama,  
 or perhaps a musical performance?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Singing!  
Ooh, I wanna put on a concert!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Hm? Where'd that come from. You lose all your screws?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well! I went to one of Carmina's performances the other day,  
and hearing them live, it was just like, beyond hype!  
Isn't that the highest dream to aspire to?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh... You're one of those idol stans.  
  
**Chieru：**  
You bet I am! Idol girl groups are like, *so* my jam!  
I mean, people ask me \"Why aren't *you* up there singing?\"  
and I get where they're coming from, but still!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Wait... Who the heck asks that.  
Like this girl needs an ego boost.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Car-minna? What is that? A foreign delicacy?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh?! You're telling me you've never heard of Carmina?!  
They're only the hottest idols in all of Landosol!  
Are you even living?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, I guess if it's Carmina... I kinda get that.  
Like, I've never subscribed to all this idol junk,  
but those girls, I think I could actually stan 'em.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Right? Right?!  
They're the adorbest of the adorb!  
The tunes, the moves, the styles! It's all on a totally different level!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, not that. They're strong.  
Have you seen 'em kick monster butt? 'Cause it's outta this world.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. To sum up, this \"Carmina\" must be some kind of military band?  
{player}, are you familiar with them?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Um... Car-who did you say?  
**Choice: (4)**  Oh, Nozomi and her friends.  
`Tag 3`  
**Chieru：**  
Wow. Lameass.  
Not knowing Carmina's like, lower than the lowest low.  
This is what's wrong with you, {player}.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Chieru：**  
Wow. Creep-o.  
Trying to make out like you're pals with them?  
This is what's wrong with you, {player}.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Yuni：**  
Please, no need to fret, young Chieru.  
While I do now appreciate your passion, we're getting sidetracked.  
Our goal at hand is to secure this scholarship for—  
  
**Chieru：**  
Of course—that's it!  
I just had the idea of the century!  
  
**Chieru：**  
For this big test, why don't we put on a full Carmina cover concert?  
See, there's three of us and everything!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, count one more time.  
The goal, remember?  
You're forgetting literally the most important piece.  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Wha. Don't tell me *you* want to sing, {player}?  
  
**Yuni：**  
The open disgust in your voice seems quite excessive.  
  
**Chieru：**  
But this is *Carmina*. Aren't they a bit, um, out of your league? Huh? Who'd you be? The producer?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Forget him, *I'm* nixing this concert crap.  
Like, belting tunes in frilly threads to a room of stony teachers?  
Just shoot me dead, why don't you.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrmm...  
The concert notion itself is a truly magical prospect,  
but given the context, it does indeed sound outright hellish.  
  
**Chieru：**  
But... if we work on the musical angle now,  
won't it be easier to put out discs later on?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Wait, young Chieru.  
At what point did we become an idol unit for you to promote?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Obviously at the end of the story,  
we'll need a character song over the credits, too!  
  
**Yuni：**  
And since when is a theatrical screening in the cards?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Either way, you gotta admit a concert's seriously out.  
We'd just end up with all those bigwigs  
giving us a full lecture on taking school assignments seriously.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ehhh~? Then what *are* we gonna do?  
  
**Yuni：**  
That's what we're discussing.  
But all the ideas we have so far are art and music.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, I nixed music already.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Then by process of elimination, art it must be.  
  
**Chieru：**  
So, we... draw a picture? Together?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Like, what?  
Get a carpet-size sheet of paper?  
And all of us grab brushes the size of mops and run hollering across it?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ohhh! That sounds like fun!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Sometimes the mini doctor goes full Chieru on us, too...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Then so be it!  
Tomorrow, we assemble in an open space.  
And it is there that we begin our first joint endeavor!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Chelly morning~! ☆  
  
**Chloe：**  
Mm, so?  
We've got the gear and laid out a big ol' sheet...  
Now where do we start.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm... This textbook suggests  
it's best to begin with a rough sketch in paler colors.  
  
**Chloe：**  
A sketch.  
Uh, so who here knows how to draw.  
It's not really my thing... Yuni, how 'bout you?  
  
**Yuni：**  
There was a time when I took to the easel and canvas.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh... Then you *can* draw.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Unlike in academia, art has no clear answers.  
While I do take pride in my artistic achievements,  
I cannot guarantee others will see them in the same light.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeah, no need for the spiel.  
Here's a brush.  
Just show us what you can do.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Swish, swash, swoosh...  
  
**Yuni：**  
There! That should do it. Thoughts, my friends?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Eh? What *is* this?  
Some kind of demon-summoning ritual thing?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Actually...  
Dr. Yuni, have you ever thought about seeing the school shrink?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Simpleton.  
 This isn't some expression of repressed childhood trauma.  
It's merely a portrait of young {player}.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, this is {player}...?  
We've been trying to build a friendship with *this* monster?  
Wow, talk about a close encounter. I rank it Keter.  
  
**Chieru：**  
If pious old Mother Hilda saw this, forget passing or failing,  
we'd be expelled on the spot for blasphemy and demon worship.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I'm an impressionist.  
But alas, an artist is never appreciated in her own lifetime...  
  
**Yuni：**  
How are your own artistic inclinations, young Chieru?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hmmm, that's a tricky one.  
I've never tried,  
 but I bet I could do better than this, at least.  
  
**Yuni：**  
He who climbs not knows not the mountain's measure.  
Young Chieru, your naive presumption may be only human,  
but in time you will see. Some things require a flair of true genius.  
  
**Chieru：**  
That's a wrap!  
I had a go at drawing {player} too!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Holy crap!  
We're not worthy!  
  
**Chieru：**  
I figured he'd make a bit of a dull model as is,  
so I bumped him a few steps up on the hottie scale!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, I forgot...  
We have a prodigy in our midst.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh? The sketch's all done?  
Nice work, Chieru.  
  
**Chieru：**  
No, no, I couldn't've done it without all your support!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. Initially I had my concerns,  
but group efforts like this are most enjoyable once you get into them.  
The magic of youth surrounds us.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Right?! It's *so* magical!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, if you say so.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Now we just gotta color it.  
Let's get that done before the sun goes down.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes.  
 So, as we discussed before,  
let's each grab a mop and take our stations.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ready... Go!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Heurggghhyaaaaaahhh!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Hey... Don't go crazy now.  
I get you're all hyped up from making it this far, but...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ho-hoh? Young Chieru is going all out.  
As her elder and superior, I can't be outdone!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Geurggghhhhyaaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Not you too.  
Ah, man, if they trip and spill that paint, we'll be back to square one...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  They're having so much fun, though.  
`Tag 6`  
**Chloe：**  
Mm... Well, sure.  
So it's fine, then, I guess.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh? No, I don't...  
I mean, why would I want to go wild too.  
That's so not me, right?  
  
**Chloe：**  
It's just, like, y'know?  
Feels kinda lame standing around on my own?  
So I guess I could *think* about joining in...  
  
**Chieru & Yuni：**  
Waaghhh!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh? What's up now—  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ahhhhh, young Chloe, look out! The paint!  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Uweghh?  
  
**Chieru：**  
And the bucket! Doooodge!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, I can't see a thin—  
  
**Chloe：**  
Guahhh!  
  
**Chieru & Yuni：**  
Chloeeeeee!  
  
**Yuni：**  
A-are you hurt, young Chloe?!  
I'm sorry, young Chieru has wrought a disaster!  
  
**Chieru：**  
A-are you alive there, Chloe?!  
I'm sorry, our Dr. Yuni's such a hopeless klutz!  
  
**Chloe：**  
...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Um... no response?  
What have you done, young Chieru?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
She's lying facedown, not moving a muscle!  
This is way too awful, Dr. Yuni!  
  
**Yuni：**  
What shall... we do...?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wait, this isn't one of those scenes, is it?  
Where she doesn't get up  
because she's totally fuming and livid...?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Awawawah! Hurry and apologize, young Chieru!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Y-y-y-you said it! Kneel on the ground and grovel, Dr. Yuni!  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Hahah...  
  
**Yuni：**  
A-ahhh! Look, she's laughing!  
Young Chloe's shoulders are trembling with mirth!  
I knew she was a kind soul. Of course she wouldn't blame us for—  
  
**Chloe：**  
Hahah... ahahahah...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hmm?  
 She's still facedown, but she's writing in the dirt?  
  
**Yuni：**  
D-dear me...  
This is almost like one of those \"dying messages.\"  
Hahaha. Let's not joke about such morbid things, shall we...?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wh-what's she writing, exactly...?  
Ummm... let's see... \"I take that as a challenge\"?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Heheheh... Ahahahahah...  
  
**Chieru & Yuni：**  
Awa... awawawawahhh...!  
  
**Chloe：**  
All right... Since you asked for it...  
  
**Chieru & Yuni：**  
E-eeeek!

![301600301.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/301600301.webp)  
**Chloe：**  
I'm gonna murder you so dead!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Aaaaaaghhhhh!  
  
**Chieru：**  
W-w-w-we're sorryyyyyy!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huargh! Yeargh! Graaaaaghh!  
  
**Yuni：**  
W-wait! Stop this, young Chloe!  
Is the noble goal of love, peace and friendship  
not the proud motto of the Yuni-ettes?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
That's right! It's the proud motto of the Friendship Club!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Then why... don't we all have a friendly *murder party*, huhhh?!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  You all get along so well...  
`Tag 7`  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, don't worry, {player}.  
I'm not leaving you out!

`image display end`  
**Teacher：**  
Ah, good day.  
Excellent—all four of you are present.  
  
**Teacher：**  
It's time to see what you have prepared.  
All of us judges have been eagerly awaiting this all week!  
So, let us begin your final qualification test.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I'm afraid that simply won't be possible.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Oh?  
  
**Chloe：**  
We're not making excuses. It's just, in this world,  
there are some things that are too special to portray in images.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Fickle idolatry can twist the heart of a religion.  
That's the conclusion this week has led us to reach.  
  
**Yuni：**  
What matters lies in our hearts.  
Not in outward appearances.  
We need only trust in ourselves and believe.  
  
**Chieru：**  
That's right!  
So this is our final answer!  
  
**Chieru：**  
The bond we share has no physical form!  
  
**Yuni：**  
*smirk*  
  
**Teacher：**  
...*sigh*  
  
**Teacher：**  
Yes, I see. All too clearly.  
You didn't finish your project.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Well then, we'll repeat the test another time.  
Please keep up your efforts. Good day.  
  
**All：**  
Huh...?  
  
**All：**  
Whaaaaa—?!  
  
**Narration：**  
And the St. Theresa's Academy (Friendship Club) members' cries  
echoed endlessly through the halls of the school.
