# St. Theresa's Academy (Friendship Club) Episode 2
In order to secure their scholarship, Yuni, Chloe and Chieru are forced to band together in pursuit of friendship. As a starting point, they decide to form their own guild, but the Guild Association refuses their application on grounds of lack of purpose.

**Narration：**  
Brought together by their common desire for cash,  
Yuni, Chloe and Chieru are now faced with a boy they all recognize.  
Thus the scholarship briefing becomes a whirlwind of surprises...  
  
**Teacher：**  
Ahem. Settle down.  
Now, if we're ready, let's hear the transfer student  
introduce himself properly.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm {player}.  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's all get along.  
`Tag 1`  
`Tag 2`  
**Teacher：**  
It just so happens that when our academy began the search  
for a deeply respectable young man to take part in this exercise...  
  
**Teacher：**  
We received an enthusiastic recommendation  
from Miss Io of Lucent Academy, offering a most suitable student.  
  
**Teacher：**  
In her words, young {player} is always calm and composed,  
and ever cordial with his female peers;  
the very picture of an affable Landosol gentleman.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Ah, but it seems such introductions are unnecessary.  
May I take it that you are all acquainted with him already?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh... Well. I do know him, yeah...  
  
**Chieru：**  
I know him too, buuut... how to say this...  
There's something bugging me about those tags you gave him...  
  
**Teacher：**  
What's this?  
Why are the three of you staring so incredulously?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Deeply respectable...?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Calm and composed...?  
  
**Chieru：**  
A gentleman... Pfft.  
  
**Chloe：**  
She sure knows how to pick 'em, that Io from Lucy AC.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Do you have objections?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well, no,  
 I suppose from a certain perspective,  
those assessments may be somewhat difficult to entirely dismiss, but...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ehhhh~? You think he's a \"Landosol gentleman\"?  
  
**Teacher：**  
Whatever is all this, girls?  
If you are so displeased with him,  
we can request that Lucent Academy send us a different student...  
  
**Yuni：**  
No, I cannot object.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, me neither, I guess... He's as good as anyone.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yep.  
I'm not keen on boys, but I guess I can deal with him.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Oh, well then!  
In that case, I will leave this task in your hands.  
May the blessings of heaven be with you.  
  
**Yuni：**  
So, my dear fellows.  
Let us commence our first  
Emergency Scholarship Qualification Meeting.  
  
**Yuni：**  
The key to prevailing in our shared goal  
is to make friends with {player}, or so it would seem.  
What say you?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Objection! Me and {player} are like,  
totally the bestest of buds already.  
 Right~? ★  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. Is this a contest?  
In that case, I could say the same of myself.  
 Right~? ★  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh. So it's like that.  
Well, sure. Whatever.  
...Right?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, but wait a moment.  
In this instance, it's not our individual bonds that are in question.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Harmony with foreign cultures—those were Mother Hilda's words.  
The academy's wish is to observe our friendship as a group,  
as a sign of their own future prosperity.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  What's all this about?  
`Tag 3`  
**Yuni：**  
Oh? Did Mother Hilda not inform you of the details?  
I see...  
 In that case, I will explain in due course.  
  
**Yuni：**  
For now, we are undecided on how to proceed.  
We must reach an agreement.  
While we do, let's see... Why not apply yourself to physical education?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Start doing exercises.  
**Choice: (5)**  Pull out a textbook.  
`Tag 4`  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? The heck're you doing, {player}?  
Standing up and sitting down at breakneck speed? That's just scary.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Actually, that's really distracting...  
Sorry, but can you, like. Do that in the corner or something.  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Chieru：**  
Ah!  
Objection! The boy flipped straight to the sex ed pages!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Not the finest idea.  
Let's see... perhaps dietary sciences would be more age-appropriate.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Chieru：**  
'Kay, so, back on topic.  
Where were we? You were saying something, Yuni?  
About individuals and groups and stuff?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes. In short... To fulfill our patrons' wishes,  
I expect we four will need to form a single \"friendship group\" together.  
  
**Yuni：**  
The \"group\" aspect is of utmost importance.  
It's meaningless for any one of us to befriend him alone.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well said.  
Chieru, you listening?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ummm...  
I hate to ask, but what kind of character do you take me for, exactly?  
  
**Chloe：**  
A people-pleasing suckup.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wha...?! No way, she's sussed me! Oh, shucks!  
Chloe, don't tell me you've always been watching me from afar?!  
Aww, so sorry! I'm not ready to go out with anyone right now!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Young Chloe.  
It would appear you have experienced a most sudden romantic defeat.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Hey, Yuni.  
Can I, like, punch this clown in the gut.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Patience, my dear.  
If you must, do so after our goal is fulfilled.  
For now, we must attend to our task of becoming friends.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh~?  
But haven't we, like, totally done that already? We're friends, right?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oh?  
 Are we really?  
A-are you sure? Eheheh...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh god, no.  
Friends, ten minutes after you just met?  
That's like, actual horror show levels of normie brain.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Awww...  
  
**Chieru：**  
No, really! We're best buds!  
Aren't all these jabs from Chloe just blatant proof of that?  
Can't start teasing each other 'til you get along!  
 Right~?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Grrr...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm... In any case, our friendship is not our own to judge.  
That's for our patrons in the academy's upper echelons to decide.  
  
**Chloe：**  
What a uselessly vague condition.  
I mean, friendship? What's that?  
What kind of ruler you gonna measure it with?  
  
**Yuni：**  
I have long pondered this.  
It's quite the philosophical labyrinth.  
  
**Chloe：**  
God, who knows.  
 Hey, isn't this stuff, like, your field, Chieru?  
Go on, spill it. How's a girl like you define friendship.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well, let's see...  
 Friends do stuff like...  
go on group trips and take lots of cute snaps together, right?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Cute trips, you say!  
 That does sound magical.  
Yes, let's do it.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh? Who's paying?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ngh... Th-the magic of youth does not come cheap...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, but if we're going to get this scholarship,  
can't we fund our trips and stuff with that?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Whatever shall we do, Chloe?  
It seems our flighty friend views this scholarship  
as a working adult might view an end-of-year bonus.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, haven't you gotten that plan backwards?  
Since when've we got the cash already?  
Put the means before the goal. Or what, you got a time machine?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ummm... Chloe?  
Most of the stuff I say is just wild spur-of-the-moment fancies,  
so you really don't need to take it so seriously!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Who's being serious. I'm just putting you in your place.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Still, cute group photographs...  
 The idea itself is surprisingly sound.  
Mental states are not easy to judge, so physical evidence will surely work to our advantage.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ahh... Y'know, I actually kinda get that.  
It's like the guys I see at work always say.  
\"Talk with your wallet, not your face.\"  
  
**Yuni：**  
That sounds concerningly like a stereotypical scene of criminal extortion,  
but yes, the principle is there. Hard evidence speaks volumes.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well then, why not start from the goal?  
Like, um... We could start our own guild together!  
Make our group totally official in a jiffy!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Right... Something they can't deny.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yeppity-yep!  
If we're fully registered as a guild,  
who's gonna doubt we're all the best of buddies?  
  
**Chieru：**  
And like, once we're a guild,  
I bet we'd end up as friends for realsies, too.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I see. A fine proposal indeed.  
A guild... That does sound magical.  
Young Chloe, are you with us on this?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh... Well, guess I'm fine with whatever.  
  
**Chloe：**  
I mean, yeah... sounds good to me.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Then it's settled!  
Let's all mosey off  
 with a cheru~n ☆  
to the lovely old Guild Association!  
  
**Karin：**  
You're applying to establish a new guild?  
In that case, I'll need a representative...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Sure! That's me!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Move it.  
Not her. You can talk to this runt.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hello. It's a pleasure.  
I am the guildmaster, Yuni.  
  
**Karin：**  
R-right. Lovely to meet you.  
Well then, can I start by asking your guild's name, please?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Our guild's... name?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh!  
Of course, I completely forgot.  
We're not gonna get anywhere without a name, are we?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Interesting.  
By giving a name to the uncertain, we tether it to reality.  
Hrm, a most logical step. I dub our guild the Yuni-ettes.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Hell no.  
  
**Chieru：**  
That's a nope from me.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Come now, my friends.  
Let's be more constructive with our discussion.  
If you dislike this option, I trust you have a superior alternative.  
  
**Chloe：**  
No, uh, I mean.  
Can't we just use our school's name like regular students?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ehhh~?  
There's gotta be a cuter option than that!  
Like \"Something Something Cherurun\" or \"Chelly-Chelly Whatsit\"!  
  
**Chloe：**  
You sure love yourself, huh.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yep, I'm crazy for me!  
 Cheru~n! ☆  
  
**Yuni：**  
Now, now, young Chieru, let's not lose sight of our objective.  
We need this guild to represent our unity as a group.  
It would hardly be right to name it solely after a single member.  
  
**Chloe：**  
I wanna say \"Well said,\"  
but look in a mirror before you talk, Little Miss Yuni-ettes.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Young Chloe, can we not agree to briefly put that matter aside?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Briefly? I'm gonna bury it forever. Like, in hell, maybe.  
  
**Yuni：**  
As young Chloe rightly reminded us, we should all bear in mind  
that this group is dependent upon St. Theresa's Academy.  
As such, our name should be befitting of that fine institution.  
  
**Chloe：**  
You mean... like a \"study group\" or a \"student society\" or whatever?  
I dunno, uh, kinda like \"The Friendship Research Team\" or something?  
  
**Chieru：**  
If we're a school club,  
 why not just be the Friendship Club?  
Oh boy! It's so simple it's perfect!  
It sounds super cute *and* super friendly!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Hell no.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I think not.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes... With that said,  
I think the time has come for \"Yuni-ettes\"  
to rearise like a phoenix from the flames.  
  
**Chloe：**  
No, that's still somehow worse.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Nope means nope. The Yuni-ettes can get comfortable  
with their friendly neighborhood flames of hell.  
  
**Karin：**  
Ummm...?  
I'm sorry, is this going to take a while?  
We do have other applicants waiting in line...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, no, we're done.  
Just sign us up under \"St. Theresa's Academy.\"  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ahh... You can't just decide that...!  
  
**Chieru：**  
And don't forget to write \"(Friendship Club)\" at the end, too!  
  
**Karin：**  
As you wish!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Wh-what?! Is that a valid move?!  
In that case, be sure to add \"(Yuni-ettes)\" after that!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Too long.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Way too long.  
  
**Karin：**  
I'm afraid there won't be room...  
  
**Yuni：**  
N... nghhh...!  
  
**Karin：**  
Great, then it's settled!  
\"St. Theresa's Academy (Friendship Club)\"  
will be your official registered guild name.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hmph.  
 I'm sure it's the name of \"Yuni-ettes\"  
that the world will remember us by.  
  
**Karin：**  
Now then, next I need to hear your guild's main goals and objectives.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Goals.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Objectives.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Um... Do we actually have any of those?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. One could say we do.  
To become friends, just as the name suggests.  
  
**Karin：**  
To become friends.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well, true.  
I guess that is the only goal we've really got right now!  
  
**Karin：**  
To become... friends...?  
  
**Chloe：**  
What. You got a problem?  
  
**Karin：**  
Well, yes... I'm very sorry.  
We're not really allowed to register an official guild  
without at least some kind of productive purpose...  
  
**Yuni：**  
...  
  
**Karin：**  
Those are the rules, you see!  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Hrm. We'll be back. Retreat!  
  
**Narration：**  
After charging in without anything resembling a plan,  
the members of \"St. Theresa's Academy (Friendship Club)\"  
were forced to abandon their goal for the day.
