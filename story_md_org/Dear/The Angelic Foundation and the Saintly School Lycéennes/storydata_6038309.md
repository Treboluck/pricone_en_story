## Subtitle: Circuitous Locutions
  
**Yuni：**  
Hmph. Those dullard engineers. They said I speak in circuitous locutions  
devoid of meaning. For the moment, I spat at their feet,  
 but tell me now.  
Do you think that any of my past statements  
 require further explanation?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Why do people call you \"Doctor Yuni\"?  
**Choice: (2)**  What are the world's \"hidden truths\"?  
**Choice: (3)**  What's all this \"magic of youth\" stuff?

**Yuni：**  
Oh, don't call me that. An honorary title is little more than a nickname—  
a proverbial carrot dangled by the academy. They welcomed me once as  
a promising star... though it wasn't long before I was branded an outcast.

Ahhh... Yes, what indeed? The words trigger a feeling akin to nostalgia.  
As if I'd forgotten them long ago, yet they never left my mind.

need to note them down. More relevantly, let's do guild stuff, my friend!

**Yuni：**  
Ah, yes. I'm always seeking that answer. Yet it's like grasping at a cloud.  
Atop a far-off peak, it towers plain for the eye to see, but fades into mist  
as I approach...  
 Hrm, that was a poetic analogy.  
 You should note it down.
