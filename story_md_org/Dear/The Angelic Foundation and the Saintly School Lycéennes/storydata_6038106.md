## Subtitle: All About Tamaki
  
**Chieru：**  
That Tamaki girl is pretty cute, with all her meowing and stuff.  
 She pulls  
off the kitty thing so well, I wanna give her a chelly-chell under the chin!  
I get the feeling she's got a secret, though.  
 What do you know about her?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She's a catgirl.  
**Choice: (2)**  She's a taiyaki seller.  
**Choice: (3)**  She's the Phantom Cat.

**Chieru：**  
Um, yes. Like, who could mistake her for a dog?  
 Oh, that reminds me!  
When we first formed our guild, I was listed as a beastgirl by mistake!  
I wonder what animal they thought I was. An angel or goddess, maybe?!

Yeppers! I drop by that stall all the time! It's meowthwateringly good!  
Oh, that's right! I think her meows have rubbed off on me a bit!  
But hey, it's cute, so I figure I can roll with it.  
 Ain't that mewtiful?

\"Phantom\"...?  
 Huh? Where'd you get that fancy-sounding name from?  
You gone all Chloe in the head? Are you OK?  
 But wait. \"Phantom Cat\"...  
There's a thief called that already!  
 You can't steal other people's ideas!
