## Subtitle: Our Business Proposals
  
**Yuni：**  
Alas, the angels chose not to grant the Yuni-ettes their blessings.  
Our ideas themselves seemed like perfectly ludicrous... I mean, lucrative  
business proposals...  
 So tell me. Which of them would you have chosen?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Your explosive firework show.  
**Choice: (2)**  Chloe's original clothing brand.  
**Choice: (3)**  Chieru's Chatterbox Chellypon.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuni：**  
You dolt. It was no show.  
 That finale was a regrettable yet unavoidable  
accident. Are we clear? If anyone asks, repeat that statement verbatim.  
Worry not—this world is built on lies.  
 Yunicopter?  
 Never heard of it.

`Tag 2`  
**Yuni：**  
Yes. Her fashion sense is no joke; she simply misjudged the branding.  
How about this: I'll draw some logos myself to print on all her items.  
Come now—first I'll decorate your cloak with a cute self-portrait. Huahh!

`Tag 3`  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm, a fine choice.  
 It was young Chloe and I that created it, you know.  
Young Chieru did supply a plethora of vocal samples,  
 but the distinctions  
between those hundreds of \"cheru~n\" varieties continue to elude me.
