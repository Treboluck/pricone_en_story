## Subtitle: Recent Activities of the Yuni-ettes
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, my compatriot. So today we meet. No, it's fine. You have your social  
net to weave. I can't ask you to visit this school every day.  
 So, how is life  
of late?  
 ...Oh? What about us? Hrm.  
 Let's both share our news, shall we?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What have you been up to?  
**Choice: (2)**  What's Chloe been up to?  
**Choice: (3)**  What's Chieru been up to?

**Yuni：**  
Me, you ask? Let's see.  
 I've been busy administrating our guild activities.  
But that's natural. It's not young Chloe's forte, and young Chieru is... yes.  
Given their flighty ways, only I can bear the cross of responsibility.

**Yuni：**  
Young Chloe?  
 I hear she took on a job to save the world.  
 An unlikely tale.  
One wonders if this world merits saving.  
 I, meanwhile, stayed home  
to consolidate knowledge. In the terms of the layfolk, I caught some Z's.

**Yuni：**  
Ah, young Chieru.  
 Like you, she is by nature a social animal. On days with  
no guild activities, she fosters friendships in this academy and outside it.  
...We can't fall behind. Let's build our own affinity! Quality over quantity!
