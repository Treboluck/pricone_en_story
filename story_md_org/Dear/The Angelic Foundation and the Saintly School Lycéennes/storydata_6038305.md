## Subtitle: All About Yukari
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm? What is this strange scent? *sniff sniff* It reminds me a little  
of Dr. Mitsuki's tonics...  
 Oh? Yukari was here recently?  
If this is her aroma... could she be a scholar of chemistry or medicine?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She's a very grown-up woman.  
**Choice: (2)**  She's a former holy knight.  
**Choice: (3)**  She's a drunkard.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuni：**  
A grown-up woman.  
 Ah! You mean an individual much like myself.  
...Young man. Stop gazing at my body with that quizzical expression.  
Forget the outer shell. I mean the essence—the age of the soul within.

**Yuni：**  
Wait. I believe holy knights are virtuous elites. They need the discipline to  
resist temptation.  
 Given Yukari's barley antics, that seems...  
 Ah, but no.  
What if she was ousted due to those habits?  
 That *would* make sense.

`Tag 3`  
**Yuni：**  
I knew it. Well, I'll feign polite ignorance.  
 In life, there are times when  
we adults can't help but drink.  
 You'll see someday. Or do you wish to try  
now? Worry not. Dr. Mitsuki's potions are both legal and safe. In theory.
