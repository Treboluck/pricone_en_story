So... Yukari. She balances the Mercs' books, so she's gotta have skills.  
Right now, I'm mostly seeing her as a broth-chugging barley maniac,

**Choice: (1)**  She's a very grown-up woman.  
**Choice: (2)**  She's a former holy knight.  
**Choice: (3)**  She's a broth-chugging barley maniac.

Yeeep.  
 But listen, dude. I meant *aside* from that. There's gotta be more.  
Even that tankard-toter can't be drunk as a skunk from noon till...  
Huh? She *does* start early? ...I see. Then... Yeah, you win.
