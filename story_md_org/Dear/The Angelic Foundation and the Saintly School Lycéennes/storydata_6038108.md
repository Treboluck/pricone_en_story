## Subtitle: Our Business Proposals
  
**Chieru：**  
Ugh, so dumb! Like, can you believe those Merc gals?!  
Our pitches weren't even bad at all!  
 Um, so, just out of interest,  
which of our ideas set your heart on fire the hottest?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Yuni's Floaty-Woaty Yunicopter.  
**Choice: (2)**  Chloe's original clothing brand.  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm really not into the heart-burning thing.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chieru：**  
Oh... yes. The concept of cute snaps anywhere and everywhere was solid.  
But a product that causes explosive accidents is *so* unprofessional.  
Well, that girl's in the \"-ettes\" corner, so she's no associate of ours!

**Chieru：**  
Oh, I get you! Our Chloe has a real spark of talent as a designer!  
 And to  
me, her dead-honest advice is more of a pro than a con!  
 All she's missing  
is the ability to sell stuff...  
 Hm. That's a deal-killer. Guess she's a dud.

**Chieru：**  
Oh?! My Chatterbox Chellypon?! I knew it! You've got such good taste!  
She's the revolutionary result of all three of our efforts, after all!  
Ahah! As her producer, I'm so proud she earned your respect!
