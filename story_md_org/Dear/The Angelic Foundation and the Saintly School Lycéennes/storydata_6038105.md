Hey, what gives? What's going on here?!  
Our Chloe, the queen of not giving a hoot,  
 goes all hearts-in-the-eyes  
as soon as that Mifuyu girl walks in the room! Who even is she?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She's an efficiency demon.  
**Choice: (2)**  She's a part-timer.  
**Choice: (3)**  She's the Dragon Slayer.

Crazy focused on efficiency? Oh, huh!

Ooh... A freelance ace? She does it all, from deliveries to merc jobs?  
I see, I see. That kind of life fits my try-it-all philosophy to a tee.

 Hmm... I dig it.  
 Swoon.

Yes, that's it! The thing Chloe couldn't stop harping on about.  
Hey, d'you think if I had a cool moniker, Chloe'd go crazy for me too?  
Can you call me the Pink Typhoon? Or the Pretty Goddess of Chaos?
