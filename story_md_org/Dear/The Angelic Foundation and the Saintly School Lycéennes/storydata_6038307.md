## Subtitle: Presenting Precious Pals
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, my research fellow. Here's one nugget of wisdom I gleaned from this  
project.  
 Presentations are a surprisingly difficult art to master.  
 We must  
practice.  
 Let's see... Try lecturing me about one of the guilds you know.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Introduce the Gourmet Guild.  
**Choice: (2)**  Introduce Little Lyrical.  
**Choice: (3)**  Introduce Forestier.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuni：**  
A food-tasting guild?  
 Hrm. As you know, I take little interest in food, so...  
What? They even eat monsters?  
 That *is* intriguing. It sparks my curiosity.  
In layfolk's terms...  
 How crazy is that?  
 Yes, that's it! How crazy indeed! ☆

**Yuni：**  
Oh, the young trio you invited to that social event.  
 I've acquainted myself  
with them already. I supported them in a simulation of family life.  
 It was  
a struggle to align myself with their values,  
 but this too is an elder's duty.

`Tag 3`  
**Yuni：**  
Ah! Young Aoi's guild in the Elven Forest.  
 I believe the guildmaster is  
a certain Miss Misato... What? She's famed as a motherly saint?!  
 Tell me  
more.  
 ...No, no, leave this Hatsune girl aside.  
 Tell me about Miss Misato.
