**Chloe：**  
So listen. The Merc gals. They've all got crazy talents, right?  
But then that Tamaki girl just seems like a meowing weirdo.  
Like, I dunno. I get a weird sense that she's hiding *something...*  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She's a catgirl.  
**Choice: (2)**  She's a taiyaki seller.  
**Choice: (3)**  She's the Phantom Cat.

**Chloe：**  
Uh, yeah. Anyone can see that. Not like I ever hear her say \"woof.\"  
Huh? She's cute?  
 Blech, you sucker... Who actually goes for all that  
kitty bunk? I'd rather die than stan that. Mega-lame. Nyasty AF.

**Chloe：**  
Yeah, so I hear. But weren't her profits listed at 500 mil a year?  
How's a street stall make that?  
 Like, uh, is taiyaki a code for something?  
What if the stall's a front, and she really sells... \"catnip\"?  
 Sorry not sorry.

**Chloe：**  
Eh? Uh, weird joke to flex. Like, I know the Cat. Steals from villains and  
gives their cash to the poor, right?  
 Actually, one of my gigs got hit by her.  
And like, fair, but...  
 Tch. Someday I'll teach that cat burglar a lesson.
