**Chloe：**  
Pff... What a waste. Baited into working my ass off, and all for nothing.  
Oh well, no biggie. Not like I was ever cut out for enterprise. So it's fine,  
but how 'bout you? Which of our mad ideas would you have gone for?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Yuni's Floaty-Woaty Yunicopter.  
**Choice: (2)**  Your hilarious skits.  
**Choice: (3)**  Chieru's Chatterbox Chellypon.  
`Tag 1`

Eh...? But, uh, didn't it literally blow you up too at the end?  
Huh. Really. It was fun?  
 Hmm. Well, guess I can't argue with...  
 KABOOM!  
...Wow, you're actually laughing.  
 At a \"kaboom.\" How old are we, five?

Hey. Those weren't comedy skits. I mean, they were in the end, but yeah.  
...Huh? You wanna see 'em again?  
 I told you, they're not skits!  
Please don't smile at me like \"Isn't it great you've got a new talent.\"

**Chloe：**  
Oh? Thanks.  
 Like, y'know, it's basically me and the Doc that made it.  
Chieru was just all, \"Make the face sharper! Make the chest bigger!\"  
Giving us tons of dumb orders to follow.  
 She just got in the way.
