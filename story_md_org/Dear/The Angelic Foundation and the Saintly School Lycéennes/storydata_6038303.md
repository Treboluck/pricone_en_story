## Subtitle: All About Mifuyu
  
**Yuni：**  
Look here. This can't be right. Whatever is going on?  
 Even young Chloe,  
the crude and merciless brawler, when faced with Mifuyu, says nothing  
but \"I can dig it.\"  
 I hear this woman teaches you. Just who is she?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She's the queen of efficiency.  
**Choice: (2)**  She's a part-timer.  
**Choice: (3)**  She's the Dragon Slayer.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm, an optimizer with an aversion to waste?  
 A crude scientific attitude.  
Still, I can't deny I see the appeal. I too always keep my room in the most  
optimal of states.  
 Though others have called that state a \"chaos vortex.\"

**Yuni：**  
Ah, a workaholic eldest sibling... I can see how they share an affinity.  
Young Chloe always strives to provide for her family. But perhaps she too  
harbors a desire for an elder sister figure...  
 Huh? Why not me, then?

**Yuni：**  
A killer of legends...  
 Young Chloe does have a weakness for such labels.  
Perhaps I too should brand myself the Ivory Sophist.  
 Hm? Too complex?  
...It's no use if the meaning is lost.  
 A layfolk version, then: Clever Li'l Yuni.
