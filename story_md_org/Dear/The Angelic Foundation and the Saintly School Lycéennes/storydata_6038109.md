## Subtitle: Sell Yourself
  
**Chieru：**  
Aw, maaan... We totally missed out on the Merc girls' hard cash!  
I'm sure my plan itself was stellar, but pitching things is tough.  
Hey, why don't you give it a go? Pitch yourself to me!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm strong.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm kind.  
**Choice: (3)**  I have zero redeeming qualities.

You're... strong, are you? Oh, you mean like, mentally?  
 Well then, sure.  
Like, when the three of us want to get changed, you just kinda sit there  
in the classroom without moving to leave. That *does* take guts.

Ohhh, \"kind,\" the classic response.  
 Strength, brains, special abilities...  
Those all need talent or hard work behind them.  
 But being kind is free!  
Anyone can claim it, anytime! It's the perfect nothing answer!

**Chieru：**  
The modesty! I see... Maybe that reserved nature is your best feature.  
Think about it... Lots of guys talk like they're hot stuff, when really  
they're a forty or fifty at best. So maybe you don't need to love yourself.
