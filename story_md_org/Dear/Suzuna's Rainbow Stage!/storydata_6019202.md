**Misaki：**  
Argh! Why am I getting into dumb arguments with  
Suzuna when I'm on vacation?! She's in the wrong, too!  
Who's the real child here, huh?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's calm down.  
**Choice: (2)**  Pat her head to calm her down.  
**Choice: (3)**  Oh no! W-whatever should I do?  
`Tag 1`  
**Misaki：**  
How do you manage to stay so composed at times like this?  
I'm an adult too, though, so I should follow suit.  
Maybe I'll have another talk with Suzuna after I've calmed down.

**Misaki：**  
Argh! Is that your way of saying I'm being a child?!  
I mean, I am to blame for upsetting her in the first place.  
I should probably reflect on my action, first and foremost.

**Misaki：**  
You're just making it worse!  
Okay, first I need to calm down...  
Wait. That's how an adult  
should approach it in the first place.  
Seeing you freak out helped me remember!
