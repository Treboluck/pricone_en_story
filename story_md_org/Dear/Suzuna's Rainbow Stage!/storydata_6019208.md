**Misaki：**  
Summer's all about shaved ice!  
That said, I can never decide which flavor to go with.  
What's your preference?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Gotta be strawberry.  
**Choice: (2)**  Green tea for me.  
**Choice: (3)**  I like mixing them all together.

Hey! You get it!  
That sweet sensation that follows the initial chilly burst  
really is the taste of happiness. Even adults love it!

**Misaki：**  
Now that's a flavor I haven't tried yet.  
Pretty impressive,  
I have to say!  
Not that I can't handle bitter flavors.  
I just never tried them. On purpose, of course!

**Misaki：**  
Wh-what?! You can't be serious, can you?!  
Is this the adult's approach?  
No, that can't be right...  
Urgh. Maybe I should let loose and give it a go?
