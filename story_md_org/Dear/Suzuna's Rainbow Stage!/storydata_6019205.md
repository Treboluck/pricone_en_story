I'm so glad I was able to make up with Suzuna!  
That, plus getting to hear about why she invited us here.  
Um... I should thank you, too, for helping out.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Duly accepted.  
**Choice: (2)**  I didn't do much.  
**Choice: (3)**  What a beautiful friendship.

You know,  
I almost feel bad for thanking you now.  
But well, it's a fact that you were reliable for once.  
Anyway. The event's tomorrow, so let's make the most of it!

Oh?  
That's quite the adult response. You almost seem reliable.  
Maybe the heat's getting to me?  
Enough talk, though. The first step  
to becoming a proper lady is to enjoy this summer!

Of course! We're best friends.  
I'll be cheering her on during tomorrow's event, too!  
And I don't plan on letting her other fans outdo me!
