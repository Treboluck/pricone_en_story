Hey hey, there's a bunch of stores on the beach!  
I'm totally down for some shaved ice!  
Let's go later, okay?  
But first, we gotta decide which flavors to get!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Nice, refreshing lemon flavor.  
**Choice: (2)**  Sweet milk syrup.  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm going full pudding.

Good taste, whiz-boy!  
It's got that real summer vibe to it!  
What was is it they say again...  
Bittersweet, just like first love.  
I don't really get it, but you probably do.

You gotta be having a giraffe, my dude.  
But who knows, maybe it's actually nice  
if you like it.  
Gimme a taste later!
