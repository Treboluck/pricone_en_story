## Subtitle: Making Up
  
**Suzuna：**  
I've never had an argument with any of my friends before,  
so I dunno how to make up with Misaki. I don't want things to get  
worse, either.  
You'd know what to do, right whiz-boy?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Apologizing is the way to go.  
**Choice: (2)**  Fortune-telling.  
**Choice: (3)**  Wait until things blow over.

**Suzuna：**  
Yeah, I figured.  
Was thinking the same myself...  
Wait. Then it's sorted!  
I just gotta apologize! It's totally simple! Thanks, whiz-boy!

Ahahaha! Hearing you say that is real LOL material.  
Hm... Then again, I heard the magazine with my photoshoots  
has a super accurate fortune-teller.  
Maybe I'll check it out.

I don't have it in me to wait!  
The event's tomorrow, you know.  
I want Misaki to enjoy it as well,  
so there's no point in waiting!  
I'm gonna make up with her today!  
Help me out, whiz-boy!
