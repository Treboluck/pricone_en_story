**Suzuna：**  
Man, this sucks. I just wanted to make some good memories  
with Misaki, so how come we ended up fighting?  
Hey, whiz-boy. Have you ever had a fight with anyone?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I don't even know what fighting's like.  
**Choice: (2)**  Every day with everyone.  
**Choice: (3)**  Only with monsters.  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzuna：**  
Makes sense. You're a whiz-boy at getting along with people too,  
so I guess you wouldn't get into fights.  
That's why you're so cool!

**Suzuna：**  
For realsies? Didn't know you were that kind of dude.  
As if. I can tell you're joshing!  
But you just wanted to cheer me up, right?  
Thanks!

`Tag 3`  
**Suzuna：**  
That's a different kind of fighting,  
but hey. You'll protect me  
if any monsters turn up at the event, right?  
Get that bodyguard mojo on!
