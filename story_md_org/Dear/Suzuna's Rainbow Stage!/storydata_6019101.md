What're your plans while we're here, whiz-boy?  
I've gotta focus on the event first, so it'd be rad if you  
could gimme some ideas on how to spend the time after that!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Collecting seashells.  
**Choice: (2)**  Exploring the island.  
**Choice: (3)**  Practicing surfing.

Where's the fun in that? Hm? You're gonna make a necklace  
out of it and give it me?  
That's, like, so totally amazing!  
My own unique accessory!  
I'll treasure it!
