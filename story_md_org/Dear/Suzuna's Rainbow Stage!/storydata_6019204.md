## Subtitle: Making Up
  
**Misaki：**  
Urgh... I want to make up with Suzuna,  
but I've never had an argument like this before.  
Hey. How would you go about it?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Apologizing is the way to go.  
**Choice: (2)**  By relying on a charm.  
**Choice: (3)**  Time'll sort it out.

**Misaki：**  
Come on, that much I understand!  
But, well, I guess that's the only way...  
I think I can get over this now...  
Thanks.

You can be surprisingly childish sometimes.  
Wait. You're not making fun of me, are you?  
Not that I entirely disagree. They can be helpful sometimes.

**Misaki：**  
Excuse me?  
Summer'll be over if I just wait around,  
plus Suzuna's event is tomorrow.  
But that's more reason  
to stop dilly-dallying!  
I need to apologize, quick!
