**Misaki：**  
Getting into an argument with Suzuna while on vacation  
just makes me feel as gloomy as this weather.  
Hey. Have you ever gotten into a fight with someone before?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's a fight?  
**Choice: (2)**  People hassle me on the street.  
**Choice: (3)**  I've fought plenty of monsters.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misaki：**  
I can't tell if you're joking or not,  
but you seem like you'd get along with anyone.  
I could learn a thing or two from you when it comes to that.

`Tag 2`  
**Misaki：**  
You are kinda out there, so I can imagine it.  
Sheesh. Try not to get yourself hurt, okay?  
I need you there to take the lead for me.

`Tag 3`  
**Misaki：**  
That's not the sort of fight I mean...  
But well, you need to be gallant when you're taking the lead for me.  
I expect the same while we're here, too!
