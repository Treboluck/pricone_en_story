**Kyoka：**  
When Mimi's with Hana, she's just like a big sister.  
How could I be more like that to other kids?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Try baking treats with them.  
**Choice: (2)**  You just need to be kind.  
**Choice: (3)**  Be as brave and strong as you can.

Baking sweet treats...  
Good idea! I have experience with that,

The path to big sisterhood is difficult...

**Kyoka：**  
Be brave... I guess in a crisis, you need to be there to rely on.  
In that sense too, Mimi really was a proper big sister to Hana.  
\"Big Sis Mimi\"... Could I call her that too...?
