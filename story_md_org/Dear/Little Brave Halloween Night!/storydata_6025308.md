## Subtitle: A Real Big Sister
  
**Misogi：**  
When she's with Hana, Mimi seems like a real big sis!  
Could I be someone's big sis like that, too?  
How would I even start?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Teach them to play tricks.  
**Choice: (2)**  Be kind to them.  
**Choice: (3)**  Gotta be brave and strong.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misogi：**  
Teach them tricks?  
Then we'd get along in no time!  
But hang on, wouldn't that make me more of a teacher than a sister?
