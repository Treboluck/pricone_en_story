**Misogi：**  
Halloween's the best, 'cause you get to play tricks!  
But I wish I had a special trick just for Halloween.  
Hey, mister, got any bright ideas?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Fire fruit juice from a water pistol.  
**Choice: (2)**  Dig pitfall traps.  
**Choice: (3)**  Hand out candy.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misogi：**  
Sweet and tasty, but gets you all sticky...  
 Ooh, I like it!  
I'll try it out on you first, so wait right here!  
Gotta buy some juice!

**Misogi：**  
Huh? But that's just like always!  
Unless I hid some candy at the bottom of the hole...  
No, it'd be a waste if it got crushed!  
 Let's start over!

**Misogi：**  
That's a treat, not a trick!  
Oh, but everyone *would* be surprised to get candy from me!  
You might be onto something, mister!
