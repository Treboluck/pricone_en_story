While I'm in Landosol, I want to learn more about the culture.  
Do you know of any books that would give me cultural insights?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  There's a book called \"Bushido\"...  
**Choice: (2)**  Check out Magical Girl Bella-Lou.  
**Choice: (3)**  Geas Apocrypha: Tyrant Code.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rem：**  
A book... all about the eastern land of Togoku?  
Hmm, it talks a lot about "ninja" and \"samurai,\" does it?  
I feel like I've heard those words from Subaru before, too...

A famous children's book series that's even inspired stage plays?  
If the people of this city all read it from a young age,  
it might contain all sorts of insights.  
 Thank you for the suggestion!

G-\"Geas Apocrypha: Tyrant Code\"...?  
That sounds extremely complicated, so I'm not sure if I can read it all,  
but I hate to turn down a recommendation, so I'll give it a try!
