## Subtitle: Bonding with Ram
  
**Emilia：**  
Have you spoken to Ram much?  
 She can be shy around new people...  
But she's a very good girl, so I hope you'll be friends with her.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  ...Shy? Ram?  
**Choice: (2)**  She's my \"dear sister.\"  
**Choice: (3)**  Do you get along with her?

**Emilia：**  
Mm, yes, she can be so shy!  
But once you get close, you'll see she's kind really.  
Even Subaru got along with her right away.

**Emilia：**  
Oh... Actually, I've been hoping we could be better friends.  
But she always keeps her distance, as a servant...  
*sigh*... I don't know how to do it like Miss Saren and Suzume.
