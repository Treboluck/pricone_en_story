Tell me, what recipes have you sampled so far?  
I'd like to see if I can cook them back in Lugnica,  
so please, share your ideas with me!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  There's something called a Gellatina Risotto...  
**Choice: (2)**  Have you tried our Pri:Rice?  
**Choice: (3)**  Kokkoro's porridge is the best.

Y-you use this Gellatina monster to cook with?!  
Foreign worlds really are home to such intriguing local culture...  
If I can find a substitute ingredient, I'll see what I can do.

Oh, the Gourmet Guild has participated in farming as well?  
Your passion for cuisine  
 is highly inspiring.  
I'm sure rice must taste very delicious after raising it yourself!

Haha. I suppose nothing does beat the taste of home, does it?  
There's someone I'd like to cook for like that.  
When the time comes, I'll feed him my own homemade porridge!
