Oh, yes.  
Have you learned how to tell Ram and Rem apart yet?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm used to twins.  
**Choice: (2)**  I still get them confused sometimes.  
**Choice: (1)**  I'd never mix them up.

**Emilia：**  
Haha, that's good.  
Rem has changed a lot lately, so I guess it's gotten easier.  
I think it's thanks to Subaru, but...  
 Don't tell the twins I said that, OK?

**Emilia：**  
They do look so alike, don't they?  
Still, it's not just their hair—their personalities are different too,  
so I think you'll get used to it if you talk to them a little more.

Mm-hm. Even with twins, it's easy once you get to know them.  
Just look at... Huh? Their work ethic?  
W-well... yes... Ram does slack off a little sometimes.
