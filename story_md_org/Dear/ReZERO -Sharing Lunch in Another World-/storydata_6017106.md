## Subtitle: Bonding with Rem
  
**Emilia：**  
Everyone at the Orphanage and at the Gourmet Guild  
seems to be so friendly with Rem, it makes me happy.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  She actually scares me a little.  
**Choice: (1)**  She's the one always helping us out.  
**Choice: (2)**  She's such a good girl.

She did all the housework back in Roswaal's mansion too.  
We appreciated her in Lugnica,  
 and it's just the same in Landosol.  
I should do something to thank her myself.

**Emilia：**  
Haha, thank you.  
But until recently, she never really opened up to anyone but Ram.  
...  
It's all thanks to Subaru. Wherever could he be now?

I guess you did first see her hurling that spiky ball...  
Rem is very strong, but doesn't that go for your guild too?  
So please try not to be too scared.
