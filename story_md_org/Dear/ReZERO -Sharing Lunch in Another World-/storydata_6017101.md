**Emilia：**  
I find Landosol so interesting.  
The way it uses "guilds" to manage its citizens  
is such an unusual system.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Want to join the Gourmet Guild for real?  
**Choice: (2)**  Why don't you make your own guild?  
**Choice: (3)**  I always just thought it was normal.  
`Tag 1`  
**Emilia：**  
Huh? Are you sure? But from what Karyl said,  
most of what you do is... eating monsters, right...?  
Are monsters really that tasty?

`Tag 2`  
**Emilia：**  
Who, me? That does sound like fun...  
But is it really appropriate for a royal candidate, I wonder...?  
I think I'd better ask the others first!

`Tag 3`  
**Emilia：**  
Oh, right.  
 Of course.  
To a country's citizens, its customs are totally normal...  
It really is educational, travelling to other lands like this.
