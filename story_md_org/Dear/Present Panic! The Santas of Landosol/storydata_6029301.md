**Illya：**  
Minion, you still have no memories, correct?  
Do you know what this holiday is supposed to be about?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's about eating cake.  
**Choice: (2)**  It's just really cold.  
**Choice: (3)**  It's when Santa brings presents.  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
Indeed. It is as you say!  
My minion, offer unto your mistress a delicious tribute!  
Fret not, for I shall reserve a morsel for you.

**Illya：**  
This level of cold is nothing to me... You, however, appear to be slightly  
frozen.  
Showing consideration for one's underlings is a master's duty.  
So come closer. Yes, yes, that's right...  
Wait! Too close! Release me!

**Illya：**  
Precisely. However, only good boys and girls receive gifts.  
You are retainer to a legendary vampire, my dear minion, so I am afraid  
you are on the naughty list.  
...I jest. Dispense with the sullen expression.
