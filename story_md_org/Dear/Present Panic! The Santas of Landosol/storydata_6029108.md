**Choice: (2)**  Let's apologize.  
**Choice: (3)**  I want to be a reindeer.

Even if you don't speak the same language, there's always a way to

Don't worry. I'm sure I'll figure something out!

Yeah... We should probably hear what they have to say...  
They're really angry, so first, we need to get them to calm down.  
Let's work together with Producer and Illya to do our best!
