**Illya：**  
What a fearsome opponent those reindeer made.  
They certainly are the embodiment of \"elite.\"  
However,

**Choice: (1)**  Clap.  
**Choice: (2)**  Everyone did a great job.  
**Choice: (3)**  Nice work.  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
Yes, yes. I praise you for your admiration of your mistress.  
Laud me, my minion, laud me!  
Hm? What? You wish to  
hoist me into the air?  
...No, that much is not necessary.

`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**

Once I become ruler,  
I shall appoint them as my underlings.

`Tag 3`  
**Illya：**  
Their power level was inconsequential.  
However... I shall accept your  
praise. My minion, my shoulders are somewhat tense. Could I request  
a massage?  
...Ngh. Hmmm! You are skilled with your hands!
