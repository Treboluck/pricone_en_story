I'm expecting an answer that will amuse me... ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's about eating cake.  
**Choice: (2)**  It's just really cold.  
**Choice: (3)**  It's when Santa brings presents.

That's certainly an answer I'd expect from you. What a predictably

What do you mean \"cold\"? How feeble.  
In frigid weather like this, if you move your body, the chill will soon pass.  
Come, unsheathe your sword.  
Let us clash weapons until we are warm... ♪

I was hoping for a more provocative response,  
but I suppose it's fine coming from you... ♪
