**Nozomi：**  
Illya is an... interesting character, isn't she?  
She's a child, but also an adult, and speaks in a unique way.  
What kind of person is she...?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  A legendary vampire.  
**Choice: (2)**  My master.  
**Choice: (3)**  The Ruler of the Night  
`Tag 1`  
**Nozomi：**  
A vampire... Like, the bloodsucking kind, huh?  
She doesn't look that scary, to be honest...  
Wait a minute, she doesn't suck your blood, does she...?

**Nozomi：**  
Whaaaat?! Sh-she's your master?  
Could you give me a little more detail?  
Huh? \"Why\"...?

`Tag 3`  
**Nozomi：**  
Having an epithet like that is kind of cool!  
Ruler of the Night...  
Sounds like she's always awake until morning.  
But staying up all night is your skin's worst enemy. I've got to tell her!
