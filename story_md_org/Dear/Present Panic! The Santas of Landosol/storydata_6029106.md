**Nozomi：**  
Producer and Illya are preparing gifts that I can't even imagine.  
I think they're going a bit overboard...  
But there's no way I'm going to lose!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're doing fine as it is.  
**Choice: (2)**  They are overdoing it a bit.  
**Choice: (3)**  Let's outdo those two.  
`Tag 1`  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? You mean, I should just do it my way...?

**Nozomi：**  
Ah, so you think so too?  
But they're so full of fun and surprises. I think that's great.  
It would be really fun if there was a Santa like that.

All right, I'm going to try really hard,  
so give me all your support!
