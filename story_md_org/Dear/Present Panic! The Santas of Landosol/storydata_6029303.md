## Subtitle: What Kind of Person Is Christina?
  
**Illya：**  
That Christina woman, is she honestly human?  
Even for a vampire such as myself, she is a strange character.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She hates the mundane.  
**Choice: (2)**  She's a producer for idols.  
**Choice: (3)**  She's probably not human.  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
Indeed, she does act in an unabashedly hedonistic manner.  
That being said, her theoretical judgment is not to be underestimated.  
She will certainly be a strong rival to becoming Santa Claus.

Why does such a fierce woman spend her time producing idols...?  
It seems to me that she has machinations for world domination, as I do...

**Illya：**  
I knew it!  
I suspected there was something suspicious about her.  
This legendary vampire cannot be deceived!  
Listen, my minion, do not stray from my side until we know it is safe!
