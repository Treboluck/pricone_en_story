## Subtitle: The Mystery of Santa
  
**Illya：**  
That Santa Claus.  
For what reason does he distribute presents?  
A ruler such as myself  
is always on the receiving end, therefore I cannot fathom the concept.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Because he wants people to be happy.  
**Choice: (2)**  Give Illya a present.  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm not sure.  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
Selfless charity because he wishes to please, hm?  
A ruler must be cognizant of such values. To that end, there is nothing  
more effective than making it a reality!  
Come, let us deliver presents!

**Illya：**  
What are you fumbling about with there?  
Hm...? A gift for me?  
Is this a snowman?  
It is modest in size, but rather cute.  
...You did it to see my happy face?  
Well. Good work, my minion.

**Illya：**  
You have no memories, so it is no surprise that you do not know.  
*sigh* The more I think about it, the less I understand.  
Just why in the blazes does Santa Claus do it?
