**Illya：**  
Oh no, it appears I made you wait.  
Apologies for the leisurely bath. Was it cold outside?  
Are you feeling chilly after your soak?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sneeze.  
**Choice: (2)**  The cold doesn't bother me.  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm going for round two.

Hm? That will not do. You will catch your death of cold.  
...I have only just  
emerged from the hot spring, therefore I am still warm.  
Come, give me  
your face. Allow me to heat it up with my hands.  
For... today is special.

Of course. Children are outdoor creatures after all.  
Hm? You are not a child?  
From where I stand, you are all but whelps.  
Well, I suppose I do not have much cogency in this form.

**Illya：**  
Good plan. I too am suddenly inclined toward another soak.  
Since we are here, I shall accompany you. My dear minion, would you  
be so kind as to wash my back?  
...L-looking is forbidden though!
