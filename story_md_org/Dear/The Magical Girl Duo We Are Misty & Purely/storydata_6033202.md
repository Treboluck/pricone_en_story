## Subtitle: The Magical Kingdom
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
The Magical Kingdom that Mora came from—I wonder what kind of country it is.  
It must be a fun place to live.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I want to go visit.  
**Choice: (2)**  There are many Moras.  
**Choice: (3)**  There are lots of magical girls, maybe?

If we ask, I wonder if Mora will tell us how to get there.  
I want to go with Hatsune, and everyone from Elizabeth Park.  
And you, of course...

...How adorable.  
Ah, but if everyone's that energetic,  
I might pass out just by talking to them.

If that's the case, Kasumi will have nothing to be embarrassed about.  
And besides, I'm sure it's a very peaceful land.  
Wait. Why would they need magical girls at all then...?
