## Subtitle: A New Magical Power
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Thanks to Master, I was able to learn some new magic skills!  
But now I want to learn as many other kinds as I can.  
I wonder what types of magic power would be good to have...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  How about clairvoyance?  
**Choice: (2)**  Telepathy seems fun.  
**Choice: (3)**  People-gathering magic!

I see. So I can easily see when you're hiding treats in your pockets?  
  
You look surprised.  
Hehe. I don't even need clairvoyance to know that.  
...I mean, you do have crumbs around your mouth. Let me get that.

**Misty★Kasumi：**  
So like mind reading?  
That would be the best ability for a detective.  
But I believe that  
I should use my powers of knowledge and logic instead  
of relying on magic.  
...I would like to take a peek into your mind though.

`Tag 3`  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
I'm not sure how that would be useful...  
Unveiling mysteries in front of crowds?  
Heheh. You're still so naive.  
Solving mysteries isn't something you flaunt to others.
