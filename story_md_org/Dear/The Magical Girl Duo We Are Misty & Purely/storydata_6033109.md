**Misty★Kasumi：**  
I never once thought I'd become a magical girl...  
I can't let anyone in the guild see me like this...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Maho would probably be happy.  
**Choice: (2)**  Makoto would probably praise you.  
**Choice: (3)**  Kaori would probably try to copy you.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...I can already envision her response:  
\"Kasumi's makin' her Maho-Maho  
Kingdom debut! ♪\"  
she would say, while forcing me to try on lots of  
different clothes. Ugh... Spare me the cute attire—I've had enough...

**Misty★Kasumi：**  
It's true that a magical girl's main job is to patrol the city, so she's the  
most likely to understand!  
Maybe I'll go and ask Mora  
to turn her into  
Magical Guard Dog★Wolven Makoto!

`Tag 3`  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...She'd incorporate my transformation pose into her dancing,  
and say  
\"Look at me, I'm Kasumi! ♪\"  
or something like that, and dance half-naked  
from morning until night.  
Listen, she's the one person we must not tell!
