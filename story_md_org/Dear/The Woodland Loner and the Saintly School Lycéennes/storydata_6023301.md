I hope you make the most of it.  
 Tell me, what subjects interest you?

Oh...  
 You have fine taste, my compatriot.  
In the abstract, such studies are an exploration of one's own soul.

**Yuni：**  
I see...  
 Very well, then. All studies have value. Even I dabble in that area.

Gym?

 Abolish it, I say!
