Come to think of it, you're currently enrolled here  
as a temporary experimental test case.  
If St. Theresa's does go co-ed, will you be applying to join officially?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Of course I'll apply.  
**Choice: (2)**  That's not the plan.  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm not sure.

Yes, well said. I look forward to welcoming you again.  
Of course, I expect the transition will take a fair amount of time...  
Wait. Won't I have graduated by then?  
 Huh?

So listen and rejoice, my compatriot. You can belong to both at once!

That's why we humans live today to the fullest. Is that what you mean?  
...No, please don't lie to me. You're just clueless, aren't you?
