**Yuni：**  
As you know, I rarely venture into the outside world. You, meanwhile,  
seem to proactively visit a wide variety of locales.  
 Would you happen to  
know any spots that might pique my intellectual curiosity?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  The Marjan Coast.  
**Choice: (2)**  Oedo Town.  
**Choice: (3)**  The Ivory Tower.  
`Tag 1`

The seaside, hm?  
 Frankly, I don't see the appeal,  
 but having grown up  
in the mountains, I suppose I should experience the ocean at least once.  
Still, would I have to wear one of those indecent \"swimsuits\"? Urnghh...

**Yuni：**  
Ah, I've heard of it!  
 A place to experience the joys of eastern culture, yes?  
But I've read worrying things about the east. Don't they eat rotten beans  
and dead fish, while slathering it all in a strange \"soy sauce\"? Hrmmm...

**Yuni：**  
The Ivory Tower? Ah, a haven of priceless historical tomes?  
It sounds perfect...  
 Wait, that's the library right here!  
 Honestly, now.  
Are you trying to leverage my learned mind for comedic purposes?
