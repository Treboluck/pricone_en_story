## Subtitle: Carry Me Away
  
**Chieru：**  
I'm so booored. Isn't there anything fun to do?  
My precious youth magic is draining away with each tick of the clock.  
Sigh, what a waste. C'mon, take me out somewhere, why don't you?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sorry, I'm out of cash.  
**Choice: (2)**  Sorry, I'm kind of busy.  
**Choice: (3)**  Sorry, I live a dull and empty existence.

**Chieru：**  
Oof, I feel that. My folks are actually stinking rich,  
but they're also strict AF, so they want me to \"learn the value of money.\"  
Bah! Who needs cash to have fun, anyway?!  
 Follow me!

Whaa~? Are you kidding? Surely you can spare a moment or two...  
Huh? You're on a delivery job?  
 Oh. Actual real work. I'm sorry.  
I shouldn't keep you, then. Let's try this again when you're free!

Oh... Well, I guess I can't deny it from the horse's mouth.  
But let me say this. If you've got nothing, what's holding you down?  
You can become anything you like!  
 Think of the boundless possibilities!
