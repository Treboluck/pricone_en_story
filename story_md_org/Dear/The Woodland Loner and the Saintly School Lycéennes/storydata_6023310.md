**Yuni：**  
I may have mentioned before,  
but prior to entering this academy, I'd never left my village.

**Choice: (1)**  What village did you come from?

**Yuni：**  
Hrm... I could give the name, but few would recognize it. It's a lonely  
hamlet deep in the mountains, several days' ride from the city. And I was  
the only youth there to speak of.  
 You might call me the village beauty.

Oh, just a bunch of stubborn old fools. They say they \"tired of the city,\"  
but... Well, academic circles are like social cliques. Some people just...  
don't fit in.  
 Though at least to me, they're all my precious family.

**Yuni：**  
Hrm... I don't have any memories of my younger days.  
Of course, precious few people do recall their actual infancy.  
Still, in that sense, you could say we're alike, you and I.
