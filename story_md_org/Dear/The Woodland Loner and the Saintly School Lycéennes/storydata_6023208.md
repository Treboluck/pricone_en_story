Entertain me with something funny.

**Choice: (2)**  Welcome home, my lord.  
**Choice: (3)**  I'll murder you dead!

Guaaahh?! You can't eat those! Some things are too gross even for me!

**Chieru：**  
Wha...?  
 Um, I'm sorry. Maybe I went too far. Forgive me.  
Still, I'm actually kind of relieved. Even you get angry sometimes, huh?
