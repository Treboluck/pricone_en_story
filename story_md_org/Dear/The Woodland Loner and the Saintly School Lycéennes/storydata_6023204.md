## Subtitle: All About Chloe
  
**Chieru：**  
You're not, like, being bullied by Chloe or anything, right?  
'Cause if you are, I'll go all \"Whoa there!\" and give her a talking-to.  
So, are you OK? You can tell me. What do you *really* think of her?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She's so strong.  
**Choice: (2)**  She's so scary.  
**Choice: (3)**  She's so cute.

Well, they say weak dogs bark the loudest, and Chloe's like the reverse.  
Like, always the dry cynic, but I've never heard her actually yell.  
She's got this real *presence,* right? You just know not to mess with her.

You think so? I mean, all that cool's just to hide the cute! Sure, her face  
and her voice and her 'tude are scary, but she's a normal girl underneath.  
And she'd never brawl with lawful peeps, so she's harmless! I think.

*Yes!*  
You *so* get her deal! The way she's always glancing at mirrors!  
Or how she always plays along with all my annoying jabs!  
 She's got a  
sense for style, too—you should see what she wears outside of school!
