## Subtitle: Where Did Hanzo Go?
  
**Shiori：**  
Where did Hanzo disappear to with his underlings?  
I tried following their scent with Nyatt,  
but that got me nowhere...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  From the dark he came; into the dark he went.  
**Choice: (2)**  He'll get caught one day.  
**Choice: (3)**  Maybe he's closer than we think...

**Shiori：**  
F-from dark to dark? You think he used some kind of magic?  
If that's the case, it's no wonder Nyatt couldn't find him.  
Huh? No? Then I'm not sure what you mean...

**Shiori：**  
You're right. No bad deed goes unpunished.  
If I ever see him again, I'll be the one to catch him.  
If that time comes, I want you to help me, okay?

**Shiori：**  
He and his men are the type to pop out of the shadows,  
so it's certainly not impossible.  
We need to stay alert and be more vigilant in our security.
