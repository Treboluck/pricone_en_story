## Subtitle: All About Shiori
  
**Rin：**  
Shiorin's a real hard worker, don't you think? I can't even pretend to  
be like that.  
Well, since she's working so hard, I guess I can't slack off,  
huh...?  
For now, that is.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm worried she's overdoing it.  
**Choice: (2)**  Show her how thankful you are.  
**Choice: (3)**  Why not rely on her more?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rin：**

We can ask her to do as much as she can,  
and the rest she can leave up to us.

**Rin：**  
Show her, huh?  
That's a bit too embarrassing.  
Maybe I'll sneak something under her pillow.  
...I just hope she doesn't mistake me for a burglar and shoot me.

`Tag 3`  
**Rin：**  
That sure would make her happy, huh?  
But she already does enough for us.  
It's hard to find the right balance.
