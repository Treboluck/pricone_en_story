**Lima：**  
Maybe it's because she's always guarding the ranch for us,  
but when push comes to shove, Shiori's super dependable.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You could give her a run for her money.  
**Choice: (2)**  She never lets her prey get away.  
**Choice: (3)**  I wish she had more self-confidence.

**Lima：**  
Wh-what?! Don't surprise me with sudden praise.  
There's no way I could guard the ranch...  
Ah, actually, I definitely  
could scare away any suspicious lurkers eyeing up the place.

She looks so cool when she's shooting her bow, right?  
I'd love to try battling like that.  
Well, I'd have quite a job without fingers.  
But instead, I can compensate for Shiori's lack of  
close combat ability.

**Lima：**  
Yeah. Sure, maybe she isn't the strongest person ever, but she's  
a kind girl who understands the feelings of others like her.  
  
We should do more to praise her wonderful traits.
