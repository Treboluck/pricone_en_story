## Subtitle: That Standing Signboard...
  
**Rin：**  
What a weird signboard. Our guests seem to love it though,  
which is odd.  
I guess we gotta thank Carmina's producer for  
sending us it.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's a nice present, huh?  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's have fun with it.  
**Choice: (3)**  Christina Spa Resort.

Making decent signboards is pretty tough, so it's actually a big help.  
But how did she know we opened up the hot spring to the public?  
She's real shrewd, so I bet she has her own information network, huh?

Huh? With the sign? No way. I'm not that much of a child, you know...  
  
Argh, fine, let's play. But I'm doing it for you.  
...  
Could be fun though.

You can't be serious. Is that really what she wanted to call the  
ranch hot spring?  
I mean, she's the one who built it, so I guess  
she has naming rights. But Elizabeth Park isn't a resort, you know?
