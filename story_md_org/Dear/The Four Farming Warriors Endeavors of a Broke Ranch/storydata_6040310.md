## Subtitle: Where Did Hanzo Go?
  
**Lima：**  
Hanzo, was it? Just where did he vanish off to?  
With the amount of pain he caused, he really needs to be captured.  
But there's apparently no trace of him anywhere...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  From the dark he came; into the dark he went.  
**Choice: (2)**  He goes wherever the money is.  
**Choice: (3)**  Maybe he's closer than we think...

F-from the dark; into the dark...?  
Hmmm.  
Come to think of it, he is a user of some kind of strange... magic?  
I really hope he gets caught...

That's surely the case... I couldn't care less about the inspector,  
but the relationship they had was really sad.  
There are more important things in life than money.

Hey! Don't say such scary things!  
...But if he jumps out at us, this time I want to capture him.  
If it happens, I'll be counting on your help.
