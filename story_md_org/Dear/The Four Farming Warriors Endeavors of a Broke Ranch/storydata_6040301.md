## Subtitle: The Mysterious Hanzo
  
**Lima：**  
The guy the inspector keeps around—Hanzo? I wonder who he is.  
I know it's a bit odd for me to say, but he looks all sorts of strange.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  He lives in the shadows.  
**Choice: (2)**  It's the latest style.  
**Choice: (3)**  I know a girl who wears clothes like his...  
`Tag 1`  
**Lima：**  
Boys really like that sort of thing, huh?  
But if he likes to hide in dark  
places, why does he dress like that during the day? It makes him stand  
out... right?  
Intimidation? Does he do it to scare people?

**Lima：**  
You serious...?  
But if you think so, it probably is, right?  
Huh? It was supposed to be a joke?  
Sorry!  
I'm not sharp like Mahiru, so comebacks aren't my thing.

**Lima：**  
There's really a girl who looks like that?  
You sure do have many types  
of acquaintances.  
Do you know anyone who looks like me? Of course  
you don't.  
But that's good! Because to you, I'm a one-of-a-kind girl!
