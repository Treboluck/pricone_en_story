## Subtitle: All About the Hot Spring
  
**Shiori：**  
I never would have expected a hot spring excavated in such a way would  
end up being so useful.  
If things weren't like this, we never would have  
found a use for it...  
I'm so happy that it's something everyone can enjoy.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That's Producer for you.  
**Choice: (2)**  They can also admire nature.  
**Choice: (3)**  I wish we could relax too.

**Shiori：**  
Is such a showy appearance really fitting for a recreational facility?  
I don't understand it myself...  
But it makes the children laugh, so it must  
be appropriate.  
Hm? Laughter does mean it's appropriate, doesn't it?

**Shiori：**  
Not only a hot spring, but beautiful scenery as well. It really is perfect,  
don't you think?  
The only thing that could make it better is freshly  
squeezed milk...  
We absolutely must get our cows back.

**Shiori：**  
We need to return the ranch to normal so that we can all bathe  
together.  
...Ah, uh, except you  
can't really use the hot spring with us,  
can you? S-sorry about that.
