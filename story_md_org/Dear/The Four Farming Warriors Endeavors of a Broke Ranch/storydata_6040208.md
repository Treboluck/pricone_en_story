## Subtitle: Mahiru's Outfit
  
**Rin：**  
Mahy's new getup definitely has a mature element to it,  
but it does nothing to hide her excessive wholesomeness...  
What a terrific talent.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She looks adorable.  
**Choice: (2)**  She is an adult.  
**Choice: (3)**  I think it's cool.

I guess she disagrees,  
but it suits her, so she should just take the  
compliment, right? Different people have different suitabilities,  
you know?

**Rin：**  
Well yeah, she is the oldest among us. But that's not what  
I'm getting at.  
Hold on, do you really think of her as an adult?  
If you do, you gotta go tell her. She'll be over the moon.

**Rin：**  
Ah, yeah, I can see it. If you say it's a cool outfit, it probably is.  
But maybe not. if Mahy's wearing it, it's just gonna look cute.
