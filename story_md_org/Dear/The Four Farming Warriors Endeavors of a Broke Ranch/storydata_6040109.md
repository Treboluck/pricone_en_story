## Subtitle: Rin's Outfit
  
**Mahiru：**  
Rinrin's outfit's real cool lookin', huh?  
Wearin' that armor to do security at the ranch...  
ain't likely, huh?  
Shame, really.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She might, if you ask.  
**Choice: (2)**  We strive for peace.  
**Choice: (3)**  She wants to take special care of it.

**Mahiru：**  
Ya think so?  
But I get the feelin' she'll be full of nothin' but excuses,  
an' then she'll try'n get away.  
I need to think of a reason for her to  
keep wearin' it,  
but I ain't good at that sorta thing.

**Mahiru：**  
Yeah, it's best not to need it.  
But ya know, it'll be a shame not to be  
able to see her like that anymore.  
If I tell her she can slack off when  
she's wearing the armor, do ya think she will?

She did say it was a gift from her mom, didn't she?  
So of course she'd wanna keep it safe.  
...Well, that's what she should be sayin'.
