## Subtitle: All About the Hot Spring
  
**Lima：**  
I can't believe a hot spring that sprung up so unexpectedly could actually  
be this useful to us.  
When I first saw the showy bathhouse, I didn't know  
how to react.  
But it seems like our guests are enjoying that too.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That's Producer for you.  
**Choice: (2)**  They can also admire nature.  
**Choice: (3)**  Maybe you'll become a hot spring guild.

Maybe she knew what was coming? Which would mean she  
really is amazing...  
Or maybe she simply wanted the limelight...  
E-either way, everyone's happy, so it's all good!

They sure can. It might be nothing special to us, but for the townsfolk,  
the scenery on the ranch could help them to recuperate.  
It would be  
even better if they could also enjoy interacting with the cows.

That does sound like a ton of fun. I'd be chopping down trees, Mahiru  
would be taking care of the cows, Shiori would be on guard duty, and  
Rin would be... skipping work?  
Well, that's the dream, right?
