## Subtitle: That Standing Signboard...
  
**Lima：**  
The signboard that Carmina's producer gifted to us  
really leaves quite the impression, doesn't it?  
None of the guests have mentioned it though...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's a nice gift, huh?  
**Choice: (2)**  I wanna put my face in it.  
**Choice: (3)**  Christina Spa Resort.

We didn't tell her we had turned it into a business, so I wonder how  
she found out.  
She sent us lots of other promo tools as well, so we  
should really thank her. Next time we see her, let's show our gratitude.

All those kids who were playing with the sign earlier were super cute,  
weren't they?  
I want to have fun with them too.  
But I might get mistaken for a cow again...

Huh? Did she really want to name a hot spring on a ranch *that*?  
Yeah, it's a fine name, but it doesn't really fit the bucolic  
mood of Elizabeth Park.  
It's perfect for Producer though.
