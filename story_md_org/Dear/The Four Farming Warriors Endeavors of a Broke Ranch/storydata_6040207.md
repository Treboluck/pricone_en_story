## Subtitle: All About the Hot Spring
  
**Rin：**  
I'm glad everyone's enjoying the hot spring. Apparently it was worth  
all the effort we put into promoting it.  
And it's funny how  
confused  
everyone was by that, uh... statue?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That's Producer for you.  
**Choice: (2)**  And the air's so fresh here.  
**Choice: (3)**  I wish we could relax too.

Right? She's got more comedic sense than Mahy...  
Huh?  
It's not supposed to be funny? Then what the heck's it for?  
Suddenly Producer seems a lot more scary.

With both the hot spring and all this nature, the ranch could  
become a really great tourist spot.But the better it becomes,  
  
the busier I'm gonna be, and that's where things get complicated...

I know, right?! We have a hot spring right on our doorstep,  
but we gotta keep working?!  
...Well, Mahy's enjoying herself,  
so I guess I can live with it.
