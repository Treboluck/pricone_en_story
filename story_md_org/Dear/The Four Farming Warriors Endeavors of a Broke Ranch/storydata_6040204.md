## Subtitle: All About Mahiru
  
**Rin：**  
I don't know anyone who treats me as well as Mahy does.  
She's let me get away with a lot in the past, so at times like this,  
I should really get my act together, right?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Yeah, and keep it that way.  
**Choice: (2)**  You should give her your support.  
**Choice: (3)**  Why don't you become her pardner?

**Rin：**  
Uhhh, yeah. Sure, that's what I'm thinking this time.  
But I can't promise anything.  
...Well, it is for Mahy, so I'll do as much as I can.

**Rin：**  
Mahy's pretty tough, so I think she can handle it.  
But you're right.  
When she needs support, I'm there for her.  
Well, I'm kinda unreliable, so  
everyone pitches in.  
Of course, you gotta show your support too, yeah?

**Rin：**  
...Huh? Well, can't say I expected that response.  
Er... nah... It doesn't matter how indebted to Mahy I am,  
I have my limits. I'm only beastfolk. So it's a no.
