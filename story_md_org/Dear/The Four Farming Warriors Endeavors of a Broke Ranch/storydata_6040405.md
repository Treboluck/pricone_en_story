## Subtitle: All About Lima
  
**Shiori：**  
Lima really is strong and dependable, isn't she?  
She's always helping me out, so I want to give back to her somehow.  
I can't carry her around on my back though...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  We should give her a present.  
**Choice: (2)**  Fight together.  
**Choice: (3)**  Why not work out?  
`Tag 1`  
**Shiori：**  
I'm sure she'd be delighted with a cute accessory.  
Something like an apple-shaped pendant.  
Maybe she'll like one I make myself.

`Tag 2`  
**Shiori：**  
Huh? Y-you mean, ride her into battle?  
I guess it would make fighting  
a lot easier, but...  
Do you have any other suggestions? Something that  
would make Lima happy.

`Tag 3`  
**Shiori：**  
Even with lots of strength training, I doubt I'll be able to lift her...  
N-no! I should take on any challenge, right?!  
Then I'll train on the days I'm feeling fit!  
Huh? You were joking?
