What? There's no need to ogle so much.  
All right, spit it out. I know what you wanna say.  
It doesn't suit me, am I right?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're such a hard worker.  
**Choice: (2)**  It looks good on you.  
**Choice: (3)**  Nice armor.

I want this to be the last time I ever lay my eyes on this armor.

Then I gracefully accept your praise. Thank you.

Anyone would agree it's cool, don't you think? My mom has impeccable
