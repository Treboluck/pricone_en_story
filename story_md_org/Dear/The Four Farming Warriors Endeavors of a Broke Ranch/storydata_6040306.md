## Subtitle: Monetary Donations
  
**Lima：**  
The villagers from the places Mahiru would go to sell produce  
and the kids from Sarendia donated a whole bunch of money to us.  
I'm truly grateful...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  We should thank them.  
**Choice: (2)**  We owe it all to Mahiru.  
**Choice: (3)**  We need to use the money carefully.

I'm not sure how we can show our gratitude, but I'll do anything to give  
back.  
Instead of letting her go alone, maybe if I help Mahiru go and sell  
produce, we can bring Elizabeth Park goods to many, many more people.

It's because she traveled to many different places to sell things  
and got to make connections with lots of people.  
I believe that's something only Mahiru's capable of.

We're going to use it to help rebuild other defrauded agricultural guilds,  
so we need to use it right.  
Once things have settled down, it would be  
great if we could send tasty gifts to the villagers and the Sarendia kids.
