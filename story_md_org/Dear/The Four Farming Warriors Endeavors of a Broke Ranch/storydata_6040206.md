## Subtitle: Monetary Donations
  
**Rin：**  
I never expected the money to be raised like that.  
I guess people really love Elizabeth Park.  
Or rather, they love Mahy.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  We really need to take back the ranch, huh?  
**Choice: (2)**  We should return the favor.  
**Choice: (3)**  Let's work our hardest.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rin：**  
Yeah, first and foremost.  
And once we do, we gotta give back beyond expectations.  
I'll work hard to that end.

**Rin：**  
The best way we could give back is with dairy produce, I guess. Mahy's  
super busy.  
Hmmm. I suppose I gotta work until we're done returning  
the favor.  
*sigh*... I hope things go back to normal sooner than later.

**Rin：**  
Let's. We'll be able to give back to everyone once we have our ranch  
and cows...  
Wait, hold on. Once we take back the ranch, I'm going on  
permanent paid leave.  
...Well, maybe I can work just a little bit.
