## Subtitle: The Mysterious Hanzo
  
**Shiori：**  
That Hanzo guy assaulted Mahiru, so I'm going to make soup out of his  
bones.  
He dresses like an absolute weirdo. Who in the world is he?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  He's a man who wears what he wants.  
**Choice: (2)**  His outfit's so cool.  
**Choice: (3)**  I know a girl who wears clothes like his...  
`Tag 1`  
**Shiori：**  
You mean he's some kind of fashionista?  
If that's the case, I can't say he dresses like a freak, can I?  
But I won't forgive him for hurting Mahiru.

**Shiori：**  
You think it looks good?  
Is that right...?  
Well, to each their own, I guess.  
If you want to dress like that, I won't stop you.

`Tag 3`  
**Shiori：**  
You know someone who dresses like that?  
Then I guess she's a  
good person.  
So it's not just villains who follow that style, huh?  
  
The plot thickens...
