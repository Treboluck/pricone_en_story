## Subtitle: All About Rin
  
**Lima：**  
I knew that Rin could accomplish whatever she put her mind to, but it  
turns out she's super tenacious too.  
I'm going to work even harder so  
that she doesn't make me look bad.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm afraid of the blowback.  
**Choice: (2)**  She deserves a reward.  
**Choice: (3)**  She's doing it for her friends.

**Lima：**  
At the same time, I'm also one to miss watching her laze around...  
I wouldn't tell her that, but it's part and parcel of peaceful times  
at our ranch.

`Tag 2`  
**Lima：**  
A reward for Rin...? What is there other than time off work?  
Acorns...  
are something she seems to enjoy gathering on her own.  
Maybe we could play one of her games with her.

`Tag 3`  
**Lima：**  
She'd probably get embarrassed and dodge the subject, but she really  
does care a lot about Elizabeth Park.  
I just wish she'd be a little more  
honest about her feelings.
