That Hanzo fella was darn scary. He gave me the willies.  
An' he looked mighty outlandish. What's his deal?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  He's a bodyguard.  
**Choice: (2)**  He's a denizen of the dark.  
**Choice: (3)**  I know a girl who wears clothes like his...

Well, ain't no use dwellin' on it, huh?

So that look's actually a thing? Landosol sure has all types, huh?  
Hm? Maybe that outfit's supposed to be \"urban\"?
