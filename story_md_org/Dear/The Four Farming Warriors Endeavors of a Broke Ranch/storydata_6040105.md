**Mahiru：**  
Shioshio's always been a hard worker,  
but still helpin' at a time  
like this is jus' saintly.  
I feel real bad that she doesn't have the chance to recuperate.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She's totally fine.  
**Choice: (2)**  Show her how thankful you are.  
**Choice: (3)**  Why not rely on her more?

**Mahiru：**  
Yeah, that's what she said.  
She's such a sweetie.  
But I can't keep relyin' on her.  
I gotta work harder!

**Mahiru：**  
I wanna do somethin' to make her happy.  
Any ideas? Healthy food...  
is somethin' I'm always careful about. This one's a toughie...  
I know, she loves cute animals!

**Mahiru：**  
Hmmm...  
I don't wanna burden her, but if I hold off, she'll get mad at me.  
I got it. I'll give her easy jobs that won't push her too hard.
