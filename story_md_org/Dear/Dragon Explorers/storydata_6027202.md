**Kaya：**  
Man, I still can't believe you even know the boss.  
Hard to tell if you're lucky or cursed.  
 Be careful around her, OK?  
That woman's on a whole different level of dangerous...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She's pretty amazing.  
**Choice: (2)**  She's a kind person.  
**Choice: (3)**  She scares me a bit.

Right? I knew you'd be able to tell!  
 She always acts so laid-back,  
but she never lets her guard down at all!  
I mean, at the end of the day, that's what makes her our boss!

*sigh*... Look... I know your type. You get scammed a lot, right?  
You could try to be a *little* more cautious.  
 Just... be careful around  
the boss.  
 That's a warning...  
 no, a word of advice.

Haha, you think so too?  
 When she gets angry, I get chills...  
Ah well, I guess she wouldn't be able to keep us in check otherwise!  
It takes real talent to lead a gang and a guild at the same time.
