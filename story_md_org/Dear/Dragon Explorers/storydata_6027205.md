## Subtitle: How's Life on Elpis Island?
  
**Kaya：**  
Been a while now since we got here, huh?  
Who knows when we'll see Landosol again...  
I mean, it's not *boring* here, but y'know...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're tired of this island?  
**Choice: (2)**  You're getting homesick?  
**Choice: (3)**  It's wearing you out?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaya：**  
No, no. With you guys and Inori here, it's tons of fun.  
And hey, instead of people, this place is full of monsters  
I can punch as much as I want!  
 It's such a blast!

**Kaya：**  
Hmm, I guess there are certain things I miss.  
 Can't wait to get back  
to my work as a brawler.  
 Oh, and I'd kill for some Landosol desserts.  
Let's go get some when this is over!

**Kaya：**  
Hah, this is no strain for me.  
If anything, it's not challenging me enough!  
Man, I gotta find some monsters who'll put up a fight...
