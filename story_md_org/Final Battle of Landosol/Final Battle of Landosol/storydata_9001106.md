Down it goes! ☆  
Good job, you two! ♪  
You as well, {player}! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Not too shabby. But hey, wait a minute.  
{player} pretty much stood in the back and did nothing!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Not quite.  
You see, he has a special power. One bestowed to him by Ameth herself,  
which he uses to provide us with support.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl, surely you noticed something different during that battle.  
Particularly in relation to your own abilities.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, huh....  
W-well, I didn't know that. Sure sounds shady.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe. What's more, he can also bring out our innate abilities.  
That, in turn, allows us to make use of extra powerful attacks.  
We call them \"Union Bursts,\" to keep things simple.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, my lord.  
Your talents never cease to impress. Simply wonderful. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You really are amazing, huh! ☆  
There's plenty of work and requests for us to do,  
so we might as well make the most of that ability of yours!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed.  
If anything, that feels like the quickest way to regaining his memories.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine, Miss Karyl.  
Our meeting was a fortunate one, no doubt willed by Ameth herself.  
I look forward to what we can accomplish together.
