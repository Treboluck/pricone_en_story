# Final Attack
The mothership descends to solid ground, and {player} and friends confront it to defend Landosol from peril. When the great ship suffers a fatal blow, it begins a self-destruct countdown, but Lima charges into its central core to prevent the explosion.
  
## Subtitle: Final Attack
  
**Narration：**  
Back on solid ground, as they wait anxiously for the L-Fighter's return,  
{player} and Kokkoro see the cloud of saucers suddenly retreat—  
just as Karyl and co. are launching an all-out assault on the mothership.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The saucers are all withdrawing at once...!  
Whatever could this mean...? Ahh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord! Something is falling from above!  
It looks like... a gigantic... Miss Lima?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Wow, she's grown.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Braving this new frontier must have inspired her to reach new heights.  
Why, it looks almost as though she is shining.  
  
**Robo-Lima：**  
LLIMA-LLIMA-LLIMAAAA!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That is... not Miss Lima, is it?  
Could it be the mothership, then?  
But where is the L-Fighter...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Kokkoro~! {player}~!  
We managed to rescue Karyl!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine's L-Fighter! So you are all safe!  
  
**Karyl：**  
We dragged the mothership all the way down to the ground!  
  
**Lima：**  
But we're out of ammo! I'm so sorry!  
Looks like we'll have to fight on foot from here!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We'll join you guys in a moment, so just hold tight!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Whew... Solid ground never felt so good.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl, your body seems unusually sticky.  
Whatever happened to you up there...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
That mothership's real goal  
was to turn all of Landosol's food into apples  
and use them as an energy source to conquer the world!  
  
**Karyl：**  
If we smash that big dummy, that'll be the end of this.  
So let's hurry up and do that!  
 And I mean *really* smash it!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah... You do not wish to discuss your experience.  
In that case, I will try not pry too deeply into the matter.  
  
**Lima：**  
Yes... That's probably for the best.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You say \"smash it,\" but that won't be easy for us on our own.  
Especially without the L-Fighter...  
  
**Karin：**  
Everyone, can you hear me?  
This is Karin from the Guild Association.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karin! What perfect timing.  
  
**Karin：**  
We've just confirmed  
the descent of a large object presumed to be the mothership.  
I've sent out a request to all guilds, so you should have backup soon!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's great news!  
Let's all work together  
 to save Landosol from destruction!
