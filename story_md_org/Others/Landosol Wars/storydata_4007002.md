## Subtitle: Princess Scramble
  
**Narration：**  
With Karyl abducted by the mysterious flying saucer,  
{player} and friends return from the investigation forlorn.  
But when they make it back to the city, a further shock awaits them.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh no... The city...!  
Where is Miss Karin...? And the residents...?  
Could they have been... taken like Miss Karyl...?  
  
**Karin：**  
Oh! You finally made it back! I'm so glad you're all...  
Huh? Miss Karyl doesn't seem to be with you.  
Could it be...?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A flying saucer took her away...  
  
**Karin：**  
Oh no...!  
  
**Flying Saucer：**  
#._M;A''♪^,,$★ ?LL|-I^?L  
  
**Karin：**  
...Ah!  
 It's still too dangerous here!  
Follow me, everyone!  
  
**Karin：**  
Right this way. This is an underground shelter from the saucers.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What happened here in the city after we left?  
  
**Karin：**  
Flying saucers appeared out of nowhere to attack our buildings.  
And for some reason,  
they sucked up every last morsel of food in the entire city.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The city's... food supply, you say?  
Did they not abduct the actual citizens?  
  
**Karin：**  
We haven't heard any reports of that, no...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Then why is it just Karyl...?  
  
**???：**  
...ro... ...Ko... ... ...ro? ...hear...  
...Can you... ...me...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This voice is...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl?! Karyl, is that you?!  
  
**???：**  
Guess it w... ...ver gonna... ...each fro... ...here...  
  
**Karin：**  
Ah, communication magic!  
I'll try to stabilize the connection so that we can hear more clearly!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl! Miss Karyl!  
Can you hear our voices now?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Koro! Thank goodness...  
I guess this shot in the dark paid off after all!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl! You're all right!  
Where are you right now?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Not sure if I can call this \"all right\"...  
And as for where I am, um...  
\"A long way above the clouds\" is the best I can explain it...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Far above the clouds...?  
Do you mean the fabled domain of darkness beyond the sky itself?  
The place known as \"outer space\"?  
  
**Karin：**  
I'm sorry... This is all my fault for sending you  
on such a dangerous mission!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait, is that... Karin?  
 No, forget about that for now!  
There's no time for pointing fingers. Landosol's in real danger!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Right above Landosol, there's another enemy way bigger than the saucer!  
That's where they've taken me. Aside from that, um...  
Well, there's also a huge pile of food here.  
  
**Karin：**  
The saucers must have taken Landosol's stolen food  
back to their mothership...  
  
**Karyl：**  
They're... stealing food...? Wait a minute!  
Did they mistake me for a tasty morsel back there?!  
I'm not gonna be gobbled up by a creepy monster, right?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl, try to calm down!  
I'll save you before that happens!  
  
**Karyl：**  
How are you gonna reach me up here above the sky?!  
  
**Karin：**  
...  
  
**Karin：**  
I do know of one possible option.  
There's an ancient anti-Starbeast weapon hidden here in Landosol  
called the \"L-Fighter\" which can reach outer space!  
  
**Karyl：**  
If you've got such a perfect weapon, then launch it already!  
  
**Karin：**  
We don't have a viable pilot...!  
It's an extremely unstable vehicle that normal humans can't handle...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll pilot it!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Pecorine?! Were you listening to a word she said?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I've got my Royal Equipment! I'm tougher than normal people!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Those saucers are stealing all the food from Landosol, right?  
If we run out of food, then I'm...  
 Wait, no.  
Landosol is done for!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If there's a chance, I have to try!  
Let me pilot the L-Fighter!  
  
**Karin：**  
I suppose you might be our best chance...  
Or so I'd like to say,  
but the L-Fighter actually needs *two* pilots to function...  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Well, we're screwed.  
There's no way we're gonna find someone as tough as Pecorine...  
  
**???：**  
Don't you dare give up! I heard the whole thing!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This voice is...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Could it be...?!  
  
**Lima：**  
It's me!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Um, who?  
The voice isn't ringing any bells.  
  
**Lima：**  
Come on, it's me! Lima!  
I'll board the L-Fighter as Pecorine's co-pilot!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Lima...!  
I guess that body of yours *does* look pretty tough...  
  
**Lima：**  
Those saucers stole the whole stash of tasty apples  
I was saving for later!  
I'm so mad! You have to let me get my revenge!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, Lima...! There's no forgiving food-related crimes!  
I get you! I really do!  
Let's settle this score together!  
  
**Lima：**  
I'm going to outer space to get my tasty apples back!  
  
**Narration：**  
Into the depths of saucer-shaped despair shines a ray of fluffy hope!  
The fate of Landosol rests on the shoulders  
of these two brave young women!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Uh... you guys?  
You haven't forgotten about me, have you?  
 Right?!  
You're coming to save me, not just the food, right?!
