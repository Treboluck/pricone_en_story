## Subtitle: Attack of the Flying Saucers
  
**Narration：**  
It's the day of a big harvest festival in Landosol.  
The members of the Gourmet Guild are browsing the stalls  
and enjoying the tastes of the festival, true to their guild's objective.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A festival all about freshly grown food!  
What a perfect opportunity for our guild!  
  
**Karyl：**  
As if you don't stuff your face every day  
whether there's a festival or not!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The best part is how everyone's giving thanks for the food together!  
Appreciating this year's harvest and praying for next year's bounty!  
What could be more important?!  
 We should celebrate it every day! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, my lord—there is a grain of rice stuck to your face.  
Let me retrieve that for you... *nibble*  
  
**Karyl：**  
These two never change either...  
At least try to restrain yourselves. Geez...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So you say, but you've been buying a bunch of treats too!  
Cotton candy, crepes... Ooh, and a candy apple!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl seems to have covered all of the festival staples.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Sh-shaddup, okay?! What's it to you?!  
They all looked really good...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yep! Nobody can resist a tasty treat!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...What's this weird noise? Ugh, it's really loud.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A technical failure, perhaps?  
It sounded almost as though it came from the sky...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh...?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Kokkoro! Are you all right?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Th-the wind is so strong, I cannot stand...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Grab onto me.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank you very much, my lord.  
It pains me to make you go to such trouble...  
  
**Karin：**  
Members of the Gourmet Guild!  
Just who I was looking for!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, Karin!  
 Heyas! ☆  
What's gotten you in such a tizzy?  
  
**Karyl：**  
When you're in a rush like this, it always means trouble!  
Fine, go on. What's the awful job this time?!  
  
**Karin：**  
These strange noises and gusts of wind  
have been reported in various locations across Landosol.  
We sent some guilds to investigate, but they've all gone missing!  
  
**Karin：**  
We're trying to get a handle on the situation,  
but we can't cover such a wide area by ourselves...  
  
**Karin：**  
We'd like the Gourmet Guild to assist us in locating  
the members of the missing guilds.  
It's a dangerous mission, so we're prepared to offer bonus rewards.  
  
**Karyl：**  
*sigh*... Fine, I guess we'll do it.  
You've got a deal.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's go investigate right away!  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Today's the harvest festival!  
We can't let anything ruin it for everyone!  
  
**Karyl：**  
What the heck's all this?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The buildings are in ruins and there's no sign of the residents...  
It's like a ghost town.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Not only the buildings—  
I also see strange shapes carved into the fields outside.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That noise again?  
 It really makes my ears hurt!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We might be in for another gust!  
Let's all huddle up together.  
Big huuuug! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wahhh?! Don't grab me out of nowhere!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. This feels ever so warm.  
My lord, please lean in a little closer.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Ahh!  
This time the wind's even stronger.  
It's a good thing we were prepared!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank you very much, Miss Pecorine.  
Without your aid, I would have lost my footing.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm? Why'd it go all dark...?  
...Wh-what's that?! Something's floating in the sky!  
A gigantic... saucer?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Could that be the source of all this destruction?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's coming straight towards us!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-what the heck?!  
Get away from meeee!
