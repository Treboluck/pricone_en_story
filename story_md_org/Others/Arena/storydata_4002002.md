# Princess Arena
{player} and the gang have gotten accustomed to Arena Battles, so they question Minerβ on their true purpose. But Minerβ dodges their questions and, instead, introduces a powered-up version of the Battle Arena—the Princess Arena!
  
## Subtitle: Seeking Greater Battles
  
**Narration：**  
Some time has passed since {player} and his guildmates  
began participating in Arena Battles.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Take this!  
  

---  
  
**Karyl：**  
Aww yeah! We win again!  
I gotta say, we're really killing it today!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I didn't think you'd get so into it, Karyl.  
You're really competitive!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Personally, I don't see much of a point  
in fighting opponents we can't eat.  
  
**Karyl：**  
There's totally a point. Think about it!  
  
**Karyl：**  
We get prizes for winning battles,  
and since we're fighting for real, it's the perfect training!  
There are literally no downsides.  
  
**Karyl：**  
{player}, Koro,  
you guys agree, right?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*chuckle* Oh, Miss Karyl. You always notice when my lord  
and I aren't participating in a conversation,  
and always so kindly include us.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You're a very sweet person.  
  
**Karyl：**  
D-don't get me wrong!  
Talking with Pecorine one-on-one for too long wears me thin.  
I had to bring you guys in to save my brain!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*chuckle* If you say so.  
My lord and I both agree  
that there are many reasons to fight in Arena Battles.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The prizes are spectacular and make for an excellent source of  
income.  
I think we gain a lot more by coming here compared to  
working regular jobs.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In fact, the benefits are extraordinary.  
I just wonder, with no audience watching us fight,  
how do they earn the money to pay for the prizes?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah, I wondered that too. It is a little fishy.  
How do they fund all this?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
There's something weird  
about our opponents, too.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
They're kinda similar to *Shadows*,  
but I can't help but feel like something's off out there.  
It feels... fake, I guess.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmph.  
I think our best bet is to ask  
that Minervay lady all these burning questions.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Her name is Lady Minerβ, Miss Karyl.  
And please, be polite when you speak of her.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I can tell that she  
is some sort of mystical being.  
Much like a spirit, or even a deity.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You think?  
She definitely has a divine aura about her,  
but it's like she's detached from reality, or something.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes.  
It reminds me of how it felt when Lady Ameth  
sent me divine messages during my daily prayers.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Lady Minerβ  
has that same kind of transcendental presence.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
For all we know,  
her scowling gaze could evaporate our entire group  
in the blink of an eye.  
  

---  
  
**Minerβ：**  
*chuckle*  
I'm afraid I don't have anywhere near  
that sort of physical power.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
You all are extraordinary beings, as well.  
Currently, my functionality has been severely limited.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Urk. There she is.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Okay, Minerβ.  
We did exactly what you wanted and fought in the Battle Arena.  
Now tell us, what's the point of all this?  
  
**Karyl：**  
The battles are big, flashy, and tons of fun.  
If you advertised and brought in big crowds,  
you'd be raking it in.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But with no one in the arena except us and our opponents,  
it feels like a missed opportunity.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
Well, presently,  
normal people  
cannot even perceive this arena's existence.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
I've decided that continuing as we have,  
in private, is the most favorable course of action.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
But if you feel having an audience would be more motivating,  
I'll consider opening things up to the general public.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
Now, moving on.  
I have something very important to tell you all.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
Because you all have performed far beyond what was expected,  
I feel I can expand the arena's capabilities.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
It will be a more complex,  
more advanced experim...  
ience.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hold on a sec.  
You were about to say *experiment*!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You'd better not be trying to use us  
for some kinda evil scheme!  
  
**Minerβ：**  
Absolutely not.  
I, too, am frustrated  
that all I can do is continue asking that you trust me.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
Fundamentally, I am your ally.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
Now then.  
Let us end the chitchat here.  
Please brace yourselves for what's to come.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
You might feel a bit of dizziness or discomfort.  
Your understanding is appreciated.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Say what?  
Hang on, I've still got a ton of questi—  
Eeek!  
  

---  
  

---  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh!  
The arena's got a new style!  
It looks a little fancier now.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I guess at this point,  
nothing that happens in this weird place should surprise me.  
Still, a heads-up would've been nice. I almost bit my tongue.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Anyway.  
What's the deal this time?  
  
**Minerβ：**  
Welcome.  
This is the expanded, evolved form of the Battle Arena.  
The *Princess Arena*.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
The facility has undergone further development  
to become the stage for a new kind of combat.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
Now you will be able to join harder,  
more frenetic team battles involving multiple  
groups of fighters.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
As before, should you participate,  
you will be rewarded handsomely for your efforts.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
Much like the Battle Arena,  
I sincerely hope you will take part if you are inclined.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
Participation is, as usual, voluntary.  
You are free to come and go as you please.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
As these will be large-scale battles,  
I recommend inviting friends along to fight by your side.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
With more people joining the battle, each  
match will be much more complex.  
You will need to consider your strategies carefully.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
I cannot help but anticipate the thrilling battles that will  
unfold.  
Experimenting with different approaches, drawing  
on all your knowledge and courage as you fight...  
  
**Minerβ：**  
Please, show me more.  
Show me more of the bizarre, fascinating tales  
that only humans can write.  
  
**Minerβ：**  
That is my only desire.
