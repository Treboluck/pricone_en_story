**Narration：**  
After a long and grueling battle,  
Pecorine and friends finally succeed in bringing  
the strange titanic menace to a complete halt.  
  
**Lima：**  
We did it!  
 I think it's really stopped moving this time!  
  
**Karyl：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
That thing *really* didn't want to go down easily...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Lima, you were great!  
I'm so happy we got to fight together like this!  
I want to share this happiness,  
 so let's shake hands! ☆  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh, Pecorine!  
 Honestly, it should be me thanking you!  
May this hand and hoof form a bond  
 that will never be broken!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Of course! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Still, what actually was this thing, in the end?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Its true nature does remain a mystery.  
My lord, did you notice anything, perhaps?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. \"These things happen sometimes,\" you say...  
I suppose there is little to be gained from dwelling on such details.  
A wise observation, my lord.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Honestly...  
That's just like you two...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha... After all that exercise, I'm totally famished!  
Let's go report in to Karin, then spend the reward money on a meal!  
You'll join us too, won't you, Lima?  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh?! You really wouldn't mind?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Of course not!  
It's all thanks to you that peace in Landosol  
and the bright futures of its children are safe once more!  
  
**Lima：**  
Wow~! Thank you!  
It sounds so fun, I can't wait!  
 Ptheh! Ptheh, ptheh!

**Ameth：**  
I'm so sorry!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Don't worry! All that was just a dream!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Sorry, did I surprise you?  
 You just had a dream about Landosol, right?  
But as for why I showed you something so out-there,  
I'm not even sure myself.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Just... forget what just happened.  
Well, I guess you'll do that regardless...  
For once, that frustrating limitation actually works in our favor.  
  
**Ameth：**  
At any rate, those can't be actual experiences you've had.  
Who did those memories even come from?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I mean, a giant weapon like that Robo-Lima  
would destroy the game balance,  
so it would never have been implemented...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Why did I even pick up on memories like that?  
Maybe I'm stretching myself too thin...  
No, I can't lose confidence now.  
 I just need to work harder!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh, sorry, you're still here?  
You can go back now. Bye-bye! See you around~!

**Narration：**  
Try as she might, Ameth couldn't recall whose memories they were,  
and the frustration kept her in a bad mood for the rest of the day.
