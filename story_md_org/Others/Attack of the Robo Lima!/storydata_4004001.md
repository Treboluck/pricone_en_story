## Subtitle: The Spitting Menace
  
**Narration：**  
In the business district of Landosol,  
{player} and the rest of the Gourmet Guild  
are sampling a variety of snacks.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*munch munch*  
Mmmm,  
 the manju buns here are so delicious!  
How crazy is that?! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hang on, how many are you eating?  
Don't you ever get sick of that stuff?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You should try one as well, my lord.  
Here, say \"ah\"...  
Open your mouth wide for me.  
  
**Narration：**  
But just as {player} opens his mouth,  
a sudden tremor shakes the whole district,  
coupled with a mighty rumbling sound.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
?!  
My lord, please stay close to me!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...I-I think it's died down now?  
What was all that shaking even about, though...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Just an earthquake, right?  
That, or it was your stomach as usual.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You might be right!  
These manju are so tasty, I'm still hankering for more!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wait... What is that?  
  
**Karin：**  
Everyone, we have an emergency on our hands!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, Karin!  
 Heyas! ☆  
It's rare to see you getting so flustered!  
  
**Karin：**  
W-well, this really is a huge crisis!  
That quake was an attack by a large unidentified object  
the size of the royal palace, which just appeared to the west of Landosol!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karin, please try to calm yourself.  
What is this object?  
Do you have any more specific information?  
  
**Karin：**  
I'm afraid we're still trying to confirm the details...  
All we know for sure right now is that it's heading for the city,  
causing destruction and chaos in its wake...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah, yeah.  
So I'm guessing you want us to investigate  
and defeat the thing, as usual.  
  
**Karin：**  
Yes... But given the scale of this threat,  
we're actually asking all active guilds  
to help us combat it if at all possible.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh—look up at the sky! Something's flying this way!  
  
**Narration：**  
As Pecorine and friends gaze up into the air,  
a mysterious liquid rains down upon them.  
It seems to gleam and sparkle under the rays of the sun.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aahhh! The whole city is dripping with some kind of sticky, wet goop!  
With the manju stall in this state,  
I won't even be able to buy seconds... Urghhh...  
  
**Karyl：**  
It stinks!  
What *is* all this? Monster saliva...?  
 Gueeehhh...  
  
**Karin：**  
24 hours, at the very maximum...  
That's all the time we have left.  
 By this time tomorrow,  
Landosol will be reduced to a wasteland devoid of life...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Okay, but seriously though, you're just exaggerating, right?  
I mean, monsters the size of palaces  
 don't just pop up out of—  
  
**Karin：**  
We are offering a greater sum than usual...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?  
  
**Karin：**  
The rewards for this quest.  
It's a city-wide crisis, so of course the rewards have to match—  
  
**Karyl：**  
R-really?!  
Say \"Just kidding!\" later,  
 and I swear, there'll be hell to pay!  
All right, guys, let's go take care of this crisis!
