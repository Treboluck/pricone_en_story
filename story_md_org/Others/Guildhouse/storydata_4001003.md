# Guildhouse Episode 3
With permission from Karin, the Gourmet Guild members begin their investigation of the third floor. Beyond the door they force open is a mist of immense magic. Pecorine charges in and loses her mind.
  
## Subtitle: Trouble Unsealed!
  
**Narration：**  
A while has passed since the second floor  
of the guildhouse was unsealed.  
  
**Narration：**  
Worried about the sealed third floor,  
the Gourmet Guild members obtain permission from Karin  
and makes their way upstairs to investigate.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hnnngggh!  
Royal Equipment, full power!  
  
**Karyl：**  
We're counting on you.  
I've removed the magic seal,  
but it's physically barricaded as well.  
  
**Karyl：**  
We'll just have to force it open.  
Thank goodness we have someone with superhuman strength. ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Do your best,  
Miss Pecorine!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord is also cheering you on while waving a tiny flag. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
I don't see what good {player}'s cheering is going to do.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, right.  
He's got some mysterious ability to enhance  
other people's powers. Was that it?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed.  
My lord has also gained experience  
and is gradually learning to wield his power better.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well done, my lord!  
You're doing amazing, my lord! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Koro, why are you in such unusually high spirits?  
Come on, both of you, keep your guard up.  
We don't know what might come jumping out at us.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Understood.  
My lord, please stand back a little.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You too, Miss Karin.  
You lack any true combat ability, correct?  
If a monster appears, you're in danger of falling prey.  
  
**Karin：**  
Okay!  
Are you sure you guys can handle this?  
  
**Karin：**  
If it's too much for you,  
I could ask one of the stronger guilds I manage  
to do the investigation.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No, no, it's fine!  
We'd feel guilty about involving others.  
This a problem inside our own guildhouse, after all.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Besides, we may not look like it,  
but we're actually pretty competent.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I believe that if we combine our strengths,  
nothing is impossible  
for the Gourmet Guild. ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Stop yapping on  
and concentrate, Pecorine.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Also, you know,  
we even haven't confirmed  
it's a monster that's sealed off on the third floor.  
  
**Karyl：**  
On the off chance that there's hidden treasure...  
We'd be foolish to involve other guilds.  
They'd get their hands on our valuable profit.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You're surprisingly greedy, Miss Karyl.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth,  
unlike a \"certain someone.\"  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yes! The door to the third floor just splintered!  
Keep it up, Pecorine! Tear that door apart! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Mmmm?  
Using my Royal Equipment at full power  
is making me super hungry!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If it's a monster in there, I don't think I can handle it. ♪  
I'll have to leave it to all of you.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, that might do it!  
The crack is getting bigger.  
There's a gap wide enough for a person to fit through!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
On the count of three, let's charge in!  
One, two, three! Let's go! ☆  
  

---  
  
**Karyl：**  
Uergh?  
*cough, cough* What's this?  
There's a weird smell!  
  
**Karyl：**  
*cough, cough*  
Feels like there's strange magic in here.  
I'm putting up a barrier, so get behind me!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. A thick, vapor-like air...  
or should I say mist.  
It has a rather poisonous color to it.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It may be harmful, so I suggest we try not to inhale it.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Mmm...  
As the third floor appears to have been completely sealed,  
perhaps it's merely the buildup of stagnant air pouring out?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm...  
But this doesn't seem like just any old contaminated air.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It contains a crazy amount of magic...  
It's basically a visible curse.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'll analyze its structure and get rid of it.  
Let's retreat for now.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It looks like it's a non-directional cluster of magic,  
but anyone lacking endurance will be affected on contact.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Wait, hold on.  
Where's Pecorine?  
Just where did that silly girl go?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
That idiot! Don't tell me...  
Did she go mindlessly charging into the mist?  
  
**Karyl：**  
She needs to take better care of herself and be more careful!  
Why is she always like this?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Complaining won't get us anywhere, Miss Karyl.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine will be out of stamina  
after using her Royal Equipment.  
She may not be capable  
of defending herself.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We must rescue Miss Pecorine, while ensuring  
we do not fall victim ourselves.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We are her guildmates, after all.  
We cannot leave her to die.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, Miss Karin,  
you should remain here just to be safe.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If we do not return,  
that is when we will truly need rescuing by the other guilds.  
  
**Karin：**  
A-are you sure you guys will be okay?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, you need not worry.  
We have overcome such hardship countless times in the past.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh? You wish to join us, my lord?  
You believe you may be able to help somehow?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
Very well. Let us hold hands as we go.  
Please do not leave my side.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh? Miss Karyl?  
We appear to have also lost sight of Miss Karyl.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Did she frantically rush into the mist  
out of sheer worry for Miss Pecorine?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
Of course.  
Those two really do get along well.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord?  
Did you say something perchance?  
My apologies, could you please repeat that?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, your voice is quite soft,  
and it appears this strange mist is muddling my senses...  
I couldn't quite catch what you said.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Agh.  
We seem to have become engulfed in the mist.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I can hardly see anything,  
and my ears and nose also feel numb somehow.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
All my senses are dull, or rather,  
I feel as if I am in a dream.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This truly is an odd mist...  
What exactly is this, I wonder?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine?  
Miss Karyl?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Where are you?  
Please, answer!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well... We are indoors, after all.  
Both of them ought to be nearby,  
but I can't feel their presence at all.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Mmnhhh...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
—?! Miss Pecorine!  
You were closer than I expected.  
It would help if you could at least reply!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...east.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes?  
I am sorry, what did you say?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yaaayyy!  
It's a feast! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What do you mean?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*giggle, giggle*  
Today's dinner is roast meat! ♪  
Wait, or should I let you simmer and turn you into stew?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What a tough choice. ♪  
Eheheheh... ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
H-huh?!  
Wait, Miss Pecorine?  
Why are you trying to slash me?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll chop you and grill you nice and crisp. ♪  
Then I'll season you with spices!  
And, for the secret ingredient—plenty of honey! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
F-for some reason, she is coming up with ways to cook me!  
No, stop...! Help!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Calm down, Miss Pecorine!  
She is clearly not in her right mind!
