## Subtitle: KO Darkblight Crag!
  
**Pecorine：**  
Dun-da-nuh! Doot-do-doo! ♪  
By popular demand, I hereby  
announce the continuation of the Gourmet Guild's worldwide  
food-tasting tour! It's time for chapter five!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Nobody asked for this!  
Where even are we?  
This fog is so thick I can't see my hand in front of my face.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Up ahead lies \"Darkblight Crag.\"  
It's a small mountain covered in toxic mist and slime.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Toxic? Slime?!  
You call this a food-tasting tour?  
Why did you drag us out here?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm glad you asked, Karyl.  
Our target for today is  
an egg!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Because of the mountain's harsh ecosystem, the creatures that  
live here get subjected to incredible environmental stress.  
And it makes them lay eggs with indescribable umami!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The greatest of them all come from the \"Lord of the Mountain\"  
who lives on the peak. Its eggs are the pinnacle of flavor,  
and are known simply as the \"Ultimate Egg!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It energizes the body, invigorates the mind,  
heals illnesses, and fills the stomach!  
It's crazy nutritious!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. If it truly does all that,  
I would love to get one to feed to my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
However, with all the poison mist surrounding the mountain,  
there doesn't seem to be any way to even get close.  
What are we supposed to do?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It just so happens that right now is the Lord of the Mountain's  
egg-laying season. Apparently, that's the one time when  
the mist and slime will recede!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In other words, we've come at the perfect time to obtain  
an egg.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, that's lovely, but it's still a *slime mountain*!  
I'm not going anywhere near that disgusting thing!  
Nope. This time, I'm going home for real.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aww. Karyl, you don't want a taste of the Ultimate Egg?  
I came fully prepared to make Ultimate Egg over rice, too.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Egg... over rice? *gulp*  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Since this is our only chance,  
I used my earthenware pot to steam the rice.  
Soft, fluffy, pillowy rice.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Way to go, Kokkoro!  
  
Only a true foodie would use an earthenware pot.  
  
**Karyl：**  
All right, you win! Clearly this is going to be hopeless  
without me. Since you guys can't handle this on your own,  
I guess I have no choice but togo with you.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's the spirit, Karyl!  
Remember, we're all part of the Gourmet Guild!  
You, {player}, Kokkoro, and me!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Everyone stick together!  
Let's go!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We've climbed this far by waiting for the mist to recede  
before moving, but it seems to be denser up here./3060/  
Be careful, my lord.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*blow* *blow*  
  
**Karyl：**  
Dumborine.  
What exactly do you think you're blowing on?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hee hee. I'm using my lung power  
to blow the poison mist away!  
Wanna give it a shot, Karyl?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Like it'd do anything!  
It only works for you because you have the lung capacity  
of a whale!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, you can do it. Just think about how you're going  
to be eating the greatest egg over rice in history,  
and I'm sure it'll work for you, too!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I seriously doubt it.  
You know, come to think of it,  
we know we're after an egg, but we don't have a clue  
what kind of creature it is that laid it.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That's a good point. I can't in good conscience feed my lord  
the egg of some bizarre creature.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Geez, you two worry too much.  
If it lays eggs,  
it's gotta be a bird.  
I'd bet anything it'll be  
an oversized chicken clucking around the mountaintop!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're sure? I'm trusting you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, the miasma's thinned out again.  
Right now might be our best shot at reaching the summit.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
All right!  
This is the home stretch!
