# Dungeon Episode 2
The Gourmet Guild defeats the monster on Cloudtop Peak and savors its delicious meat. Pecorine gets excited at the prospect of other uncharted lands hiding strange and wonderful delicacies.
  
## Subtitle: The Peak of Flavor!
  
**Pecorine：**  
Time for the sweet taste of victory!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Om nom nom. Delicious! Boy, this was totally  
worth all that hard work. It's even better than I thought!  
This, umm... This something steak!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Mmph. This is the meat of that big monster-like creature we  
encountered earlier, right? Do you think that's what the \"rare  
and valuable ingredient\" was?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Most likely.  
That creature looked like it was really  
long-lived, and it seemed like it was storing nutrients in the  
rock-like parts on its back.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So that was the legendary ingredient of Cloudtop Peak!  
And I'm on cloud nine now that I've tasted it!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Me too. I only wish I had room for more.  
It leaves behind the slightest hint of sweetness  
as it melts in your mouth.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I cannot believe you two ate that  
bizarre thing without even batting an eye.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You should really eat up too, Karyl. Not only did we climb  
the mountain, we ended up fighting monsters the whole way.  
You must be famished!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We've still got the whole descent, plus the journey back to  
town.  
If you don't fill your belly now, you'll collapse on  
the way home.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes,  
I completely agree with Miss Pecorine.  
Furthermore, you cannot fight on an empty stomach, Miss Karyl.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ugh, all right. If the usual pattern holds, you're just gonna  
force me to eat it in the end anyways. Plus, I can't deny it  
smells indescribably delicious.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I guess I can at least have a bite. With all of the treasure  
and stuff we found, I at least need to regain enough stamina  
to carry my share back.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yay!  
Open wide, Karyl! Say \"aah!\" ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hee hee hee! Isn't it just delectable?  
I bet there are more amazing undiscovered flavors out there  
in the other uncharted lands!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We need to keep adventuring far and wide, so we can discover  
them all!  
Together, we'll go on a global tasting tour of the  
rarest, most delicious flavors the world has to offer!
