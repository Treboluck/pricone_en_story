# Dungeon Episode 4
The Gourmet Guild obtains the \"most delicious fruit in the world\" in the heart of Deepwood Oak, but the skin is so tough that they can't figure out how to cook it. They decide to head back to town and do more research.
  
## Subtitle: Thick-Skinned Fruit
  
**Pecorine：**  
Take that!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*whine* Nothing's working! We finally got our hands on the  
most delicious fruit in the world, but the skin's so thick  
and hard. It's impossible to cut!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aww, it smells crazy delicious, too.  
This is torture!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. If Miss Pecorine swinging with all her might while  
empowered by my lord *still* can't cut it, then  
clearly we will  
need to do something extraordinary to prepare this fruit.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We should return to town and start looking through whatever  
books and reference materials we can get our hands on to see  
if we can find a method that will work.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah, sounds like a plan. No point in wasting any more time  
out here. When we get back, I can go through the archives in  
the royal library.  
  
**Karyl：**  
C'mon Pecorine, stop gnawing on that fruit. You look pathetic.  
Let's head home, okay?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Num num. Wait, the skin's yummy all by itself!  
If you suck on it, little drops of juice come through.  
It's so yummy and sweet...  
I can't help myself!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, we wanna try it too! Don't get your spit all over it.  
I  
know there are more of them growing around here, but it was  
such a hassle just to get our hands on that one piece.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I don't wanna go on this journey a million times.  
Let's conserve it, okay?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*sigh* We need to plant one of these in the guildhouse.  
The juice alone is out of this world.  
Num num, nummy nummy. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
What are you, an infant?  
That's it, I'm confiscating the fruit.  
Now pick up the pace. I wanna get home before tomorrow!
