# Dungeon Episode 11
The Gourmet Guild accepts a job from the Guild Association to investigate a remote peak known as Jadewyrm's Roost. Karyl balks at the notion of investigating a terrifying dragon, but nothing can stop Pecorine's overwhelming curiosity about the flavor of dragon meat.
  
## Subtitle: Investigate Jadewyrm's Roost!
  
**Pecorine：**  
We're gonna fight a dragon, guys! A real dragon!  
Isn't that crazy exciting?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, for the—  
Why do you sound so thrilled about this?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
From what Miss Karin told us,  
a violent dragon has been sighted near this mountain's peak...  
  
**Karyl：**  
\"Investigate the dragon, and eliminate it if necessary\"...  
Uh, isn't that a bit of a tall order?  
In the first place, dragons are supposed to be insanely rare, right?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But you know, this job's directly from the Association!  
The info should be pretty reliable!  
Eheheh... A dragon, huh?! I wonder what it tastes like...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait. Pecorine...  
 Please don't tell me  
you took this job just so you could taste dragon meat?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahahahaha...  
 Don't be so ridiculous~!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Dragons are said to be among the most dangerous of all monsters.  
If battle proves necessary, will we truly be able to defeat it alone?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah, exactly! It's a suicide mission!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, don't worry!  
We're just going to investigate  
 and hopefully grab a bit of meat!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...It's no use. There's no stopping Pecorine when she gets like this!  
W-well, it's not a certainty that we'll have to fight it...  
If anything happens, I'll keep you guys safe.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, Miss Karyl...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Anyway, a job that comes from Karin is fishy by default.  
I bet there's something she's not telling us...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aw, Karyl... Do you really need to be so cynical?  
The first step on the gourmet path is faith!  
Have faith in your heart,  
 and tasty dragon meat will surely come!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It is true that the faithful are said to reap great rewards...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And faith is exactly what I have in you two! Come on! Please?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine...  
 Very well.  
I too shall trust in your fine judgment.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...*sigh*... I knew it'd end up like this. I just *knew* it!  
Urgh... I just pray we don't have to battle any dragons!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whew!  
 We made it here in one piece!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This area... It possesses a magical atmosphere indeed.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? Wait. Wait! Hold your horses!  
What's with this place?! Doesn't it look dangerous as heck?!  
Could these be the bones of a stupidly huge dragon...?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We really might find a dragon here!  
 Now I'm even more excited!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This must surely be the nest of the beast we seek.  
However, why would the dragon be behaving violently?  
  
**Karyl：**  
That's a good question.  
Dragons shouldn't have any natural predators to worry about...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No point in wild speculation!  
Let's just get investigating!  
Ready? Chaaaarge!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hold it right there, dummy!  
At least use your brain a *little* first!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I must agree, Miss Pecorine.  
You should not put yourself in harm's way so readily.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't you want to eat it, though?! We're talking dragon meat!  
Said to be so delicious, it's like nothing in this world...  
I bet it's better than any meat we've ever tried!  
  
**Karyl：**  
*gulp*...  
  
**Karyl：**  
B-better than *any* meat we've tried...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We have sampled countless delicacies in our travels together.  
Can it truly surpass each and every one...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes! I'm sure of it!  
  
**Karyl：**  
W... well then.  
 I guess we *are* here on a job.  
It'd be wrong of us not to investigate...  
 Since it's a job.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I concur completely.  
After coming this far, it would not do to return empty-handed.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Great! Then let's go grab ourselves some juicy dragon meat! ☆
