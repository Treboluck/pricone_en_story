## Subtitle: A Recipe for Joy
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Okay, everyone!  
I whipped up a simple dish  
based on the recipe we found in the ruins.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I couldn't find all the necessary ingredients,  
so I can't say I followed the recipe to the letter.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, there weren't many living creatures in the ruins.  
Of course, there were plenty of Shadows at every turn...  
But as long as I get to eat a yummy meal, I can't complain.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Heh heh heh. I can't complain, either!  
The Sheercliff Ruins were hiding a buttload of treasure!  
So much I can't even carry all of it back!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Sure, I almost bit the dust a few times, but I'm glad I came  
along. If I sell all this stuff, I'll be able to get all those  
books and trinkets I've had my eye on. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
The ruins fall under the jurisdiction of the country,  
so legally, I can't keep all this treasure for myself.  
But taking home a little shouldn't be a big deal.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hahaha.  
So, it turns out the recipe we were after  
is written in an ancient language and it's gonna  
take a while to decipher, right?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes. Once again, I have more or less put together a dish  
through feeling.  
How does it taste?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's great!  
Of course, everything tastes delicious when my stomach's empty!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmph.  
You think everything tastes delicious no matter where we go,  
or when we eat, don't you?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
True!  
Everything *does* taste delicious as long as I'm with all of you.  
Everywhere, every time!
