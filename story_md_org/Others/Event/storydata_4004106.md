Hm-hm-hm-hm-hmmm~! ☆  
Lunchtime, lunchtime, I can hardly wait~! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Forget lunchtime,  
I don't think you've stopped eating all day!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, yes... But without a proper lunch,  
my tummy will be empty in no time!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, I expect your tummy is also starting to rumble.  
One cannot fight effectively on an empty stomach.  
Let us share a brief lunch together.
