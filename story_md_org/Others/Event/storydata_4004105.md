Wheeew, this battle's getting crazier than ever.  
But it's times like this you've gotta eat a hearty breakfast  
to build strength!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Breakfast? Seriously? Did you actually bring a meal in this situation?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Of course I did!  
Here—onigiri made from the rice we lovingly raised together!  
  
**Karyl：**  
*munch munch*  
 ...Oh?  
This rice... Wouldn't it go great with pudding, too?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Naturally, I have plenty for you also, my lord.  
Please dig in to your heart's content.
