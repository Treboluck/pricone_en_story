**Pecorine：**  
Ooh, a hole opened up in its chest!  
Do you think it's finally breaking down?  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh no, how scandalous!  
A girl shouldn't reveal her inner secrets like that!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Its insides do seem visible.  
...  
Hmm. So this is how that great body is constructed.  
How intriguing.  
  
**Lima：**  
Ooh, now I'm getting all embarrassed!  
Stop staring, everyone!  
 Especially you, {player}!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahahah!  
Well, its insides seem pretty defenseless,  
so this must be our chance to attack!  
  
**Karyl：**  
But with that hatch open, it's leaking crazy amounts of energy!  
Seems more dangerous than ever...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We already knew this was crazy, Karyl!  
Everyone's still raring to go, right?  
This battle's just getting started!
