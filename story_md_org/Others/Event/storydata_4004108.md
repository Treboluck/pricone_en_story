**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, this lengthy battle must be tiring for you.  
After all our efforts, victory will soon be within our grasp.  
Perhaps this would be a good moment for a short break?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm totally beat, too...  
Honestly, why'd Karin bring us such a crazy mission?  
And accepting it without a thought... How selfless can you be?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, silly Karyl! Don't you remember?  
As soon as we heard about the reward,  
you were more pumped than any of us!  
  
**Karyl：**  
D-don't be so ridiculous!  
As if I'd be tempted by some measly reward...  
Hmph! Forget it!  
 You dummy!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aw, you embarrass so easily!  
You're the cutest, Karyl~! ☆
