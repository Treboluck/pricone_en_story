# I Couldn’t Wish for More
A wish seeking how to kiss properly appears just as Yui and {player} end up alone together. Circumstances push the both of them close together, leaving the wish satisfied.
  
## Subtitle: I Couldn’t Wish for More
  
**Narration：**  
As the sun begins to set for the day  
and the number of visitors increases,  
the crew find themselves getting used to their work.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
So yeah. I asked that all the visitors try to help each other out as much  
as possible. And if there's anyone's that's [[really]] in trouble,  
they can send them to me!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Now we don't need to run around all over the place.  
The problems just come directly to us!  
  
**Rei：**  
So you took {player}'s advice and implemented it  
on a wider scale. Impressive.  
You're always  
on the ball when push comes to shove, aren't you?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ehehe. You think?  
...  
Oh! Someone's calling out for me!  
Lemme go see what's up!  
  
**Rei：**  
Some people never change, do they?  
She really will do whatever it takes to help others.  
  
**Yui：**  
That's what makes her so great.  
Though I'm kind of scared to take my eyes off her sometimes.  
  
**Rei：**  
You and me both.  
We'll just have to keep looking out for her...  
Hey, you two!  
We're on temple grounds here.  
There'll be no fighting on my watch.  
  
**Rei：**  
They're not even interested, are they?  
Sorry. I'll go and sort them out!  
  
**Yui：**  
Take care!  
That's the two of them gone now.  
It's funny how similar they can be, isn't it?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What should we do, then?  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
Hm... I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried about them,  
but we should keep an eye out as well.  
Who knows when another wish could materialize.  
  
**Yui：**  
...  
  
**Yui：**  
Hey, Mr. Knight.  
  
**Yui：**  
I'm sorry.  
We kind of got you all wrapped up in this.  
  
**Yui：**  
I'm sure you wanted to spend New Year's Eve  
with Kokkoro and everyone else, didn't you?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm happy to spend it with you three.  
**Choice: (4)**  If anything, I want to thank you.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yui：**  
Really?  
What a relief...  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Yui：**  
Oh, no! There's no need for that!  
I'm... I'm more than happy that I can spend it with you.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Yui：**  
Th-that didn't sound weird, did it?  
Urgh... I always get so nervous when we're alone.  
  
**Yui：**  
I didn't realize he'd be this happy about it, though...  
  
**Woman's Voice：**  
Eeeeeek!  
  
**Man's Voice：**  
Wh-what's your deal?!  
U-uwaaahhh!  
  
**Yui：**  
That's our cue!  
Let's get going, Mr. Knight!  
  
**Woman：**  
Ugh! Get away!  
  
**Yui：**  
Th-that's...!  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
Someone... Please.. Teach me...!  
  
**Yui：**  
Eeek! I-it's coming this way!  
What should we do?!  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
Someone... Anyone... I'm begging you...!  
  
**Yui：**  
It's going to bother the temple visitors at this rate!  
We need to do something about it.  
The two of us, together!  
  
**Yui：**  
U-um!  
What is it that you want to know?  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
I just... wanted to kiss... my girlfriend.  
A nice, romantic kiss...  
  
**Yui：**  
Whaaaaaa?! K-kiss?!  
U-uhhh.... I'm not too sure about that, myself.  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
Someone teach me....  
Teach me... how to kiss...!  
  
**Yui：**  
Waugh! This is bad!  
  
**Yui：**  
If anything, I want someone to teach [[me]].  
I'll never be able to purify this!  
  
**Yui：**  
Hey, Mr. Knight.  
What should I do here?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Let's teach it ourselves.  
`Tag 6`  
**Yui：**  
Ourselves...?  
W-wait! Wait just a minute!  
Are you... Are you implying that we should kiss?!  
Right here?! Right now?!  
  
**Yui：**  
Me and you? Kiss?! No way!  
I mean... I-it's a kiss, you know?  
  
**Yui：**  
Urgh...  
Hiyori! Rei!  
Help!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yui!  
  
**Rei：**  
Are the both of you okay?  
  
**Yui：**  
Hiyori?! Rei?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yup! That's my name!  
What's wrong? Does your tummy hurt?  
Wanna take a little break?  
  
**Rei：**  
It's rare for Yui to be this distressed.  
Just what sort of wish are we dealing with?  
  
**Yui：**  
Err... W-well, truth is...  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight, I...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Think you can manage it?  
`Tag 8`  
**Yui：**  
Nope! Nope, nope, nope!  
Absolutely not!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Wow, she's really not digging it.  
Does it want her to eat bugs or something?!  
  
**Rei：**  
We're dealing with a force we may not have anticipated.  
Just what in the world was its wish?!  
  
**Rei：**  
Don't push yourself, Yui.  
We can take your place if need be—  
  
**Yui：**  
L-let's not go that far...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I still dunno what's going on, but I'm all ready!  
To do, uh, something.  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
Someone... teach me...!  
  
**Yui：**  
Wait up, Hiyori!  
Eeek?!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Yui! Watch out!  
`Tag 10`  
**Yui：**  
Owieeee...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Are you okay?  
  
**Choice: (12)**  You're not hurt, are you?  
`Tag 12`  
**Yui：**  
I'm fine, yeah.  
Thanks for helping,  
Mr. Knight...

**Yui：**  
Whaaaaa?!  
  
**Yui：**  
Wh-what's going on?! Why's his face so close?!  
Any closer and we'd practically be kissing!  
  
**Yui：**  
S-sorry about that!  
I'll get away from you right away!  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
Woooooow!  
This is it! This is the trick to kissing!  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh?! Wh-what are you—  
  
**Visitor：**  
Wew, look at them go.  
Guess someone couldn't wait for the new year to roll around!  
  
**Visitor：**  
Think they'll go all the way?  
  
**Visitor：**  
Brings back memories, doesn't it?  
  
**Visitor：**  
We were all lovey-dovey like that back in the day.  
  
**Yui：**  
Y-you've got it all wrong!  
That's not what's going on here!  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
Kiss...  
Kiss! Kiss! Kissssss!  
  
**Rei：**  
What's this about... kissing?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
A... kiss? Whaaaaaa?!  
You're telling me the only way to purify  
that wish is for the two of them to kiss?!  
  
**Rei：**  
Th-this isn't a turn of events I was expecting...  
  
**Yui：**  
His face is so close...  
Is this it...? Is this how it happens?  
Can I... Can I finally...  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!  
  
**Visitors：**  
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!  
  
**Yui：**  
Ki...  
  
![501000302.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/501000302.webp)  
**Yui：**  
Ki... Ki..! *wither*  
  
**Rei：**  
Yui! Are you okay?!  
Get a hold of yourself!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yui!  
She's out for the count.  
  

---  
  
`image display end`  
**Rei：**  
Take care of Yui.  
We'll deal with that thing ourselves if it comes to it!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
You realize the two of us'll have to kiss, don't you?!  
But wait! Look!  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
I finally... understand!  
Kissing wasn't what I wanted...  
It was this!  
  
**Rei：**  
Did its wish get granted?  
  
**Corporeal Wish：**  
Consider me fulfilled.  
  

---  
  
**Hiyori：**  
And puff it goes...  
  
**Rei：**  
That was enough to do the job?  
Well, uh...  
I'm glad it went well, at least.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
For sure!  
Good job, you two!  
  
**Yui：**  
Mmm...  
Oh. Mr. Knight...  
  
**Rei：**  
Oh, Yui. Glad to see you're okay.  
You had me worried there.  
  
**Yui：**  
What happened to the wish...?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It disappeared not long after you collapsed.  
Its last words were \"consider me fulfilled.\"  
  
**Yui：**  
Ahh, right.  
Urgh...  
  
**Rei：**  
Why the long face?  
We were able to purify it in the end,  
so there's no reason to be down.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yup, yup!  
Good stuff all around!  
No problemo!  
  
**Yui：**  
Y-yeah...  
Ahaha...  
N-no problemo...  
  
**Yui：**  
Urgh...  
I didn't even get to do anything in the end!
