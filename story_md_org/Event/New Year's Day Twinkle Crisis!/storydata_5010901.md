We were able to purify the kagami mochi in the end.  
All thanks to you, of course.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Thanks so much, Mr. Knight!  
But guess what? We've got a super duper special present for you!  
Here you go!  
  
**Yui：**  
It's New Year's pocket money,  
specially for you.  
The three of us decided that we'd split our own to share with you.  
Hopefully it's enough to make you happy.
