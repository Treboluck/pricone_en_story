# Treasured Memories, Past and Present
The party find themselves busier than ever, but are able to take the time to write down their own wishes. All except {player}, who has no unfulfilled desires or memories he wants to forget. Though the Twinkle Wish trio feel guilty over this, countless corporeal wishes suddenly spawn, enveloping the area in a dark mist.
  
## Subtitle: Treasured Memories, Past and Present
  
**Narration：**  
The party find themselves accustomed to purifying wishes  
by the time night falls. Visitors continue to pour into the  
temple, however, affording them no time to rest.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I'm baaack.  
Man, sure feels like we've been working all day.  
  
**Yui：**  
We should take a little break.  
Our bodies won't be able to keep up at this rate.  
  
**Rei：**  
I am feeling exhausted,  
but we also don't know when another wish will appear.  
  
**Priest：**  
Thank you all for your hard work today.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh! Hello there!  
  
**Priest：**  
If you're in need of a break, now may be the perfect time.  
It's only going to get busier from here on.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Figures...  
  
**Priest：**  
The last few hours of the year contain the highest density of wishes.  
Those that go unfulfilled interweave and entwine with one another,  
often leading to rather dramatic results.  
  
**Priest：**  
I suggest you take extra care as the night goes on.  
  
**Rei：**  
Dramatic results?  
  
**Priest：**  
Precedents have been set in the temple's long history, to say the least.  
If any of you have something in mind,  
then now would be the best time to write it down and offer it up.  
  
**Rei：**  
I'd like to burn away the memories of what happened earlier.  
Haha. Hahaha...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Come back to us, Rei!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Have you all finished writing?  
'Cause I sure have!  
  
**Yui：**  
Same here.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
What'd you write?  
Gimme a peek!  
  
**Yui：**  
Come on, don't look.  
It's embarrassing...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Now you're just making me extra curious!  
How about you, Rei?  
  
**Rei：**  
Hehe... Hehehe...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Well that was a dumb question.  
Guess I'll leave her be.  
  
**Yui：**  
What about you, Mr. Knight?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I didn't write anything.  
`Tag 1`  
**Hiyori：**  
Really?  
Nothing comes to mind?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Nothing at all.  
`Tag 3`  
**Hiyori：**  
...Oh, right.  
Your memories...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I've got nothing but good memories with you all.  
`Tag 5`  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight...  
  
**Rei：**  
Fair enough.  
I wouldn't rid myself of memories together with you all either.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, oh! Then how about this?  
Let's make even more memories together!  
  
**Yui：**  
Sounds good!  
  
**Rei：**  
Indeed.  
We'll go offer up our wishes, so you wait here.  
  
**Rei：**  
Bringing him along today might not have been the best idea.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
How come?  
Sure seems like he's been having fun.  
  
**Yui：**  
I get where you're coming from, Rei.  
  
**Rei：**  
Let's assume that you were an amnesiac.  
Would you feel good about taking part in a ritual that,  
at its core, involves ridding yourself of certain memories?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...!  
Yeah, that must be tough...  
But even still! I just know he'll look back on today fondly!  
  
**Yui：**  
That said, I wish there was something we could do for him.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
There has to be! There has to...  
No. I'm sure there is!  
  
**Rei：**  
Yeah. If he ever needs our help, then we'll do everything we can for him.  
After all...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I scratch your back,  
you scratch mine!  
  
**Rei：**  
Yup. That's the ticket.  
  
**Yui：**  
Yeah! Agreed!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
And with that said, we should head back!  
Let's race!  
On your mark, get set, go!  
  
**Yui：**  
Watch out, Hiyori!  
It's dangerous to run in a kimono!  
  
**Rei：**  
Taking advantage of the fact that you can run while we can't, are you?  
I respect it!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I can't help it!  
I just really want to see Mr. Knight's face now!  
You two feel the same way, don't yo—  
  
**Woman's Voice：**  
Eeeeeek!  
  
**Hiyori & Yui & Rei：**  
?!  
  
**Rei：**  
What's going on?!  
  
**Yui：**  
Did another wish appear?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Something feels... off compared to before.  
  
**Rei：**  
Let's hurry back!  
  
**Wish A：**  
College... Enrollment...  
  
**Wish B：**  
Cheated on... Don't leave me...  
  
**Wish C：**  
Pochi... Won't come home...  
  
**Rei：**  
What in the world?  
We were gone for barely a moment!  
  
**Yui：**  
How did so many spawn this fast?!  
  
**Priest：**  
Oh! There you all are!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
We're here now,  
so you should run!  
Leave these things up to us!  
  
**Priest：**  
Fear not. I've already instructed the visitors to flee.  
The rest is in your hands!  
  
**Yui：**  
There's too many to deal with them one by one...  
  
**Rei：**  
We'll be here until next year if we did that.  
This is bad...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Either way, we should deal with as many as we can!  
  
**Rei：**  
Hiyori, wait!  
Rushing in is too dangerous!
