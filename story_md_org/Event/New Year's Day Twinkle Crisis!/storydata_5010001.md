## Subtitle: Going Out with a Bang
  
**Narration：**  
New Year's Eve.  
{player} makes his way to the destination noted  
on the map given to him by the Twinkle Wish trio.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Mr. Knight! Over here!  
  
**Rei：**  
Hello.  
Pleased to see you're as punctual as ever.  
  
**Yui：**  
Hey, are you thirsty?  
I brought plenty of drinks along with today's lunch,  
so don't hesitate to say so if you want some.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  The three of you look extra fancy today.  
**Choice: (2)**  The three of you suit those outfits.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rei：**  
Curious, are we? These are called kimonos.  
They're mainly worn during New Year's related events.  
Apparently they originate from another continent.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Look, look! They're even fancier than you think!  
  
**Yui：**  
Rei helped both me and Hiyori put them on properly.  
How... How do we look?

`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
Th-thanks.  
  
**Rei：**  
Hehe.  
The compliment is most appreciated.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ehehe! Thanks!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Priest：**  
Forgive me for interrupting.  
You're all from Twinkle Wish, I presume?  
  
**Rei：**  
Indeed we are.  
You must be the priest.  
  
**Priest：**  
Quite.  
I must thank you all once again for agreeing to take up my request.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Not at all!  
If anyone's in trouble, then we're here to help!  
  
**Rei：**  
That's how our guild functions, so please don't worry about it.  
  
**Priest：**  
Very well.  
I do notice that there's one more member than initially discussed, though.  
  
**Yui：**  
Is that... against the terms, maybe?  
  
**Rei：**  
He's here to provide us with backup.  
A reliable partner if there ever was one.  
Please allow him to join us.  
  
**Priest：**  
Well if that's the case,  
then he's more than welcome to.  
I'll prepare his share of the reward.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Thank you!  
Welcome to the party, Mr. Knight!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Thank you for letting me help.  
`Tag 4`  
**Priest：**  
Think nothing of it.  
Now then. Allow me to explain the particulars of this request.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Please do!  
  
**Priest：**  
First off, let us begin with the history of this temple.  
It has existed since time immemorial.  
A place of worship for an ancient deity.  
  
**Rei：**  
I recall reading that its history predates even that of the Tower of Sol's.  
  
**Priest：**  
Quite the scholar, aren't you?  
Said deity governs the concept of wishes,  
and the temple continues to receive its blessings to this day.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
What sort of blessings?  
  
**Priest：**  
Very good question.  
You see... It allows the wishes offered up at this temple to take form.  
  
**Yui：**  
Ahhh.  
That's lovely.  
  
**Priest：**  
And as you all know,  
we hold a bonfire here every New Year's Eve.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  A bonfire?  
`Tag 6`  
**Rei：**  
Wishes that never came true that year are written on paper.  
Praying for them to come true next year, they're tossed into the bonfire.  
This allows those wishes to return to the sky.  
  
**Yui：**  
I've heard plenty of stories about wishes tossed into  
the bonfire actually coming true the year after, too.  
  
**Priest：**  
There are many.  
We're of the belief that by purifying said wishes,  
they become born anew, and more likely to come true as a result.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Wow-wee!  
That's amazing!  
  
**Priest：**  
Of course, not every wish can be granted equally.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Figures...  
That's kind of sad, when you think about it.  
  
**Priest：**  
It is, but in more ways than one.  
Though certain wishes can't come true, the feelings behind them remain.  
That is why I requested your assistance today.  
  
**Priest：**  
The bonfire alone is not enough to completely purify a wish.  
Some may burn, but only in practice.  
Wishes that remain gather at this temple, then eventually become corporeal.  
  
**Rei：**  
What?!  
  
**Priest：**  
They start off as a faint, mist-like substance. But as the new year grows  
closer and the density of wishes increases, they become able to possess  
objects. Even worse, they can materialize entirely and attack our visitors.  
  
**Yui：**  
That's awful...  
  
**Priest：**  
I'm sure you're aware at this point,  
but I'd like to request that you act as security on the premises.  
Should any wishes take form, please do purify them.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Got it!  
Those wishes are probably sad about not being purified,  
so we'll save each and every one of them.  
  
**Priest：**  
Save them?  
Yes, that does indeed have a good ring to it.  
Thank you. It seems I chose the perfect guild for the job.  
  
**Rei：**  
Thank you, too.  
We'll be sure to live up to your expectations.  
  
**Priest：**  
Proceedings are about to begin. As such,  
please take this time to prepare. I have the  
utmost faith that you'll do us well when the new year comes around.  
  
**Yui：**  
Thank you very much.  
  
**Rei：**  
...Purifying wishes, huh?  
We got charged with quite the important task, didn't we?  
  
**Yui：**  
We can manage it, can't we...?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Of course we can!  
We've even got Mr. Knight with us!  
  
**Rei：**  
True enough.  
Bringing you along was definitely the right choice.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Why did you all agree to take on this request?  
`Tag 8`  
**Yui：**  
Well. We actually wanted to spend the New Year's period together,  
but our schedules just wouldn't match up.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
The end of the year itself was fine, though,  
so the three of us agreed that we should close it out with a bang!  
  
**Rei：**  
As an aside, the reward for this job is quite the hefty one.  
That's why Hiyori invited you to come along.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
You said you want to give Kokkoro her New Year's pocket money, right?  
I figured this might be the best way to fund that!  
  
**Yui：**  
We didn't make you force yourself to come, did we?  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Not at all. Thank you.  
`Tag 10`  
**Yui：**  
We're the ones that should be thanking you.  
Let's give it our all today!  
  
**Rei：**  
No need to worry about it.  
I scratch your back, you scratch mine.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Rei?!  
Don't steal my line!  
  
**Yui：**  
Hehe.  
She got you there.  
  
**Rei：**  
Sorry, sorry.  
Anyway. That's enough talk. Let's get ourselves ready.  
A sea of people visit this temple every year.  
We're going to have our work cut out for us.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Okay-dokie!  
Let's get this job done well and good!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus the crew made their preparations  
in anticipation of the incoming flood of visitors.
