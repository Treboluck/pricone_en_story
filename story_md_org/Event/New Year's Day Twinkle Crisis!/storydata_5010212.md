**Hiyori：**  
H-huh? Whoa?!  
  
**Yui：**  
Hiyori! Are you okay?!  
...  
What's going on?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It's not some sort of curtain, right?  
Black mist...?  
  
**Rei：**  
Dammit! It's pitch-black!  
I can't see a thing!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Look! It's clearing up!  
  
**Rei：**  
Are they... Are they all merging together?  
  
**Yui：**  
Something's sucking them all in!  
Over there!  
  
**Rei：**  
No way...  
That's...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey. Isn't that the kagami mochi?  
  
**Rei：**  
You're right!  
This is what the priest meant!  
  
**Yui：**  
They interweave and entwine, leading to dramatic results!
