# Full Circle
More and more wishes continue to materialize, causing chaos at the temple. Though the situation seems dire at first, all the people that {player} and co. had helped beforehand offer to repay the favor, allowing them to focus on and defeat the last remaining wish.
  
## Subtitle: Full Circle
  
**Narration：**  
Countless wishes materialize as the New Year draws close,  
transforming into a giant monster after swarming together  
and possessing the temple's kagami mochi.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
How did it come to this?  
  
**Rei：**  
Our first priority is evacuating the temple visitors!  
That thing has a dreadful aura emanating from it.  
  
**Yui：**  
Wait a minute.  
Isn't it saying something?  
  
**Gummy：**  
Why... Why am I so bald?!  
My precious puppy won't come home!  
Mommy! Where are you?!  
  
**Rei：**  
It's become an amalgamation of multiple wishes...  
This won't be easy.  
  
**Gummy：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
W-watch out!  
  
**Rei：**  
Figures it'd go wild!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are you all okay?  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight!  
Thank goodness you're okay!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
We're all good here!  
But a bunch of wishes have all mixed together into this thing.  
  
**Rei：**  
We need you to take charge.  
Give us precise orders.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Yui. Guide the visitors away from here.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
Okay!  
Leave it to me!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Rei. Keep that thing at bay.  
`Tag 3`  
**Rei：**  
Understood.  
But I'll need you to power me up.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Hiyori. Go find anyone that can help us fight.  
`Tag 4`  
**Hiyori：**  
Okay-dokie!  
I'll be back in a flash!  
  
**Rei：**  
Your opponent stands before you!  
And trust me. You won't be getting past me!  
  
**Gummy：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Rei：**  
Phew. You don't honestly think that's enough to take us down, do you?!  
Come on, I'm right here! Give me everything you have!  
  
**Yui：**  
Everyone! I need you to get as far away from the temple as possible!  
Please give priority to women and children!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Excuse me! Is there anyone confident in their fighting ability here?  
We'd appreciate anyone that can help us out!  
  
**Woman：**  
...  
  
**Youngster：**  
...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hm... This isn't going well.  
  
**Young Man：**  
Hey! I'll help out!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh! You're the person that was looking for the good luck charm!  
  
**Young Man：**  
Sure am!  
You helped me out back then, so now it's my turn!  
  
**Man：**  
Count me in!  
That blue-haired demonfolk is your friend, isn't she?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
You must mean Rei!  
She sure is!  
  
**Man：**  
She helped me out a little while ago.  
And I'm not one to let a favor go without being repaid!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hm? What's wrong?  
  
**Youngster：**  
Let me help out as well.  
  
**Man：**  
Hey there, young'un!  
You sure you've got what it takes?  
  
**Youngster：**  
I do!  
My girlfriend's here, so I want to protect her!  
  
**Man：**  
Well.  
Just make sure you don't pull any stunts that'd make her worry, got it?  
  
**Youngster：**  
Got it!  
  
**Man：**  
Hold up! Count me in, too!  
I can't let you do all the heavy lifting.  
I put out a call to all my buds, too.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Thank you so much!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Heeey! Rei! Mr. Knight!  
I brought along a bunch of people that'll help!  
  
**Rei：**  
Perfect timing!  
It was starting to be a bit of a struggle on my own!  
  
**Yui：**  
All the visitors have been evacuated, too!  
  
**Rei：**  
Good to have you back, Yui!  
We should be able to fight back now!  
  
**Gummy：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Yui! Defensive magic!  
`Tag 5`  
**Yui：**  
Got it!  
Please protect them all!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Rei! Stop its movements!  
`Tag 6`  
**Rei：**  
Roger! Haaaaahhh!  
  
**Gummy：**  
GGRRRUOOOOOOGGGHHH...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Good stuff, Rei!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Hiyori! The rest's up to you!  
`Tag 7`  
**Hiyori：**  
Okay-dokie!  
Get ready! I'm giving you everything I've got!  
  
**Gummy：**  
GGRRRUOOOOOOGGGHHH...!  
  
**Rei：**  
Great! We've got the upper hand at this rate!  
  
**Man：**  
Hey, mochi-face! I'm gonna turn you back into a pile of rice!  
Take this!  
  
**Gummy：**  
GGRRRUOOOOOOGGGHHH...!  
  
**Man：**  
Gahaha! Ain't no thang!  
  
**Yui：**  
Wow! You sure brought some strong people along!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Right?  
Even better, they're all people we helped today!  
  
**Rei：**  
I do recognize that axe-wielder, now that you mention it.  
Quite the reminder that we should always take care  
in how we treat other people.  
  
**Gummy：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
Another wish incoming!  
  
**Rei：**  
New Year's isn't far off,  
but it's looking like we'll have to deal with more and more at this rate.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That won't be enough to stop us, though!  
It's me, Yui, Rei and Mr. Knight! We can't lose!  
  
**Gummy：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Huh? It's trying to take off!  
  
**Yui：**  
It's going to leave the temple!  
We need to stop it!  
  
**Rei：**  
No, let it!  
That thing—  
those things—  
realized that it's dangerous to stay here.  
  
**Choice: (15)**  Then let's lead it outside.  
`Tag 15`  
**Yui：**  
It'll be safer to have the visitors stay close to the temple then, right?  
But can we keep them all safe while fighting?  
  
**Choice: (17)**  That's just extra motivation.  
`Tag 17`  
**Rei：**  
Exactly.  
It's time to go all out!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
A hundred and ten percent! Let's do this!  
  
**Young Man：**  
Please leave things here to us!  
  
**Man：**  
We can handle the small fry here!  
You lot take care of the ones outside!  
  
**Rei：**  
Thanks. We appreciate it!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Let's meet up afterwards!  
  
**Rei：**  
Haaaaahhh!  
  
**Gummy：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Rei：**  
This one's resilient!  
It must be the last one!  
  
**Yui：**  
It's a lot tougher than the rest...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I don't think I can put a dent in it on my own...  
What should I do, Mr. Knight?  
  
**Choice: (19)**  Let's go at it all at once.  
`Tag 19`  
**Hiyori：**  
Got it!  
If there's one thing I'm good at, it's punching away at something!  
  
**Yui：**  
I'll hold off its next attack, then.  
Hiyori, Rei. The rest is up to you after that.  
  
**Rei：**  
Leave it to us.  
We only have one chance.  
Yui! Here it comes!
