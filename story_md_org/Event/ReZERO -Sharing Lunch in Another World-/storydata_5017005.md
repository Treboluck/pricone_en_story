# Encroaching Piety
The Gourmet Guild and its honorary members save Christina from Petelgeuse's attack. Though they thwart his trap thanks to the prophecy, they find themselves surrounded by a huge crowd of Witch Cultists. Working together with Nightmare, they face down this new enemy.
  
## Subtitle: Encroaching Piety
  
**Narration：**  
Petelgeuse Romaneeconti has appeared.  
Hearing this news, the group hurries to the scene aboard a carriage.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Apparently that weirdo is causing a scene in a nearby village.  
Nightmare is keeping him at bay for now, though...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Well, Miss Saren did tell us  
that the members of Nightmare are very reliable.  
  
**Karyl：**  
This team's being led by their vice-captain Christina.  
I can't see anyone beating her with a sword,  
but other things, like her personality, are more worrisome...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You seem well-informed, Miss Karyl.  
Are you acquainted with this vice-captain somehow?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?! O-of course not!  
I've never seen her face  
 or even heard her name!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Even her name?  
Karyl, what's gotten into you today?  
Is your tummy starting to ache from skipping breakfast this morning?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm not a food maniac like you!  
What exactly do you take me for?!  
  
**Ram：**  
Honestly.  
Considering the job ahead of us, you're all very carefree.  
  
**Rem：**  
I believe that is the Gourmet Guild's charm!  
Still, our foe is attacking a village, you say...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Does that worry you?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rem：**  
Yes, I suppose so.  
It brings back some unpleasant memories...  
  
**Ram：**  
Our childhood home was destroyed by the Witch Cult.  
It was only a small village, so it never stood a chance.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh... I had no idea...  
  
**Rem：**  
So you see, I'm worried for the village he's attacking.  
The thought that someone else might go through what we did...  
  
**Karyl：**  
...You don't need to worry about that.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Did you forget?  
Nightmare's already on the case.  
One of the strongest guilds, even among the Princess Knight elites.  
  
**Karyl：**  
So there's no need to be so worried.  
Have some confidence! Come on,  
 chin up!  
  
**Emilia：**  
...Haha.  
You really are such a good girl, Karyl.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wha—?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes, she really is~! ♪  
Our Karyl's the sweetest girl in the whole wide world! ☆  
  
**Ram：**  
If only she didn't hide it behind such a wall of cynicism.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, but that is all part of Miss Karyl's charm.  
Would you not agree, my lord?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It's her cutest feature.  
`Tag 2`  
**Karyl：**  
Qu-quit messing with me!  
That goes double for you, {player}!  
Ugh, what's the big idea?!  
 I'll murder you all dead!  
  
**Rem：**  
...  
Thank you for that, Miss Karyl.  
Thanks to you, I think my anxiety has faded a little.  
  
**Karyl：**  
H-huh. Well, I guess if you say so.  
Ugh, enough! Quit staring at me!  
Isn't it time we got more serious and...  
  
**Puck：**  
Mm, yes.  
Sorry to interrupt the heartwarming mood,  
but I think we're almost at our destination.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Almost there...?  
 Then, that means...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Our second meeting with Mr. Petel from the Witch Cult!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Yes!  
Everyone, we mustn't let our guard down!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
...Ahhh.  
 Aaahh,  
 aahhh!  
Excellent! Most excellent! Wonderful, yes!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
You are a truly wonderful foe!  
Such fierce devotion!  
 Such passion!  
 Such pride!  
Your thirst for life is as diligence made flesh!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah!  
Boldly spoken, phantom in black!  
And you're not half bad yourself!  
 Why don't you pick up the pace?!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
My love!  
 My pure love!  
My authority granted by the Witch's favor!  
Through some authority of your own, you block its every strike!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Then this encounter is a fateful struggle between two passions!  
My love against yours! The slothful must perish, and the diligent prevail!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Truly, truly, truly, truly!  
My brain  
 trembles soooooooooo!  
  
**Christina：**  
Love, you say?!  
 The words of a true warrior!  
Despite your looks, you too are a knight who fights for another!  
Very well—I will respond in kind!  
 With love behind my blade!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah, the thrill. Oh, the merry thrill!  
When did I last put my life on the line like this?! ☆  
  
**Royal Knight 1：**  
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is that woman sane?  
Even with all that magic flying around,  
she's charging in, waving her sword and laughing!  
  
**Royal Knight 2：**  
You think this is anything new?  
Anyone who's served under her  
could tell you this is business as usual.  
  
**Royal Knight 2：**  
Even so, it's rare to see her this excited.  
Guess these two psychos really hit it off somehow.  
  
**Royal Knight 2：**  
Still, at this rate, we can't get close!  
Focus on evacuating civilians, while keeping an eye on his companions!  
  
**Royal Knight 1：**  
...Isn't something off about the vice-captain's movements?  
  
**Royal Knight 2：**  
Playing around as usual, I expect.  
Hey! Don't let your guard down!  
Always stay alert!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hah, my grunts are doing a fine job.  
Staying out of my way? Perhaps they're finally learning.  
  
**Christina：**  
This mortal struggle is a rare treat!  
If anyone tried to interrupt,  
I might accidentally slice them through instead!  
  
**Christina：**  
Still, I must say, he's proving difficult to corner.  
It's as if my Absolute Offense and Defense are lagging.  
  
**Christina：**  
Now and then, I find myself evading without reason.  
...  
Wait, is that not quite right? No, it can't be.  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
...  
  
**Christina：**  
In his eyes, I see a surging intent to kill.  
Whenever it peaks, my Absolute Defense takes effect.  
Which means... he's attacking in some way I cannot see.  
  
**Christina：**  
Haha...  
 Ahahah! What a discovery!  
So, is this what you're telling me?  
  
**Christina：**  
Without my Absolute Defense's protection,  
this man would have slain me at the very first turn?  
  
**Christina：**  
Ohhh, you are a marvel!  
To think that any man, even only in his thoughts,  
could have taken my life!  
 I could fall in love right now! ☆  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Sadly for you, my soul is already devoted to the Witch alone.  
No matter how diligent a woman you are, some things are not possible!  
  
**Christina：**  
Well, that's no fun at all.  
In that case, in lieu of a bouquet,  
let me take your head as a gift to ease my broken heart!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Your way of life is splendid, yes.  
A path so warped it converges upon integrity.  
And yet, even with that,  
 you cannot match my diligence!  
  
**Christina：**  
What do you mean...?  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
I was watching. Closely observing, yes.  
Examining the way you avoid my every attack.  
Deducing the way you may show me an opening.  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Your movements are exquisite,  
but they slow for an instant when dust flies from the ground.  
  
**Christina：**  
...?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh, he's sharp.  
 Indeed, I'm impressed.  
 My Absolute Offense  
and Absolute Defense calculate everything around me.  
Rain, dust... such minute complications interfere with the process.  
  
**Christina：**  
But to see through this in our brief encounter?  
Who exactly is he?  
 Certainly no mere brain-addled criminal!  
  
**Christina：**  
Name yourself, dark phantom!  
I am the vice captain of Nightmare, Christina!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
I am a Sin Archbishop of the Witch Cult, representing Sloth!  
Petelgeuse Romaneeconti,  
 yes!!!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ngh... That attack again?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Striking the ground with unseen blows to raise a dust cloud!  
Not good. Very bad, actually.  
 In this situation, even I...  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
You are...  
 slothful, yes?  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh no—!  
  
**Emilia：**  
That's quite enough!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
What now?!  
Nguaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!  
  
**Emilia：**  
For starters, I tried firing the strongest spell I could manage...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That seems somewhat excessive for \"starters,\"  
but if it helped keep the damage here to a minimum, so much the better.  
  
**Ram：**  
Impressive work, Miss Emilia.  
Nobody can match you in the field of ruthless sneak attacks.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh my...  
An actual compliment from Ram  
 is such a rare treat!  
  
**Karyl：**  
That was a compliment?  
 Not a snide jab?  
  
**Ram：**  
Hah!  
  
**Rem：**  
More to the point,  
the woman who was fighting the Sin Archbishop...  
  
**Christina：**  
Dear me...  
To think my battle would be interrupted so explosively.  
  
**Christina：**  
Now, should I thank you for coming to my rescue?  
Or should I be furious at your interruption?  
Tell me, which reaction better suits your tastes?  
  
**Ram：**  
Well, what an audacious damsel in distress.  
Does she not realize we just saved her life?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Now, now, Ram! Don't start a fight!  
Are you quite all right? You're not hurt, are you?  
  
**Emilia：**  
I did make sure not to hit you,  
but I'm very sorry if the sudden attack scared you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
M-Miss Emilia, I don't think...  
  
**Rem：**  
That sort of kindness  
seems more likely to anger her than anything...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Huh? Did I say something wrong?  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahhh, you people cramp my style!  
So much for the good day I was having.  
  
**Christina：**  
And dear me, it looks like even young {player} is here.  
Along with another face I think I recognize...  
  
**Karyl：**  
...  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmph.  
 Intriguing though this all is,  
I suppose I won't say anything out of turn.  
Nobody would love me for spilling the beans too soon.  
  
**Christina：**  
Besides...  
It seems we may not have time to stand around and chat.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, yes...!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
And yet, ahhh, and yet!  
This pain I feel is the proof that I live on!  
With this body of flesh, I retain a place in this world!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Waagh! H-h-h-he's back?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh,  
 he's as feisty as ever, that Mr. Petel!  
Even that massive spell didn't leave a scratch!  
  
**Rem：**  
I'd expect no less from an Archbishop...  
However, this time you won't escape! I will take you down!  
  
**Ram：**  
Yes, well said, Rem.  
Let's take out our stress by tearing him to pieces.  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Bold words you speak!  
Yet you are not the only ones who have come prepared!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Silver-haired elf with the amethyst eyes! And you, half-devil!  
To test you and your heresy against the Witch,  
I have laid cunning plans away from your sight!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
To test myself and Miss Emilia...?  
  
**Emilia：**  
...I'm afraid I can't understand how you feel right now  
or what makes you do this.  
  
**Emilia：**  
But look at all the people surrounding you.  
Surely now you see you're at a disadvantage?  
So please, just surrender! Then we won't have to...  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
You will show me gracious mercy?  
Pity, for a Sin Archbishop blessed with the Witch's own favor?  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
...You must be taught to learn your place!!!  
  
**Emilia：**  
...?!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Try as you may, nothing will cause my faith to falter!  
Least of all the words of a half-devil such as yourself!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
How could my diligence ever permit such a slothful act?!  
Ah, such humiliation! Ah, such insolence! Ah, such disgrace!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
In other words, such sloth!!!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I-I think he's completely lost it now...  
  
**Puck：**  
Yep, as expected, there's no use reasoning with him.  
That man... well, all Witch Cultists, are sick in the head.  
  
**Puck：**  
They see their twisted faith  
as a grand trial bestowed by some greater being.  
  
**Puck：**  
If they remain true, they'll be sent to a better place.  
That's what they believe. They'll never see things our way.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Puck...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Either way, looks like the time for talking's over!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I rather doubt further conversation will prove productive.  
As such, I too must stand firm to protect myself.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Besides, I cannot ignore  
anyone who would speak so harshly of Miss Emilia.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh, Kokkoro... Pecorine...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, guess we'll just have to use our force of numbers.  
You're the one who made so many enemies, so don't go blaming us!  
  
**Christina：**  
Such a resolution is hardly to my tastes,  
but since you saved me, I suppose I'll refrain from interfering.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Mm, all right. Stay there and watch.  
We'll take care of this naughty Sin Archbishop ourselves!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Oh, yes. Come, do your worst.  
 Show me your might!  
I am a Sin Archbishop of the Witch Cult, representing Sloth!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
...Petelgeuse Romaneeconti, yes!!!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Great, then let's go, everyone!  
We'll beat him up good,  
 then have a massive feast to celebrate!  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
\"In the near future, a sickening evil will appear in your path!  
You will know your nemesis by his freakily neat green hairdo!\"  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
\"This man wields a terrifying power of his very own,  
which may place you in grave danger if you even approach him.\"  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
\"Now listen! When you face your foe, remember this advice!  
Rain or dust, mist or fog will bring luck to your side!\"  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
\"Your enemy has many allies to support him.  
So stay alert and never let your guard down!  
 Hoh hoh hoh!\"  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
\"Only you have the power to seize your happy end!  
Good luck out there!\"  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Guys, wait!  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Chaaaarge! ...Wait,  
 huh?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, is something the matter?  
Approaching him directly may be dangerous, you say?  
  
**Karyl：**  
What are you talking about?!  
We've got him cornered, and you want to just chicken—  
  
**Emilia：**  
Is this about the prophecy?  
You're worried about what Subaru told you?  
  
**Rem：**  
A terrifying power, and a hint.  
If those really were Subaru's words...  
  
**Ram：**  
We have the clear upper hand.  
If we attack now, victory seems assured. Even then...?  
  
**Ram：**  
Answer me.  
Even then, will you place Subaru's words first?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  My heart tells me to trust him.  
**Choice: (5)**  I made him a promise.  
`Tag 4`  
**Rem：**  
...!  
That answer is as fanatical as a demon!  
  
**Ram：**  
Honestly... Your blind faith is ridiculous.  
I'm at a loss for words, so do as you like.  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Emilia：**  
...Mm, yes. Yes, I see.  
All right, then. After all,  
 promises are very important things!  
  
**Puck：**  
Keeping a promise, huh.  
 Maybe you're pretty cool, kid.  
I think my heart just skipped a beat under all this fluff!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Then, my lord.  
If we are to believe this prophet's—Master Subaru's—words...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  The enemy isn't alone!  
`Tag 7`  
**Petelgeuse：**  
You are... diligent, yes?  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
To think you would read my hand.  
How in the world...? Or... was I the slothful one?  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Ahhh, aahhh! But if I was,  
 how terrible that would be!  
I myself! Through sloth, no less! Ruining the perfect chance  
to demonstrate my love for the Witch...!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Deplorable, truly deplorable!  
My love, my love, love, love, love!  
 I must prove it now!!!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
...  
  
**Karyl：**  
H-he froze up staring at the sky...  
What the heck's that weirdo doing now...?  
  
**???：**  
...Keheheh, keheheh, keheheheh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That noise... No, is that... laughter?  
  
**???：**  
Keheheh, keheheh.  
Keheheheheheheheheheheheheheheh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It seems to be growing closer.  
Ahhh... Something about this feels crazy bad...  
  
**Emilia：**  
...!  
Look! Just behind him... Right behind Petelgeuse!  
  
**Ram：**  
A crowd of people is emerging from the forest...?!  
  
**???：**  
Keheheheheheheheheheh!  
Keheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheh!  
Keeeeheheeheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
H-hold on! What the actual heck?!  
 This is way too scary!  
  
**Ram：**  
Normal villagers... Beastfolk, even knights...  
All laughing in unison. How creepy...  
  
**Christina：**  
Hahah. Now this is a surprise!  
My friends, you see who they are?  
It's the missing people who were abducted by this man!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The missing people, you say?  
No, but... far from abductees, they seem like...  
  
**Rem：**  
Witch Cultists...!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Indeed! I evangelized!  
It took quite some time, but I raised a new force from nothing!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
All of this thanks to my Gospel's guidance!  
No matter how I am stranded, the Witch abandons me not!  
As such, I too must strive to serve her needs,  
 to serve her in kind, yes!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
For love! Love must breed love!  
That alone is my duty! The sole reason for which I live!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Ahhh!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Ahhh, aaahhh!  
  
**Petelgeuse & Cultists：**  
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, aaahhh!!!  
My brain, it trembles sooooooooooooooo!  
  
**Christina：**  
...All of you, get ready.  
Draw your blades if you wish to live.  
Take their lives to save your own. This is a battlefield now.  
  
**Royal Knight 1：**  
Vice-Captain...? Of course... Understood!  
  
**Royal Knight 2：**  
We will fulfill our duty  
and risk our lives as knights of Nightmare!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
They're so pumped up... It's crazy!  
Also, that book Mr. Petel is holding  
is the one our new friends need to get home, isn't it?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Yes... It should be.  
We need to defeat Petelgeuse, calm down all those people,  
take the book for ourselves, umm, and then, and then...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Once everything's settled,  
we'll throw a great big feast and eat till we drop!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Let's do this, guys!  
`Tag 8`  
**Emilia：**  
Yes... This must be the final battle!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
To protect my lord, I will give all the strength I possess!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
I look forward to seeing how long  
 that spirit lasts!  
Now, now, now, now! Go forth, my devoted believers!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
It is time to bid farewell to sloth and prove your diligent faith,  
 yes!!!
