**Rem：**  
Sin Archbishop of the Witch Cult.  
Was tarnishing one world not enough for you?!  
  
**Ram：**  
Calm yourself, Rem.  
This isn't like the time our village was attacked.  
We have reliable allies...  
 yes, friends fighting with us.  
  
**Rem：**  
Dear sister...!  
  
**Emilia：**  
She's right, Rem.  
I can't let that man's crimes go unpunished, either.  
Let's face him together,  
 okay?  
  
**Rem：**  
Dear sister... Miss Emilia...  
 Thank you so much.  
Please lend me your strength in battle!
