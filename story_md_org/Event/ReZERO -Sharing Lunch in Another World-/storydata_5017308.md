**Rem：**  
This strength...  
 I hate to admit it,  
but he lives up to his name as an Archbishop of Sin!  
  
**Ram：**  
Even with our magic, defeating him won't be easy.  
What an irritating pest of a man.  
  
**Emilia：**  
No matter how strong he might be,  
I can never forgive him for what he's done!  
Your crimes end here, villain!
