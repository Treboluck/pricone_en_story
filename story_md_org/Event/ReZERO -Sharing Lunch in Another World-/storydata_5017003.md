## Subtitle: Nostradamus's Prophecy
  
**Jun：**  
My apologies for calling you all here.  
Fellow Princess Knight guild members,  
I have assembled you to discuss an important matter.  
  
**Jun：**  
And that is—the recent incidents in the vicinity of Landosol.  
Specifically, the damages caused  
and the dangerous culprit behind them.  
  
**Saren：**  
I must say, this is unusual.  
Doesn't Nightmare usually try to take care of incidents like this alone?  
  
**Jun：**  
Alas, you are not wrong.  
Our guild is often more secretive than seems strictly necessary.  
I hope to improve upon this going forth, so please let it rest for today.  
  
**Saren：**  
All right, all right, Jun. I understand.  
So? Have you uncovered any details about these incidents?  
  
**Jun：**  
Yes, we have indeed.  
As I initially mentioned, the reports come from near Landosol.  
Though their scale is small at present, the contents are most troubling.  
  
**Saren：**  
Disappearing villagers and sightings of a dangerous individual.  
  
**Jun：**  
Impressive, my d... ah, Saren.  
You already learned that much on your own?  
  
**Saren：**  
As leader of a guild, I keep my ears open.  
But you must have uncovered more information than that, I hope?  
  
**Jun：**  
You demand much of us... But yes, we have.  
I would like to add a number of supplementary details.  
  
**Jun：**  
It seems that there is a definite connection  
between the disappearances and the mysterious individual.  
  
**Jun：**  
In fact, people close to the missing persons have attested  
that they went along with the stranger of their own accord.  
  
**Saren：**  
The villagers went along willingly?  
But then, does that really count as disappearing?  
It's more like they ran away.  
  
**Jun：**  
If that was the end of it, then yes.  
But when their friends attempted to stop them,  
they were met with violence, and some were heavily injured.  
  
**Jun：**  
Bearing that in mind, these seem more like abductions.  
Particularly when they are by no means isolated occurrences.  
  
**Saren：**  
Villagers willingly fleeing their homes, with violent consequences...  
So Jun, what do you want us to do about this?  
  
**Saren：**  
Though I hate to admit it,  
my guild has no real fighters aside from myself.  
We won't be a whole lot of help on an all-out manhunt.  
  
**Jun：**  
No, you can leave the actual combat to us.  
What I would ask of you all is to spread word of the danger  
and keep the populace alert.  
  
**Jun：**  
For our part, Nightmare has dispatched patrols  
to bring the situation under control.  
Our vice-captain herself has set out for the affected region.  
  
**Saren：**  
\"Vice-captain\"...  
 Is it wise to let Christina handle this?  
  
**Jun：**  
She was most eager, and her skills are beyond doubt.  
No dangerous individual could hope to outmatch her.  
  
**Jun：**  
At any rate, that's all from us.  
If there are no questions, you may all take your leave.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, Jun, can you wait a moment?  
About the mysterious individual...  
Would you be able to share the specifics of those reports with me?  
  
**Jun：**  
Certainly, but why?  
The affected region is far from your orphanage.  
Is there really need for such immediate concern?  
  
**Saren：**  
No, you're right.  
It may not affect me, but it's not me who wants to know.  
I've actually taken in a group of somewhat unusual guests...  
  
**Jun：**  
Ah, I see. Always working hard for others.  
Very well. I'll share all the information I have to offer.  
  
**Saren：**  
Thank you.  
I really appreciate it, Jun.  
  

---  
  
**Saren：**  
And that sums up everything I learned.  
Was it useful at all?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Yes, it was a big help!  
Still, I guess you really are an important person...  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm no big shot anymore.  
These days, I have my hands full with the orphanage.  
But I'm satisfied with this life.  
  
**Rem：**  
Your work is most admirable.  
The children love and respect you more than anything, Miss Saren.  
  
**Saren：**  
Sometimes, I feel as though  
it's me who needs them even more than they need me.  
  
**Ram：**  
...I can understand that a little.  
  
**Rem：**  
Dear sister?  
  
**Ram：**  
No... it's nothing.  
In any event, our enemy's movements are quite concerning.  
  
**Rem：**  
What could the Archbishop be trying to achieve  
by luring all those villagers away from their homes?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Even injuring people who tried to help... It's awful.  
We can't let him get away with this...  
  
**Saren：**  
OK, hold it right there. Settle down a moment.  
I hope you remember the promise you made me?  
  
**Saren：**  
We agreed that you wouldn't do anything rash.  
I didn't bring you this information  
so that you could put yourselves in harm's way.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Yes, but...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Saren is quite correct, everyone.  
It seems the knights of Nightmare are on the case.  
So there is even less call for us to involve ourselves.  
  
**Ram：**  
Just how reliable are these \"knights of Nightmare,\" exactly?  
  
**Saren：**  
In terms of strength, they're Landosol's finest.  
Though Jun is still working to improve their organizational flaws...  
  
**Ram：**  
You're quite sure they'll be a match for the Witch Cult in battle?  
  
**Saren：**  
Yes, absolutely.  
Christina, too, though she has personality issues,  
is stronger than me with a blade in battle.  
  
**Saren：**  
I understand your reluctance to leave this to others.  
I feel the same way myself, to an extent.  
  
**Saren：**  
But...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  This is exactly what guilds are for.  
`Tag 1`  
**Emilia：**  
{player}...  
  
**Saren：**  
I couldn't have put it better myself.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes. It is just as my lord says.  
The people of this land form guilds to face hardships together.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Mm... All right, then.  
I'm still very concerned, but I'll trust in them.  
  
**Ram：**  
Yes, don't you worry.  
Sitting and waiting for results is what I'm good at.  
  
**Rem：**  
Ah, my dear sister! Such elegance even in idleness.  
Who could possibly compare?!  
  
**Emilia：**  
I suppose that settles that, then.  
We'll wait here  
 for good news from Nightmare.  
They'll handle everything fine, I'm sure.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  ...I'm getting kind of sleepy.  
`Tag 2`  
**Saren：**  
Oh, what a big yawn.  
Right after you said something so cool, too.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It is only natural.  
The hour is getting rather late.  
  
**Saren：**  
True enough.  
We have an early day tomorrow, so let's rest.  
I think I'll stay at the orphanage today, as well.  
  
**Rem：**  
Oh, then let me prepare your room for you!  
Miss Suzume has shown me how everything is done.  
  
**Saren：**  
Ahaha, it's almost like you're part of the household.  
  
**Ram：**  
Don't worry.  
I won't overstep the bounds of my role as a guest.  
  
**Saren：**  
I don't think anyone would complain if you did...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh? {player}?  
What are you doing out here so late?  
  
**Emilia：**  
You couldn't sleep?  
Oh... that's why I'm here too.  
I still feel wide awake, so I came out for some fresh air.  
  
**Emilia：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Are you worried?  
`Tag 3`  
**Emilia：**  
...I can't hide it from you, huh?  
Is my face really that easy to read?  
  
**Emilia：**  
It isn't about Nightmare, though.  
I decided I'm going to trust them on this,  
so I mustn't dwell on it too much.  
  
**Emilia：**  
No, my biggest worry is Subaru.  
We still haven't found the faintest sign of him.  
  
**Emilia：**  
He has brains, but his muscles are so dinky!  
So I worry how he'll do out there on his own...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Don't worry, he'll be fine.  
**Choice: (5)**  Who even says \"dinky\" nowadays?  
`Tag 4`  
**Emilia：**  
Haha... You make it sound so certain.  
Are you trying to comfort me?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Mm, thank you a lot.  
Talking about it seems to have helped a little.  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Emilia：**  
...Oh, that was such a surprise!  
You sounded just like Subaru.  
  
**Emilia：**  
It feels almost like I'm talking to him.  
Maybe that's why I feel a little calmer now.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Emilia：**  
I suppose you might be  
a bit similar to Subaru, in some ways.  
  
**Emilia：**  
I think the two of us will be great friends.  
But first, I have to find Subaru, and quickly.  
  
**Emilia：**  
...!  
Did you just hear a noise from behind the orphanage?  
  
**Emilia：**  
I'll go and have a quick look!  
You wait for me here, OK?  
  
**???：**  
Whew, that was a close one.  
Didn't think I'd stumble on a grave for broken pots...  
Why are there so many broken pots here, anyway?  
  
**???：**  
Still, now I know where Mili and the others are.  
I just gotta stay calm, focus, and get outta...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Hello there.  
`Tag 7`  
**Young Man：**  
Omoplata~?!  
  
**Young Man：**  
Wait, crap! I didn't mean to shout!  
Mili, uhhh...  
 didn't notice, I guess...?  
  
**Young Man：**  
Ughh, that was close.  
Yeesh, what's the big idea...  
 Gah! It's you!  
  
**Young Man：**  
Huh? Me? Oh, I'm nobody suspicious!  
I, uh, know that doesn't sound convincing,  
but I'm really not a peeping tom or an intruder...  
  
**Young Man：**  
Dang, I wasn't planning to run into anyone here.  
But hang on. You're all on your own, right?  
This might be a good opportunity!  
  
**Young Man：**  
All right! I've got a secret to share with you.  
It's important, so listen close, {player}.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  How do you know my name?  
`Tag 8`  
**Young Man：**  
That'd be because... I'm actually a prophet!  
  
**Young Man：**  
Oof! I can see you trusting me less with every word!  
...I get it. I understand, I really do!  
But please—you just gotta hear me out!  
  
**Young Man：**  
First up, you can call me Nostradamus the Second,  
and I'm about to give you the prophecy of a lifetime!  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
\"In the near future, a sickening evil will appear in your path!  
You will know your nemesis by his freakily neat green hairdo!\"  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
\"This man wields a terrifying power of his very own,  
which may place you in grave danger if you even approach him.\"  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
\"Now listen! When you face your foe, remember this advice!  
Rain or dust, mist or fog will bring luck to your side!\"  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
\"Your enemy has many allies to support him.  
So stay alert and never let your guard down! Hoh hoh hoh!\"  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
\"Only you have the power to seize your happy end!  
Good luck out there, {player}!\"  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
Yeah, that's the long and short of it.  
I'll be doing my thing too in the background,  
but I need to leave the main stage to you.  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
After all, I've returned by d—  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
Ueerghhh...!  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
T-talk about strict!  
 That part's a no-go?  
I can only share what I know up to a certain limit...  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
If I try to say any more, I face a nasty penalty...  
But I can't let that scare me away from talking.  
I've gotta share *some* of the important stuff, or we're all done for!  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
So say it I will!  
Listen, and listen close! I'll take care of the guy's \"fingers\"!  
But I can't fight with you. He'd just make me a \"finger\" too!  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
To prevent that, I'm staying outta the fight.  
I'm still gonna do whatever I can, but I need your help!  
For the parts I can't handle, I've just gotta stake everything on you!  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
So please! This must all sound pretty crazy, right?  
But I want to help everyone. I just need you to trust me!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  ...All right.  
`Tag 9`  
**Nostradamus?：**  
...Yeah, figures.  
I wouldn't trust me either if I was in your shoes.  
This is why I wanted to prepare better before I...  
 Wait, huh?  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
Eh? What'd you just say?  
You didn't say \"All right,\" did you?  
To a wild request like that? From a guy you've never even met?!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Were you lying?  
`Tag 10`  
**Nostradamus?：**  
Of course not! I wouldn't lie!  
I'll swear it to every god, every demon,  
and every legendary dragon I've heard of!  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
I'll swear it,  
 but will that really make you believe?  
Even without a shred of proof to back it up?  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
...Well, damn.  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
Uhh, I mean...  
 Yeah. Sure. Of course. That's just who you are.  
The kind of guy who'd have my back, even right from the get-go...  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
Dangitall. All that planning, all that effort, and for what?  
I should've done this from the very start...  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
Ahah... hahaha...  
  
**Choice: (11)**  Are you OK?  
`Tag 11`  
**Nostradamus?：**  
Yeah. I'm fine. So fine!  
Haven't been finer since I arrived in this place.  
And it's all thanks to you. I'm counting on ya.  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
...Well, I guess Mili and the others might be here soon.  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
Can't outstay my welcome. I oughtta head off.  
Don't let on too much about me, all right, bro?  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
I'd open up and tell you all everything if I could,  
but having me around's a one-way ticket to a nasty ending.  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
So, one last thing. \"Unseen Hands\"!  
Remember that name, and be on the lookout for them.  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
Now, good luck!  
Live strong out there, bro!  
  
**Emilia：**  
...Ah!  
Are you OK?  
 Nobody came this way, did they?  
  
**Emilia：**  
You didn't see anyone bad?  
Oh, good. That's a relief.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Me, I just found a pile of old pots.  
I suppose they must have fallen over.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Well, we don't want to be noisy and wake everyone.  
It's probably time we went back to our rooms.
