## Subtitle: The Final Battle!
  
**Ram：**  
It's been a long struggle with the Sin Archbishop,  
but this should be the final day.  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes, dear sister.  
Today, I will defeat that Archbishop once and for all!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh, stop... You always try to do everything on your own.  
We're all in this together! Say it! Ready, go!  
  
**Rem：**  
W-  
we're all in this together...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Very well done!  
  
**Ram：**  
Hahah... After seeing Rem make a face like that,  
I suppose even I'll have to put in a little effort.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Good!  
All three of us can give that nasty villain a proper spanking!
