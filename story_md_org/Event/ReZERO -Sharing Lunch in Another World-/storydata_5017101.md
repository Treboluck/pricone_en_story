Having stumbled into the alternate world of Landosol, Emilia and her friends find themselves working with the Gourmet Guild to hunt down their missing friend...
  
**Rem：**  
The entrance hall is clean now,  
so that just leaves the bedrooms and storerooms...  
  
**Ram：**  
You sound glum. What's wrong, Rem?  
You seemed fine until you went to wake Barusu.  
Did he look that depressingly ugly in his sleep?  
  
**Rem：**  
No, dear sister. Subaru's sleeping face  
was so very sweet, I could have stared at it all day.  
I'm just  
 rather anxious for some reason.  
  
**Rem：**  
I feel an ominous sensation from the mansion, too...  
With the mabeasts gone, there shouldn't be anything to fear, and yet...  
  
**Ram：**  
Really... How worrying.  
Well, I suppose we should tie up Barusu  
and throw him out before he brings us any more trouble.  
  
**Emilia：**  
...Oh, you silly girl, Ram.  
Why do you say such naughty things?  
  
**Rem：**  
A good morning to you, Miss Emilia.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Yes, good morning, Rem.  
So, is there something worrying you?  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes.  
I just have the strangest foreboding feeling...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Really? You too? Actually, so do I...  
Although I'm not sure if what I'm feeling is really all bad.  
  
**Ram：**  
You don't think it feels entirely negative, you mean?  
  
**Emilia：**  
No... It does feel very worrisome,  
but I get the sense that a really, really lovely meeting  
could be waiting for me  
 just around the corner!

**Emilia, Rem & Ram：**  
Coming soon: \"Re:ZERO - Sharing Lunch in Another World.\"

**Ram：**  
A lovely meeting... I see.  
So that time has finally come for you too.  
Looks like  
 Barusu has finally met his match.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Huh?  
Why would Subaru be fighting someone?  
  
**Rem：**  
Oh, Subaru...  
Sometimes even I feel a little sorry for you...
