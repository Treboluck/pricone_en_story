**Petelgeuse：**  
Witch... Lady Witch! My Lady, my Witch!!!  
Grant me your love... Your deepest love...!  
  
**Emilia：**  
He's completely consumed by the madness...  
  
**Ram：**  
I'd love to leave him to his ridiculous ranting,  
but I suppose that won't do.  
  
**Rem：**  
Indeed. As though feeding upon his madness,  
the Cultists are clearly growing in strength.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Both of you, look over there!  
  
**Rem：**  
Th-those are...  
  
**Ram：**  
Could they be \"Shadows\"...?!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Pecorine did mention them.  
Monsters that take people's forms...  
But I didn't think they'd look this much like Rem and Ram!  
  
**Rem：**  
Worse still, just like the Witch Cultists,  
they seem to be under the Sin Archbishop's control!  
  
**Rem：**  
Monster or no, turning me and my sister  
into filthy Witch Cultists...? Utterly unforgivable!  
  
**Ram：**  
...Even I don't think I can keep my cool in the face of this!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Both of you!  
I'll support you, so take them on with everything you've got!
