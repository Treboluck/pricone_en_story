## Subtitle: A Toast to Otherworldly Dishes
  
**Narration：**  
With Petelgeuse utterly defeated,  
the group files a full report of the incident with the authorities.  
Before long, the suspicions against Subaru Natsuki are cleared.  
  
**Ram：**  
Oh, you're back, Barusu.  
How's freedom taste, you old jailbird?  
  
**Subaru：**  
That's how you greet a friend who was arrested on false charges?!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Ahaha...  
Still, it's good they let you go so quickly.  
I'm sure it's all thanks to Miss Saren's efforts defending you.  
  
**Saren：**  
*sigh* Honestly.  
Personally speaking, it's the rest of you who I'd like to give  
a piece of my mind for breaking our promise...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Ahh...  
 Um, listen...  
  
**Saren：**  
But, well, you all came back safely.  
And you weren't reckless—you fought for a good cause.  
So how am I supposed to stay angry with you?  
  
**Suzume：**  
The whole time you were away, milady was beside herself with worry.  
So I think she's just happy to see you all again!  
  
**Saren：**  
Suzume! Do you need to tell them all that?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
H-huh~?!  
I'm so sorry, miladyyy!  
  
**Karyl：**  
How are they always like this?  
These people can't stay serious for two seconds...  
  
**Rem：**  
Hee hee.  
 Yes, you're right.  
But I'd much rather see everyone laughing  
than with serious frowns on their faces all the time.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Well, guess I can't argue with that.  
*sigh* Oh boy. Have they started to infect me too?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl, you have always been a kind soul.  
Rather than \"infecting\" you,  
 perhaps we revealed your true nature...  
  
**Karyl：**  
K-Koro?! Don't you start as well!  
I was trying to have a moment, so leave me alone!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, but listen! Our efforts were all worth it!  
Thanks to us helping out Nightmare,  
they gave us a big pile of reward money!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's why this party  
has gotta be the biggest one we've ever held!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I thought I might die of hunger back there,  
but now look at all this food! It's crazy!  
At this rate, I might drop dead from happiness instead!  
  
**Emilia：**  
We all worked so hard to win the battle.  
I can't let you die now for such a silly reason.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aww~!  
Oh,  
 then why don't you feed me a spoonful yourself?!  
Then you can make sure I eat a sensible amount!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Really?  
Mm, all right. Say \"ahh\"...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhhh~!  
 Mmm! That's so good!  
I think you're a natural at this! How crazy is that?  
Hey, Emilia, can I fall in love with you?  
  
**Subaru：**  
Whoa, whoa, whoa!  
All that friendly flirting between girls is like, uh,  
 you know!  
It's a beautiful thing, but still! It's kinda...  
 see? Yeah?!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Sorry, I really don't have a clue what you're saying...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
By the by, though I hate to interrupt the jolly mood,  
did you all manage to find a means of returning home?  
I saw Master Kitty Spirit inspecting the book you retrieved...  
  
**Puck：**  
Did someone say \"kitty\"?  
 Mya-mya-mya-meow! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Speak of the devil.  
 It's the runt himself!  
  
**Puck：**  
I come when I'm called!  
Besides, I actually brought some good news.  
While running tests on that book,  
 I managed to get in touch with Betty!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss... \"Betty,\" you say?  
  
**Emilia：**  
She's a funny girl who lives in a strange library  
in the home we came from.  
It seemed like her magic  
 was part of what sent us here...  
  
**Puck：**  
She was as surprised as us!  
According to her, she felt a strange pull on her Door Crossing,  
and then just moments later, a message arrived from me.  
  
**Rem：**  
Only moments later?  
But surely we have been stranded here  
for several days already at this point...  
  
**Puck：**  
Looks like our times aren't quite consistent.  
A day over here might only last a single minute there.  
  
**Subaru：**  
Which means  
 there's no need to hurry?  
Even if we take our time, we'll barely have missed a thing?  
  
**Puck：**  
Seems like it!  
Well, we'll at least have time  
 for proper goodbyes!  
  
**Ram：**  
Oh, that is good news.  
After all today's work, I'm totally beat.  
  
**Karyl：**  
How can you even say that  
when you spent half the time slacking off?!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Ummm,  
 so wait, what does this mean?  
  
**Subaru：**  
We can go home whenever!  
So right now, let's celebrate our victory  
with all the new friends we made in this world!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh! Really?  
That does sound lovely, doesn't it?!  
  
**Subaru：**  
Right?!  
  
**Puck：**  
Well, we did still find that Gospel in the mansion.  
And we're no wiser as to why it actually sent us here.  
Who knows what Roswaal might have been secretly plotting...  
  
**Puck：**  
But it'd be a shame to spoil the mood with all that.  
For now,  
 I'll just enjoy this victory with everyone else!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Puck? Is something wrong?  
  
**Puck：**  
Nope, it's nothing, Lia.  
It's getting pretty close to my bedtime,  
but I'd love to stick around and enjoy the fun!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Mm. If you could stay, I'd love that too.  
  
**Subaru：**  
All right! Well then... Guys! You all got your drinks?  
  
**Subaru：**  
Then without further ado...!  
  
**Puck：**  
Cheers!  
  
**All：**  
Cheers!  
  
**Subaru：**  
Hey! Don't steal my line, cat!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Phew...  
What a wonderful evening this is, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Everyone seems to be having so much fun.  
After the ordeal we have been through, perhaps that is only natural.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What? Me, my lord?  
Of course, I am also enjoying this greatly.  
It is a pleasure to relax by my lord's side.  
  
**Subaru：**  
Aha-ha...  
 So this is where you were.  
  
**Subaru：**  
'Sup, you two.  
Mind if I take a seat right here?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Master Subaru...  
Should you not be celebrating with everyone?  
  
**Subaru：**  
Well, yeah, that's the plan.  
And that's exactly why I came over here.  
  
**Subaru：**  
Thing is, today... No... \"this time.\"  
You really saved my skin.  
Seriously, it's all thanks to you, {player}.  
  
**Subaru：**  
If it weren't for you,  
we might not be celebrating anything right now.  
For real. That's how much you helped.  
  
**Subaru：**  
Tell me...  
 Why *did* you trust me back there?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I just... had a feeling?  
**Choice: (2)**  You seemed so serious.  
`Tag 1`  
**Subaru：**  
Just a... feeling?  
 Pfft!  
Bwahahaha! You for real?! Well, that's a riot!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord is just that kind of person...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Subaru：**  
I \"seemed serious,\" huh?  
Well, that's still pretty amazing.  
You trusted me on that alone, and that's what I needed.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Perhaps your earnest efforts were just that evident.  
My lord is quite sensitive to these things, you know.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Subaru：**  
Heheh. Either way, thanks a bunch.  
You made all those times I...  
 \"died inside\"  
 turn out worth it in the end.  
  
**Subaru：**  
...That one's OK, huh?  
I swear I'm never gonna get the hang of these rules.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...?

**Emilia：**  
Oh! This is where you've been, Subaru!  
And the two of you are here, too?  
  
**Subaru：**  
Ohh! Mili!  
I was just giving {player} a proper thank-you, man to man!  
  
**Emilia：**  
A thank-you?  
In that case, we should all do the same!  
  
**Ram：**  
True enough.  
So much has happened in these few days,  
but it's thanks to you that everything ended well.  
  
**Rem：**  
The Gourmet Guild's members have done so much for us.  
My deepest thanks to you and Miss Kokkoro as well.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh yes, absolutely.  
So I'm really... yes,  
 really so thankful!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You're welcome.  
`Tag 4`  
**Emilia：**  
Heheh... This feels kind of funny.  
  
**Puck：**  
Brings a tear to the eye, huh?  
But the celebrations are only just getting started!

**Karyl：**  
Hey, you guys!  
This is your party, remember?  
We need the main guests present! Get over here!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm still not even close to done with sampling  
all your world's tasty cooking!  
 Go on, feed me more~! ♪  
  
**Ram：**  
It seems we're needed.  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes, so it does!  
I must show my thanks  
 by offering all the service I can provide!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In that case, please allow me to assist.  
We cannot let the two of you handle all the work alone.  
  
**Ram：**  
An admirable offer.  
Feel free to cover my whole share of the work.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Now, now, Ram!  
You're always like this...  
Don't make trouble for Kokkoro! I'm sorry about her.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
M-Miss Emilia...  
I believe I have asked you not to pat my head...  
  
**Subaru：**  
Oh?  
 What's that look for?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I like this mood.  
`Tag 5`  
**Subaru：**  
Yeah... Same here.  
Can't get enough of it.  
  
**Subaru：**  
Well, shall we get back too?  
Maybe we'll be leaving tomorrow, but we can still toast to today!  
  
**Subaru：**  
This time, will you let me do the honors?  
  
**Narration：**  
The Kingdom of Lugnica, home to Subaru and his companions.  
The city of Landosol, where {player} and his friends live.  
Two very different worlds, forming new connections from zero.  
  
**Narration：**  
Basking in the miracle of this meeting that should never have been,  
everyone was filled with smiles as the night seemed to go on forever.
