# The Unseen Hand's Grasp
The group struggles to overcome Petelgeuse's Unseen Hands. But thanks to Subaru's prophecy and everyone's combined efforts, they defeat the Archbishop, and the Witch Cultists are freed from his brainwashing. Finally, Subaru himself appears, only to be promptly arrested as a prime suspect.
  
## Subtitle: The Unseen Hand's Grasp
  
**Men：**  
Haaaaaahhhhhhhh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
There's so many...  
 Guys, get ready!  
They're all going to attack at once!  
  
**Rem：**  
He converted all these people in such a brief time...?!  
  
**Ram：**  
I'd assume he was only pretending to be cornered, too.  
Inviting an attack so he could take us all out at once.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Th-that really is pretty crazy, isn't it...?  
By the way, will defeating those people turn them back to normal?  
  
**Rem：**  
Once they fall to the Witch Cult, there's no turning back...  
  
**Puck：**  
Actually, that might not be a sure thing.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Master Kitty Spirit, do you have some kind of plan?  
  
**Puck：**  
A Witch Cultist is normally born  
when a person with the potential receives a Gospel.  
But why would that system exist in this world, too?  
  
**Ram：**  
Are you trying to say this is a forcible, temporary transformation?  
  
**Puck：**  
I can't say for sure.  
But  
 just assuming \"they all have to die!\"  
 seems a bit cruel,  
so Lia might like this option better.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Yes, I really agree!  
In that case, we'll have to rethink how to fight them!  
  
**Christina：**  
What are you people squabbling about?  
If you're not going to fight, stand back.  
Any rogue that comes close will taste my blade's—  
  
**Emilia：**  
No, you stand back, Chris!  
It's time for Puck and I to launch a big one!  
  
**Karyl：**  
A \"big one\"...?  
 W-wait.  
You don't mean that crazy magic you used when you got here?!  
  
**Ram：**  
Miss Emilia is always so hasty...!  
Everyone, get out of there! That goes for you too, knights!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wh-whoa...?!  
A huge shard of ice just appeared up in the sky!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If we shaved all that ice, it'd feed so many people!  
How crazy is that?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Quit saying such dumb things and get out of its way!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Hahhh!  
 Hit your mark!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Th-that is quite the spell.  
How much firepower must it boast?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm...  
I wouldn't say \"firepower.\" More like "icepower"?  
  
**Rem：**  
Everyone, are you all right?  
Nobody was crushed or struck by any stray shards?  
  
**Puck：**  
Honestly, talk about rude.  
As if me and Lia would make any silly mistakes like that.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Puck's right. You worry too much, Rem.  
It's fine... The attack worked just like we planned.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Just as planned...?  
 Ahh!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Silver-haired half-devil...!  
Do you mean to say you did this on purpose?!  
  
**Ram：**  
The ice has separated Petelgeuse from the Cultists...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Most impressive, Miss Emilia.  
With this, we can focus on defeating Mr. Petelgeuse alone.  
  
**Christina：**  
And subduing that unfortunate mob  
falls to me and my Nightmare allies, I suppose?  
A thankless job. You wily snake.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hm? I guess that is a lot of enemies.  
I'd be happy to help out.  
 You need a hand with them?  
  
**Christina：**  
Hahah! A fine joke!  
Who do you take me for?  
 Or indeed my men?  
Handling the rabble will be tedious, but I'll let you take the main dish.  
  
**Christina：**  
It would be cruel to steal the spotlight from the stars of the show.  
Even I have the tact to appreciate that much.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh! Once you beat them, we might be able to turn them back!  
So please...  
  
**Christina：**  
Avoid taking their lives,  
 I presume?  
If you insist. I'm used to that from our knights' training!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Training at Nightmare is always a life-or-death ordeal, huh...?  
  
**Ram：**  
At any rate, I fully agree with Miss Emilia for once.  
Rem! It's time for us to show what we can do!  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes, dear sister!  
You can count on me!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Hruuoooogghhhhh!  
  
**Rem：**  
Well then, though we cannot welcome you properly,  
allow me to demonstrate the skills  
 of an otherworldly maid!  
  
![501700601.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/501700601.webp)  
**Rem：**  
Haaaahhhhhhh!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Nguaaaahhhhh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?! That girl grew a horn on her head!  
  
**Ram：**  
We are of the demon clan.  
If we use our full strength, a horn or two is no surprise.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Then you're going to transform like that as well?!  
  
**Ram：**  
Me, get serious?  
Hah! A ridiculous notion.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-why, this little...  
Letting her sister do all the work...!  
  
**Rem：**  
Far from it—just knowing that she is watching  
boosts my strength a hundred, no, two hundredfold!  
Ah, my dear sister!  
  
**Ram：**  
Heh.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You two are really fine with that?!  
  
`image display end`  
**Man 2：**  
Guoooohhhhh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahh! Wahh!  
They really do just keep coming!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Pecorine, get down!  
I'll provide support, so take them out while they're stunned!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh! Me and Emilia as a bodacious battle duo!  
Well then, let's show Mr. Petel's friends  
just how great a team we can make!  
  
**Emilia：**  
I'm not sure what a \"bodacious battle duo\" is,  
but if we work together,  
 we'll have them beaten in a jiffy!  
  
**Pecorine & Emilia：**  
Hyaaaahhhh!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Nguaaaahhhhh!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Kokkoro!  
 Take care of the unconscious people!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, leave it to me!  
I will tie them up and carry them away from the battlefield!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, and any knights who are free,  
I would appreciate your aid with this.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Got it!  
`Tag 1`  
**Royal Knight 1：**  
S-sure, I'll help! Let me assist however I can!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank you very much.  
Thus far we have succeeded in reducing the enemy's numbers, but...  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
All of you, all of you...!  
Time and time again! You overturn my every plan and scheme!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Aahh, this outcome is no good at all!  
How can I prove my faith, my undying love,  
my pure and diligent service to the Witch like this?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh...?!  
All that scratching looks really painful,  
but the path is open, so now's my chance!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Mr. Petel! You're going down!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Nice going, Pecorine!  
Charge right in and take him out!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Of course!  
I'll be right...  
 Wait, huh~?!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
My brain... trembles.  
  
**Rem：**  
Miss Pecorine stopped her charge... in midair?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ur... ghh...  
 H-huh?  
This might be  
 kind of... crazy bad!  
  
**Ram：**  
Her armor's buckling...?  
Not good! I can't see what's causing it,  
but get out of there, Pecorine!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hng... gyaaaahhhh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh!  
Miss Pecorine went flying a great distance!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Owieeee!  
Ohhhh... I think I might've bruised my tushie!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Is this the time for playing around?!  
What *was* that? Why'd you stop still and fly through the air?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I-I don't know what happened either...  
But it felt like I was caught tight  
and held firmly in some kind of strong grip...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I only barely managed to break free  
by maxing out my Royal Equipment's strength!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...You used your Royal Equipment's full power?!  
  
**Emilia：**  
What's this \"Royal Equipment\" thing?  
It sounds like some sort of very strong item...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It refers to the special equipment owned by Miss Pecorine.  
When she activates it, her strength is boosted many times over.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
In return,  
 I end up getting really hungry, though!  
  
**Karyl：**  
A grip Pecorine could barely escape, even with her Royal Equipment?  
Strength like that would tear the rest of us to pieces!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah yes, I neglected to mention—he attacks with an invisible power.  
Approach him only with the utmost of care!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Are you kidding me?!  
Tell us important stuff like that sooner!  
  
**Ram：**  
At any rate, this is bad.  
We can no longer afford to even get close to him.  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
It seems you now appreciate my strength.  
However, I too am quite taken aback!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
To think that my Witch-granted authority  
would be matched in strength by a young girl like you!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Still, your advantage ends here!  
None of you has the ability to break through my authority's defenses!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Mr. Petelgeuse's words hold a ring of truth.  
My lord, however can we combat this power...?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Pecorine, can I count on you?  
**Choice: (3)**  Emilia, can you do this for me?  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
You need me to buy time? All righty then!  
With my Royal Equipment, I'll break free even if he catches me!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But  
 I'm gonna be super hungry afterwards,  
so when we get back home, there'd better be a real feast waiting!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Emilia：**  
Magical attacks from a distance,  
 huh?  
I'm not sure how much they'll do, but...  
Mm! This is no time to lose our nerve!  
  
**Emilia：**  
There must be a way to beat him!  
Until we find it, let's buy as much time as we can!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Now, what will it be?  
If you hand over the silver-haired elf and the half-devil to me...  
  
**Karyl：**  
As if anyone would agree to that!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Oh...?  
  
**Rem：**  
Don't assume that everything will go just as you wish.  
Sin Archbishop, you will fall here at our hands!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Ah, such touching loyalty!  
And yet you will soon come to regret your choice!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
He's using that weird power again!  
Everyone, scatter and keep your distance!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Pecorine! I'll keep backing you up!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Okies! I'm counting on you,  
 Emilia!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Clinging to misjudgments, you lose your chance to flee!  
This folly is sloth... Sloth, sloth,  
 sloth, sloth, sloth!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Such ludicrous sloth, it pains me to watch, yes!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Nobody's slothful here!  
I always take my work very seriously!  
If you want to eat, you have to work for it, after all!  
  
**Emilia：**  
I know I do rely a lot on Ram and Rem,  
but I always do my best to handle my own responsibilities!  
  
**Ram：**  
So... Those two are working hard to buy us time,  
but this still looks like a losing battle.  
  
**Rem：**  
Our attacks still can't reach him,  
and we can't see what his attacks even are...  
Miss Emilia's Mana and Miss Pecorine's strength won't hold up forever!  
  
**Karyl：**  
But what else can we do right now?!  
Invisible attacks are just cheating!  
Is this a bug, or what?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...?  
 My lord, is something the matter?  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
One last thing. \"Unseen Hands\"!  
Remember that name, and be on the lookout for them.  
  
**Nostradamus?：**  
Now,  
 good luck!  
Live strong out there, bro!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Hold on... Unseen Hands?  
`Tag 5`  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?  
 Say what now?  
Forget your dumb prophecy, we need to deal with his invisible...  
  
**Ram：**  
\"Unseen Hands\"... So that's it.  
  
**Rem：**  
Did you work something out, dear sister?!  
  
**Ram：**  
Yes, it makes sense to me now.  
I think I see how his \"authority\" works.  
  
**Ram：**  
Though of course, I can't \"see\" it with my eyes!  
  
**Karyl：**  
This is no time for smug faces!  
If you figured something out, just tell us already!  
  
**Ram：**  
Of course, that's exactly what I'll do.  
  
**Ram：**  
After all, to break through his plans...  
Karyl, Kokkoro, I'll need help from you and everyone else.  
  
**Ram：**  
Now tell me.  
What did that prophet—Barusu—say we needed?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I believe... according to my lord, he said...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Dust will bring luck to our side!  
`Tag 6`  
**Pecorine：**  
Hah! Yah! Hoiyah!  
Whoa... Hiyayayayayayah!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Ah! Pecorine,  
 don't go that way!  
He'll corner you! You need to get around him!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hahhh...! Royal Equipment, full power!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
There,  
 I made it through!  
But my tummy feels so empty it hurts...  
Urgh... I might start getting dizzy soon...  
  
**Puck：**  
Sadly, we didn't bring any handy snacks.  
Hmm... at this rate, he'll wear us all down.  
Shall we retreat while we can?  
  
**Emilia：**  
No way!  
Chris and the others are still fighting over there,  
so we have to defeat Petelgeuse no matter what!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
You overstretch yourselves!  
None of your bold declarations  
will change the fact that you are being overwhelmed!  
  
**Emilia：**  
It's true that all we can do on our own is buy time, but...  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
\"But\"...  
 what?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's simple!  
It's not just the two of us and our kitty!  
  
**Pecorine & Emilia：**  
We have our friends!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Wha—?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Take thiiiiis!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Magic?!  
But it missed its mark...!  
  
**Ram：**  
No, her aim was true.  
You're better than I thought, Karyl.  
Although you can't hold a candle to Master Roswaal.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're not half bad yourself.  
Figuring all this stuff out just from the words \"Unseen Hands.\"  
Too bad your magic's no match for your brains!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The two of you  
 are more similar than I realized...  
  
**Ram & Karyl：**  
Excuse me?!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
...What is your plan?  
A mere distraction  
 will have precious little effect on your fates...  
  
**Ram：**  
You're a fool, Sin Archbishop.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Why don't you take a closer look at the state  
of your Unseen Hands, hmm?  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
...! Can it be?!  
You raised a cloud of dust  
to render my Unseen Hands visible to all?!  
  
**Ram：**  
Hah!  
Those Unseen Hands look pretty \"seen\" to me.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Some authority this is!  
You make it sound so fancy,  
but in the end, it's just a bunch of ugly hands!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh... As I thought, the two of you are most similar. ♪  
  
**Ram & Karyl：**  
Like hell we are!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
With mere dirt, you defy my authority?!  
Besmirch the Witch's favor...?!  
  
**Emilia：**  
See, Petelgeuse?  
This is our strength. The strength of friendship!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Even with all those allies, you fight alone.  
I'm sure that's why you're going to lose to—  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Do not speak as though you know me,  
 filthy half-devil!!!  
  
**Emilia：**  
...Ahh?!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
A half-devil rejected by one and all!  
While I am loved and needed by the Witch herself!  
And you dare to lecture me on the subject of companionship?!  
  
**Puck：**  
You think too much of yourself, puny human.  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Wha...  
 Ngguaaagghh!  
  
**Puck：**  
You fail to command even half of Satella's shadow...  
Yet you dare insult Lia with that filthy mouth?!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Why, youuuu...  
Idle spirit  
 who wastes away the ages in slothful torpor...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Mr. Petelgeuse...  
I do not know what kind of life Miss Emilia may have lived  
in the world you come from.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
However, Miss Emilia is a true friend to us.  
That, at least, is a fact I will allow no one to deny!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Kokkoro...  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Silence... Silence, silence, silence, sileeeeence!!!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-what the?!  
He can still move after a direct hit from Puck?!  
  
**Ram：**  
He's moving his body using his Unseen Hands alone.  
What ghastly tenacity...  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
You are too dangerous!  
To call a half-devil friend is to defy the natural order,  
to reject the Witch herself!  
  
**Petelgeuse：**  
Thus, here and now! By my hands! By the force of my diligence!  
To reject my own sloth and fulfill my love... You must die, yes!!!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Looks like he's still itching for a proper fight!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Now that we can see them, we'll be fine!  
Let's give that creep hell!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine, Miss Emilia, focus on healing.  
You need to save your strength for the final blow.  
  
**Rem：**  
While you do, we will block the Archbishop's Unseen Hands!  
  
**Ram：**  
Indeed.  
Face him down, Rem, Karyl.  
  
**Rem：**  
Of course, dear sister!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You help too, dammit!  
  
**Karyl：**  
We... beat him...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Yes, he is defeated.  
Our party stands victorious!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  We did it!  
`Tag 7`  
**Karyl：**  
Ha...  
 Ahahaha...  
I-I think my legs are wobbling from relief...  
  
**Rem：**  
After that fierce struggle, who can blame you?  
But  
 we still have the other Cultists to...  
  
**Ram：**  
No, Rem.  
It looks like that won't be a problem.  
  
**Man 2：**  
O-ohhh...?  
  
**Old Man 1：**  
Wh-what were we doing...?  
  
**Royal Knight 1：**  
Have they come out of their trance?  
  
**Christina：**  
It seems our allies felled the entrancer.  
Dear me. Fighting without killing really is a bore.  
Though it was necessary,  
 I'd rather avoid it in the future.  
  
**Royal Knight 2：**  
Vice-Captain!  
What shall we do with the villagers who've come to their senses?  
  
**Christina：**  
Ask a few questions, and if they seem fine, let them go home.  
I'd hope none of you were so hopeless as to suffer losses at their hands?  
  
**Royal Knight 2：**  
Of course! As you command!  
  
**Christina：**  
Now, this is a fine mess to clean up.  
I think it's high time I took my leave!  
Until we meet again, you outlandish clowns!  
  
**Christina：**  
Perhaps next time, you will be the ones to slay my tedium!  
  
**Ram：**  
...She swept away like a passing storm.  
  
**Emilia：**  
But we ought to be thankful.  
If it weren't for Chris and her men,  
this situation would have turned out a whole lot worse.  
  
**Puck：**  
True enough.  
It's hard to deny they're all proper knights when it counts.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh... I'm totally at my limit...  
I feel so hungry I could die right now!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You have fought well, Miss Pecorine.  
Fear not, for our mission here is now fulfilled.  
  
**???：**  
Yeah, it sure is.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Subaru：**  
I do believe  
 this is Mission Complete!  
  
**Emilia & Rem：**  
Subaru!  
  
**Subaru：**  
Yo. Nice going, guys!  
 Honestly, I was stressed like hell watching,  
but I knew you guys'd pull through! You're really something!  
  
**Subaru：**  
Pecorine's Royal Equipment. Karyl's intense magical strikes.  
Together with Kokkoro's support, I figured you could take him.  
  
**Subaru：**  
So with Mili and the others too,  
this mission was a total success!  
 Good job, everyone!  
  
**All：**  
...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Umm,  
 who are you?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You entered the conversation very casually,  
but I feel certain this is our first encounter...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmmm, I can't say I recognize you either...  
Where did you learn about my Royal Equipment?  
  
**Subaru：**  
Huh? Ohh,  
 crap, yeah!  
Umm, the thing is, uh...  
 Guehh!  
  
**Ram：**  
Enough of your blabbering.  
Where have you even been this whole time, Barusu?  
  
**Rem：**  
Oh, Subaru!  
I've been so worried about you!  
You really must be more careful!  
  
**Subaru：**  
Urgh...  
Man, I'm sorry, Rem. You too, \"dear sister.\"  
  
**Rem：**  
If... if you ever died, Subaru...  
I would take my own life too in grief!  
  
**Subaru：**  
Don't say stuff like that with such a cute face!  
  
**Ram：**  
Making Rem spout such madness...  
You dirty Barusu.  
  
**Subaru：**  
Can you *not* turn a guy's nickname into an insult?!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Still, we were all so worried.  
Really, Subaru, where have you been hiding?  
  
**Subaru：**  
Mili...  
Listen, I actually worked pretty hard behind the scenes!  
  
**Subaru：**  
But look, here.  
Thanks to my efforts, we have this!  
  
**Emilia：**  
The Gospel!  
With this, we can return to Lugnica!  
  
**Subaru：**  
Yeah, you got it!  
Man, looking back, it was a long struggle...  
  
**Subaru：**  
See, that freaky Petelgeuse can actually take over other people's bodies.  
I had to go to some pretty crazy lengths to stop that from happening.  
  
**Subaru：**  
There are limits to who he can take over,  
but figuring them out was not an easy task!  
Man, the number of times I...  
 Uhhh, no! Can't actually say that part...  
  
**Subaru：**  
Point is, I had to visit a bunch of villages,  
get certain people outta there before he made them Fingers...  
  
**Royal Knight 3：**  
I see... Interesting.  
So, you admit you were the other suspicious intruder.  
  
**Subaru：**  
Eh...?  
  
**Royal Knight 4：**  
There were two intruders reported.  
One lies defeated, but the other is still at large.  
Black hair, dark eyes, wearing a strange outfit... Yes, the shoe fits.  
  
**Subaru：**  
W-wait, wait, wait!  
I can see how you'd get the wrong idea,  
but I was working my ass off to save everyone from...  
  
**Royal Knight 3：**  
You're under arrest!  
Save the excuses for your questioning at Nightmare!  
  
**Subaru：**  
Hey, hold up!  
M-Miliiiiii!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Subaru!  
I promise we'll come for you later!  
  
**Subaru：**  
Ehhhhh?!  
Later? Not now?! Dona Donaaaaa!
