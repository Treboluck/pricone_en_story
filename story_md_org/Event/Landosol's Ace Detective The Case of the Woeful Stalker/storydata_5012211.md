**Goddess of Woe：**  
Heh. You're tougher than anticipated.  
And here I was expecting you to wallow in your own despair,  
unable to muster up even the slightest bit of courage.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I-I can be as brave as I need to be  
if it's for the sake of protecting {player}!  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
Heehee. Is that so?  
Sorry, my little dear. But I can see it.  
I can see the weakness, the darkness that dwells in your heart.  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
You haven't changed a bit. You're still terrified. You want to flee  
right now. But you can't. You're relying on these comrades of  
yours. They're your excuse to put on a brave front. Am I wrong?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I... I...  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
You can't accomplish anything on your own. You're powerless!  
Thus I'll bestow upon you the despair you so deserve!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
K-Kasumi... Makoto...  
Kaori, Maho...  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
Clinging onto your comrades is the only thing you're capable of.  
But look. My little darlings resemble them so much.  
Do you have it in you to face them? To face your own weakness?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I-I made a promise. A promise to protect {player}.  
So yes. I can fight for his sake!
