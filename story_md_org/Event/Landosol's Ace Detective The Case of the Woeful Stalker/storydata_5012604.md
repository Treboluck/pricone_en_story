Ahh, man. Ain't ever been that embarrassed in my life.  
I'm never, ever dressing like that in front of people again.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
R-really? I, um, thought it was a lot of fun.  
And I feel like I'm closer with you all now...  
I-including {player}, too...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
What are we doing next, Kasumi?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Why, it's everyone's favorite part of the job.  
Stakeouts!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Stakeouts, huh?  
Think I've heard of those. You basically glue yourself  
to someone to get the proof you're looking for, right?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Indeed. They can yield interesting results.  
Like seeing you get dressed in your PJs and having  
a pajama party with everyone,  
for example.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sh-shut it! Don't make me remember!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ahaha.  
Enough pleasantries, though. Let's get started.
