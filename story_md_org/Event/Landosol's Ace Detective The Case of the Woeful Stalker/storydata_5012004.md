## Subtitle: A Courageous First Step
  
**Narration：**  
Following her encounter with the Goddess of Woe,  
Ayumi reveals to Kasumi and Makoto that  
{player}'s life is in danger.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
...That's the gist of it.  
  
**Makoto：**  
So something really was after his life, huh.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The Goddess of Woe...  
Hm. That does sound familiar.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I'm sorry...  
I should have been more upfront about everything!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Argh! Look. There's no need to apologize.  
Especially now that you've told us all about what's going on.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
But, but...!  
If I was even just a little bit braver, then...!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Don't worry. I know exactly how you feel, Ayumi.  
We're both cut from the same cloth.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Knowing how much of a coward you are feels awful, doesn't it?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But here you are now, having found the courage to tell us.  
That's as big a step as any.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I-I... I couldn't bear the thought of {player} getting hurt.  
I knew I had to do something!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
The Goddess of Woe, though... She knows.  
She knows full well that this is all I can do.  
  
**Makoto：**  
That ain't true! We're here with you now!  
Quit bearing the brunt of this on your own!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
She's right.  
Besides, if the culprit understands your mindset,  
then the opposite also holds true, right?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Y-yes...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You realize how much of an advantage that gives us, don't you?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Let's work together.  
We'll do everything we can to protect him.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
O-okay!  
I'll gladly yelp!  
Waugh... Th-that was the worst time to mess up...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ahahaha!  
Good to have you on board!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
First things first, we need to keep him safe and sound.  
Which means sticking around him all hours of the day!  
  
**Makoto：**  
How about we let him stay here, then?  
Ayumi too, of course.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Yup, that's our best option.  
With that said, let's bring him back to the guildhouse.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Here's {player} as requested!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Waugh?!  
Staying with him?! Under the same roof?!  
We're skipping several parts of the process here,  
but this is so perfect that it's almost scary!  
  
**Makoto：**  
D-down, girl...  
Anyway, let's save the details for tomorrow and get some sleep.  
You're good sleeping with us, right, Ayumi?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Better yet...  
Let's all sleep together tonight.  
  
**Makoto：**  
WHAT?! You want {player} sleeping with us?!  
You out of your mind or something?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
H-huh?! I get to sleep beside him?!  
B-but I might just go crazy...!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I've got information to share with all of you.  
And we don't really have the luxury to just hang around and chat.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
So come on, let's all get changed into our pajamas!  
The two of you can use some of our spares.

**Kasumi：**  
What's with that petrified look, my faithful assistant?  
Come join us.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sheesh. Can't believe this is actually happening...  
H-hey, {player}. Quit staring!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
A-awawah!  
I'm so nervous! My mind's going all blank!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're all adorable.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm getting pretty nervous.  
`Tag 1`  
**Ayumi：**  
A-adorable?! Ahhh! Awawah!  
*wither*  
  
**Kasumi：**  
*sigh* Come now. Most people wouldn't say that so bluntly.  
But I guess that's just your shameless side coming out.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Curiously enough, though, I don't actually mind.  
Much appreciated. ♪  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Makoto：**  
N-nervous?! What's there to be nervous about?!  
Don't say stuff like that while looking into my eyes!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Argh, man. You really know how to make a girl panic.  
Try and think about what you say before you say it.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's very natural of him to voice how he feels.  
But at the same time, it's hard not to feel embarrassed in this situation...  
Ahaha.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Ayumi：**  
H-he's... He's so close...  
Ahh...  
I can't. I-I think I'm forgetting how to breathe...!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Thank you so much, everyone.  
My life wasn't that terrible after all.  
Ka-flump.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey, Ayumi! Get back up!  
We're in this situation because we need more information from you!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
*gasp* P-pardon me.  
Well then, uh... Should I get started?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
This dream-like experience would just become a  
painful memory if anything happened to {player} after it.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I couldn't live with that.  
Absolutely not.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I... I want to protect him.  
Both him and these happy memories of us together.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Kasumi, Makoto, a-and me.  
If we work together, we can save him.  
No... We *will* save him!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus they spent the night discussing  
everything that Ayumi had witnessed.
