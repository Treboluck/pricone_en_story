**Goddess of Woe：**  
Why... Why is this happening?!  
You're nothing. You're powerless!  
Just like I was! Then how are you able to oppose me?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
You're right.  
I'm powerless.  
I'm a fool that can't do anything on my own.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
At the same time, though,  
I have comrades to support me.  
That's why I'm able to stand here now, ready to face anything.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
If I can do it, then you can as well.  
It's not too late.  
You can start over...  
*We* can start over!  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
I won't accept this...  
I'll never accept this!  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
I no longer care for despair... For hope... Nor for this wretched world!  
Let it all return to darkness!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I-I won't let that happen!  
We'll save this world! And we'll save you as well!
