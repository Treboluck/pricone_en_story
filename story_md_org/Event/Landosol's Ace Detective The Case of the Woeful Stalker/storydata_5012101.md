# Landosol's Ace Detective: The Case of the Woeful Stalker Preview
Accidents occur left and right as Landosol ramps up for the big carriage race, but all is not as it seems. The truth is in the eye of the beholder, and there's no keener eye than that of Landosol's ace detective. But can she get to the bottom of this dreadful case?
  
**Kasumi：**  
I see. So this friend of yours keeps coming a hair's breadth  
away from falling victim to all sorts of accidents. And you  
want me, a master detective, to solve the mystery behind this case.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Th-that's right.  
He's in so much danger, but no one will believe me...  
You're the only one I can rely on now!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Then let's hear what you've got to say.  
Tell me everything, from start to finish.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I think it all began on the day the big carriage race was announced.  
Some lumber being used on a house nearby almost fell onto him,  
which seemed like a coincidence at first, but it didn't end there...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
A black cat ran straight across his path in the morning. Then they didn't  
give him any sauce when he ordered lunch. And then he  
helped a lost child later that night.  
He was really cool...!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Err, that stopped sounding like a serious case almost immediately.  
Especially the end—all you did was praise him.  
But wait...  
You were watching him all day? That's what we call a stalk—  
  
**Ayumi：**  
There's no need to talk about me right now!  
I thought as hard as possible about what the cause could be,  
but nothing came to mind.  
A detective should know, though... right?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Heh. But of course. In fact, I've already got this case wrapped up. It may  
seem tricky, considering each incident took place at a separate location,  
but there is a common link. And that link is...  
they all took place outside!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Th- they all took place outside...  
So what you're saying is that  
he'll be safe so long as he just stays inside all day? Wow!  
Detectives really are amazing!  
I'll tell him right away!

Another day, another case solved.  
'Tis not the end, though. For as  
long as evil lurks in the hearts of men, such incidents will never cease.  
Yet I'll continue to fight.  
Why, you ask?  
Because I'm a detective. ♪  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh... Wait a minute. I wanted to make sure that he doesn't get  
wrapped up in any more accidents, but this is only a temporary  
solution...  
M-Miss detective! This case hasn't actually been solved yet!
