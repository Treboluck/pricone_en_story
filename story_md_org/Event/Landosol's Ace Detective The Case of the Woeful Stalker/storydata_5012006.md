# I'll Be There for You
The Goddess of Woe appears during the race, just as Kasumi had planned. Ayumi desperately tries to get her feelings across as they clash, eventually getting through to the goddess and defeating her thanks to everyone's help.

**Narration：**  
On the day of the race...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
We've gotten plenty of practice,  
so let's make good use of it all!  
  
**Woman：**  
It's that time of the year, folks!  
Hard-boiled racers from all over the continent have gathered together,  
eager to prove themselves as the new king of the races!  
  
**Spectator：**  
WOOOOOOOOO!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Eeek?! Th-that was really loud.  
Urgh. Now I'm getting all nervous...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
U-um, {player}.  
Are you sure I was the right choice to pair with you?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Couldn't think of a better one.  
**Choice: (2)**  What makes you ask?  
`Tag 1`  
**Ayumi：**  
R-really?  
Ehehe.  
Hearing that directly from you makes me feel more confident.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Okay! I need to make sure I'm not just a nuisance!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Ayumi：**  
I mean,  
there's no arguing that Makoto's more cut out for this than I am.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Kasumi said that I'll notice the Goddess of Woe's presence quicker  
than anyone else, but I'm worried that might not be the case...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I can't falter here, though.  
Everyone's relying on me!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Ayumi：**  
Come on, Ayumi. Concentrate.  
Deep breaths, deep breaths. Inhale, exhale...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
N-now that I think about it, w-we're all alone here.  
He's... he's so close. I can't believe it!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
W-wait. No.  
His life is in danger right now.  
Quit thinking about yourself,  
you big dummy!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
But... what if! What if our arms touch and stuff...  
Urgh. I'd be really happy, but really embarrassed!  
  
**Woman：**  
Now then,  
folks!  
Let the races begin!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Wait, what?! It started already?!  
L-let's get going!

**Ayumi：**  
The Goddess of Woe is guaranteed to target him during this race.  
Knowing that, we'll go after her instead... That's the plan  
Kasumi came up with. She's so much bolder than she lets on.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
The race starts out in the center of town, then we make our way to  
the outskirts before looping back. Out of all the locations we pass  
through,  
the plaza at the center of town will have the biggest audience.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
That's where Kasumi expects us to be attacked.  
Though it won't be when we pass through it initially.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Instead, it'll be after we loop back from the outskirts of town.  
The race will be at its climax then, garnering even more attention.  
Right?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Let's get through this together.  
`Tag 4`  
**Ayumi：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
U-um!  
Do you mind if I tell you something?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I, well... I'm not very good at expressing myself.  
And I have very, very little to talk about.  
That's always made it difficult to make friends and the like...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I feel like something's starting to change recently, though.  
Not just thanks to my guildmates, but Caon as well.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Makoto, for example,  
has treated me like a longtime friend ever since we first met.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
As for Kasumi, she validated me.  
All I ever did was watch you from a distance,  
but she told me that fact would be of great help to you.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
This happiness I've found is all thanks to you. Really.  
You connected us and led us together.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
That's why I want to cherish it.  
Protect it.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Ehehe.  
I'll give everything I've got to accomplish that!

**Ayumi：**  
Okay, back in the center of town.  
{player}! We're almost at the plaza!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
You'll be fine... Not one single bad thing will happen to you!  
We're all here, working together. Kasumi, Makoto...  
A-and me!  
We'll protect you!  
  
![501200602.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/501200602.webp)  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
Curses. Of all the people to get in my way, it's *you*?  
Color me surprised.I truly had you pegged as just a powerless little girl.  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
That just fills me with even more excitement, though!  
I can already taste the sheer despair you'll feel as you fail to  
protect him in spite of your best efforts. What a delightful rush!

**Ayumi：**  
Wait!Hear us out!  
I'm begging you!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I took the liberty of looking into your origins.  
We're well aware of the incident that led you down this path.  
  
**Makoto：**  
'Bout time to give it a rest, don't you think?  
This cycle of despair's gotta end!  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
Haha... Hahaha!  
You lowly humans seek to *understand* me?!  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
Nay! These years of torment and suffering!  
Despair deep enough to burn my very soul!  
You could never understand!  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
But that's all behind me now!  
My heart desires one thing and one thing only!  
To spread that very same despair far and wide!  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
Come now! Give yourselves up to eternal grief and sorrow!  
Crave despair as my lovely little minions!  
Allow your very souls to be enveloped in darkness!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
You... You big dummy!  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
Impossible!  
How could you deflect that?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
{player} gave me this power!  
The power I need to save you!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I'd be a liar if I said I knew anything about the person you loved.  
But I *do* know that you'd want to see him smile!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Do you think he could smile right now, after seeing you like this?!  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
Don't make me repeat myself! You'll never understand anything!  
My feelings are mine and mine only to understand!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Sorry, Ayumi. This isn't the same princess from once upon a time.  
It's her hatred given form, birthed from the despair  
that led her to become this monstrosity in the first place.  
  
**Makoto：**  
If words ain't gonna work, then we just gotta brute-force it.  
  
**Makoto：**  
{player}! Power us up as much as you can!  
It's time to give this stubborn princess a good scolding!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ohhh man! The power's just flowing through me! I love it!  
Haiyaaaaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
We'll save you, no matter what it takes!  
Haaahhh!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The Goddess of Woe... As your name implies, you've suffered enough as it is.  
We'll free you from the despair that's continued to torment you!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Accept your fate!  
Let this investigation come to an end!  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
Impossible... Mere humans... capable of defeating me...  
Simply... unfathomable...  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
Ahh... Now I see...  
I no longer need to hunger for despair, do I?  
How odd... Everything seems so clear now...  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
...Hey.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh? Me?! Wh-what is it?  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
You resemble me from days long past.  
But... there was one major difference between us.  
You have close friends. People that trust you...  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
I wonder... What if the same had held true for me?  
Could I have lived a wonderful life like you all?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I, well...  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
Disregard that.  
Allow me to give you one last warning...  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
Though I may be no more, this curse will never break.  
My anguish and pain will linger, then gather once more.  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
An entity that seeks only to spread despair will awaken soon.  
And you will be its first targets.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Bring it on.  
We'll take down whatever comes at us.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Pretty much.  
We'll knock it down a notch until it learns to let go.  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
Hehe.  
Ever so reliable, I see.  
Then I'll leave it to you all.  
  
**Narration：**  
With her last words,  
the Goddess of Woe of faded away with a gentle breeze.
