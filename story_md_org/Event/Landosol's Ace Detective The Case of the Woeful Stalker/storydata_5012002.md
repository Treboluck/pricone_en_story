**Ayumi：**  
...*staaaaare*  
  
**Kasumi：**  
There's a piercing gaze coming from behind us.  
It's a girl... But who is she?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
She's looking right at {player}, too...  
Now I'm curious.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Let's get going, Kasumi.  
We're gonna lose him at this rate.  
  
**Man 1：**  
Waaahhh!  
Incoming carriage!  
  
**Kasumi & Makoto：**  
What?!  
  
**Man 2：**  
I can't stop it! The horse is out of control!  
Get out of the way!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Hurry! Everyone run!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh no, it's heading straight for {player}!  
We won't make it in time!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yeah we will. Just leave it to me!  
Haaahhh!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Makoto!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Grab on, {player}!  
We're gonna jump! Yaaahhh!

**Makoto：**  
Phew... That was a close one.  
Had me sweating buckets.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Something's off, though.  
Far as I could see, that horse just happened to go wild.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Anyone that hadn't heard about what's been happening to you wouldn't  
bat an eyelid. They'd think it was just an unfortunate coincidence.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Kasumi might just be on the mark here.  
It feels like a real mystery.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Don't worry, though.  
You'll be safe so long as you're with us. I promise.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Thanks for saving me.  
**Choice: (2)**  My face feels all nice and warm.  
`Tag 1`  
**Makoto：**  
No need for thanks.  
That was the whole point in the first place.  
  
**Makoto：**  
And besides,  
Yui would be devastated if anything happened to you.

**Makoto：**  
Huh? What about me?  
O-of course I'd feel the same!  
  
**Makoto：**  
But well, our reasons for it would be a bit, uh, different...  
Ahh, man! This is a pain!  
Let's just leave this conversation for later!

**Makoto：**  
Huh? What're you going on abou—  
W-wait. What's your face doing THERE?! Uwaaahhh?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Y-you really caught me off guard with that.  
How about I just drop you right here?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sheesh. Forget that even happened, okay?!  
Wipe it from your memory the second we land!

**Makoto：**  
Down we go.  
Oh man... That house got wrecked by the carriage.  
I can only imagine what would have happened if it ran right into you.  
Talk about a close call.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hey, you.  
Care to explain why you're observing the scene of this  
supposed accident from a nice, careful distance?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Wha—?! Er, I...  
Umm, ummm!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That's one way to make yourself even more suspicious.  
Am I right to assume that you *can't* explain yourself?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
N-no! U-um,  
I... I...!  
I'm not s-suspicious at all! Whatsoever!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Yeah, and water isn't wet.  
Allow me to ask, then. What are you doing here?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Well, um, you see!  
Th-this is a, err,  
hobby of mine!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You expect me to believe that?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Waugh... W-  
won't you?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Of course not!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Wah! B-but, um!  
This really is sort of like a hobby!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You're getting more suspicious by the second!  
I'm taking you in!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
E-eeeek?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Kasumi! What's going on?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Ahhh! {player}!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Wait. You know him?!  
Don't tell me you were watching him this whole time!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Urgh... I, well...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Why were you observing him?  
Spit it out!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Y-you can't ask me that...  
Not when he's right there...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I can't say it in front of him!  
I'm sorry!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hey! Wait up!  
Urgh. She got away!
