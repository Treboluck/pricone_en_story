# The Grand Plan
An old legend brought up by Kasumi leads Ayumi to declare that she wants to save the Goddess of Woe. Working together with Ayumi, Kasumi is able to theorize where the Goddess of Woe will appear, after which they devise a plan to lure her out by having {player} take part in the carriage race.
  
## Subtitle: The Grand Plan
  
**Narration：**  
The next day...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Oh. Good morning,  
{player}.  
Did you sleep well?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh? Why am I not in my pajamas?  
Well, err...  
Keeping them on all day is a little embarrassing.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Um, Makoto left to go on patrol.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
As for Kasumi, she was already gone when I woke up.  
Makoto said she might be doing some research in her room.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Mornin', {player}.  
Thanks for keeping an eye on him, Ayumi.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Welcome back.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Doesn't seem like we've got anything to worry about right now, at least.  
Everything seemed perfectly normal.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Man, though. The Goddess of Woe?  
{player} sure caught the eye of something frightening.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh? Is Kasumi still in her room?  
Hey, Kasumi!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh, sorry about that. There was some research that needed doing.  
Good morning, everyone.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
As for what research— there's a  
certain myth that I recalled after hearing Ayumi's story.  
And a little digging helped me piece everything together.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Mind if I tell you all a little tale?  
An old tale of carriage races and a woeful princess.  
A tragedy that fell into the ravines of time.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
There was once a kingdom ruled by a stern king.  
Said king had a daughter, as kind and compassionate as could be,  
whom he planned on marrying off to the prince of a bordering kingdom.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
This princess knew her fate. She had accepted it...  
or so she thought.  
As destiny would have it, a new encounter awaited her.  
At the country's renowned carriage race, no less.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
What's more, her fated partner was renowned as a hero of said race.  
Love blossomed between them in an instant... And that incurred the  
wrath of the king, signaling the beginning of the end.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Under orders from the king,  
the young man was assassinated during the race.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Though she knew the truth, the princess could not convict her father.  
And as her despair reached its peak, she took her own life,  
rejoining her lover in the afterlife.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Wait. That sounds familiar...

**Goddess of Woe：**  
Fret not, dear.  
There's not a single thing you can do to stop it.  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
Trust me, I know.  
You remind me of myself, after all.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh?  
  
**Goddess of Woe：**  
Nothing but a fool that convinced herself she was powerless.  
A being so engulfed in her own self-loathing that she would  
go on to curse herself. That's what you remind me of.  
  

---  
  
**Ayumi：**  
...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey. That hero is the guy on the posters all around town, right?  
I've never once heard about him being in love with a princess.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That's how myths and legends work. They vary based on who tells them.  
No matter the times, information is altered by the people relaying it.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh, okay.  
I get where this is going.  
You think that princess is the Goddess of Woe, right?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Man, though.  
Myth or not, that really is a tragedy.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Indeed.  
I can't bring myself to blame her for ending up like that.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I want to save her...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ayumi?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Oh. S-Sorry.  
That's not the best thing to say when  
she's trying to take {player}'s life, is it?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
But, well... If that story is true, then I really do want to save her.  
She's a victim, and she's been suffering all this time...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...  
Yeah. I understand.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Haha. Getting greedy, are we?  
Wanting to protect {player} is one thing,  
but now you're gonna tell off the Goddess of Woe in the process.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I-I never said I would tell her off...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hehe. Either way, our first course of action is to actually locate her.  
And with that said,  
it's time for my favorite pastime: deduction.  
Take a look at this.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hm? What do we need a map of Landosol for?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
We're going to mark certain spots on it.  
Yesterday's  
carriage accident happened... here. Makoto, do you  
remember where that plant pot almost fell on {player}?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hm...  
I'm pretty sure it was here. Lemme mark it down.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You've been watching him this whole time, haven't you, Ayumi?  
Do you mind marking all the other spots where he was targeted?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
O-okay!  
No problem!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Um... The one two days ago was here. Three days ago was... here.  
Before that was here. And before that was here.  
Something also happened here. And then—  
  
**Makoto：**  
H-hold up, hold up.  
Just how far back does she remember?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Also, {player} said he started feeling like he  
was in danger two or three days ago, right?  
Does that mean Ayumi noticed way before he ever did?!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Th-this is incredible.  
She gives the Goddess of Woe a run for her money when  
it comes to stal—  
Sorry. Never mind me.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
...Phew. Sorry for the wait. This should be all of them.  
Err, um... What's wrong? You're both awfully quiet.  
  
**Makoto：**  
O-oh! Uhh, sorry about that.  
We were just kinda taken aback.  
Haha. Ahaha.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
R-regardless.  
Are there any patterns we can notice based on what she's marked down?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hm? They're all in town... Or not. Some spots are different.  
But they're mostly residential districts, or places where people gather...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey. Wait a minute...  
They're all places where an accident would stand out!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Yeah. I reached the same conclusion.  
Now we've got a good grasp of how she operates, all thanks to Ayumi.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
True to her name, the Goddess of Woe is trying to  
harm {player} in areas where people can witness it.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
As for the reason...  
It's like she's trying to recreate the very tragedy she experienced.  
Cases like this aren't exactly rare, either.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
At the same time, I'd say she's also deriving pleasure from it all.  
She's determined to spread fear to those who witness the accidents.  
There's no need to be scared, though.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
She's targeted {player} on numerous occasions at this point.  
In other words, she's convinced she can kill him whenever she feels.  
Which means she's far too confident in her own abilities.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And that's a godsend for us.  
We can use that conceit against her.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hm... Can't say I got all that.  
But anyway, how are we going to find her in the first place?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The perfect opportunity is about to present itself.  
One with deep ties to her past,  
and a guaranteed spectacle.  
The carriage race.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
What if {player} takes part?  
  
She's all but guaranteed to appear. I'm sure of it.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
B-but wouldn't we be putting him at risk?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Indeed. This is a bet where everything could go wrong.  
  
But it's also our best bet. We won't find another opportunity like this.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But I'm in no place to force him.  
The decision is all his.  
So, {player}. How do you want to proceed?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I trust you all.  
**Choice: (2)**  Carriage riding? That sounds fun.  
`Tag 1`  
**Ayumi：**  
{player}... Th-  
then I'll give it my all, too!  
I'll protect him, no matter the cost!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yup. Agreed.  
Just leave his safety to us.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Ayumi：**  
You're saying that to make us feel better, aren't you?  
But that's what makes you so cool...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Haha. Yeah, that's the {player} I know!  
All right, leave it to us.  
We'll keep you safe, no matter what!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I, uh, think he really meant that...  
But oh well.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kasumi：**  
Sounds like it's decided, then.  
First things first, let's get you signed up for the race.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Makoto, Ayumi. Can I leave that to you two?  
I'm going to try and pinpoint where  
the Goddess of Woe will try and target him.  
  
**Makoto：**  
No problem.  
Let's get going, Ayumi.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
O-okay.  
I'm right behind you!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Or so I said, but I've pretty much pinpointed the location already.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Considering it's a race, so it's easy to imagine the most exciting areas.  
I'd be remiss to say any deduction was involved at all here.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That's not the main issue here, though.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'm sorry, {player}.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Huh? What for?  
For the plan I proposed, of course.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
All the deduction and theories in the world won't change the fact that  
exposing you to danger is our only way of retaliating against the Goddess of Woe.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And when it comes down to it, that's all on me.  
It's depressing just how powerless I am...

**Kasumi：**  
Waugh?! Wh-what's with the sudden headpat?  
Are you trying to comfort me?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
N-not that I mind, I guess...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Huh?  
Let's work together to save the Goddess of Woe?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Sheesh. You really are something else.  
But that's why we...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
O-oh. Ignore me.  
I'm just talking to myself.

`image display end`  
**Kasumi：**  
It's not just you, though. Ayumi's just as kind.  
Most people would  
want to fight back to protect themselves or the person they care  
for, but you two reached an entirely different conclusion.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm?  
That only happened thanks to me uncovering the Goddess of Woe's identity?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Huh. I guess that's one way to think about it.  
I'm more than honored to have lead you to that conclusion, then.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...{player}.  
Let me swear this to you once again.  
We'll do anything and everything we can to protect you.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
So let's save this goddess from the darkness that's consumed her.
