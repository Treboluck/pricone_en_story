**Ayumi：**  
W-we did it, Kasumi!  
We defeated the Goddess of Woe!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Don't get ahead of yourself.  
If I were to hide myself to deceive the enemy, then... I'd hide here!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Wha?!  
I-I never even knew there was a path here!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's one of those paths you won't find on maps.  
If the Goddess of Woe is anywhere to found, it's beyond here.  
The battle's only just begun. Don't let your guards down.
