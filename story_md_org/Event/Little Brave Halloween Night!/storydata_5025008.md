**Narration：**  
As suddenly as it came, the blinding light disappears...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahh...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
H-huh? We're... outside...  
 Does that mean...?  
  
**Misogi：**  
We made it!  
 All riiiight! We all escaped together!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
B-but how, though? Weren't we inside the spirit realm?  
  
**Hana：**  
Ahhhh! Look at these!  
  
**Mimi：**  
So pretty...  
 What are they?  
  
**Child's Voice：**  
Thank you! Now we can all have our Halloween fun...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh?! Then are these all...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
The captured spirits...  
 Then that light that saved us was...!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Aahhh...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Misogi... Are you crying?  
 Did you get hurt?  
  
**Misogi：**  
N-no... I dunno... I dunno why, but... the tears won't stop...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Pat Misogi's head.  
**Choice: (2)**  You all saved the spirits together.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misogi：**  
Mm...  
 Oh, mister...  
 Eheheh. Thanks.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kyoka：**  
That's right, Misogi.  
We're all safe and sound now... *sniff*  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ohhh, don't you cry too, Kyoka!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kyoka：**  
Hmm... What should we do now?  
  
**Misogi：**  
We can't really take her to stay at our houses, can we?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Do you wanna live with me?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Um, I don't think that's exactly for you to decide...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I know a good place.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh? D-do you really?!  
  
**Saren：**  
That's quite the story.  
Really, how do you always get yourself mixed up in these things?  
  
**Hana：**  
...  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh,  
 I'm so sorry. My name's Saren.  
I take care of lots of other children in situations like yours.  
I'm sure you'll find lots of new friends here.  
  
**Hana：**  
Friends...?  
  
**Saren：**  
Well... Maybe more like family. Yes.  
So if you don't mind, I hope you'll think of this as your new home.  
In your own time, of course!  
  
**Hana：**  
...Eheheh. So I'm not on my own...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Well, isn't that great?!  
You know your stuff, mister!  
  
**Mimi：**  
If she's here,  
 we can all come visit, too!  
  
**Hana：**  
Big Sis... Big Bro...  
 Thank you!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Guess that's a wrap, then!  
Time to have our Halloween—  
 Gaaaaaaahhhhh!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
W-what now?!  
 Don't just scream like that!  
  
**Misogi：**  
All the treats we collected...  
 We gave them to the ghost kids!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...?  
 Ahhh!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Waaaahhhhh! How can we have our party now?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
We can't have a party...?  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm not sure I follow...  
But if you like, you could join in our Halloween party!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh?! For real?!  
 Oh—I mean, may we really?  
  
**Saren：**  
Sure. The more the merrier, if you ask me.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Th-thank you very much! Um, let me help with the preparations!  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, no need to worry about that!  
After all, you've got that covered, right, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I-I'll get right on it...  
`Tag 5`  
**Saren：**  
Heheh.  
All right then! The other kids should be back soon, so let's hurry!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Check it out! I got sooooo much candy!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh, you're so greedy...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Really~? Are you sure you're one to talk?  
I brought your favorite cupcakes too...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Well, since they're here,  
 I shouldn't waste them!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahahaha! Just admit you want them!  
...Huh? Where's Hana?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
She's playing with the Orphanage kids.  
Aren't you going to join her, Mimi?  
  
**Mimi：**  
...Uwehh?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Mimi, are you getting sleepy?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Umm... I'm still awake...  
 Did I... manage to be a big girl today...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh?  
 ...Yes. I think you were braver than any of us. Right, Misogi?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh yeah!  
 Even when Kyoka was being a scaredy-cat,  
you didn't seem scared at all, Mimi!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I-I was not being a...  
 Actually, wasn't this all your fault, Misogi?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Urk!  
 W-well, I made up for it, didn't I?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
If I disappeared someday...  
Would you guys still remember me?  
  
**Misogi：**  
...'Course we would! Besides, we'd find you for sure!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
That's right. It's not Little Lyrical without all three of us!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Eheheh... That's so... nice... Zzzz... zzzz...

**Misogi：**  
...There she goes.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Yes...  
  
**Misogi：**  
You know, I was thinking. Even if I did forget about you guys,  
I bet that we'd make friends...  
No, make super mega friends all over again!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi... You're right. I think we would.  
...Oh dear. If that happened,  
 I'd have to learn your tricks all over, too.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Heheheh. If you forget 'em,  
that means more chances to catch you off guard!

**Misogi & Kyoka：**  
Pff... Ahahahahahaha!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Zzz... zzz...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Good night, Mimi. We'll always be your best friends!  
  
**Narration：**  
With the night's trials behind them,  
the three girls had put an end to unhappy Halloweens.  
And all three of them felt just a little more grown-up than before.
