# When Curiosity Calls
The members of Little Lyrical are trick-or-treating to collect candy for their Halloween party, and Misogi suggests they try visiting the haunted mansion on the outskirts of town. Though it initially seems unoccupied, the front door mysteriously opens, and curiosity leads them to investigate the interior.

**Narration：**  
One lively Halloween evening in Landosol...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Trick or treat!  
Give me some candy, or I'll play a trick!  
  
**Mother：**  
Oh my, how frightening!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Eheheh. I love this costume so much! ♪  
  
**Mother：**  
Oh, Mimi, isn't it almost time?  
Misogi and Kyoka are waiting for you, aren't they?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Uh-huh! We're gonna get lots of candy  
and have a big party together!  
  
**Mother：**  
Just don't get overexcited and hurt yourselves.  
Remember, you're the oldest among your friends,  
so you need to take good care of them.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Okay!  
 See you later, then!  
  
**Misogi：**  
So, word has it that every year at Halloween, you can hear voices...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
V-voices...? What voices?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Lonely children's voices from the mansion just outside town...  
\"Let's play... Let's play…\" they say!  
  
**Misogi：**  
It sounds like they just want friends.  
But if you follow them inside the mansion...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I-if you go inside...?  
  
**Misogi：**  
YOU'LL BECOME A GHOST TOO!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Aaahhh!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahahahah! Did I scare you?  
 I totally scared you!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I-I just didn't expect you to shout!  
 There's no such thing as ghosts...  
Besides, where did you hear such a silly story?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Eheheh... A friend at school told me!  
She said  
 a \"friend of a friend\"?  
 ...told her all about it!  
  
**Misogi：**  
And guess what?  
 The friend of a friend actually went missing!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
If they went missing, then how did they tell the story?  
  
**Misogi：**  
...Oh! Good point!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
That's obviously just a trite urban legend.  
  
**Misogi：**  
\"Turban legend\"...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
They're what happens when little rumors build up over time  
until they get exaggerated into scary stories.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
So there's no reason to believe a word of it.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Bah... That's no fun...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Misogi! Kyoka!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh—Mimi...!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Awahhh!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Whoa! A-are you OK?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
U-uh-huh...  
 Eheheh, I fell over...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Let me see... Good, you're not hurt.  
Mimi, you shouldn't run in the street.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Sorry...  
 I just couldn't wait for our Halloween to start!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Okay! We're all here now,  
 so let's go get some candy!  
  
**Mimi & Kyoka：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Misogi, Mimi & Kyoka：**  
Trick or treat!  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Here, have a candy treat!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Yaaay, chocolate!  
 Thank you, Miss Nice Lady!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Urghh... Candy's great and all,  
 but I wanna play tricks...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Behave yourself, Misogi.  
Besides, you play tricks even when it's not Hallow—  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Girls! I baked a batch of cupcakes!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Cupcakes?! Come on, let's go see!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Uwehh?! You changed your tune fast!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ooh!  
 Look at all the candy we got!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Mmm... We've got enough for the party,  
but it would be a waste to stop now, right?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
But we've done a full circle of the town.  
  
**Misogi：**  
...Oh, I know! Listen, why don't we try that haunted mansion?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Haunty mansion...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Th-that's silly!  
 There won't be anyone with candy for us there!  
  
**Misogi：**  
It's a really big house, though. Maybe they've got fancy treats to match!  
And Kyoka, didn't you just say there's no truth in turban legends?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
W-well, I... Urghhh...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh! Don't tell me you're... *scared?*  
  
**Kyoka：**  
O-of course I'm not scared!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Then let's do it! To the haunted mansion we go!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Let's go! ♪  
  
**Kyoka：**  
*sigh*...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh—this is the place!  
 Look, it's even got a graveyard outside...  
  
**Misogi, Mimi & Kyoka：**  
Trick or treat!  
  
**Mimi：**  
...No answer?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
S-see? It's just a big, empty house!  
Come on, let's go home—  
  
**Misogi：**  
The door... swung open...  
  
**Mimi：**  
...  
  
**Misogi：**  
W-  
wanna look inside?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
What?!  
 No way! We'd get in trouble!  
  
**Misogi：**  
If nobody lives here, who'll complain?!  
 It's just like exploring!  
I-I'm going in, anyway!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi, wait!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Uwehh... Don't leave me behind, guys...!  
  
**Narration：**  
Spurred on by curiosity, the girls set foot in the haunted mansion.  
Little did they know what terrors would await them within...
