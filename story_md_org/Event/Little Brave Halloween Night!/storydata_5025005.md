# Captive Souls
Unwilling to leave her behind even after his own death, Hana's father has transformed into a dark spirit, consuming the souls of children that gather each Halloween in order to remain in the mortal world. He whisks his daughter away, but Mimi and friends give chase, determined to release all the captive spirits of the mansion.

**Narration：**  
A mystery man appears before {player} and the girls,  
and to their surprise, Hana addresses him as \"Daddy.\"  
  
**Hana：**  
Daddy!  
  
**Mimi：**  
H-Hana, don't!  
  
**Hana：**  
Big Sis Mimi...?  
  
**Mimi：**  
I dunno, but... but... That man... He's scary...  
  
**Hana：**  
He isn't scary at all!  
 He's my daddy!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahh—!  
  
**Man：**  
Yes... It's me, Hana. I would never leave you...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
That man's her dad?  
 But...  
  
**Man：**  
Yes, I am no longer living.  
 But why does that matter?  
Even in death, I could never leave my Hana alone.  
  
**Misogi：**  
H-how's that work?  
So that guy really is Hana's daddy... but he's a ghost?  
What about all the voices we heard, then?  
 Bahhh, I don't get it!  
  
**Man：**  
On Halloween, the two worlds draw close.  
At that time, the souls of departed children  
come to join those still living in their Halloween merriment.  
  
**Man：**  
I invite those souls into my mansion to keep my dear Hana company.  
With me gone, she needs friends to ease her loneliness...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ghostly friends? But she said her friends all disappear...  
  
**Man：**  
Their souls can only remain while Halloween lasts.  
That is why before the night ends, I must consume their spirits.  
To preserve my own form... To remain here in this world.  
  
**Man：**  
To stay by my daughter's side where I belong.  
  
**Misogi：**  
So, what...? You've been capturing all the kid ghosts  
who come here to enjoy Halloween?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Th-that's not right at all!  
And once Halloween's over, you just use them for yourself?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Weren't they just here to have a good time like us?!  
  
**Hana：**  
...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Hana... Will you come with me? It's not good to stay here...  
  
**Hana：**  
But... Daddy is...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Your dad has been gone for a long time now!  
This man here... might look like him, but he's just a bad ghost!  
  
**Hana：**  
No way! He's still alive!  
 I can see him!  
  
**Man：**  
That's right... I am right here. I'll never disappear!  
You'll never take my daughter...!

**Mimi：**  
Ah! Hana!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Look out!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahhh! B-but I've gotta save her!  
I... I promised!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...You can leave this to us. Go after her, Mimi.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Kyoka...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
You saved me before...  
 So this time it's my turn to help you!  
Now go find your friend!  
  
**Mimi：**  
...Yeah!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
You won't get past us.  
Misogi! {player}!  
  
**Misogi：**  
All right! Let's take care of these meanies!  
  
**Mimi：**  
I promised... I said I wouldn't leave her...  
I promised Hana I'd stay!  
  
**Misogi：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
 Huh? Where's Mimi?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
If she isn't here... does that mean she's back in that room?  
 Let's hurry!  
  
**Children's Voices：**  
Trick or treat!  
Give us lots of candy, or you get tricked!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Again...?  
 You're all victims here too!  
Why are you getting in our way?!  
 If we don't hurry, they'll...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Wait, Kyoka!  
 These ghosts, they want to tell us something!  
I mean, think about it... They never actually hurt us!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Well, am I wrong? We just got all scared on our own...  
These ghosts never tried to hurt us or anything!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I suppose... They said weird things and scratched at the walls,  
but they never actually attacked us...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Right? Hey, guys, what are you trying to tell us?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Look, Kyoka! Mister {player}!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
The scratches are shaped like letters...?  
  
**Misogi：**  
\"We want to leave…\"  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...So that's all it was.  
 All this time, you were...  
trying to send us a message, the only way you knew how...  
  
**Misogi：**  
'Course you wanna leave.  
You just came to have fun, but you all got trapped in here...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Were you actually the ones who sent  
{player}'s power to me back there, too...?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hey, mister... Can't we help them somehow?  
I mean, it's not fair...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's release them from this mansion.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misogi：**  
Mister...!  
 Yeah. That's what we ought to do right now.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
And to do it,  
 I suppose we'll have to stop that man...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Let's put a stop to it!  
 We'll end this messed-up Halloween...  
Then we can all go back to our fun Halloween together!  
  
**Narration：**  
Determined to save both Hana and the captive spirits,  
the three of them hurried off after Mimi.
