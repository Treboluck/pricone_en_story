**Narration：**  
Finally, the three girls are reunited,  
but Misogi and Kyoka are surprised to find Mimi  
with a girl they have never seen before.  
  
**Girl：**  
...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Mimi, are you really OK? You're not hurt?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ooh... Eheheh, Kyoka, you're tickling me!  
  
**Girl：**  
Big Sis Mimi...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Um...  
 Mimi, who's this girl?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Hmmm? Oh, well... So, when I woke up, I was here.  
And then, and then...

**Mimi：**  
...Mnhh... Where... am I...?  
Misogi...? Kyoka...?  
Ahhh... Where are you? I don't wanna be all alone...  
  
**Girl：**  
...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahhh! Wh-who's there?  
  
**Hana：**  
Hello... My name's Hana...  
Are you going to play with me?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Uweh?

**Misogi：**  
Oh, I see! So she's Hana!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wait, wait, wait! Misogi, come here a second!  
  
**Misogi：**  
W-wahhh! What's up, Kyoka? Why all the dragging?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
\"Oh, I see\"?  
 Are you mad?! That girl's too suspicious!  
What's she even doing here all on her own?  
  
**Misogi：**  
I guess... you might have a point. *glance*

**Mimi：**  
Hana, watch this! If you put your hands like this...  
 You can be a bunny!  
  
**Hana：**  
Ohhh! That's amazing!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Hippety-hoppety bunnies!  
 Oh, do you wanna join in, mister?  
  
**Misogi：**  
...Maybe you're overthinking this.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Y-you can't let her fool you!  
  
**Misogi：**  
But look. She could've been kidnapped like Mimi, right?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Hmmmm... Let me try asking her!  
  
**Hana：**  
Hippety, hoppety~! ♪ Eheheh...

**Kyoka：**  
Umm... Tell me, Hana, have you been here long?  
  
**Hana：**  
...Uh-huh. Every year, at Halloween,  
all my friends come here to play.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
At Halloween...?  
  
**Hana：**  
But then, when it's over, they all disappear...  
Big Sis Mimi, you won't disappear, will you?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Nope! I'm not going anywhere!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Actually, we should leave...  
`Tag 1`  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh. Y-you're right.  
 We've found Mimi now, so...  
Let's get out before any monsters or ghosts find us.  
  
**Misogi：**  
We can finally have our Halloween party!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Party time! Party time! I can't wait~! ♪  
  
**Hana：**  
...  
  
**Mimi：**  
You wanna come too?  
  
**Hana：**  
I need to wait here for Daddy.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Daddy?  
  
**???：**  
Give her back... Give her back...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...! What was that voice? Come on, let's leave now!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh?!

**Misogi：**  
Where  
 are we...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
This is where I heard your voice...  
 But how did—  
  
**???：**  
Give her back... Get away from my girl...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Wahhh! A-a ghost!  
  
**???：**

**Hana：**  
...Daddy?  
  
**Narration：**  
Though they tried to escape, the group was suddenly transported  
to a strange new location.  
And who should await them there but a mysterious man...?
