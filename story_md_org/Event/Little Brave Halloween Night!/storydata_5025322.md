**Misogi：**  
Wh-what now...?  
 I'm feeling all weak...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Misogi! Get back!  
I think he's trying to drain our strength!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Seriously?!  
Th-that was close!  
Hang on, though... Is he getting even stronger?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
First he uses the ghost kids, and now our strength as well?!  
Does he want to keep Hana for himself that badly?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
But Hana's going home with all of us!  
We're not gonna lose now!
