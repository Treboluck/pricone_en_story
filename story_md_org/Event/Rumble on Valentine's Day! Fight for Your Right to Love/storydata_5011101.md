Valentine's Day—a time for heartfelt passions to come out into the open. Eriko and Shizuru face off in a chocolatey battle for the ages!
  
**Rino：**  
Hmhmhmm~! ♪  
Valentine's Day is almost here!  
What kind of chocolates should I make for Big Bro~?  
  
**Rino：**  
Wait, huh?  
Over there, is that... Big Sis and Eriko?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Say, Shizuru...  
 Is it true that you plan to give chocolates  
to my darling {player} this Valentine's Day?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Well, of course!  
 It's a once-in-a-year opportunity.  
I've gotta do everything I can  
 to make my little bro happy!  
  
**Eriko：**  
I'm afraid my beloved would never accept chocolates  
from anyone other than me.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Are you sure?  
Personally, I don't think he'd really want  
any chocolates but his big sister's.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Well, if you're quite sure,  
I suppose I'll have to take out the trash!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Settle things fairly, you mean?  
In that case...  
  
**Shizuru & Eriko：**  
Let the challenge begin!
