**Narration：**  
There are only a few days to go until Valentine's Day.  
{player} is taking a stroll around Landosol  
when he spots Rino crouching by a street corner.  
  
**Rino：**  
Hmhmhmm~! ♪ You're as cute as always!  
  
**Cacaola：**  
Choco! ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Here, have a splash of water!  
How's that feel? Good, right?  
  
**Cacaola：**  
Choco choco! ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh! Have some more, then!  
Keep on growing~♪ Keep on growing~♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, Big Bro!  
 Hi there!  
  
**Rino：**  
Look at this little guy!  
 Isn't he just the cutest?!  
  
**Cacaola：**  
Choco! ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh? Isn't that a monster, you ask?  
  
**Rino：**  
Yes, he is! A baby monster of the Cacaola species.  
I was just keeping him nicely hydrated with water.  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh? Why am I raising a monster?  
  
**Rino：**  
Well, you see how his tail looks like a cocoa plant?  
  
**Rino：**  
If you shower this monster with kind, happy words,  
it's supposed to grow a pod of special cocoa beans!  
  
**Rino：**  
And then you can use those beans  
to create the ultimate source of happiness:  
\"Love Destiny Chocolate\"!  
  
**Rino：**  
Look! It's going really well!  
Don't you think the beans might be about to grow?!  
  
**Rino：**  
At this rate, I think they'll be ready by Valentine's Day!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's \"Valentine's Day\"?  
**Choice: (2)**  That's some kind of chocolate festival, right?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rino：**  
Huh? Big Bro, don't tell me...  
You've never heard of Valentine's Day?!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Rino：**  
Well, no, it's not exactly a *festival*, per se...

`Tag 3`  
**Rino：**  
Here, I'll explain. Valentine's Day is an occasion  
where you give delicious chocolates  
to the person you love the most!  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh? Why's it gotta be chocolates?  
  
**Rino：**  
Well, because, umm...  
They're the best way to express your sweetest feelings!  
  
**Rino：**  
I'm going to raise this little guy  
into a fount of cocoa-y goodness!  
  
**Rino：**  
And then I'll make the cocoa into chocolates  
and give them to you, Big Bro!  
  
**Rino：**  
Now, I'm guessing...  
You'll be getting chocolates from Big Sis Shizuru too, right?  
  
**Rino：**  
I'm never going to be as great at cooking as she is...  
But on Valentine's Day, love is war!  
  
**Rino：**  
I can't let anyone beat me, not even Big Sis Shizuru!  
So Big Bro, set your expectations super high!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Let's see. Cocoa powder... hazelnuts... walnuts... berry sauce...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Mmmm! This shop always has the best ingredients!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hm...? That's a familiar face...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh? You are... Shizuru, yes?  
I believe this is the first time I've encountered you here.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I thought it was you, Eriko!  
Yep yep, I've never seen you in here before!  
This feels kind of funny!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Whoa,  
 you sure are buying a lot!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Yes. This store has quite the broad selection,  
so it serves my needs well.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Wow, just like me!  
They mostly carry specialized ingredients, though. Do you like to cook?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Cooking? Well... I do make certain concoctions...  
 Teehee.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh? Like medicine? Is someone ill?  
I'm sorry to hear that...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ill...?  
Right now, I'm preparing to make some chocolates.  
As a gift for someone very special.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh...? Have you got a little crush on someone?  
That's great! Girls our age need lots of romance!  
Let's both make some delicious chocolates!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
So hey, what else were you planning to buy?  
Do you want to look around the shops together?  
  
**Narration：**  
And so, after a chance encounter,  
Shizuru and Eriko ended up going on a joint shopping spree.
