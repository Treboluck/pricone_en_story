## Subtitle: The Sweetest Gift
  
**Eriko：**  
Finally...  
 We are alone together, my love.  
I have brought some delicious chocolate for you to savor.  
  
**Eriko：**  
This sweet, sweet token of my love...  
You will consume it all, I trust?  
  
**Eriko：**  
If by any chance you don't...  
 Teehee.  
I'm joking, of course.  
I would never dream of harming you.
