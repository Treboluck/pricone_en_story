## Subtitle: Sweetness Turned Sour
  
**Narration：**  
Having bonded over their shared affinity for cookery,  
Shizuru and Eriko are chatting happily as they stroll through the shops.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
That's right! A dash of this in any curry  
brings out ten times more flavor!  
My little bro can't get enough of it!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh, you have a younger brother, do you?  
It's so nice when families get along. Teehee.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Whoa, I didn't know they sold alcohol here!  
I've been looking all over for this liqueur!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ah, how coincidental.  
I was looking for a liqueur  
for my chocolates as well.  
There's a brand with the most delightful aroma...

**Eriko：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ah...  
  
**Eriko：**  
...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
...  
  
**Eriko：**  
It would seem this is the last bottle they have.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Looks like it.  
 The sign even says \"while supplies last.\"

**Eriko：**  
I'm afraid I simply must have this liqueur.  
Without it, my chocolates will not be complete.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Well, sure, but neither will mine!  
  
**Eriko：**  
I cannot lose this opportunity to satisfy my beloved!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Me either! My little bro deserves nothing but the best chocolates!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh, so your chocolates are merely a gift for family.  
Then might I ask you step aside?  
  
**Eriko：**  
No matter what it takes,  
I simply *must* create  
 the most exquisite of chocolates  
for my Valentine, {player}!

**Shizuru：**  
Huh? Wait a minute!  
Could you be talking about my little brother?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Did you just say \"*my* little brother\"?  
I can't let that comment slide.  
  
**Eriko：**  
At any rate, my darling {player} has no siblings.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Could it be... though you have no blood relation,  
you call yourself his sister  
 in a crude attempt  
to take advantage of his memory loss?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hm? What's blood got to do with it?  
My little {player} and I are joined as brother and sister  
by the bonds of fate!  
  
**Eriko：**  
The bonds of fate, you say...?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
...What are... these... words... you are... saying...?  
  
**Eriko：**  
You must pay... You must pay, you must pay,  
you must pay, you must pay, you must pay,  
you must pay, you must pay, you must pay...  
  
**Eriko：**  
YOU MUST PAY!!!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Foul harlot who seeks to tear me from my soulmate!  
This liqueur! And my beloved! Neither shall belong to the likes of you!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Wow, that sure was a speech.  
 Oh well.  
Why don't we have a chocolate-making contest, then?  
  
**Eriko：**  
A chocolate... contest?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yep. We'll both make some chocolates  
and get {player} to taste them!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Whoever gets the thumbs-up gets {player} all to herself!  
Isn't that fair?  
  
**Eriko：**  
As much as it pains me to acknowledge you in any way...  
...  
Very well. I accept your challenge!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
For my little bro, I won't hold anything back!  
  
**Eriko：**  
I know my love's tastes better than any other.  
My victory is a foregone conclusion!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I feel kinda bad for Eriko,  
but the only girl {player} needs in his life is his big sister.  
I'll have to show her who's boss!  
  
**Narration：**  
The day after meeting Rino on Landosol's streets,  
{player} is walking down a quiet alley  
when three shadows creep up behind him.  
  
**Rino：**  
Target A has passed the go point! Over!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Roger!  
Proceeding to approach from behind  
and secure Target A in a burlap sack. Over!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Why have I been roped into this ridiculous farce?  
And why is Miss Rino here as well?  
  
**Rino：**  
My big sis told me all the deets!  
Sounds like you've got some pretty wild plans, huh?  
  
**Rino：**  
And a sister's gotta help a sister in a pinch!  
Brothers are thicker than daughters, as they say!  
  
**Eriko：**  
I suspect you mean \"Blood is thicker than water,\" actually.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Honestly... I did not sign up for these childish games.  
There are far more efficient ways to secure a target... Teehee.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Stop that, Eriko! Don't push!  
What if {player} notices we're here?!

Honestly, you're all hopeless.  
It's time to use force!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Sorry about this, {player}!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Target successfully secured! Proceeding to next objective!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Are you sure you're not enjoying this...?

It's kind and happy words that make Cally grow.  
So what better environment for him  
than a stadium full of love and chocolate?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Well then, you just wait here 'til the chocolates are ready!
