## Subtitle: The Last Halloween of the Year
  
**Miyako：**  
Is this really the last day of Halloween?!  
Ahhh... Miyako wanted more pudding...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
All happy times must come to an end eventually.  
But that's why we should enjoy them to the fullest while they last.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu is totally right!  
For the last day, no more \"Trick or pudding\" from Miyako.  
Today, it's \"Pudding or pudding\"!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Hee hee. Well then, shall we get going?  
We can't be late for our last Halloween party.
