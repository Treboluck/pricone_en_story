**Miyako：**  
Waaah! The puddings Miyako smelled  
were just Jack again?!  
 Enough bullying!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Something feels different about his aura this time...  
Could he have absorbed even more candy  
and grown stronger than ever before...?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Doesn't matter!  
Strong or not strong, Miyako will eat him all up again!
