## Subtitle: Here Comes Halloween
  
**Jack-o-Pudding：**  
The power... It's flooding through me!  
  
**Girl：**  
Waaahhh! I'm scared!  
  
**Man：**  
Aaarghh! It-it's a monster!  
  
**Jack-o-Pudding：**  
Scream and cry! Bawl in shame!  
Rue the day you forgot my name!  
  
**Miyako：**  
He ate up all of Miyako's puddings!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
His spirit energy is on an entirely different level from before...  
So this is Jack's true power!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Being eated up by a big nasty bully...  
Those poor puddings! How you dare! No forgivings!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Wh-what happened?! The attack bounced off!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
His pudding-based body seems to absorb the force of any impact...  
How very unhelpful.  
  
**Jack-o-Pudding：**  
Ahahahahah! I know...  
I'll eat you all up and make *your* energy mine as well!  
  
**Jack-o-Pudding：**  
Haaaahhhh!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Ngh!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu! You OK?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Yes, barely...  
But... simply defending ourselves is not enough.  
We need to find a way to fight back...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Mnngh! Jack, no evil cheating!  
That pudding was Miyako's pudding!  
Getting stronger with it is no fair!  
  
**Jack-o-Pudding：**  
What's the difference, as long as I win?!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Aahhhh!  
  
**Miyako：**  
This is all no use! Can't defeat Jack, puddings are all gone...  
Miyako's life is filled with pain and dark!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Life? Aren't you dead?  
**Choice: (2)**  Try to calm down.  
`Tag 1`  
**Miyako：**  
Now is no time for silly technicalities!  
If you want to be clever, give Miyako pudding!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Miyako：**  
How can Miyako calm down?! Miyako has cravings!  
Miyako needs pudding!  
 Pudding, pudding, pudding!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako's had no pudding in ages!  
With no sweet and creamy pudding, I can't do a thing!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Sweet and creamy... pudding...?  
 Ah...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Say, Miyako, what can you see in front of us right now?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Huh? Miyako just sees Jack...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Are you sure about that?  
  
**Miyako：**  
...?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ahh! No... That's not Jack...  
  
**Miyako：**  
It's a big pudding...! A big, wobbly, juicy pudding,  
biggerer than Miyako ever saw! Looks so tasty!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Yes! That's not Jack, it's a big pudding.  
So, Miyako... Why don't you dig right in?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Amazing!  
 Shinobu is a genius!  
  
**Jack-o-Pudding：**  
Wh-what's your deal?! That look is scary!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Let's do this, Miyako, {player}!  
  
**Jack-o-Pudding：**  
Haaaaahhh!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Hngh! Hahh!  
  
**Jack-o-Pudding：**  
Urgh... You sneaky little...!  
How about... THIS?!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu!  
  
**Jack-o-Pudding：**  
Heheh, did I get ya too good? ...Huh?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Such pitiful attacks will never defeat us!  
  
**Jack-o-Pudding：**  
Th-then... I'll fire off as many shots as it takes!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Whew... That pudding was the yummiest! ♪  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Jack... It would seem that you yourself  
were the \"biggest, sweetest pudding in the world\" in the end.  
  
**Jack：**  
Urgh... Dammit... Dammit!  
Why does nothing go right for me...?!  
  
**Jack：**  
You lot are the ones who started this whole mess!  
If you hadn't forgotten all about me...  
  
**Jack：**  
All I ever wanted... was to celebrate Halloween with everyone.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Jack...  
  
**Man：**  
Wh-what the heck *was* that monster?  
  
**Woman：**  
It looked like that costumed boy transformed into a giant pudding...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Everyone, we're sorry for the trouble.  
May I ask how you liked our little show?  
  
**Man：**  
Huh? \"Show\"?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Yes. Halloween is a night of spooky wonders...  
So my guild members and I took the liberty  
of preparing a suitable spectacle.  
  
**Jack：**  
Wh-what are you saying...?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu...!  
 Eheheh.  
Everyone! Sorry we maybe went a bit too far!  
But we'll give back all the candy soon, so no worrying!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
This boy just wants to enjoy Halloween like everyone else.  
Would you all be kind enough to accept him?  
  
**Man：**  
A-ahh, geez...!  
 It was just a show?!  
I mean, of course I knew that!  
  
**Girl：**  
That was amazing!  
It was so scary, I really cried and stuff!  
  
**Jack：**  
What are you... playing at now?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I'm a spirit medium.  
Resolving lost spirits' unfinished business is what I do.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
However, your loneliness...  
Your regrets would not have been solved by revenge.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
If there was a way to save your soul,  
it could only be to connect with humans once more.  
  
**Jack：**  
But none of them even remember who I am... So how can I...?  
  
**Girl：**  
Hey... Here you go!  
You can have this candy!  
  
**Jack：**  
Huh? Is this for me? But... why...?  
  
**Girl：**  
'Cause Halloween's meant to be fun for everyone!  
And you're Jack O. Lantern, right?  
  
**Jack：**  
You... know who I am?!  
  
**Girl：**  
'Course I do!  
 Anyone who loves Halloween knows that!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Halloween may change with the times,  
but the name of Jack O. Lantern  
has settled deep into the people's hearts.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Perhaps it's time you tried changing a little yourself?  
Instead of bringing fine harvests, you could simply  
embody the joy this season brings.  
  
**Jack：**  
...  
  
**Miyako：**  
What is silly Jack waiting for?  
 Go on, have some fun!  
  
**Jack：**  
Whoaa...  
 Ahhh...  
 Trick or treat!  
Hand over the candy or you're getting pranked!  
  
**Woman：**  
Well, isn't that scary! Here—a candy just for you!  
  
**Jack：**  
Eheheh... Eheheheheheheh!  
All right, guys! Let's make this a Halloween to remember!  
  
**Narration：**  
On the night of Halloween, the soul of a lonely spirit was saved.  
Shinobu, Miyako and {player} watched in satisfaction  
as fun and laughter returned to the streets of Landosol.
