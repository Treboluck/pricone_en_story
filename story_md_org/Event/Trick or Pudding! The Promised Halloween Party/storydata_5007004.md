## Subtitle: Operation: Rescue Shinobu!
  
**Narration：**  
Refusing to let Jack fuse completely with Shinobu's body,  
Miyako and {player} stand in his way.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Haaahhhh!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Wa-wahh!  
 Urghh...  
Miyako still can't do any attacking on Shinobu's body!  
  
**Miyako：**  
We know Jack wants to take over Shinobu's body.  
But how to get Jack out of Shinobu before he does?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Heheh! So you found out my plan,  
but you still don't have any way to stop me, huh?!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shut up now! Miyako's thinking up special ideas!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ummm... ummm...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Hahah, think fast!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Wahhh!  
  
**Miyako：**  
M-Miyako has no good ideas...  
Maybe Miyako really can't save Shinobu after all...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's believe in Shinobu's own strength.  
**Choice: (2)**  Why don't we call out to Shinobu?  
`Tag 1`  
**Miyako：**  
Strength? What're you talking about?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Call out to Shinobu inside Jack?  
Th... there's no way that would...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Miyako：**  
Just talk to her?  
 W-will a plan like that do anything?  
Jack is so strong even Skull Daddy can't escape him...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Miyako：**  
But... Miyako has no better plans, so let's try!  
  
**Miyako：**  
If Shinobu can hear Miyako even a little bit... then...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Oh, yes! Perfect idea!  
  
**Miyako：**  
If that bully can possess Shinobu, Miyako can do it too!  
When Shinobu wakes up and makes Jack a bit weaker,  
Miyako will go possess her instead!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Then Miyako might be able to chase him right out!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Well? You two done brainstorming? Not that it'll do you  
a lick of good! Let's get this over with already.  
I don't have time to play with you today!  
  
**Miyako：**  
...Shinobu! Please listen to Miyako's voice!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...What's this? Are you actually trying to talk to my host?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu... Miyako...  
Miyako wants the old Shinobu to come back!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
As if she can even hear you!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako is always super selfish,  
so Shinobu might think Miyako is only a big pain all the time...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Selfish, huh?  
I guess this poor host must be sick to death of you, then.  
  
**Miyako：**  
But no matter what, Shinobu was always nice to Miyako!  
That's why Miyako... always let Shinobu do everything.  
  
**Miyako：**  
But now...  
 It's Miyako's turn to help Shinobu!  
Say you can hear Miyako, Shinobu!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
What an idiot.  
As if your own self-centered feelings will...  
 Urghh?!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu is Miyako's best friend in the whole world!  
I really really love Shinobu!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Wh-what the?!  
 This body... I can't... Guaaahhh!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu! Please answer! Come back right now!  
And then... And then...!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Let's have our Halloween party together!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
No way... But why?! Stop that! Stop—!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...

**Shinobu：**  
...Yes... You're... right...  
I did promise, didn't I...?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu?! Is that you?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I heard you call... Heard your... voice...  
So, I have to answer properly...!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Miyako... I... I never...  
Never thought that you... were a pain... or too selfish...!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
You're always so lively and cheerful...  
Seeing you always brightens my day...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
You're a very important person to me...  
Like the little sister I never had...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Miyako... I... love you too!

**Shinobu：**  
Urgh... Guaahhh! *pant*... *pant*...  
How can she... suppress *me* with her own will?!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu hasn't disappeared at all! She's fighting to escape!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Urghhhh... Ngh...  
 Yes, I am... I haven't given in yet...!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu! I knew it!  
 Miyako will save you right now!
