## Subtitle: The Perfect Host
  
**Narration：**  
Just when it seemed Jack's attack had knocked her completely  
unconscious, Shinobu opens her eyes.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ah! Shinobu! You're awake again?!  
 What a relief!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Haaahhhh!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Wahhh! Wh-what's wrong, Shinobu?  
Did Miyako do something naughty?  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Hey, squirt! Brat! Run for it!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Wh-what's happening now?! Miyako doesn't understand!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Ahahah... Ahahahah!  
You fell for it! You totally fell for it!  
  
**Miyako：**  
M-Miyako never saw Shinobu laugh that loudly before!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
No! This ain't Shinobu at all... It's Jack!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Ding ding ding! That last host was no use anymore,  
so I switched over to this one!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
This girl's body is... amazing!  
I can feel power coursing through me!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Dammit... His power is so strong, I can't even move,  
let alone protect Shinobu...!  
  
**Miyako：**  
What a big bully! Give Shinobu back now!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh, really? If you try attacking me, you'll only hurt this body...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Urghhh... That's cheating!

**Shinobu：**  
Ahahah! With this body, I've got nothing to fear!  
Finally... I can begin my revenge!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Trick or treat!  
Shall I play some tricks on this body?  
  
**Miyako：**  
No you don't! No doing naughty things to Shinobu!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Then will you play with me?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Who'd want to play with you?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Tch! Fine, then. But you'd better hand over  
every last sweet treat you've got!

**Miyako：**  
Urghhhh... Miyako's pudding... isn't for this nasty guy...  
B-but... Shinobu... Ahhh...  
  
**Miyako：**  
F-fine then! Take it all! All of Miyako's puddings!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Yay! Yay!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...Wait, there's not a thing in here but pudding!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Those puddings are Miyako's!  
H-have some respects for them, big bully!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Seriously, how pudding-obsessed can you be?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Well, whatever!  
 All this tasty pudding is mine now!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Aaahhh... All Miyako's puddings...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I think we should run now.  
`Tag 1`  
**Miyako：**  
Are you a crazy person?!  
 We can't leave Shinobu here!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Well, we can't fight Shinobu either, but...  
  
**Miyako：**  
B-but... just abandoning Shinobu and Miyako's pudding is wrong...!  
Urghhh! Stop pulling Miyako, {player}!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Jack~! Give back Shinobu and pudding!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako couldn't save Shinobu... Couldn't save pudding either...  
  
**Miyako：**  
It's all over! No more pudding, no more Shinobu!  
Nothing left for Miyako anywhere!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Shinobu saved Miyako from being hurt...  
But Miyako couldn't do anything at all...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako is sorry... Shinobu... Miyako is so sorry!  
I don't know what we should do anymore...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's work together and rescue Shinobu.  
**Choice: (3)**  Let's take back Shinobu and the pudding!  
`Tag 2`  
**Miyako：**  
{player}, you're gonna help me?  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Miyako：**  
...Right.  
 We can't give up...! On Shinobu or pudding!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Miyako：**  
Me and you together will be fine, right?!  
We can beat that bully Jack!  
  
**Miyako：**  
And then... when it's all over... After that...  
  
**Miyako：**  
We're gonna have the best Halloween party with Shinobu!
