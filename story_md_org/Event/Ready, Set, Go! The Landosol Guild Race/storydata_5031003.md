# A Forest in Turmoil
The third leg of the race through the forest abounds in dizzying developments, with Mifuyu and Jun at the mercy of Misogi, and Rin in the lead but falling asleep halfway. Kokkoro, who rescues Mifuyu, is able to pass her sash on to Suzume despite the delay.

**Commentator：**  
Unexpectedly, the racers ended the second leg as a group.  
Side by side, they've broken into the third leg! Visibility is low in the forest,  
making for a racecourse that's sure to be wrought with challenges!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I cannot accept that my lord came to the relay stationwith so many  
girls.  
But this situation, with everyone at a tie, is rather tense.  
Miss Jun, your armor will cause you to have difficulties running.  
  
**Jun：**  
Whether in my private life or during training, I always wear this armor.  
I don't have any problems with it.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Forcing my way to the front now wouldn't be efficient.  
It's best to conserve my energy here...  
  
**Rin：**  
And I'm off!  
  
**Jun：**  
Wha—?!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Oh my! Rin is suddenly in the lead!  
  
**Lima：**  
Rin is amaaazing!  
And right when I thought we'd come in last!  
  
**Shiori：**  
She darts so swiftly between the trees.  
Is it because she's... so small?  
Regardless, she's moving like she's accustomed to the forest.  
  
**Lima：**  
I know why! I bet she was practicing by herself  
to make up for skipping work all the time!  
Wah! She's so aloof!  
  
**Rin：**  
I can't tell them I'm used to it  
because I'm always slacking off to come collect acorns...  
  
**Misogi：**  
I'm here too!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Ooohhh! Out of nowhere, Misogi is tailing very closely behind Rin!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Eheheh! Little Lyrical's always coming to play in the forest!  
Running here is super easy for me!  
Oh! The gap between those trees over there leads to a shortcut!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
A shortcut?! I have no option but to use it!  
U-uwaaaaghhh! Wh-what's all this white, sticky stuff?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Heheeh! It's a spider monster's web!  
Prank success!  
Who's next?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh! Armor woman, you'll hit a branch if you keep running that way!  
  
**Jun：**  
Hehe. What a cute little prankster.  
I won't fall for that— Urk!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Awww, I did warn you...  
  
Man, you really hit your head hard. Are you all right?  
  
**Jun：**  
Uh, yes. Are you going out of your way for me? You're a kind one.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Let me check your head for a lump!  
Heave, ho!  
  
**Jun：**  
Woah! Y-young lady! Please return that!  
I can't run without it!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? ...Oh, really?!  
Your head looks fine,  
so away I go!  
  
**Jun：**  
He— Wai—! My helmet!  
Don't leave with my helmet!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Mifuyu and Jun  
are dead in the water thanks to Misogi's interference!  
Kokkoro is running over to give them assistance!  
  
**Commentator：**  
In first place we have Rin, in second is Misogi... Wait—  
Rin has disappeared. Don't tell me she's fallen into  
one of Misogi's pitfall traps?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
This time it's got nothing to do with me.

**Rin：**  
Ahh... This is sooo comfy.  
  
**Commentator：**  
Oh my word! Rin is napping inside a large tree hollow!  
It's something that a rabbit in a picture book might do!  
  
**Lima：**  
What are you doing, Rin?! You were in the lead!  
  
**Rin：**  
I know my limits.  
I'm done here.  
I'm out. I wanna go home.  
  
**Lima：**  
You're still fine, Rin! You're nowhere near your limit!  
You've got to keep going! You can do it! I know you can!  
  
**Rin：**  
Ungh, you're smothering me…  
Limalima, that has the opposite effect on me.  
So I'm gonna call it a day.

**Misogi：**  
Yay! I'm number one!  
Mimi, let's keep killing it!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Thank you, Misogi. I'll do my best too!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Little Lyrical has entered the fourth leg in first place!  
At this rate,  in second place will be either Kokkoro, or Mifuyu.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
*pant, pant*  
  
**Commentator：**  
Whaaaat?! It's...! Wh-who is it?  
  
**Ninon：**  
It is Ayumi!  
  
**Commentator：**  
I-it's Weissflügel's Ayumiii!  
It seems that she slipped under our radar and was  
steadily and stealthily running in second place!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I-I was just running normally...  
Kuka, it's your turn!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Heehee. Th-the sash is digging into my body. It's making me crazy!  
And in front of all these people...  
I'm such a naughty girl, aren't I?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
U-umm... Please hurry up and go!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Heehee. I-I don't mind being rushed.  
In fact, I quite like it! Here I come!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I was in a real mess back there...  
Thank you for saving me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I need no thanks. If I see somebody in trouble, I cannot simply leave them to their fate.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
This will probably make the others angry...  
but I'll let you take third place. If you hadn't come to my rescue,  
you probably would have been in a better position.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
No, I require no repayment—a good deed is its own reward.  
...Instead, let us proceed together. That is the spirit of sportsmanship.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
If it's fine by you, then it's fine by me. But...  
No, you're right. It would be inefficient to hesitate any longer.  
Let's go onward together.  
  
**Commentator：**  
In joint-third are Mifuyu and Kokkoro!  
One by one, they hand over their sashes,  
and go on to the fourth and final leg!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Suzume, please give it your all.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I-I will!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'll show everyone that I can do my best even when milady Miss Saren isn't around!  
  
**Commentator：**  
There's still no sign at all that Jun and Rin will show up!  
If they don't pass on their sashes, the next runners will each  
have to take an advanced start and a time penalty!  
  
![503100004.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/503100004.webp)  
**Matsuri：**  
Urgh... That means I'll be given a nameless sash...  
  
`image display end`  
**Christina：**  
Hahah! If the captain herself fails to hand over the sash,  
it will make for an extraordinarily funny anecdote.  
  
**Tomo：**  
That's totally unnecessary!  
Matsuri, you'll be fine. Believe in Jun.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ain't no way I'm avoidin' an advanced start...  
Rinrin, I'll remember this when we get home.  
  
**Narration：**  
Saren is finishing paperwork  
while in a wagon on her way to meet a business partner.  
  
**Saren：**  
It looks like Kurumi has already finished her leg of the race.  
If I can get this meeting over with quickly, maybe I can make  
it in time to cheer Suzume on...  
  
**Saren：**  
Knowing what she's like, it would be enough if she managed to stay on  
her feet.  
Argh, I need to focus! If I want to go and cheer her on later, I  
need to get this work done now!
