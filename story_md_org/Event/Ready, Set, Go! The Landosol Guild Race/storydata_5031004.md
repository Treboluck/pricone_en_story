**Commentator：**  
While the other guilds are one by one entering the fourth leg,  
Jun and Rin are nowhere to be seen at the relay station!  
Their fourth-leg runners are getting ready for an advanced start!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Jun will definitely show up...  
A hero always arrives late with a grand entrance!  
  
**Jun：**  
*huff, puff* M-Matsuri!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Jun?!  
See, I was right!  
  
**Rin：**  
Ngh. This armor's so bulky it hurts.  
  
**Commentator：**  
What's this?! Jun just entered the scene carrying Rin over her shoulder!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
R-Rinrin! What on earth are ya doin'?!  
  
**Jun：**  
Well, I found my helmet in the hollow where this little one was sleeping.  
I thought I might as well bring them both with me.  
  
**Jun：**  
One of your guild members came to the assistance of other racers  
in the first leg. We are the ones who should be taking that initiative.  
I carried Rin here out of respect for your guild.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Y-ya sure are kind.  
Ya took good care of our Rinrin. Much obliged.  
  
**Rin：**  
In case you didn't know, I was in the lead at one point.  
At least give me some credit for that.  
Here, the sash is yours.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
What're ya talkin' 'bout?  
I'm fixin' to give ya a real good scoldin' when we're done here!  
  
**Jun：**  
Matsuri, apologies for making you feel anxious.  
Here, take the sash. I'll leave the rest to you.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
You bet! As long as I have this sash that connects me to all of you,  
I have the strength of a hundred—  
no, a thousand women!  
Off I go!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmmm. Lame. Totally subpar.  
Are you performing a third-rate play for me, Captain?  
  
**Jun：**  
You are cruel, Chris... Isn't this what racing is all about?  
  
**Commentator：**  
Thanks to Jun's kindheartedness, both she and Rin have  
passed on their sashes! At last, all teams have entered the fourth leg!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahhh, it's so hot.  
  
**Commentator：**  
Mimi has been hit by the volcano's hot air and steepness, decreasing her pace dramatically!  
This truly is the devil's fourth leg!  
  
**Kuka：**  
*pant, pant* My body is so hot!  
I'm being ravished  
inside and out...  
It's so exciting!  
  
**Commentator：**  
My word, Kuka! She's really going for it!  
Out of nowhere she's overtaken Mimi!  
Just what is it that's got her all fired up?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
*pant, pant* I'm spent.  
  
**Commentator：**  
Oh no, it looks like Yukari can't take the heat  
and needs to use the water station.  
  
**Yukari：**  
...It's no use! There's no way such a flavorless drink could ever quench  
my thirst!  
I was saving this for after the race, but just a little tipple...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Mm... J-just a little more... One more sip... This will be the last...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Pfffhaaaaah!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Ahahahahah,  
huh? I kinda fell rearly great.  
*hic* Oh? Ohhh?  
  
**Commentator：**  
Wh-what on earth just happened?! Yukari put something in her mouth,  
and a moment later started acting strange!  
She's meandering along, yet somehow also picking up the pace!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Eheheh! It's b'cosh I'm gonna take firsht place and  
drink lotsh'a water that makesh me feel reeeal good!  
  
**Commentator：**  
She overtook Mimi! Little Lyrical has dropped to third place!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ohhh... And everyone tried so hard...  
  
**Commentator：**  
And here we have the trailing group!  
Is it at all possible to make a comeback from here?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
*pant, pant* Everyone's so fast.  
I can't believe it. I need to exercise a lot more often...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Aaargh! I can't seem to close the gap! What should I do?  
  
**Christina：**  
Are you in a bind? Then you should use my secret stratagem!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
S-stratagem?!  
That sounds real cool! What is it? What is it?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Behold! This is Nightmare's ultimate weapon!  
  
**Tomo：**  
...Isn't that the cannon you used during the Living Mail incident?  
  
**Christina：**  
You are a perceptive one. ☆Come, little girl, climb in!  
Become a human cannonball and soar expeditiously to the finish line!  
Turn the tables with flight... How fitting for a true hero!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Flight... Hero...  
This is awesome!  
I'll do it!  
Old lady, light 'er up!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Er... from a human rights perspective, human cannonballs are a no go.  
We want to keep this broadcast PG-13, but we can't if Matsuri is blown to smithereens.  
  
**Christina：**  
R-rated is so much more fun, wouldn't you agree?  
  
**Commentator：**  
Our sponsors would pull out, and there'd be no more races ever again!  
  
**Jun：**  
Why, I have no intention of letting Matsuri become a human cannonball.  
Matsuri... That body of yours that you train hard day in, day out,  
and your indomitable, heroic spirit are the only things you can depend on.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
J-Jun!  
I get it!  
I'm gonna turn this race around using nothing but my own power...!  
  
I'm gonna become a hero!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Matsuri daaaaash!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Eeek! What was that wind?  
  
**Commentator：**  
In a heartbeat she's left Suzume in the dust!  
At this rate, Mimi is next! To the top she goes!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Excellent! Great work, Matsuri!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Woooaaargh! Gotta live up to everyone's expectations!  
  
**Commentator：**  
She's truly the mountain-running tiger!  
She's the Mountain God!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I-I'd rather be a hero than a god, you know...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I ain't no slouch either!  
My ranchin' background makes me good at mountaineerin'!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Here comes Mahiru, closing in so fast that  
she just might well overtake Matsuri!  
It's a close race for the leading group!  
  
**Suzume：**  
A-and there they go...  
  
**Mimi：**  
*sniff*... Playing catch-up is no fun.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh dear! Th-there's no need to cry!  
I'm also in last place.  
  
**Mini-Gryphon：**  
Eeky squeaky, purrrrrr!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Huh? Mr. Mini-Gryphon... You're going to help me?  
  
**Suzume：**  
M-Mini? Where did this little thing come from?  
  
**Mini-Gryphon：**  
Eeky squeaky, purrrrrr!  
  
**Mimi：**  
You'll let me ride you?  
Eheheh. Thanks!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh? Wait—  
  
**Mimi：**  
Wheee! You're sooo fast!  
Mimi and Mr. Mini-Gryphon to first place!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Can you believe it?! Mimi is riding Mr. Mini-Gryphon up the mountain!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey! Isn't that against the rules?!  
  
**Commentator：**  
The friendship between a girl and her monster... So beautiful...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Listen to what I'm saying!  
  
**Commentator：**  
Suzume is the only one to pull back from the lead group.  
Does she still have a chance to win?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
......  
  
**Saren：**  
My apologies for keeping you waiting.  
  
**Man：**  
No, no, I'm sorry for calling you out here.  
  
**Saren：**  
During our business meeting the other day, when Suzume... I mean, the server, spilled—  
  
**Man：**  
Eheheh. Everybody makes mistakes.  
She was only trying her best.  
Please tell her not to worry about it.  
  
**Man：**  
At any rate, the race is really heating up.  
  
**Saren：**  
Yes, it is. It seems many of my acquaintances are taking part,  
so it's quite fun listening to the commentary.  
  
**Man：**  
Are you sure you don't want to go and show your support?  
Right now, they're on the fourth leg...  
  
**Saren：**  
I-I'm sure. There are things I need to do first...  
  
**Commentator：**  
Suzume is the only one to pull back from the lead group.  
Does she still have a chance to win?!  
  
**Saren：**  
......  
  
**Man：**  
...That maid is apparently taking part as well, right?  
Eheh. Every year it's fun to just listen to the commentary, but knowing  
that someone I've met is taking part makes me kind of happy.  
  
**Man：**  
The other day, thanks to her being there,  
I was able to relax and conduct business properly.  
  
**Man：**  
Seeing her dedication reminded me of how I used to be.  
It made realize that I still have to work hard too.  
That's what I wanted to tell you today...  
  
**Saren：**  
You don't mean...  
  
**Man：**  
I do. Investing in the Sarendia Orphanage  
is absolutely something that I wish to go forward with.  
Therefore, you should hurry up and go support your girl.  
  
**Saren：**  
...Thank you ever so much. ...I'll be off then!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so, Saren ran as fast as she could to go and cheer on Suzume.
