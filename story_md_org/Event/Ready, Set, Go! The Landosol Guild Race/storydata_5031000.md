# Last Challenge of the Year
On New Year's Eve, the Gourmet Guild goes to visit the local shrine. Along the way they meet Suzume, who is feeling down due to a blunder she committed at work. Walking through the town as they try to cheer Suzume up, they happen across a crowd of people who are waiting for the opening of the New Year's Landosol Guild Race.
  
## Subtitle: Last Challenge of the Year
  
**Suzume：**  
Actually, I was heading to your guildhouse to wish you all  
a Happy New Year.  
I'm glad I ran into you.  
  
**Suzume：**  
This past year, you've all really taken great care of me.  
On behalf of milady Miss Saren, I want to thank you.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No, no, we're the ones who should be grateful to you!  
Thank you so much for all your help this year!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I see you're all dressed up. Are you going to visit the shrine?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes. We thought we might as well welcome the New Year at the shrine,  
and offer our prayers while there.  
If you would like, please feel free to join us.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Yes, I would love to tag along!  
  
**Karyl：**  
By the way, it's rare to see you all by your lonesome.  
It's always \"milady this\" and \"milady that\" with you.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Milady miss Saren is a little busy... *sigh*  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hm? There's a story behind that sigh.  
Did you have a falling out with Saren?  
  
**Suzume：**  
No, it's nothing like that at all!  
It's just that I'm a nuisance to her...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Here it is New Year's Eve, yet you're acting all miserable.  
You probably just did something clumsy again, right?  
Is it really something to get that depressed about?  
  
**Suzume：**  
...Actually, the other day, Milady had a business dinner with a client.  
She had me there waiting on them.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I was really nervous, and I accidentally dropped a dish...  
I-I spilled soup all over her business partner! I want to redeem myself,  
but I haven't had the chance to speak to milady at all lately...  
  
**Suzume：**  
I wonder if the reason milady is so busy recently is because she's  
trying to make up for my blunder.  
Or maybe she's run out of patience and is looking another maid...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Suzume, I think that is a leap too far.  
Not to be able to exchange words with  
the one you serve is certainly difficult.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
However, Miss Saren is not the kind of person to treat you cruelly  
based on something like that.  
Please, do not lose sight of yourself...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Yeah, you're right. S-sorry for being so gloomy on New Year's Eve.  
But thanks to you I feel a little relieved. Thank you very much.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? What's with the huge crowd—  
  
**Man 1：**  
We're gonna wiiiiiiiiin!  
  
**Woman：**  
According to this formula our victory is certain.  
  
**Man 2：**  
Me... destroy... rival...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-what's all this racket?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Perhaps there is some kind of event.  
Pushing ourselves through this throng seems rather difficult.  
  
**Commentator：**  
Today, on this New Year's Eve... the fortune for the coming year  
will be decided! Thank you for your patience!  
The New Year's Landosol Guild Race will soon commence!  
  
**All：**  
Race?
