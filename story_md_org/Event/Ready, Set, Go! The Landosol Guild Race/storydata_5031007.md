## Subtitle: Chimes of Celebration
  
**Narration：**  
A little after the race has ended, the participants gather at the shrine  
for the awards ceremony.  
  
**Saren：**  
I hear you also did your best, Kurumi.  
Sorry I didn't make it in time to cheer you on.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
That's okay. I was hoping you would be watching the broadcast.  
A-anyway, Suzume,  
um... Congrats on your victory.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Thank you very much!  
But I messed up a lot,  
and caused trouble for everyone.  
  
**Saren：**  
Still on about that?  
Just so you know, even I have many flaws,  
so I don't care about each and every little thing.  
  
**Suzume：**  
B-but your flaws aren't flaws!  
  
**Saren：**  
Exactly. As far as I'm concerned, your flaws aren't flaws either.  
I can't tell you how many times you've saved me up until now...  
  
**Suzume：**  
A-are you saying that I should keep on blundering the way I do?  
  
**Saren：**  
Not exactly. Don't keep on blundering, per se. You should try to fix that.  
But all your slipups and all your efforts are a part of being you.  
And that's the Suzume I want by my side. Nothing more.  
  
**Suzume：**  
M-Milady...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I'm gonna do my best too... Mama Saren.  
  
**Saren：**  
Of course I also love you the way you are, Kurumi.  
Heh... So let's all do our best together.  
  
**Commentator：**  
The awards ceremony is about to begin!  
All racers are requested to gather at the podium!  
  
**Commentator：**  
And now, the members of the fantastic Gourmet Guild,  
which from today holds the title of the Lucky Guild,  
will select their extravagant prizes!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I, um... I'll take this feywood—  
  
**Saren：**  
Suzume, hold on a second.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh? M-Milady?  
  
**Saren：**  
...Yes, isn't this a better choice?  
  
**Suzume：**  
\"Guildhousekeeping Set\"... It's a load of really fancy cleaning equipment.  
I-I couldn't! Can we at least pick a prize that has been blessed?!  
  
Originally, I wanted to get something for your business partner who I—  
  
**Saren：**  
About that. It all went smoothly thanks to you joining the race.  
  
**Suzume：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Saren：**  
It's weird, but he told me that your screw-up kept his mind at peace.  
Your clumsiness helped me close the deal.  
  
**Saren：**  
Besides, if you want to talk about blessings, then your constant  
hard work is a blessing to me and everybody at the Orphanage.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh? Eheheh. I-if you say so... But I'm no benefit to anyone—  
  
**Spectator 1：**  
Hey! It's her! The Mountain God Shrine Maiden!  
  
**Spectator 2：**  
I heard that if she receives your prayers,  
you'll have good luck for the whole year!  
  
**Commentator：**  
What's going on?! The crowd is pouring in, hoping to receive blessings  
from Suzume! What does the shrine's priest make of all this...?  
He doesn't care! \"By all means,\" he says!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wh-whaaaaat?! I don't have that kind of power!  
  
**Spectators：**  
Blessings! Blessings! Blessings!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Waaaaaah! Oof!

**Pecorine：**  
All that running has me starving!  
I know! Let's celebrate with a banquet!  
  
**Karyl：**  
G-good idea. How about we use these coupons I just got  
for a full course at a fancy restaurant?  
From time to time I feel like  
eating something that doesn't have monster in it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yay! These tickets are for a ritzy monster cuisine diner!  
Karyl, I can't believe you wanted to eat monster meat so badly!  
  
![503100702.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/503100702.webp)  
**Karyl：**  
...Huh? Ritzy monster...? How could this happen?!  
I sometimes just wanna eat something decent together...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl, are you saying you chose that prize for all of us?  
Eheheh. When we're all together, anything can be a feast.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh yeah, you said something like that during the race too.  
I mean! I'm sick of eating monsters!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. Now, now, Miss Karyl.  
It does not change that fact that it is high-class.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That's not what I'm saying, Koro...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh! Before we realized, it's already tomorrow!  
  
**Saren：**  
Beginning a new year outside the orphanage is kind of refreshing.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Urgh... Falling over at the start of a new year... isn't a very good omen.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh. There's nothing to worry about.  
Because we can all celebrate together!  
Let's eat looooots of tasty things together this year too!
