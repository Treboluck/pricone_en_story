## Subtitle: The Mountain Sleeps
  
**Suzume：**  
Th-the Mountain God finally went home...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Everyone, good work, as always.  
However, can we honestly assume that we will not see it again...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I wish you would cut it out with all the scary talk...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. I merely jest, Miss Karyl.  
Anyway, surely this will all make the coming year an even better one.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A good year ahead is great and all, but I'm already starving!  
Let's go find somewhere to eat!  
We can think about all the other stuff later!  
  
**Karyl：**  
For once I agree with you.  
All right, let's get going!
