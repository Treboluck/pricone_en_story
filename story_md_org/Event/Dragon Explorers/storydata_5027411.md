**Matsuri：**  
Today, we'll be saying goodbye to Elpis Island...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Why so blue, Matsuri?  
I honestly thought you'd be getting pretty homesick by now.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Of course I'm not homesick!  
I've got you here, and Miss Kaya... Why would I be lonely?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Haha. Well, I've enjoyed this too.  
It felt almost like having two Inoris around.  
  
**Inori：**  
Excuse me?!  
 That doesn't sound like a compliment at all!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Okay, let's finish things up here and leave with no regrets!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'll do my best!
