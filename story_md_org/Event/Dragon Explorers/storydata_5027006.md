# Dragon's Fury
Thanks to Kaya's awakening, the group just barely manages to fight off the beast—only to discover that it wasn't a real dragon at all. As the members of Dragons' Nest lament that all their efforts were for nothing, Tomo and Matsuri decide that their targets are no threat, and their mission is complete.
  
## Subtitle: Dragon's Fury
  
**Narration：**  
In response to Kaya's provocation, the dragon readies a fiery blast.  
But the members of Dragons' Nest show no sign of panic.  
  
**Homare：**  
Here it comes!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
O-oh no...!  
 It's gonna fire-breath us!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Pfft...! Br... \"breath us\"? \"Fire-breath us\"?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hey, it's not that funny!  
 Is this really the ti—  
  
**Kaya：**  
Whoa there!  
Heheh, I like the 'tude.  
So you're accepting it, then? The fight I just offered?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
She baited the breath and dodged at the last second?  
It's like she isn't afraid of getting burned to a cinder!  
  
**Inori：**  
Ohhh... Here she goes with her bad habit again...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Heheh. That's some potent fire you've got!  
Go on, try to hit me with it!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Watch out for the tail!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Whoa!  
 C'mon, is that your best shot?  
Your tail's so slow, I think a fly might land on it!  
  
**Dragon?：**  
MGRUOOOOHHHH!  
  
**Homare：**  
Ooh, he does seem angry~!  
Kaya? Try not to let your focus slip!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Say what? It's not like you to be a worrywart, boss.  
As if a blow like that would even hurt me!  
  
**Homare：**  
No, not that! I didn't mean you might get injured—  
  
**Dragon?：**  
FFSSHHHHRRR...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Here comes that breath again!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Not good! At that angle, the blast might hit us as well!

**Kaya：**  
I don't think so! Inori!  
  
**Inori：**  
I'm on it!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh, nice! She blocked the breath with her own!  
  
**Inori：**  
Kaya-P! Now's your chance!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Yeah! Here I gooooo!  
  
`image display end`  
**Dragon?：**  
Mguohhhh...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Wait, huh? Can it really be that easy...?  
  
**Homare：**  
Watch out for that red fruit!  
It has the exact same scent as that creature's breath!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? This fruit here?  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Ah! It's gonna catch fire and blow! Get back!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Protect Matsuri.  
`Tag 1`  
**Tomo：**  
Matsuri! {player}!  
  
**Inori：**  
Kaya-P... Come back to us, Kaya-P!  
  
**Kaya：**  
I'm sorry, Inori...  
  
**Inori：**  
Kaya-P...!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I was really worried there for a minute...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Anyone hurt...?  
 Hmm. I guess it's this guy who suffered the worst of it.  
  
**Dragon?：**  
Mrrrghhhhhh...  
  
**Inori：**  
Is he gonna be OK?  
Just when we finally found a real dragon...  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Sorry. Guess I went a bit far.  
I must've given Matsuri a scare again, too...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
No, no! Not at all!  
It's thanks to you that we're all OK!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Even so, I was a little shocked.  
I didn't think you'd defeat a dragon by yourself.  
  
**Kaya：**  
It wasn't just me who fought, was it?  
Inori put in plenty of work, too.  
  
**Tomo：**  
True enough. Her flames were quite something.  
Or are you still going to say lighting fires is \"all you're good for\"?  
  
**Inori：**  
I-I didn't do anything all that special...  
I just didn't want to back down from a real dragon!  
  
**Homare：**  
Yes, about that...  
This fella...  
 isn't a dragon after all! ☆  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Whaaaaaa?!  
B-but... it's got the wings, the horns, the tail *and* the fire breath!  
What else could it be?! It's just the same as you guys!  
  
**Tomo：**  
No... I do think Homare has a point.  
Take a closer look, Matsuri.  
Those wings aren't real, and the horns are handmade too.  
  
**Homare：**  
As for the breath, I think this explains it! ♪  
Largo, set that fruit on fire.  
  
**Largo：**  
Growwrrr!  
  
**Kaya：**  
What the...?! That explosion was from the fruit?  
It eats them and uses them to breathe fire...!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Then the fire at the camp was from this fruit too...?  
  
**Kaya：**  
So it's like a Pseudo-Dragon or something?  
What about the ruins, then, boss?  
  
**Homare：**  
Hmmm... There doesn't seem to be much left of them.  
Oh...? This item... I do believe it's from our camp!  
Then the rest of these may have been taken from other ruins, too.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So when Inori saw it, it was stealing from the camp?  
That's why it ran off so quickly...  
  
**Inori：**  
Who put you on first-name terms with me?!  
I'll have you know I'm older than you!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh?! I figured you were my age or younger!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hahaha,  
 well, who wouldn't?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Careful now, Matsuri.  
Inori here is actually the same age as me.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Wait, really?! I figured you were way closer to my age...  
  
**Homare：**  
Hmmm...  
 I see~! ☆  
  
**Inori：**  
Hey, {player}! Enough of the staring and comparing!  
That's so rude! Nasty, creepy, no-good perv!  
Scum! You big piece of scum!  
  
**Inori：**  
Honestly... Has nobody around here even heard of respect?!  
  
**Pseudo-Dragon：**  
Mrrghhh!  
  
**Inori：**  
\"You're no better\"? Excuse me?  
Wait, huh...? Wh... who just said that?  
  
**Pseudo-Dragon：**  
Frrshhhh...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh, crap. More breath?!  
 Everyone, get down!  
  
**Pseudo-Dragon：**  
Bruaghhhh~!  
  
**Homare：**  
Ahhh...!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Guehh! Did that thing just belch?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Uerghh! Th-that really stinks!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Wait, where's the Pseudo-Dragon?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ahhh! It ran away!  
  
**Kaya：**  
What is going on here?!  
  
**Inori：**  
…\"Shut up, dummies.\"  
  
**Kaya：**  
...What?  
  
**Inori：**  
N-not like that, Kaya-P!  
It's what I thought I heard the Pseudo-Dragon say just now!  
  
**Homare：**  
Well, from its perspective, we did just storm in on its nest,  
cause a massive scene, and then kick off a full inquiry~! ♪  
  
**Tomo：**  
When you put it that way...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I kinda feel bad for the big guy...  
  
**Inori：**  
Now he's run off into the jungle...  
  
**Kaya：**  
So hold up. We pulled out all the stops for this voyage  
 just to find  
some overgrown lizard and ruins so ruined they're worth squat?  
Was this the wild goose chase to end all wild goose chases?  
  
**Homare：**  
Agreed... We leaked a bunch of information to Nightmare,  
and we're behind on the actual exploration too, so forget profit,  
we're deep in the red!  
 ...Looks like nobody's getting paid this month! ☆  
  
**Kaya & Inori：**  
D... dangitall!  
  
**Narration：**  
The wails of two young dragongirls echoed through the jungle.  
And thus Dragons' Nest's grand Elpis Island adventure  
came to an unfortunate end for the moment.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So, um... Did justice prevail here, or what?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Matsuri... Let's just leave them alone for now...
