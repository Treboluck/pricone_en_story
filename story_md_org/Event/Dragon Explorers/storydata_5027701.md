**Narration：**  
Inori and her new friend Pseudraggo's special training continues.  
  
**Inori：**  
This is going really well.  
You've gotten so much smarter, Pseudraggo!  
...Bleh, \"Pseudraggo\" sounds so weird and uncute.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, c'mon. Didn't you come up with the name yourself?  
...And is this guy even supposed to be cute?  
  
**Inori：**  
Hmm, a cuter name... a cuter name...  
Aha! Why don't I just call you Draggo?!  
  
**Draggo：**  
Mrgh! Mrrghhh!  
  
**Inori：**  
Ooh, he likes it!  
You want me to call you Draggo, do you?  
  
**Draggo：**  
Mgrr! ♪ Gmmrrhh! ♪  
  
**Inori：**  
Ahhh, good boy, good boy... You're the best, Draggo!  
Heheheheh. Together we can take on the world!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Uh, at what...?  
Still though, it's true you've both been putting up a good fight lately.  
D'you think maybe we've done enough?  
  
**Inori：**  
Hah! You just wait there and watch, Kaya-P!  
We'll drown you in an ocean of impossible letters!  
  
**Draggo：**  
Mrghhh! Grrmhhh!  
  
**Kaya：**  
If you're so sure, I'll stop holding back.  
Gimme your best shot!
