## Subtitle: Return to Elpis Island
  
**Narration：**  
Returning to Elpis Island for a second time,  
the three members of Dragons' Nest make their way back  
to the ruins where the Pseudo-Dragon makes its lair.  
  
**Inori：**  
Hello~? Anyone home?  
Come on, show yourself! We brought treats for you!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Treats? What have you got there?  
  
**Inori：**  
Tasty candy!  
I'm sure he'll love it!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Actually, when the big guy attacked the camp,  
I did hear all our chocolate went missing...  
  
**Homare：**  
Look, Inori.  
The creature's watching us from over there.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Then let's drag him out here already.  
  
**Inori：**  
Wait a minute, Kaya-P!  
He's scared of you after you beat him up last time!  
It's OK, big guy... We're not gonna hurt you...  
  
**Pseudo-Dragon：**  
Mrghhh...  
  
**Inori：**  
Come over here!  
I've got tasty chocolates for you!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, here he comes.  
Guess using food was the right call.  
Now let's see what he can tell us.  
  
**Inori：**  
Hm, I see...  
...So you were jealous of real dragons, huh?  
  
**Inori：**  
Looks like he dresses like this because he wants to become a dragon.  
  
**Kaya：**  
So you can seriously understand what he's saying?  
  
**Inori：**  
It's not totally clear...  
But I think he's trying to say he felt the presence of dragons at our camp.  
That's why he came to begin with.  
  
**Homare：**  
Hmm, you two really can communicate...  
Does he know anything about the ruins?  
  
**Inori：**  
Hmm... I can tell basically what he's saying,  
but it's hard to understand the details...  
Uerghh... I don't get it at all!  
  
**Kaya：**  
What the heck?  
  
**Homare：**  
You sense its feelings, but it's more difficult to convey actual words?  
So much for a proper interrogation, then...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Even you can't tell what it's saying, right, boss?  
Why's it just Inori that can talk to it?  
  
**Homare：**  
There may be some kind of natural affinity,  
 but I expect  
it's mostly because their intellects are on similar levels! ☆  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, dang...  
 So he's not too bright either, huh?  
Poor thing...  
  
**Inori：**  
Kaya-P?! Did I just hear something super insulting?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Well, I mean, in the end, he wasn't any use, was he?  
After we came all the way back here, too... *sigh*...  
  
**Inori：**  
Aurghh! W-wait a minute!  
I'll prove that he isn't useless at all!  
  
**Inori：**  
I know—let's teach him!  
If we teach him to speak, he can tell us more!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Can you do that?  
He looks like a pretty big idiot to me...  
  
**Homare：**  
How about you try using these stone tablets?  
If you gradually teach him words for concepts,  
perhaps he'll even be able to talk to us all!  
  
**Inori：**  
That's it!  
This way I can prove I'm way smarter than Kaya-P!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's keep things realistic.  
  
**Inori：**  
The first thing we need is a name!  
I'll become your godmother, big guy.  
\"Pseudo... Dragon…\"  
 Pseudraggo! I'll call you Pseudraggo!  
  
**Pseudraggo：**  
Mrrghhh!  
  
**Inori：**  
Hahaha, really? You like it, do you?  
Kaya-P! We'll make short work of you soon enough!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Yeah, yeah, sure thing. You just do your best.  
  
**Narration：**  
Thus begins Inori's education of the Pseudo-Dragon.  
She faces up to the challenge with discipline, passion,  
and most importantly the lure of chocolate to guide him, until...  
  
**Inori：**  
Haha... Hahahahahaha...! We can win! I'm sure we can win!  
Kaya-P! Face us now!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Say what? What's going on?  
  
**Inori：**  
Pseudraggo and I have finished our training.  
See if you can beat us at linking words with these panels!  
We'll crush you into dust!  
  
**Homare：**  
Oh~? That sounds like fun! ☆  
Go on, Kaya, why don't you take them on?  
  
**Kaya：**  
All right. I never turn down a challenge.  
Whether we're fighting with fists or words, I'll come out on top!  
  
**Inori：**  
When we beat you, we'll become the new rulers of this island!  
You, the boss... everyone will bow down to us!  
Let's do it, Pseudraggo! And {player}!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  When did I get drafted into this?  
`Tag 1`  
**Pseudraggo：**  
Mrrghhh!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh boy, her head's getting overinflated...  
What do I do now, boss?  
  
**Homare：**  
She's even forgotten all about our original goal  
of asking him about the ruins...  
Perhaps you should put her in her place a little! ☆  
  
**Inori：**  
Heheh, go ahead and try!  
As if we'd lose to a battle addict with muscles for brains like Kaya!  
I could win this in my sleep!  
  
**Pseudraggo：**  
Mrgh gmrrh mrghhh!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...?!  
 Those're some real fighting words, Inori...!  
Guess I'm gonna hafta show you my brains  
are made of more than just muscle!  
  
**Homare：**  
Not denying there's muscle in there~? ♪  
Well, personally, I don't mind who wins  
as long as that creature can tell us about the ruins!  
  
**Inori：**  
Heheheh. Kaya-P!  
 You're going down!  
  
**Kaya：**  
I like your guts!  
 Bring it on!
