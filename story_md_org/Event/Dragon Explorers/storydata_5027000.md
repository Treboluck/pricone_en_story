# Top Secret Mission
Jun, captain of Nightmare, gives a new mission to her trusted subordinates Tomo and Matsuri: to perform an undercover investigation of the guild Dragons' Nest—rumored to have underworld connections—on their expedition to a certain uncharted island.
  
## Subtitle: Top Secret Mission
  
**Narration：**  
One early afternoon outside the Landosol palace gates,  
where an ironclad figure stands staunchly before the regal backdrop,  
two young knights approach and greet their superior.

**Matsuri：**  
Sorry for the wait, Captain Jun!  
Matsuri here, reporting for duty together with Tomo!  
  
**Tomo：**  
What's this about, Jun?  
Calling us all the way out here...  
If it's work, shouldn't we meet indoors?  
  
**Jun：**  
Ah, good to see you, Tomo, young Matsuri.  
And... well, I think this discussion is better held here.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I see...  
 By holding this talk out in the open,  
you're making sure if anyone listens in, you can spot them.  
...I take it this is a pretty big deal, then?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh?! Wait, is this a secret assignment?!  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha. Well, it pays to be cautious.  
Have you two heard of the uncharted land being explored recently?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Uncharted... land?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh... Do you mean that remote island?  
From what I heard, though it's home to dangerous monsters,  
the Guild Association's been making sure everything goes smoothly.  
  
**Jun：**  
Yes, it's the Association that approached me.  
It seems there have been certain vessels  
making their way to the island through unapproved channels.  
  
**Jun：**  
Ships registered with the guild Dragons' Nest.  
You've heard of them, haven't you, Tomo?  
  
**Tomo：**  
...!  
All the rumors say they're a front for an underworld gang...  
Why would they be taking part in this expedition?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
W-wait, gangsters?  
Those are like, bad guys, aren't they?  
Then we've gotta take 'em down!  
  
**Jun：**  
As Tomo mentioned just now, this expedition is not without dangers.  
We can only rely on guilds with the strength to defend themselves.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I see... Guess even the Guild Association can't be too choosy.  
  
**Jun：**  
Precisely. But we can't be lax, either.  
If the expedition funds were to be appropriated by gangsters,  
that would be no laughing matter.  
  
**Jun：**  
So our plan is to send a pair of operatives  
to monitor this guild's activities.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wow, that's gotta be a tricky job...  
  
**Tomo：**  
I see where this is going. As our captain, you can't leave Landosol.  
And most members of Nightmare would inevitably arouse suspicion.  
Which is why...

**Jun：**  
Yes. It's time for our secret weapon: you two.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Me and Tomo are your... secret weapon...?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Understood. You can count on us, Captain.  
We'll seize those Dragons' Nest villains by the tail.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Me and Tomo  
 will bring that evil organization to ruin!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Um, we're only supposed to investigate them, Matsuri...  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha, thank you.  
Well then, good luck.
