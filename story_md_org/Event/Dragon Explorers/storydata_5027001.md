## Subtitle: To Uncharted Lands!
  
**Narration：**  
A few days later...  
Tomo and Matsuri have infiltrated the crew recruited by Dragons' Nest  
for their latest voyage to Elpis Island.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Whewww!  
 Hey, Tomo, isn't this awesome?!  
We're out on the open sea!  
  
**Tomo：**  
You sure are full of energy.  
I expect we'll be sick of that open sea before long.  
Ah well, keeping lookout is all part of our job here.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Y-yeah, good point.  
Can't let the excitement distract me from the job...  
  
**Tomo：**  
What's that~?  
Matsuri, you do remember our \"job\" is to defend the crew, don't you?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Oh yeah, I know!  
You and me are a beautiful bodyguard and her sidekick!  
Am I right?  
  
**Tomo：**  
The \"beautiful\" part doesn't seem necessary,  
 but that's the idea.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I don't think anyone on this ship has noticed  
that we're really members of Nightmare!  
Captain Jun sure knows her stuff, huh?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Our real targets are the dragonfolk guild members.  
There should be three of them aboard, so stay alert.  
If they find us out, who knows what we'll be subjected to.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Urghh... When you put it like that, this feels scary...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hahaha. Don't worry.  
 Nobody should know about us here,  
short of a freak encounter with an acquaintance.  
 Wait, huh?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hey, guys!  
`Tag 1`  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? Huuuuuuh?!  
{player}?!  
What're *you* doing on this ship?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It's just a job.  
`Tag 2`  
**Tomo：**  
Ahaha... Same as us, then.  
We joined up as bodyguards as part of a new training regime.  
Right, Matsuri?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Oh! ...  
Yeah!  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'm guessing you're here to handle cargo?  
These expeditions do pay well, so they're attractive work.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I was invited by this guild's members.  
`Tag 3`  
**Tomo：**  
You have friends in Dragons' Nest...?  
Could you tell us a little more about that, perhaps?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Urgh... Tomo's expression turned scary...  
Maybe I should get outta here before I let anything slip...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Whew...  
 It sure is a big ship, though!  
This side is \"port,\" that's \"starboard,\" and our cabin is...  
Huh? I-I can't remember which way it was...  
  
**???：**  
You there! What are you loitering for?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Mm? There's a little girl yelling.  
Huh, didn't know there were other kids on board.  
  
**???：**  
I'm talking to you, tiger-tailed beast-runt! Yes, you right there!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? Wait, you mean me?  
L-like heck I'm a beastgirl! This tail's an accessory!  
  
**???：**  
Who cares what race you are?!  
What're you doing on this ship?!  
This is no place for curious little brats to wander!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Say what? I'm here on work!  
A mission... uh, I mean,  
 a bodyguard job!  
...Even if I'm just helping out.  
  
**???：**  
Who hires a bodyguard as teensy as you?!  
Even that sword you've got looks like a toy!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
D-don't you look down on me!  
I'm a member of Nigh...  
 Argh! That's a secret...  
Wh-who are you, anyway?!  
  
**Inori：**  
Oh-hoh? So you don't even know who I am?  
That proves you don't belong here!Haha... Listen and weep!  
I am the great Inori, a leading member of the Family!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Leading...?  
Wait. Those horns and wings... Could you be  
 a dragongirl?!  
  
**Inori：**  
Eheheh. I scared her... I actually scared her!  
Hahahahahah!  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
Oh, there she is.  
 What're you up to here, Inori?  
The boss was looking for you.  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
Oh yeah, if she finds you slacking off, you'll be in for it again.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Are they gangsters?  
Looks like they're from that guild, at any rate...  
  
**Inori：**  
Ah, what perfect timing!  
You guys can teach this brat how we do things around here!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Like you're not a kid yourself.  
  
**Inori：**  
Aurgh!  
 I can't let that one lie! How exactly do I look like a kid?!  
You cheeky brat! Men, take care of this girl!  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
...Uh, don't give out weird orders, Inori.  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
We've got actual work to handle.  
Here, you two have some candy to eat together.  
  
**Inori：**  
Nghhh...! Is *everyone* here hopeless?!  
...I mean, sure, I'll take the candy, but still.  
I'll just have to teach this brat a lesson... all by myself!  
  
**???：**  
Whoa there, Inori. What're you up to now?  
  
**Inori：**  
Pyeughh!

**Inori：**  
Wh-what's the big idea, Kaya-P?! You're too cruel!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
A-another dragongirl...!  
  
**Kaya：**  
I'm not the one hurling threats at a kid I've just met.  
Hey. You OK there?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Oh... Y-you mean me?  
I'm fine...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Sorry about our little runt.  
 I'll see she behaves better.  
I think she's really just happy to see another kid her own age.  
  
**Inori：**  
Ehhhh?! Of course I'm not happy!  
Don't put me on the same level as some snot-nosed brat!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh yeah—we should introduce ourselves.  
I'm Kaya. And this is Inori.  
  
**Inori：**  
Aughh! Kaya-P!  
 You can't just ignore me!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
My name's Matsuri...  
 Oh yeah!  
You wouldn't happen to be friends of {player}, would you?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hm? You know him too, do you?  
Actually, he did say he thought he recognized someone in the crew.  
So that was you, huh...?  
  
**Kaya：**  
OK. Nice to meet you, Matsuri.  
Now, where was I?  
Inori, the boss wants you.  
 What did you do this time?  
  
**Inori：**  
Yeaugh! I-I haven't messed up yet today!  
I'm innocent, totally...  
 inno... cent...?  
  
**Kaya：**  
So many options, you don't know which one this is about, huh?  
Well, I'll say sorry with ya, so let's move.  
Later, Matsuri.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Oh, sure... See you around.

**Matsuri：**  
Off they go...  
That girl... actually seemed kind of cool...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmm... Is that right?  
Feeling tempted by the gangster life, are you, Matsuri?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Uwahh?! T-Tomo! When did you show up...?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
I thought we were devoted to pursuing justice together,  
but I guess that was just me. Too bad, too bad.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
No, it's not just you!  
I'm always aflame with passion for justice!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahaha, that's a relief.  
Still, those two... They're the dragonfolk, huh?  
I can see how they might be tricky customers.  
  
**Narration：**  
With dark clouds on the horizon, the ship glided across the waves,  
carrying the conflicting factions of Dragons' Nest and Nightmare  
to a brave new world...
