Whew...  
We finally put those copycows in the dirt.

Oh...? I'm almost impressed.  
But this isn't even my final mode. Wait until you see my true power.  
  
**Inspector：**  
What?! You! You've purposely been holding back?!  
Get it together, man! Don't forget the fortune I'm paying you!  
Remove every single trace of these peasants at once!  
  
**Hanzo：**

**Rin：**  
Is it just me, or can you sense some internal discord?  
  
**Shiori：**

**Lima：**  
Let's show them how strong we are when we fight as a team!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You got it!  
When we pull together, ain't nobody got a cowbell's chance in hell!
