# Hardworking Days
The members of Elizabeth Park steadily earn money through dangerous but well-paid jobs. Just as things are starting to go well with the extra income from collecting a bounty, it is discovered that the ranch is being turned into a health resort for the Council of Nobles.
  
## Subtitle: Hardworking Days
  
**Narration：**  
Having had their home taken away from them,  
the residents of Elizabeth Park are staying at  
Sarendia Orphanage thanks to {player}'s help.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Saren, we're so grateful for ya.  
We'd be homeless without your generosity.  
  
**Saren：**  
We owe Elizabeth Park a debt of gratitude, so it's no big deal.  
  
Plus, the children are happy.  
  
**Girl：**  
Hey, Lima, lookit, lookit!  
Me and Big Sis Shiori drew a picture of you!  
  
**Lima：**  
Wow, thank you so much!  
Oh my goodness, its so cute! I'm so happy!  
  
**Shiori：**  
It really accentuates your features, doesn't it?  
Like your fluffiness.  
  
**Boy：**  
Hey, Rin! How do you play this game?  
  
**Rin：**  
That's \"Big Sis Rin\" to you...  
Well, whatever.  
Watch. You play it like this.  
  
**Saren：**  
I really appreciate you all helping with the children.  
I wish it could always be like this,  
but I know I mustn't say such things.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Right, 'cause we gotta take back Elizabeth Park.  
We found us some real high-payin' work  
so we can start savin' up cash.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Um... are you sure I don't have to go with you?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
All the good-payin' jobs seem pretty tough.  
Instead, how 'bout you give {player} a hand  
with his mail route? Jus' don't overdo it, 'kay?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Well, I should do as much as I can, right?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's do our best.  
`Tag 1`  
**Shiori：**  
Let's!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Rinrin, we oughtta go get ready.  
  
**Rin：**  
All right...  
*sigh*... It's time to wear *that*, huh...?

**Rin：**  
...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Rin...  
  
**Lima：**  
Ohhhhh my gosh, that's cute! ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Aw man, that's why I didn't wanna put this on!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Have you always had that armor?  
It doesn't really suit you.  
  
**Rin：**  
It's uh... When I joined Caon... my mom bought it to...  
encourage me to do my best... I guess...  
  
**Lima：**  
So she bought large armor in anticipation of you growing. ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
It's been way too big for me since I got it.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Don't give up! Ya can still grow into it!  
  
**Rin：**  
...No, even you can't convince me of that.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Why not?!  
  
**Rin：**  
'Cause like, you know...  
  
**Shiori：**  
You look cute too, Mahiru.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Y-ya think I look cute?!  
Well, I actually thought it was more of a mature and dignified outfit,  
if I'm bein' honest...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
That's strange...  
It's the venerable battle uniform of Elizabeth Park  
that's been passed down for generations...  
  
**Lima：**  
When you wear it... it looks less mature, and more healthy?  
It looks great on you! ♪  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Thank ya, Limalima!  
But don't I have any adult charm...?  
  
**Rin：**  
Nope, so forget about it.  
  

---  
  
`image display end`  
**Shiori：**  
Heheh.  
...But it must be a pretty dangerous job if you have to wear something  
like that.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hmmm. Well, there are a lot of security jobs.  
And the pay's good, so we'll earn a whole bunch of rupies.  
  
**Saren：**  
Erm, I don't mean to sound rude,  
but do you have the time for chit-chat?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh! You're right! We gotta get goin'!  
  
**Lima：**  
I'd best be off too!  
  
**All：**  
See you later!  
  
**Old Man：**  
So you're the people who took the job?  
You don't look that strong...  
But nobody else was willing to accept my request.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Don't worry yourself. We'll get the job done.  
But what exactly is it ya want us to do?  
  
**Old Man：**  
I'm about to go and stock up on agricultural produce.  
I want you to escort me.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...?Is that really necessary?  
I used to sell goods all over the place, but nowhere 'round here ever  
struck me as dangerous.  
  
**Old Man：**  
There's been a huge spike in food prices recently, so I've become the  
target of many a bandit gang... Good grief, what's the world coming to  
when people are being robbed for food?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I wonder, is that 'cause of Mr. Inspector...?  
  
**Rin：**  
Mahy, all we should be thinking about now is getting the ranch back.  
That's all we can do for the time being.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Yeah. Let's focus on the work that's right in front of us.  
  
**Foreman：**  
Pick it up, lazy maggots! Quit slackin'!  
If ya don't fulfill yer quota, ya don't get to rest!  
  
**Lima：**  
Gosh, this place sure is scary...  
But there just aren't that many places where I can actually work,  
so I've got to tough it out.  
  
**Man 1：**  
Wh-why's there a monster here...?!  
  
**Lima：**  
Ah, s-sorry, I'm not a monster!  
I'm just really into cosplaying. A weirdo, that's all.  
  
**Man 1：**  
S-so ya didn't follow me here to turn me into lunch...  
  
**Lima：**  
Follow you? Why would I...?  
  
**Man 1：**  
F-forget about it!  
It ain't a big deal!  
  
**Lima：**  
I can pretend not to be interested if you really want...  
Well, how about you explain this job to me instead?  
The foreman didn't tell me a thing.  
  
**Man 1：**  
Er, okay...  
Our job's to gather rocks from this mountain and transport 'em  
into town.  
Apparently they make beautiful pavin' stones.  
  
**Lima：**  
So that's what we're doing! Got it!  
For the sake of getting the ranch back, I'll give it my all!  
  
**Man 1：**  
She ain't given up yet...?  
I wish I'd been more proactive like that...  
Oh well, it's too late now...  
  
**Man 1：**  
Either way, that inspector always had those scary fellas followin' him  
'round. Ain't no tellin' the outcome if I'd fought back...  
  
**Narration：**  
Mahiru and company have finished stocking up  
and are pulling the cart down the highway at a leisurely pace.  
  
**Old Man：**  
If we make it back to the city without incident,  
your escort fee will be all but a waste.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm real sorry.  
I'd love to give ya a discount, but we got our own troubles, you see...  
  
**Old Man：**  
Hahahah! I'm just pulling your leg.  
I never would've thought that you were Elizabeth Park's guildmaster.  
  
**Old Man：**  
Once you take your ranch back in one piece,  
just promise you'll trade with me. That'll be enough.  
  
**Rin：**  
Is Elizabeth Park really that famous?  
  
**Old Man：**  
The guild's always been well-known for selling high-quality animal  
produce, but these days there's a whole lot of talk about products  
bearing the Elizabeth Park seal being gifted to the nobility and such.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Gifted...?  
I ain't done no such thing...  
  
**Old Man：**  
You serious?  
  
Well, come to think of it, you wouldn't be out here protecting  
an old codger like me if you were aligned with the aristocracy.  
  
**Rin：**  
Tell us, where did you hear all that stuff...?  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Hey, you over there!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Drop the goods an' get the hell outta here!  
  
**Old Man：**  
Aaaah!  
  
**Rin：**  
Aw man... There really are bandits roaming around.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Rinrin! Don't jus' stand there, we got a job to do!  
  
**Rin：**  
Yeah, I know that.  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Huh? What's the deal, li'l girls?  
  
**Rin：**  
We're here protecting this man.  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Hahahahahah!  
What the hell can a couple of runts like you do?!  
Ya don't even fit into yer own armor! Stupid kid!  
  
**Rin：**  
What...?!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Don't take us lightly!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Yaaargh!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ya can't jus' come in and swipe food that others've worked so  
earnestly to make!  
But what really gets my goat is you makin' fun of Rinrin's armor!  
  
**Rin：**  
Mahy...  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Loose-fitting li'l girl!  
Now ain't the time to be zonin' out!  
  
**Rin：**  
Whoa!  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Rin：**  
Where were you aiming?  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Wh-what the...?  
Again! Hyaah!  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
She dodged again?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh, I see.  
Your aim's off 'cause my armor's too loose, huh?  
It was pretty dumb of you to make fun of it.  
  
**Rin：**  
Sorry to say, but there's a heavy price to pay for mocking my armor.  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
W-wait! I ain't the one who made—  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
fun of it...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Well that was anticlimactic.  
  
**Old Man：**  
I'm amazed. You ladies are rather strong.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hmmm, well, considering we're a simple ranching guild,  
we get wrapped up in all sorts of hijinks.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
We sure do.  
But what should we do with these here bandits?  
  
**Old Man：**  
Now that you mention it, these rapscallions have prices on their heads.  
If you have money problems, why not turn them in?  
  
**Rin：**  
Really?  
Hmmm... These guys are pretty weak, so I don't think the  
bounty's gonna be that great.  
But it's better than nothing.  
  
**Rin：**  
Who'd have thought those bandits would be worth so much?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I guess it's 'cause they robbed so many people.  
Things'll be a li'l bit more peaceful now.  
  
**Rin：**  
So the cargo was safe, and the old man was happy.  
I'd say we're off to a good start.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
We sure are. But there's still a long way to go.  
I'm sure everyone else is doin' their best too.  
Let's fulfill as many requests as we can!  
  
**Narration：**  
Shiori, who is helping {player} with his mail route,  
is confounded by unexpected circumstances.

**Shiori：**  
I, um, that's...  
Er...  
  
**Young Woman：**  
I heard you're giving away Elizabeth Park milk to the aristocracy.  
Does that mean you won't sell to us anymore?  
  
**Old Woman：**  
And what's this about the ranch hot spring closing down?  
I was really looking forward to seeing Mahiru!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Uh, well, the hot spring was closed down after being seized by the tax  
inspector. As for the milk, all our cows were confiscated, so there must  
be a mistake...  
  
**Young Woman：**  
Thank goodness!  
That makes sense. There's no way Mahiru would do such a thing!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Why do I get bombarded with questions wherever we go...?  
I'm not wearing anything that would identify me as being from  
Elizabeth Park.  
  
**Young Woman：**  
Your friend there was advertising the hot spring.  
Aren't you from Elizabeth Park?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, I get it now.  
Well, I am, but {player} is just kindly helping us  
to gather together the money to pay our overdue taxes.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Oh, my. Why are we just hearing this now?  
If you're in trouble, you should've said something to us.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Huh? Uh, no,  
it's just, we don't want to get other people involved...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
But your friend there's lending you a hand, isn't he?  
Then it's not a problem.  
  
**Young Woman：**  
What she said. Mahiru's the only one who comes all the way out here to peddle her  
wares. Please let us return the favor.

`image display end`  
**Man 2：**  
Uh, we couldn't help overhearing your conversation...  
  
**Man 3：**  
Could you fill us in on the details as well?  
  
**Shiori：**  
...?  
  
**Foreman：**  
You, move this block!  
  
**Lima：**  
Yeah, but where do you want me to move it to?  
  
**Foreman：**  
Don't ask me about every little thing!  
Just do what these other losers are doin'!  
  
**Lima：**  
A-all right!  
...Gosh.  
I'm glad he's not scared of me, but why's he gotta be so mean?  
  
**Man 1：**  
You're in my group. Follow me.  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh, really?  
You're so kind!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Ah, no, I'm... not really...  
  
**Lima：**  
...?  
Oh! Looks like it's time to move!  
Let's go! ♪  
  
**Man 1：**  
I can't believe I sold out such a kindhearted guild.  
An' in the end, I couldn't even protect my own ranch.  
What was the right thing to do...?  
  
**Lima：**  
Come on, the more stone we move, the more money we earn, you know!  
  
**Lima：**  
Now that I think about it,  
this is exactly the same as  
the road to Elizabeth Park...  
Hah, no way!  
  
**Lima：**  
Elizabeth Park was seized, so it's definitely closed.  
  
**Lima：**  
...Huh? Wh-why are we at the ranch?!  
  
**Laborer：**  
Oh, you've arrived.  
Lay out all that stone in the field over there.  
  
**Man 1：**  
...  
  
**Lima：**  
Wh-why? I don't understand what's going on!  
There's still time until the deadline!  
  
**Laborer：**  
That cow just talked!  
  
**Lima：**  
I'm not a cow! I look nothing like a cow!  
But more importantly, why do we have to spread all this stone across  
the ranch?!  
  
**Laborer：**  
D-don't ask me!  
All I know is it's being turned into a health resort for the Council of  
Nobles...  
  
**Lima：**  
H-health resort? Wh-why...? Ah!  
I've gotta tell everyone about this!  
  
**Lima：**  
B-but if I leave my post now, it'll just cause trouble for you...  
  
**Man 1：**  
...Don't worry, I'll cover for ya.  
Hurry up an' go tell your friends.  
  
**Lima：**  
Really?!  
Thank you!  
I'll be back in two shakes of a llama's tail!  
  
**Man 1：**  
I really don't deserve any thanks...  
I ain't nothin' but an absolute coward...
