# What Remains on the Ranch
Mahiru and the others are at a loss when their cattle are seized by the region's new tax inspector for non-payment of taxes. But Mahiru remembers the existence of a hot spring on the ranch and comes up with a plan of action: to open up a ranch spa.
  
## Subtitle: What Remains on the Ranch
  
**Narration：**  
A sad silence permeates Elizabeth Park after every single cow  
has been taken away by the mysterious group.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
M-my beloved cows...  
I don't understand...  
  
**???：**  
I told you, foreclosure.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I mean, jus' why the heck are we bein' foreclosed?  
Sure, the ranch is  
fallin' apart for a number of reasons, an' our management leaves a  
lot to be desired,  
but we ain't in debt or nothin' with nobody...  
  
**???：**  
My, my, my. What strange things you say.  
This lovely little ranch is very deeply in debt, I assure you.  
  
**???：**  
Or at least, the taxes you're supposed to be paying to the country  
aren't being paid.  
  
**Rin：**  
Another crazy appeared...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
An' who might you be...?  
  
**Inspector：**  
I'm the new tax inspector in this region.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I see, so you're new in town.  
No wonder I ain't seen ya before.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ya see, Mr. Inspector.  
It's true that Elizabeth Park's a pretty broke guild, but there ain't no  
way we're skimpin' on our social duties.  
Could there've been a mix-up?  
  
**Inspector：**  
The likes of a mere rancher dares to challenge an aristocrat such as me?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
That ain't my intention...  
  
**Inspector：**  
Of course. I beg your pardon.  
Because there's no way that would be permissible.  
  
**Inspector：**  
However! I am a tolerant man, so I do respond to the doubts of the  
lower classes.  
The issue is how things have been done until now.  
  
**Inspector：**  
Since my appointment, I've been examining my predecessor's work,  
and what a terrible, terrible job he did.  
  
**Inspector：**  
The taxes he was supposed to collect from various guilds simply went  
uncollected, you see.  
Imagine being poor little me, having to run around cleaning up his mess.  
  
**Inspector：**  
Ohhh, by the way, if you can settle your unpaid taxes right now,  
I can return your livestock immediately.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Jus' how much we talkin', exactly?  
  
**Inspector：**  
This document contains the particulars of your arrears.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Lemme see here. Elizabeth Park's overdue taxes add up to...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ten million rupies?! How's that possible?!  
  
**Inspector：**  
Goodness, we have a real problem if that alone shocks you.  
Read the rest of the document.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
The rest of it? There's more...?  
Let's see, what else...?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
\"If ten million rupies is not paid by the due date,  
Elizabeth Park will be demolished...\"  
  
**Shiori：**  
Demolished?  
Does that mean the guild will cease to exist?  
  
**Inspector：**  
If you can prepare the money, then there will be no problems!  
So do your utmost to ensure that outcome.  
  
**Rin：**  
Prepare? How're we supposed to make money when you took all our  
cows?  
  
**Inspector：**  
Is there anything else you could use as collateral?  
  
**Rin：**  
Well...  
probably not...  
  
**Inspector：**  
I'm afraid I'm a rather busy person. Therefore, I must take my leave.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...Hold on a minute!  
  
**Inspector：**  
Hanzo.  
  
**Hanzo：**  
Sir!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wah!  
  
**Rin：**  
What's the big idea?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Are you all right?!  
  
**Inspector：**  
She went to touch me with her filthy hands.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Mahiru isn't dirty at all!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I-it's all right, Shioshio.  
I jus' came back from selling produce, so my hands are a little dirty...  
I do apologize, Mr. Inspector.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I-I jus' wanna get this right...  
If we can produce the money, everythin'll go back to normal?  
  
**Inspector：**  
Of course. I eagerly await the fulfillment of your overdue taxes.  
I'm doing this for the sake of the country, you see.  
  
**Rin：**  
...And he's gone.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Mahiru, are you okay?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hm? S-sure!  
I'm right as rain!  
It all happened so fast, I was jus' taken aback, that's all.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Please rest for a little while.  
Mahiru, you're a little pale...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I can't believe you're telling me that, Shioshio.  
I feel like I've become a fair-skinned beauty.  
  
**Shiori：**  
That's not exactly what I meant...  
Oh, I mean,  
I'm not trying to say that you're not beautiful...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Thanks for worrying about me, Shioshio.  
But there ain't no way I can rest at a time like this.  
I gotta start gatherin' up money fast...  
  
**Rin：**  
Mahy...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm here with a delivery.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rin：**  
Wha?! Man, this is like the worst time my game could arrive!  
Oh, {player}...?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Worst time?  
`Tag 2`  
**Shiori：**  
Well...  
  
**Shiori：**  
And that's what happened.  
So we have to find a way to make lots of money...  
But if our cattle have been confiscated...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
We're in a real tough spot.  
We gotta do somethin' about it, but nothin' comes to mind at all.  
  
**???：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wah! Wh-what the heck?!  
  
**Lima：**  
I'm so sorry I wasn't here when things got difficult!  
  
**Rin：**  
For real. It sure wasn't the time to be napping in the woods.  
  
**Lima：**  
I wasn't napping in the woods!  
Well, I was, but then I was mistaken for a cow and carted off in a big  
wagon...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You were also confiscated...?  
  
**Lima：**  
That's right! I overheard the drivers' conversation, and that's how I  
learned what happened.  
It was really tough running back here on the secluded mountain roads...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ah, so that's why you're covered in mud...  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh? Am I dirty?  
  
**Shiori：**  
N-no, not really...  
Just a little. It's just a tiny bit of mud.  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh my gosh! I'll go hop in the bath...!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Bath...?  
Bath...  
Yes!  
  
**Lima：**  
Even you think so, Mahiru?!  
If I'm that dirty, then I need to get myself clean this instant!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You're always squeaky clean, Limalima!  
That ain't what I meant!  
I jus' remembered that we got a hot spring right here in Elizabeth Park!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Now that you mention it...  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh yeah, I totally forgot.  
Carmina's producer, was it? She's the one who dug it up, right?  
  
**Lima：**  
It's hard to relax in it because it's too luxurious, so we kind of stopped  
using it.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
We can use the hot spring to draw in customers...  
  
Whaddya girls reckon?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Nah, maybe not. I dunno what I'm talkin' about.  
Sorry, I was speakin' without thinkin'.  
I really need to consider this more seriously.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Not at all! I think you're onto something!  
  
**Rin：**  
We haven't got any other ideas, so I like it.  
But even if we have a grand opening today, how're we gonna get  
customers to come all the way into the sticks...?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'll hand out flyers.  
`Tag 3`  
**Lima：**  
If we do that, customers are sure to come!  
  
**Shiori：**  
I want to help {player} with the distribution.  
I'll do my best to promote the ranch!  
  
**Rin：**  
Maybe not, you're too weak, Shiorin.  
I think you better sit this one out.  
  
**Shiori：**  
You're right... I doubt I'd be of any use...  
  
**Rin：**  
I didn't say that.  
I mean, it's best for you to do the things you're good at.  
We need someone to make the flyers, don't we?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, right...!  
If that's the case, I'll make the best flyers you've ever seen.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'll go clear out the old barn. We can use it as a relaxation space for  
customers!  
We need more than just a hot spring!  
  
**Shiori：**  
It might be a good idea to sell souvenirs as well.  
We'll have to think a little about what we can prepare, though.  
  
**Lima：**  
I'll help too!  
Leave any heavy lifting to me! ♪  
  
**Shiori：**  
And... what about you, Rin?  
  
**Rin：**  
Me?  
I'm not gonna do any...  
I'll distribute flyers.  
We can't make {player} do it all on his own, you know.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Rinrin...  
  
**Rin：**  
Aw man! Don't give me that face!  
If the ranch gets closed down, I'll have nowhere to slack off.  
That's all!  
  
**Lima：**  
Yeah, sure.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Tee hee.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Y'all  
are wonderful!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
To get back our cows  
an' protect Elizabeth Park,  
we're gonna  
open up a hot spring!  
  
**All：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Rin：**  
Ah, but first, you should take a bath, Lima.  
  
**Lima：**  
Come on! Don't rub it in!  
  
**Man：**  
I-I did as you said.  
I cooked Elizabeth Park's books.  
S-so you'll write off my guild's debt now as ya promised, right?!  
  
**Man：**  
You'll cancel the demolition of my guild now, won't ya?!  
  
**Inspector：**  
Pardon? I'm a little confused.  
I don't recall ever making such a promise.  
You forged these documents of your own accord.  
Am I wrong?  
  
**Man：**  
...Huh?  
N-no way!  
Then what's gonna happen to my guild?!  
  
**Inspector：**  
Oh, do be quiet.  
...Hanzo.  
  
**Hanzo：**  
Sir.  
  
**Inspector：**  
This fellow appears to be coveting money.  
I hear there's a shortage of workers in the remote mountains.  
Please take him there.  
  
**Inspector：**  
It's tough work, but you can make money doing it.  
How fortunate.  
  
**Man：**  
N-no...!  
I did exactly as I was told...  
  
**Hanzo：**  
Shut it.  
  
**Man：**  
Ngh! Mnnnm...!  
  
**Hanzo：**  
Take him away.  
  
**Ninja：**  
Sir!  
  
**Man：**  
Mmnghh...!  
  
**Inspector：**  
I finally have a monopoly over Elizabeth Park, whose produce is  
rumored to be favored by the nobility.  
The road to success will be  
a very short one indeed. Hahahahahah!  
  
**Narration：**  
As the Elizabeth Park members cheerfully looked ahead, the dastardly  
laughter of the crooked aristocrat echoed throughout the land.
