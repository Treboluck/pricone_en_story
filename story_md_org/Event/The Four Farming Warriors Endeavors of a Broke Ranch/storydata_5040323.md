**Lima：**  
*pant* *pant*...  
Even after all that, he's still standing...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
He's stronger'n we took him for...  
  
**Hanzo：**  
To think you're still alive. I'm surprised.  
Fighting head-on isn't my style, but I'll do it with all my strength  
if I have to.  
  
**Inspector：**  
Oh my god!  
You should've been doing that from the start, you absolute idiot!  
  
**Hanzo：**  
...  
  
**Inspector：**  
Hey! Say something! Don't you dare ignore me!  
Kill them! Put them in the ground this instant!  
  
**Rin：**  
He really has stopped pretending he isn't the villain...  
How totally classless.  
  
**Shiori：**  
It likely means he's out of options.  
We should brace for the worst.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
All this \"kill, kill\" business—jus' what does he think we are?  
He doesn't value life. We gotta make him pay!  
  
**Lima：**  
Right!  
  
There's no way we can just let such a dangerous person walk free!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
We gotta stand firm.  
Let's take 'em down and restore peace to the ranch!
