**Rin：**  
I'm getting pretty good at scaring off mice.  
But I don't get why they're so intent on  
getting their paws on this cheese.  
  
**Rin：**  
There's tons of other stuff to eat aside from cheese.  
No offense to Mahy, but acorns and walnuts  
are much tastier.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hmmm, but come to think of it, I don't think I've ever  
tasted the ranch's cheese before.  
  
**Rin：**  
But this cheese is for our guests, so I can't try it now.  
Hmmm, but that  
peculiar smell that acorns don't have is really stimulating my appetite...  
How do I explain it....? It has a certain richness, like it's the source of life...  
  
**Rin：**  
So cheese is also quite...  
No! No, no, no!  
I prefer acorns!  
Yeah, acorns are definitely much better!  
  
**Mouse：**  
Squeak!  
  
**Rin：**  
Wah! Another mouse!  
But this one's bigger than the others!  
  
**Rin：**  
Do you really want the cheese that bad?  
You've made me even more interested in it, you know.  
  
**Rin：**  
If you don't wanna leave, I'll make you!  
I'm coming for ya!
