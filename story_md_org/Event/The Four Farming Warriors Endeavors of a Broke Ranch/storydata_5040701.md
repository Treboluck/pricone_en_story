# Terrible Tiny Trespassers
Protecting the cheese seems like an easy job as long as there are no mice to defend it from, but unfortunately for Rin, they just keep coming. As a lone cheese guardian, she battles boldly to drive the mice away.

**Narration：**  
On guard alone in the storehouse, Rin squares off against a sudden  
onslaught of mice in order to protect the aged cheese.  
  
**Mouse：**  
Squeak!  
  
**Rin：**  
Ah! You're quick to show yourselves, huh?!  
*sigh*... This job would've been super easy if they'd just stayed away.  
  
**Rin：**  
But I told everyone to leave it to me,  
so I oughtta get rid of these mice.  
Hey! Get outta here! This cheese isn't for rodent consumption!  
  
**Mouse：**  
Squeak!  
Squeaky squeak!  
  
**Rin：**  
Why, you!  
You're persistent, huh?!  
I said go away!  
  
**Mouse：**  
Squeak?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Whew... Finally got rid of 'em.  
Mice are surprisingly stubborn.  
  
**Rin：**  
But I did manage to chase them away,  
so if I just keep it up, the cheese'll stay safe.
