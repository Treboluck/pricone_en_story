# Final Battle of Elizabeth Park
Mahiru and friends fight off the subordinates trying to prevent them from delivering their tax payment. Waiting for them is the inspector, who has been concealing his corrupt practices by deploying armed mercenaries.

**Ninja 1：**  
...  
  
**Ninja 2：**  
H-how could a mere ranching guild get this far...?  
  
**Rin：**  
You know, I feel like we've explained this once already today.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Heheh.  
'Cause for a mere ranchin' guild,we get wrapped up in all sortsa hijinks.  
  
**Ninja 1：**  
W-we must report this to Hanzo at once...  
  
**Ninja 2：**  
We have no choice but to pull back for now. Hah!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Wh-where did they go?!  
  
**Lima：**  
What's going on?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Ah, if they get away, they'll get the drop on us!  
We need to get to the inspector, now!  
  
**Cow：**  
Moo.  
  
**All：**  
...Oh.  
  
**Rin：**  
What about the cows?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
We can't jus' leave 'em here.  
Sorry. It'll be tough, but could y'all come with us?  
  
**Cow：**  
Moo.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, fantastic. You'll follow along.  
Thanks a million.  
Jus' bear with me a little longer. Then I'll let y'all rest as much as ya like.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
All right! Let's go take back what was taken from us!  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh? That man running toward us is...  
  
**Man：**  
Y-you guys! What the heck did ya do?!  
The inspector's at the ranch, an' he's goin' bonkers with rage!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Is he a friend of yours, Limalima?  
  
**Lima：**  
Yeah.  
At the quarry, he was really kind to me.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ohhh, is that right?  
I really appreciate it, pal.  
  
**Man：**  
Y-ya appreciate it...?  
I was jus' makin' up for...  
N-never mind that. Go any farther an' you're gonna get hurt!  
I ain't tellin' no lies! Turn back!  
  
**Rin：**  
Damn, those cronies that got away must've reported us already.  
Well, I expected as much.  
What'll we do, Mahy?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I told you. I'm selfishly havin' y'all see this through to the end with me.  
  
**Rin：**  
I knew you'd say that. Then let's go.  
Man, I never expected I'd end up getting so much use out of this armor.  
  
**Man：**  
H-how can y'all be so carefree at a time like this?  
Them real scary fellas are waitin' for ya...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
'Cause we ain't done nothin' wrong. An' above all else...  
We're all in this together.  
  
**Man：**  
...  
I wonder... if I had friends like that, would I have tried harder?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...?  
  
**Man：**  
I-it's nothin'. I came here to stop ya.  
But if you still wanna go ahead, I'll get outta your way.  
  
**Lima：**  
Thanks for worrying about us.  
But if we're seen together, something terrible might happen to you,  
so you'd best keep your distance.  
  
**Man：**  
Uh, yeah...  
Be careful...  
  
**Ninjas：**  
...  
  
**Rin：**  
Yeah, should've expected the welcoming committee.  
  
**Hanzo：**  
You're not pushovers, are you?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
That's by the by.  
We're jus' here to pay the taxes that are overdue.  
  
**Inspector：**  
Hmph! How shameless.  
I've been told that you hijacked my cows.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ah, Mr. Inspector, there you are. Perfect timing.  
We're here to pay off the remaining balance on Elizabeth Park's debt.  
  
**Inspector：**  
So you plan to feign ignorance until the very end...  
Well then!  
What do you have to say about those cows  
following behind you?!  
  
**Cow：**  
Moo.  
  
**Rin：**  
Haven't you realized? Sure, we took back our cattle before giving you  
the cash, but you didn't respect the due date. You were doing whatever  
you pleased with Mahy's cows.  
  
**Lima：**  
And even now, you're doing anything you want to the ranch.  
  
**Shiori：**  
You just assumed we wouldn't be able to gather the money  
and felt free to do as you like...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
We have your money, as you asked.  
  
**Inspector：**  
Argh, money, money, money! Well done.  
With all your might, you managed to scrape enough together.  
Congratulations.  
  
**Inspector：**  
But what of it?  
With just one command, I can have you all eradicated in an instant.  
  
**Inspector：**  
If you relinquish the ranch along with the livestock and withdraw  
without a word, I'll let you live.  
Even someone as foolish as you  
surely knows the correct course of action.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Nope, ain't got a clue.  
  
**Inspector：**  
Wha—?!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
To begin with, whaddya mean, \"I'll let ya live\"?  
As far as I'm concerned, this ranch, my friends, an' my cows  
are my life!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You confiscated my cows, foreclosed my ranch, an' took my hot spring,  
but I quietly went along with it.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But at some point, this disheartened, spineless coward was uplifted  
by the folks of Elizabeth Park.  
I ain't your doormat no more!  
  
**Inspector：**  
Grrr...!  
When somebody shows you kindness, you shouldn't push your luck!  
  
**Inspector：**  
Hanzo, exterminate these vermin at once!  
Don't leave even a scrap of flesh behind!  
  
**Hanzo：**  
Understood.  
Get them.  
  
**Ninjas：**  
Sir!  
  
**Rin：**  
As if I'd let you.  
  
**Shiori：**  
The punishment for your horrible treatment of Mahiru  
is an arrow to the face!  
  
**Ninja 3：**  
Hmph. Mere farmers don't stand a chance against us!  
  
**Lima：**  
Then just who did those farmers take their cows back from, huh?!  
  
**Hanzo：**  
Hmph. Taking back those cows was your biggest mistake.  
Kill them.  
  
**Ninja 1：**  
Yes, sir!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wha—?  
Don't you lay a finger on my cows!  
  
**Rin：**  
I won't let that happen!  
  
**Ninjas：**  
You shall not pass!  
  
**Rin：**  
Ahhh, come on! Outta my way!  
  
**Lima：**  
Step aside, now!  
  
**Shiori：**  
If you don't, I'll shoot your brains out.  
  
**Ninjas：**  
...!  
  
**Rin：**  
Lima! Shiorin!  
  
**Lima：**  
We'll handle these guys!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Please go and save Mahiru and the cows!  
  
**Rin：**  
Thanks!  
Hold on, Mahy!  
  
**Hanzo：**  
Hahah! Do you really think you alone can protect those cows?  
You really are stupid!  
  
**Ninja 3：**  
Hyah!  
  
**Ninja 4：**  
Take this!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ngh!  
  
**Cow：**  
Moo.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Don't y'all worry. I won't let 'em hurt ya.  
Count on it!  
  
**Hanzo：**  
How long do you expect that bravado of yours to last?  
  
**Rin：**  
Until you're dead!  
  
**Hanzo：**  
...!  
  
**Rin：**  
Tch, he blocked it.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Rinrin!  
  
**Rin：**  
Sorry I took so long!  
Are the cows okay?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Yeah, more or less.  
  
**Hanzo：**  
Are you worried about each and every one of those beasts?  
Why would anyone put their life on the line to protect cattle?  
They're nothing more than a means to make money.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
How many times do I have to tell ya?  
They're my family! I don't need no reason to protect my family!  
  
**Cow：**  
MOOOO!  
  
**Hanzo：**  
What?!  
  
**Ninja 1 & ２：**  
Wh-what the—?!  
  
**Cow：**  
MOOOOOO!  
  
**Shiori：**  
The cows have joined the fray?!  
  
**Lima：**  
Thanks, everyone! ♪  
But don't hurt anybody too much!  
  
**Ninja 1 & ２：**  
...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Lima, be careful.  
There are still some enemies left.  
  
**Lima：**  
Such a small number of enemies  
will be a walkover for you and me. ♪  
  
**Shiori：**  
...!  
You're right, it's child's play!  
  
**Ninja 2：**  
You little—! I'll show you child's play!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Heheh. Told ya the cows are family.  
  
**Rin：**  
I guess they understood how you feel.  
...I oughtta be careful when I slack off in the cow shed.  
  
**Hanzo：**  
Hmph. Those cows are nothing more than a distraction.  
  
**Hanzo：**  
Make an enemy of us and you're finished.  
You'll come to regret your stupidity when I stop your breathing.  
Hrah!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Aaarghhh!  
  
**Rin：**  
Mahy!  
  
**Hanzo：**  
Heh, too slow!  
You're dead now. Haaah!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Nghh...!  
  
**Lima & Shiori：**  
No way!  
Not happening!  
  
**Lima：**  
Here we are!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Sorry we're late!  
  
**Rin：**  
Th-thank yooouuu!  
  
**Hanzo：**  
Filthy animals...  
What did you do to my men...?  
  
**Lima：**  
They're resting on the grass. ♪  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's been a while since I've done security-like work.  
Rin, we're almost done.  
  
**Rin：**  
Yeah, but we've left the scariest baddie 'til last.  
*sigh*... We're not out of the woods yet.  
  
**Inspector：**  
Wh-wha—...?  
Hanzo, the most expensive mercenary I know, was beaten so easily...  
  
**Inspector：**  
I should retreat for now, and come back when I've devised a suitable  
crime to pin on them...  
  
**Lima：**  
Where do you think you're going?  
  
**Inspector：**  
Ah! Aaahhhh!  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey, guess what? We're not dead.  
  
**Shiori：**  
We thought you might have another ace up your sleeve.  
But by the looks of it, you're out of ideas.  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
We received reports of a brawl!  
  
**Inspector：**  
...! I-I'm saved!  
You animals!  
When the royal knights understand what's going on,  
it's you who'll be arrested...  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
For abusing your position as tax inspector in order to defraud  
numerous guilds, I'm placing you under arrest!  
  
**Inspector：**  
...What?  
Wh-what's the meaning of this?! Are you totally blind?!  
  
**Man：**  
...  
  
**Lima：**  
H-huh? You... What are you doing here?  
  
**Man：**  
I'm so incredibly sorry!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wh-what's up with him?!  
Why's he suddenly kneelin' in the dirt?  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
This fellow was blackmailed by the inspector into falsifying Elizabeth  
Park's paperwork. He came to us to confess.  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh?  
S-so that means Elizabeth Park wasn't even behind on its taxes  
in the first place...?  
  
**Man：**  
There was never any debt at all!  
It was jus' a set up by the inspector so he could steal your cows!  
  
**Man：**  
He told me that if I edited those documents, he would write off  
all my guild's debt.  
I... I...  
  
**Man：**  
I never thought it would turn into such a serious matter...  
How... can I apologize...?  
I'm so sorry...I'm truly sorry...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Raise your head.  
  
**Man：**  
...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
All ya did was try'n protect what's important to ya.  
If I was in the same position, I reckon I'd have done the same.  
  
**Man：**  
Ain't no way!  
You an' your friends would never do such a cowardly thing!  
  
I was so weak...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'd be weak if I was alone. In fact, I actually tried to give up at one point.  
But I'm surrounded by friends. That's why I didn't do anythin' silly.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
It's true that you got your hands dirty, so you gotta make amends,  
doncha?  
But once ya do, come back, ya hear? I'll be waitin' with  
some tasty milk, and the hot spring will be open again.  
Yeah?  
  
**Man：**  
...!  
Thank ya! From the bottom of my heart!  
  
**Inspector：**  
Hyaaaah! What are you all doing? This isn't over yet!  
Hanzo, get over here! Hanzo!  
Do something about this situation!  
  
**Rin：**  
...Huh? Those ninja guys disappeared.  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
Ninja guys? You were only ones here when we arrived...  
  
**Inspector：**  
...What?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I guess they abandoned ya, huh?  
I feel for ya...  
  
**Narration：**  
Everyone looked on in pity as the tax inspector was marched away.
