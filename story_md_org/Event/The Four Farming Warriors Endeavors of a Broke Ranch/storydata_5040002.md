# Prepare for Business!
Rin starts distributing flyers to promote the ranch spa, and {player} takes her to the Sarendia Orphanage. There, she learns that Mahiru has been donating Elizabeth Park's produce, which renews Rin's motivation to promote the ranch.
  
## Subtitle: Prepare for Business!
  
**Narration：**  
Several days have passed since Elizabeth Park had its livestock  
confiscated. Everyone at the ranch is working hard.  
  
**Lima：**  
Mahiru! I've brought the wood you said you needed.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Drop it over there, would ya?  
I'll do all the handiwork,  
so you just keep it comin'.  
  
**Lima：**  
Got it! ♪  
  
**Shiori：**  
Mahiru.  
About the hot spring's rest area—I put down on paper what's in my  
imagination, and this is what I came up with. What do you think?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ohhh, beds to lie down on?  
Good idea. Much better'n just settin' out a  
few chairs.  
That's my girl. Ya know exactly how our guests'll feel when  
they come here to recuperate.  
  
**Shiori：**  
This is exactly the type of thing where I can put my experiences to  
good use.  
But if we do decide to build beds, your to-do list will just  
grow longer...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Don't go fussin' over me.  
This foreclosure business is my problem in the first place.  
I'm jus' grateful to have y'all lendin' me a hand...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Mahiru, this is like an unspoken promise.  
We're helping because we want to.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Shioshio...  
Thanks a million!  
Let's build a hot spring that can warm even the coldest of hearts!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Absolutely! I'm sure right now Rin and {player} are  
handing out flyers like there's no tomorrow.  
There's no way they'll give up.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You're right.  
Rinrin's try'n her darndest.  
There ain't no way any of us won't do our best!  
  
**Rin：**  
Man, this sucks.  
Totally sucks.  
Sucks so much it blows.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Don't you wanna hand out flyers?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rin：**  
I will!  
I'll do it.  
But if something sucks, it sucks. Not my rules.  
  
**Rin：**  
Shiorin worked her butt off to make them, so I know I gotta distribute  
them with care. But it's just not my thing, after all.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll do it for you.  
**Choice: (3)**  Let's continue with care.  
`Tag 2`  
**Rin：**  
For real? Awesome, I'll just...  
  
I mean, I'm not *that* useless, you know?  
  
**Rin：**  
If I wanted to force my work on you, I wouldn't have come all this way.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Rin：**  
Yeah, let's.  
Shiorin put so much effort into making them.  
  
**Rin：**  
I'll cherish these flyers forever and ever...  
  
No, I can't do that, can I? What am I saying?  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Rin：**  
*sigh*... I know, I know.  
It feels like I'm being tricked into doing it,  
but I'll do it.  
It's for the best, right?  
  
**Rin：**  
Whatever. Let's go stuff some mailboxes...  
  
**Rin：**  
*sigh*... Man, I'm beat...  
So *this* is what you do for a living...  
I've changed my mind about you a little...  
We've pretty much  
finished giving out flyers, so let's head back to the ranch.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  We're not done yet.  
`Tag 5`  
**Rin：**  
Hey, don't say that.  
We've already been around the whole city.  
Our work here is done. Yeah. We did well.  
  
**Rin：**  
...  
  
**Rin：**  
Awww, come on. I know, I know.  
  
There are people living outside the city too.  
  
**Rin：**  
All right, let's gooo!  
  
**Rin：**  
Uh, what?  
  
**Rin：**  
You know, I was being serious when I said \"let's gooo!\"  
So why'd you bring me to a forest with no signs of life?  
  
**Rin：**  
Until now we've been distributing flyers as we should,  
but there aren't any people in the forest.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  It's a shortcut.  
`Tag 6`  
**Rin：**  
A shortcut? I can't remember there being anything here...  
  
**Rin：**  
What is this place...?  
  
**Girl：**  
Ah, Big Bro!  
Welcome! Have you come to play?  
Or do you need to see Mama Saren about something?  
  
**Rin：**  
Mama Saren...?  
Ah, so this is the Sarendia Orphanage?  
When Elizabeth Park was destroyed, you guys really helped us out.  
  
**Boy：**  
Elizabeth Park?!  
Has Big Sis Mahiru come to see us?!  
  
**Saren：**  
Hey, now, it's dangerous to suddenly run off like that.  
Oh,  it's {player}.  
  
**Saren：**  
Have you come to entrust that child to us?  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh? \"That child\"? Do you mean me? No way!  
I work at Elizabeth Park...  
Well, I say work, but... No, I can say that, can't I?  
  
**Saren：**  
Not sure why you're asking me...  
But come to think of it, some children were relocated there from Caon,  
right?  
  
**Rin：**  
That's right!  
I'm one of them. The name's Rin.  
  
**Saren：**  
Then I presume you've come with our milk delivery.  
We're always so thankful.  
  
**Rin：**  
Milk? Dunno what you're talking about.  
  
**Girl：**  
Big Sis Mahiru always brings us milk!  
It's super delicious!  
I don't usually like dairy,  
but I can always drink Big Sis Mahiru's milk!  
  
**Boy：**  
Hey, isn't Mahiru coming today?  
She said that the next time she comes, she's gonna teach me a super  
funny joke. She promised!  
  
**Rin：**  
Whoa, whoa, how the heck should I know?  
  
**Saren：**  
Listen, you two. Don't cause trouble for other people.  
Sorry about that, it's just that the kids here love Mahiru.  
  
**Rin：**  
Does she come here a lot?  
  
**Saren：**  
Yes, she regularly brings us milk and cheese.  
It's an expression of gratitude for helping to rebuild the ranch,  
or so she says.  
  
**Saren：**  
We have a lot of growing children with big appetites, so it really is a  
blessing.  
But as I understand it, Elizabeth Park has problems of its own.  
So I refuse Mahiru's generosity every time, but she always insists.  
  
**Rin：**  
Yeah, that sounds like Mahy all right.  
But... sorry. We can no longer afford to bring you milk.  
  
**Saren：**  
...I knew she was overdoing herself with those gifts.  
  
**Rin：**  
Ah, well, it's true that our operations are in a great deal of trouble,  
but I'm sure Mahy still wants to deliver your milk.  
  
**Rin：**  
But that's not easy when you've got no cows to get milk from...  
  
**Saren：**  
No cows? What do you mean?  
  
**Rin：**  
Well...  
  
**Saren：**  
Gosh, is that what happened?  
  
**Rin：**  
So we've decided to open a hot spring.  
  
**Saren：**  
I don't quite get why that would lead to you opening a hot spring...  
But I'm glad it's there.  
  
**Saren：**  
I guess even Christina's actions  
sometimes have positive results.  
  
**Rin：**  
I'm sorry that we can't bring you milk anymore,  
but we'd appreciate it if you'd come take a dip.  
Mahy sure would be thrilled to see the kids pay a visit.  
  
**Boy：**  
We can go to Big Sis Mahiru's ranch?!  
I wanna go, I wanna go!  
  
**Girl：**  
I wanna go too!  
  
**Saren：**  
You've gotten the children all excited,  
so I can't refuse now.  
  
**Rin：**  
Thanks.  
Well, we've still got a ton of flyers left, so we should probably get back  
to work.  
  
**Saren：**  
Please give my regards to Mahiru.  
You've got a lot of work ahead of you...  
so good luck.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey, you.  
By any chance, did you take me to the orphanage to make me more  
motivated...?  
  
**Choice: (10)**  You weren't motivated?  
**Choice: (11)**  Dunno what you're talking about.  
`Tag 10`  
**Rin：**  
Why would you say that? It's not that I *don't* have motivation.  
It just takes  
a while for me to get into the swing of things.  
  
**Rin：**  
I mean, you won't try to motivate me like that again, will you?  
I'm already motivated enough, so don't bother.  
But thanks.

`Tag 11`  
**Rin：**  
Your deception game leaves a lot to be desired.  
Whatever. Let's just say we went there by chance.  
  
`Tag 12`  
**Rin：**  
*sigh*... It's your fault that I'm putting in this much effort.  
Speaking of, let's head back to the city.  
I have an idea.  
  
**Choice: (13)**  Whatever it is, let's do it.  
`Tag 13`  
**Rin：**  
You would say that.  
*sigh* But all this work really isn't my cup of tea.  
  
**Rin：**  
Everyone's favorite dairy farm, Elizabeth Park,  
is holding a grand opening event for a new spa!  
A natural hot spring, right at the source!  
  
**Rin：**  
Is the grind of daily life wearing you down?  
Elizabeth Park, blessed with the glory of nature,  
is waiting to heal your soul!  
  
**Rin：**  
Hm? What? Don't look too surprised, now.  
Can't believe I'm such a smooth talker?  
  
**Rin：**  
All the way back into town, I was trying to figure out how we can  
advertise more effectively.  
We can't just hand out flyers without saying anything.  
  
**Rin：**  
Come on, I'm doing all the work here.  
Get your butt in gear.  
Look, I'm working, so you should too.  
  
**Rin：**  
Everyone's favorite dairy farm, Elizabeth Park,  
is holding a grand opening event for a new spa!  
A natural hot spring, right at the source!  
  
**Ninja：**  
...  
  
**Rin：**  
Man, it's already late.  
Everyone must be worried.  
  
**Rin：**  
Or maybe not. I bet they all just think I'm slacking off.  
  
**Choice: (15)**  I bet they don't.  
`Tag 15`  
**Rin：**  
I don't need your encouragement.  
I know myself better than anyone else.  
  
**Rin：**  
Well, I should make up for what they've let me get away with  
not doing until now.  
  
**Rin：**  
Whoa, look at that!  
It really looks like a hot spring!  
  
**Lima：**  
Rin!  
Welcome home!  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's so late, we've been worried sick.  
  
**Rin：**  
There's no need for any of that.  
I've been hard at work drumming up interest in the ranch, you know.  
  
**Shiori：**  
...? That's not what we were worried about.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I appreciate ya workin' so late.  
Ya must be tuckered out. We cleaned up the hot spring mighty nice,  
so get yourself in there and have a good rest.  
  
**Choice: (17)**  ...See?  
`Tag 17`  
**Rin：**  
Don't look so smug.  
...But you were right.  
I'm a member of this guild too, after all.  
Even I must put some effort in from time to time.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm a bit lost.  
  
**Rin：**  
Don't worry about it.  
  
**Lima：**  
Come on.  
Rin, is that a smirk I see?  
Did something good happen?  
  
**Rin：**  
Honestly, forget about it.  
Besides, we have to stay focused until the hot spring's finished.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
We sure do. But I ain't got no doubt it'll all end well,  
  
'cause you're try'n your darndest to help. I can't not believe.  
  
**Narration：**  
The members of Elizabeth Park looked towards the sky  
as if saying a silent prayer to the stars.
