## Subtitle: I Won't Lose!
  
**Mahiru：**  
The power of Elizabeth Park—  
all you can eat! Bon appétit!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
We can fight much better'n I thought.  
Callin' ourselves a ranchin' guild must seem like a lie.  
But takin' care of my cows is more my thing.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
For the sake of returnin' peace to the ranch, I gotta keep whoopin' hide!  
I won't lose!
