## Subtitle: The Vacation of Our Dreams!
  
**Narration：**  
Lucent Academy is a few weeks off from the start of summer holidays.  
With everyone excited at the prospect,  
the classroom is buzzing with chat about everyone's plans.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Sheesh. What a bunch of children.  
Summer holidays are still half a month away,  
but they're already getting ahead of themselves.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hey hey, Misaki.  
You got any plans for the summer holidays?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Me?  
Well, um...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Sounds like a no to me!  
You're coming with me, girl!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Wh-what?!  
Don't go deciding stuff without my permission!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Actually.  
What's this even about?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh, right.  
Y'see...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I got picked to be the poster girl for an upcoming event!  
It's taking place pretty far from Landosol.  
On an island, even!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Nice!  
That's awesome!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Ehehe. Thanks!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I've got some time off after that,  
so I figured I'd hang around and have some fun there!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
And hey, it's no fun without friends, right?  
I hear the beach there's mega pretty, too.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Huh?!  
That's straight up a vacation!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Yup! That's why I hit you up.  
Kinda sounds like you've already got plans, though?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Huh?!  
Err...  
L-let me check my schedule.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hm... Let's see.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Oh, what a coincidence! I just happen to be free then!  
And only then, too.  
It'd be a waste not to go, so count me in!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
For serious?  
Hellaaa! Thanks!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Never know when a job this big'll come up next,  
so I wanted you to see me strut my stuff up close!  
That, plus going on vacation with friends is hype, right?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh hey, it's whiz-boy!  
Whattup!  
My dude here with the perfect timing as always.  
You're in too, right?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's this about?  
**Choice: (2)**  For sure!  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh?! Weren't you listening?  
Vacation time! We're hitting up an island!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Doubt you've got any plans either, so let's go!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzuna：**  
Wait.  
I never told you what the script was, did I?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
But you still know what's going down.  
Now that's my whiz-boy!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Suzuna：**  
This summer's gonna be wild!  
  
**Io：**  
Oh?  
Making plans for the summer holidays, are we?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Suzuna's got an event lined up on an island!  
We're going with her to cheer her on,  
then turning it into a vacation once she's done!  
  
**Io：**  
Wow, that's incredible.  
Congratulations!  
You never fail to impress, Suzuna.  
  
**Io：**  
That does sound fun, though.  
Would it be wrong to ask if I can go?  
Then again, I guess it would be awkward for your teacher to tag along.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
No way!  
It'd be awesome if you came along!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Yup! The more the merrier, as they say.  
Oh. But I don't want to hear any talk about studying and stuff, okay?  
  
**Io：**  
Heehee. I'll try to be careful.  
Now I'm really excited, though.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I always get a bit nervous when I'm on set for the first time,  
but having you guys around should make it way more fun!  
  
**Narration：**  
With the prospect of an exciting summer holiday in sight,  
Suzuna and co. power through the rest of the day's classes.
