# Summer’s Just Getting Started
Everyone's prayers successfully awaken the Great Shine God, returning the island's weather to normal. Pleased to see the two spirits reunite, Suzuna takes Misaki and Io up on stage with her to kick the event off for real.
  
## Subtitle: Summer’s Just Getting Started
  
**Narration：**  
Everyone's prayers successfully awaken the Great Shine God.  
With clear skies over the beach, the Great Rain God also returns to its former self.  
  
**???：**  
...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Is that what I think it is?  
  
**Rainy：**  
Shiny!  
  
**Shiny：**  
...!  
Good morning!  
  
**Rainy：**  
Shiny, Shiny!  
I wanted to see you so much!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Woo!  
We managed to wake Shiny up!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Heh. That couldn't have been any easier!  
  
**Io：**  
Well done, everyone.  
You all get top marks for your efforts!  
  
**Shiny：**  
What are you so excited about?  
My head's still kind of fuzzy...  
Did I end up sleeping in this year?  
  
**Shiny：**  
Also, what do you mean when you keep saying Shiny?  
  
**Rainy：**  
Hehehe.  
It's a nickname Suzuna came up with!  
She's one of my new human friends.  
  
**Rainy：**  
She said that friends should use nicknames.  
Mine is Rainy!  
  
**Shiny：**  
Wow!  
Are you Suzuna?  
Thta's some good thinking, especially for a human!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Ahaha!  
Ain't no thang.  
  
**Elder：**  
Um, Great Rain God...  
Or should I say, Rainy. Shiny.  
I'm so terribly sorry for what occurred!  
  
**Shiny：**  
...?  
  
**Io：**  
Shiny was sleeping this whole time,  
so I guess it doesn't know that Rainy woke up first.  
  
**Elder：**  
Regardless. We've come to realize just how selfish we were.  
We swear this will never happen again,  
so please forgive us...  
  
**Rainy：**  
It's okay. I'm not angry.  
I finally got to see Shiny, plus I have a new friend.  
Right, Suzuna?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Yup!  
If we're buds, then we gotta hang out together!  
  
**Rainy：**  
Yeah! Leave the weather to us.  
Shiny!  
  
**Shiny：**  
I'm still don't get what's going on, but sure!  
Let's play, Suzuna!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Then let's not waste any time—  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hold up!  
You might want to leave that for when you're on stage.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
...Oh! I totally forgot!  
I've still got work left!  
  
**Misaki：**  
You do. And we're here to cheer you on,  
so don't go forgetting like that!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Roger!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Whoa?!  
Why're you pulling me along?!  
  
**Io：**  
Eeek?  
Me as well?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Don't sweat the deets!  
Let's get on that stage!

**Suzuna：**  
Whattup, peeps!  
Sorry for the wait!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Are you all okay after that?  
We went for a wild approach,  
but I hope you all had fun!  
  
**Female Tourist：**  
Woo! Suzuna!  
  
**Male Tourist：**  
Took me by surprise at first, but it was fun!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Glad to hear it!  
It won't rain again any time soon,  
so let's go all out!  
  
**Misaki：**  
This is the scenery that Suzuna always sees when she's on stage?  
  
**Io：**  
This is quite something...  
Entirely different from standing at the front of class.  
  
**Male Tourist：**  
Who're the people beside her?  
That lady's way sexy!  
  
**Female Tourist：**  
The other girl with her is so, so cute!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hey there! I can hear you!  
Quit being rude!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I'm standing here right now thanks to all of you.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
That's why I wanted to get you all involved.

**Misaki：**  
Suzuna!  
  
**Io：**  
That's one incredible memory made right off the bat.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I'm more than ready to have fun!  
So let's get this summer rolling!  
Come on, everyone!  
  
**Suzuna & Misaki & Io：**  
One, two, three!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus the three of them signalled the start of summer on the island.  
  
**Narration：**  
Two spirits, perched on a rainbow above the beach,  
watched gleefully as the people below them  
enjoyed said summer to its full extent.
