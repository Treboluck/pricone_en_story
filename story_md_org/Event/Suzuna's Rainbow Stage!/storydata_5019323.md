**Misaki：**  
That's the crystal destroyed!  
We shouldn't have to deal with that rain anymore!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Just wait, Rainy.  
You'll get to see Shiny in no time!  
  
**Rainy：**  
I'm sorry...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh? This voice...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Is this Rainy's feelings coming through?  
  
**Rainy：**  
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...  
  
**Rainy：**  
I didn't mean it.  
I didn't want to fight.  
But Shiny won't forgive me.  
  
**Rainy：**  
I'm so lonely...  
I want to play with Shiny again...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Rainy must have been scared to see Shiny again.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Being alone after an argument really is depressing.  
That barrier and crystal represented those feelings.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Well. We're pros at making up,  
so we gotta show it how it's done!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Suzuna...  
Yeah, you're right!  
One little argument won't get in the way of real friendship!  
We need to prove that!
