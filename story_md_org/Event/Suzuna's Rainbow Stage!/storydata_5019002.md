# Rainy with a Chance of Fighting
Upon hearing the reasoning behind the island's sudden downpours, they they also learn that the event itself might be cancelled as a result. Misaki attempts to cheer Suzuna up, but that in turn leads to an argument between the two of them.
  
## Subtitle: Rainy with a Chance of Fighting
  
**Narration：**  
Having been forced to go to the guildhouse due to the  
sudden downpour, the party question one of the island  
residents regarding the Great Rain God.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
You're telling me tomorrow's event is gonna get called off?!  
That's hella lame!  
  
**Io：**  
Calm down, Suzuna.  
He only said that it's possible.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
But, but!  
That means it could still happen!  
  
**Misaki：**  
The elder seemed more than up for it,  
so I doubt a little bit of rain will make much of a difference.  
  
**Assistant：**  
That's the plan for now, yes.  
Especially when Suzuna's came all this way for us.  
On a personal level, we're also simply looking forward to it.  
  
**Assistant：**  
That said, we'd also hate for any accidents to occur.  
Not just with Suzuna, but all of our visitors as well.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I mean, yeah, but...  
  
**Io：**  
You mentioned this was because of the Great Rain God.  
Could you explain that a bit further?  
  
**Assistant：**  
Erm. The Great Rain God has long since controlled this island's weather.  
Technically it's a spirit of sorts, but the blessings it  
provides for the island lead the inhabitans to rever it as a deity.  
  
**Assistant：**  
We hold a ritual at the beginning of each spring, where it awakens.  
In turn, it blesses us with weather that allows for great produce.  
In other words, we owe our lives here to it.  
  
**Assistant：**  
Once it oversees the successful produce, it enters  
its slumber once more at the end of summer,  
which lasts until the following year's spring.  
  
**Misaki：**  
W-well then.  
  
**Assistant：**  
Things have been different this year, however.  
We carried out the ritual as normal,  
yet the weather has been incredibly unstable.  
  
**Assistant：**  
Frequent rain reduces our tourist rate, putting the island in a bad spot.  
This is why we called for you in the first place, Suzuna.  
We need you and this event to succeed!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I-I think I totally get it.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  But do you [i]totally[/i] get it?  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzuna：**  
S-sure thing!  
No problemo!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Right?  
I understood it all as well.  
Super easy stuff.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Sorry, I lied.  
I only got about half of it...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Actually, that's another lie.  
I don't think I got it at all.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
But wow! You got all of that, Misaki?  
Talk about a turbo genius!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Argh! I didn't get any of it!  
  
**Misaki：**  
That said, it's not like it's raining all the time, right?  
We can just go have fun whenever the sun's out. Not a problem.  
  
**Assistant：**  
That would be ideal.  
It's just, the rain grows more fierce as the days go by—  
  
**Assistant：**  
Just look.  
We experience sudden downpours, then it clears up again.  
Much like what happened earlier.  
  
**Assistant：**  
The event itself isn't the only thing in peril due to it.  
We might need to close the beach off to avoid any accidents.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Um...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Which means...  
  
**Io：**  
Basically...  
  
**Suzuna & Misaki & Io：**  
We can't have fun at the beach?!  
  
**Assistant：**  
Indeed...  
  
**Misaki：**  
No way...  
  
**Assistant：**  
The village elder said that we would proceed with the event  
even if the weather is a bit unstable, but when you take the risks into consideration...  
  
**Assistant：**  
Oh. I'm terrible sorry!  
You must be exhausted after the long journey,  
yet here I am going on and on.  
  
**Assistant：**  
Either way. Let's make tomorrow's event a success!  
All of the residents are expecting great things from you!  
Now then, if you'll excuse me!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Man, this can't be real.  
You guys even made the effort to come along,  
but now that might go to waste.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Alas.  
There's little we can do when the weather's involved, though.  
  
**Misaki：**  
I was looking forward to you strutting your stuff,  
but there's always another opportunity next year.  
  
**Misaki：**  
I'll be there with you then, too.  
Assuming I don't have plans, of course.  
  
**Misaki：**  
If you can get another beach-related job, then even better.  
I'll cheer you on extra hard!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
That's no good, Misaki!  
  
**Misaki：**  
How come?  
You'll be able to pull it off, easy.  
I know that for a fact!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
That's not the point.  
Doing this event on this island is what's important.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Who even knows what'll happen next year, too.  
Tomorrow's already unclear as it is.  
  
**Misaki：**  
But you can't fight the weather, Suzuna.  
Realistically speaking, this is already out of our hands.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
That sort of talk isn't gonna convince me!  
I don't wanna just give up without doing anything!  
  
**Io：**  
S-Suzuna?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Wh-what's with you?  
Why're you taking this out on me?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Besdies, our summer holidays've only just started.  
It sucks that we can't do anything here,  
but we're better off heading back to Landosol now.  
  
**Io：**  
N-now now,  
you too.  
Let's calm down, shall we?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
That's a horrible thing to say, Misaki.  
Think about all the people involved in tomorrow's event.  
You saw that stage at the beach, didn't you?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Do you even get how much time and effort went into that?  
Events don't just happen themselves.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hmph. Don't treat me like an idiot.  
Of course I realize that.  
  
**Misaki：**  
But you also heard what that villager had to say, right?  
We can't just control the weather willy-nilly  
and make everything all okay again.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I get that. I do.  
But...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Who's to say that we'll get to spend time together again  
like this next year?!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
You don't even get how much I was looking forward to this!  
And you still call yourself my friend?!  
  
**Misaki：**  
E-excuse me?!  
  
**Io：**  
S-Suzuna!  
  
**Narration：**  
Suzuna fled the guildhouse,  
leaving Misaki and Io behind.
