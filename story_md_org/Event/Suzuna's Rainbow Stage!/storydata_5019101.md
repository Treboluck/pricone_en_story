# Suzuna's Rainbow Stage! Preview
The next story takes place on a tropical island mired with endless rain. Yet no cloud, no squall can compare to the beautiful rainbow known as friendship! This vacation will be one to remember!
  
**Suzuna：**  
Woohoo! This weather rules!  
It's like, totally perfect for the beach!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I'm gonna knock tomorrow's event out the park,  
then we can go wild after that!  
  
**Misaki：**  
The stage itself is so fancy!  
It's making me feel a bit nervous,  
and I'm not even part of the event.  
  
**Io：**  
There'll be plenty of other fans as well,  
so we'll pour our hearts into cheering you on.  
Give it your best shot, Suzuna!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Cheers, cheers! Gimme all you got!  
I'm feeling more hype than ever now!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
So yeah.  
A crazy wild vacation makes for crazy wild memories.  
And I'm all down for that.
