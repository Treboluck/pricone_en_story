## Subtitle: Passion Is the Key
  
**Narration：**  
Io and {player} are left  
trying to calm Misaki down after Suzuna flees the guildhouse.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Grrrrrr!  
  
**Io：**  
Don't puff your face up like that, Misaki.  
You're putting your good looks to waste.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Argh! Quit treating me like a kid, Io!  
Suzuna did the same, too!  
I can't believe she thinks I'm just some clueless child!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Especially after her attitude just there, too...  
She didn't have to go that far.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Grr....  
  
**Io：**  
I'm not fond of putting the blame on others, if I'm being honest.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Oh, so you're taking her side?  
  
**Io：**  
Think about it this.  
Everyone has something they don't want to be told.  
  
**Io：**  
Of course, none of us believe that you did it on purpise.  
Not me, not Suzuna, not {player}.  
So don't fret over there.  
  
**Io：**  
Also, I'm on both of your sides.  
That's what it means to be a teacher.  
  
**Io：**  
So why don't you be a little more honest, Misaki?  
That should help you understand how Suzuna feels.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hm...  
Suzuna's feelings...  
  
**Misaki：**  
U-urgh...  
I really did upset her, didn't I?  
  
**Misaki：**  
I didn't want to, though.  
I wanted to cheer her up!  
  
**Misaki：**  
What am I gonna do?  
What if she hates me now?  
What if she never wants to be my friend again?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Don't cry.  
**Choice: (2)**  Pat her head.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misaki：**  
I-I'm not crying!  
You're just making me feel worse...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hey! Don't give me the child treatment!  
You don't know how to cheer a proper lady up, do you?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Misaki：**  
Eeek?!  
What's with you all of a sudden?!  
I can't believe you're trying to take advantage of me  
while I'm upset! What a horrible man you are!  
  
**Misaki：**  
You best remember, though!  
Proper ladies won't fall for that!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Misaki：**  
Goof grief!  
I can't even focus properly thanks to you!  
I'm at my wits end as it is with Suzuna!  
  
**Io：**  
Hehe.  
Looks like she's cheered up a little bit.  
Thank you, {player}.  
  
**Misaki：**  
That said. Why did she invite us this time, anyway?  
She even arranged plans and stuff for us, too.  
  
**Misaki：**  
And then I went and upset her...  
I'm no proper lady, am I?  
  
**Io：**  
As far as I can tell,  
you're not to blame for the way she acted.  
  
**Misaki：**  
R-really?  
  
**Io：**  
Really. That's how I feel, at least.  
Just think about how excited she was when she invited us.  
  
**Io：**  
There has to be something else on her mind.  
So don't feel so down, Misaki.  
  
**Misaki：**  
If you say so...  
What else could be on her mind, though?  
  
**Io：**  
I'm not too familiar with model work, myself,  
but she might feel there's a reason she absolutely has to do this event?  
  
**Io：**  
Hm...  
Oh, right!  
How about we ask her fans?  
They might know more about the event itself.  
  
**Misaki：**  
That's a good idea.  
We might just hear something important!  
  
**Io：**  
Let's get going, then!  
...  
Oh! Whoa!  
  
**???：**  
Waaah!  
  
**Resident：**  
I-I'm so sorry!  
I couldn't hold back the urge to talk to Suzuna, so I came along!  
  
**Io：**  
Oh. You're one of her fans, aren't you?  
  
**Resident：**  
I am.  
...  
Huh? Is she not here?  
  
**Io：**  
Perfect timing.  
There's something we'd like to ask in regards to her.  
  
**Io：**  
—Is the general gist of it.  
You wouldn't happen to have any ideas, would you?  
  
**Resident：**  
Oh... I see. So you heard about this island's weather, did you?  
We're not sure why this happened ourselves.  
I'm sorry, especially after you made the effort to come all this way.  
  
**Misaki：**  
You can say that again.  
We were this close to kicking off an incredible summer.  
  
**Io：**  
We want to cheer Suzuna on as much as we can.  
  
**Resident：**  
Just like us!  
  
**Resident：**  
This island is pretty far out from Landosol,  
so me and the other girls have always looked up  
to the models who work there.  
  
**Resident：**  
The village elder asked us for suggestions,  
so naturally Suzuna was the first person that  
came to mind for us!  
  
**Resident：**  
So when we sent the offer out, we included  
a letter telling Suzuna how much we love and respect her!  
  

---  
  
**Suzuna：**  
For real?! Count me in!  
No way I'm missing that!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
That island's like, giga far from Landosol, right?  
I can't believe I've got fans that far out!  
I'm so happy to hear that!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I gotta go hard on this! Real hard!  
This'll be an epic event to remember!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh yeah!  
While we're at it, can I invite my friends?  
They'll help hype things up!  
Thanks for the inivte, catch you soon!  
  

---  
  
**Resident：**  
—That's what she said!  
All the girls on the island went wild after seeing that, you know?  
It made it obvious how much she cares about us all.  
  
**Resident：**  
She's more than just the looks.  
Her personality's god-tier as well!  
  
**Misaki：**  
So that's how she felt while approaching this event...  
She could have just told us.  
  
**Misaki：**  
But I'm still the one who went on about  
doing something next year, like it's no big deal...  
  
**Io：**  
I'm sure she was too shy to actually say it.  
  
**Misaki：**  
How come?  
  
**Io：**  
Though the two of you might be friends,  
you become part of the audience once she's on stage.  
  
**Io：**  
This is work to her, all things considered.  
And there's no doubt she wanted you to enjoy yourself.  
That's probably why she kept quiet.  
  
**Misaki：**  
S-Suzuna!  
Don't be so reserved around friends!  
Especially when you're not used to it in the first place!  
  
**Misaki：**  
That said.  
It's what a proper lady would do.  
  
**Misaki：**  
And a proper lady I am, too.  
There has to be something I can do for her.  
  
**Resident：**  
Ahaha.  
The two of you really are besties, aren't you?  
  
**Misaki：**  
I-I don't know if I'd put it that way...  
  
**Misaki：**  
We both go to the same school,  
but she does her model work on the side. And she's even  
popular enough to get invited out here by her fans. That's incredible.  
  
**Misaki：**  
But that's a secret, okay?  
Don't tell her I said that.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Ideally there would be something I could do to help, though.  
  
**Resident：**  
I've got just the thing!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Huh? Really?  
  
**Resident：**  
There's a gift I had in mind for her tomorrow.  
But after hearing all that, I'm sure she'd be way happier if it came from you.  
  
**Misaki：**  
What were you planning?  
I'll do anything for her!  
  
**Resident：**  
...So? How does that sound?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Fantastic!  
Let's get started on it right away!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Can you go find Suzuna, {player}?  
I'll get things ready in the meantime!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Io, you help me out!  
  
**Io：**  
Okay!  
Good to see that you're back to your usual self, though.  
  
**Io：**  
Okay, {player}.  
We'll leave Suzuna to you.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
*sigh*  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I might have gotten a bit too hot-headed there.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I brought them here so would could make some good memories.  
Getting into a dumb argument like that is a waste.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
*sigh*  
  
**Suzuna：**  
More rain?  
Totally killing my mood here, man.  
Tomorrow's event might actually be called off at this rate.  
  
**???：**  
*sob*  
  
**Suzuna：**  
...?  
Is someone crying?  
I'm the one that wants to cry, you know!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Wait. What if it's Misaki?  
Did she chase after me in tears?!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Misaki! I didn't mean to—  
  
**Suzuna：**  
?!  
  
**???：**  
...  
  
**Narration：**  
Today, Suzuna came across a being she had never bore witness to before.
