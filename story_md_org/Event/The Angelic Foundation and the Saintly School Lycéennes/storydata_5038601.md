# Who's to Blame?
As Friendbot X goes berserk, Akino checks with the other Foundation members whether they followed the blueprints properly. But due to their guilty consciences, they all give only the vaguest of answers.
  
## Subtitle: Who's to Blame?
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Stop! Stop right there, Friendbot X!  
It's not accepting my inputs... It's gone completely berserk!  
  
**Akino：**  
But the blueprints were perfect! What went wrong?  
You did all follow them carefully, didn't you?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
N... nyaturally!  
 It's just... you knyow!  
Even with the same blueprints, everyone has their own interpretation!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
This isn't because of *that,* is it?  
 N-nyo, it couldn't be!  
The other thing, then...? Nyo, it attached properly in the end.  
Don't tell me it's *that?!*  
 But that's the most important feature!  
  
**Akino：**  
Is something wrong, Tamaki?!  
Your eyes are shifting back and forth as fast as lightning!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
N-now, now, Akino!  
Who cares about some silly blueprints, anyway?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
They don't know, do they?  
 No, I'm sure they can't!  
I took care to act while nobody was looking!  
But I didn't think it would go berserk...!  
  
**Akino：**  
How very strange.  
That doesn't sound like you at all, Mifuyu.  
Usually you're so attentive to details...  
 Isn't she, Yukari?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Huh?  
 O-oh, ah... yes, that's true.  
But you know, everybody gets a little careless sometimes...!  
  
**Yukari：**  
It's not my fault... is it?  
 I don't recall anything.  
Right. I don't have any memory of this at all,  
so how could I possibly be to blame?!  
  
**Akino：**  
You all seem to be acting rather strangely...  
But there's no time to worry about that!  
We must work together to defeat Friendbot X!
