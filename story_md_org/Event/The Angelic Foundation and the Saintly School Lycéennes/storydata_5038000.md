# An Exercise in Enterprise
The three members of St. Theresa's Academy (Friendship Club) attend a whole-school assembly announcing a new special course in entrepreneurship. At first they are uninterested, but the Head of Academic Affairs signs them up whether they like it or not.
  
## Subtitle: An Exercise in Enterprise
  
**Narration：**  
The sun shines down on the prestigious St. Theresa's Academy for Girls.  
This fine morning, the entire student body is gathered outside  
on the school grounds for a special assembly.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ueghh... Major yawn.  
  
**Chloe：**  
I'm awake...  
But after yesterday's late shift,  
I'm running on like zero hours of sleep...  
  
**Student 1：**  
My, would you look at that?  
Miss Chloe seems almost ready to retire to bed!  
  
**Student 2：**  
As expected of our resident delinquent.  
Whatever could she have been doing in the dead of night?  
  
**Student 1：**  
Such an unknowable enigma...  
  
**Student 2：**  
Such a formidable rebel...  
  
**Student 1：**  
She sets my heart aflutter...  
  
**Student 2：**  
She's mega-bae to the max...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Wait, what is this.  
Why's nobody standing within five feet of me?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Like, not that I care or anything...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pff... Morning assemblies are a drag.  
  
**???：**  
Aren't they just~?  
  
**Chieru：**  
I'm sure it'll be a lecture about politeness standards  
or telling us to avoid unladylike behavior.  
Not even a teensy bit relevant to a model student like me!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Think that lecture's not for you?  
Girl, it's got your mugshot on the first slide.  
Labeled \"Wanted: Dead or Alive.\"  
  
**Chloe：**  
But hold up.  
Why's a first-year like you standing in this section?  
Aren't you getting about a year ahead of yourself?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, I just spotted a lonely hole  
gaping in the middle of the second-year crowd,  
and I was like, \"I know who that'll be!\"  
 so I dashed over to say hi!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Aren't you the world's luckiest girl  
to have a faithful pupper like me to dote on?!  
Cheru~n! ☆  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh-huh.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Two syllables! AKA: the cold shoulder!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Um, hold the phone. Could you be any icier?  
Today I've got the toasty pupper energy to handle it,  
but if I wasn't wrapped up in cozy fur, I'd be catching frostbite!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Please shut up. You need a word limit.  
Ain't nobody got the energy for weird metaphors  
first thing in the morning.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, Chloe... Have you heard of social contact?  
Do you need me to take a pastel paintbrush to your gray and empty life?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, sorry. I'm a take-the-meat-and-skip-the-parsley girl.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hey, Chillerella. If you don't warm up a few degrees,  
I'll twirl your cute 'n' adorable pigtails 'round my fingers  
and rip 'em both clean off your head.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh? This a fight?  
You want a fight? If you do, let's take this outside.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Let's not be hasty, young Chieru.  
Restrain your ire and observe young Chloe's body language.  
Do you see? She has raised her hands to touch the hair beside her face.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh? What's your point?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. A subconscious reaction, perhaps. Still, from a psychoanalytical  
perspective, this motion surely suggests a measure of elation  
at the compliment her delightful locks were just paid.  
  
**Yuni：**  
In the terms of the layfolk, she seems flattered.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Cutie-patootie!  
Bashful Chloe's off the cuteness charts!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Wha... As if!  
I'm just defending 'em from this hair-tearing lunatic!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ooh! The sheepish side glance!  
Didja see that, Yuni? The mega-cutie-in-cool-girl's-clothing move?!  
Who pulls off a high-level tech like that without trying?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
I'm at a loss.  
Young Chloe, your artifices never cease to astound.  
  
**Yuni：**  
From what I am told, the masses are so taken with such artless wiles  
that they have invented novel terms such as \"tsundere\" to describe them.  
If you ask me, a plain, time-tested word should suffice.  
 You temptress.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Young Jezebel. I mean, young Chloe. Please value yourself a little more.  
This cheap coquetry serves only to squander your hard-boiled integrity.  
Do you see? Then relinquish these vices and teach me how they are done.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, listen. I'm glad you two are having the time of your lives and stuff.  
But can you quit dissecting my character flaws  
while I'm standing in front of you.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Be silent, superego.  
It's your id with which we have business today.  
Your flimsy denials have no place in this discussion.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yeah, Supes!  
What would you know about our friend Chloe, anyway?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Whoa, getting kinda scared now!  
Why's my spiritual identity getting denied before breakfast.  
Can't we course-correct this convo to boring crap like the weather?  
  
**Chloe：**  
And, uh, did I miss the reason why the doc's popped up here?  
Don't you two have, like, your own classes to stand with?  
What are you, outcasts? Are we the Friendship Club or the Reject Club?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're all such great friends!  
`Tag 1`  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, not {player} too...  
Don't just emerge from the ether and spout that sappy stuff.  
Try asking permission first. Like, \"Mind if I be a total chump?\"  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh! {player}!  
 Chelly morning~! ☆  
If you're here, does that mean you're a class reject too?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Young Chieru. Do not mock the lad.  
He's a transfer student from Lucent Academy and our school's only male.  
We can't expect him to feel at home in a garden of feminine mysteries.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? Since when does he care about all that stuff?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I just came 'cause I saw you guys together.  
`Tag 2`  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, don't drop by like a patron at a bar.  
It's a school assembly. Everyone's got an assigned place.  
You can't decide to transform it into a freestyle social event.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pff... What even happened here?  
One minute I'm chilling on my own, the next, this spot's Party Central.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well... Not that I even care.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ah! The side-glance again!  
Didja catch that, Yuni?! She doesn't miss a \"dere\" opportunity!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Really now, young Chloe.  
Have a modicum of self-respect.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Young ladies, settle down!  
Good day to you all. Allow me to begin the school assembly.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Ah... in recent times, our academy has had the honor of working with  
the Forestier guild from the Elven Forest, enriching the views of our  
student body by welcoming a very special transfer student.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. That would be young Aoi.  
I wonder how our solitary friend is doing of late  
in her distant forest home.  
  
**Chieru：**  
You gotta wonder, right?  
I miss our li'l Aoi-wowie!  
  

---  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, I dropped by not long ago, and she seemed pretty normal.  
Saw her muttering away to some kind of ugly little doll thing.  
And occasionally shrieking like a girl possessed.  
  

---  
  
**Chieru：**  
Aw, no fair, Chloe! Just 'cause you've got elf privilege,  
you can't drop in on li'l Aoi without us!  
Did you hear that, Yuni?! Our Chloe's even got the aftercare covered!  
  
**Yuni：**  
But reading between the lines, I surmise she didn't actually greet her.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, well, yeah...  
I figured that stuff could wait till the four of us all got together...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, I see this type of fan at Carmina concerts.  
Never joining in with the crowd's cheers, just watching from the back,  
arms folded, like they think they're the girls' boyfriends or guardians.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, dude.  
Do you gotta make out like my tactful discretion  
is some creepy idol whatever?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Wait. Did you say \"guardian\"?  
Chloe, what's the meaning of this?  
Do you mean to become young Aoi's mother? I won't hear of it.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ooh~? Are we adding the mommy angle to Chloe's charm list?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh.  
What's a \"mommy angle\" s'posed to mean.  
  
**Yuni：**  
A curious-sounding phrase indeed...  
Young Chieru, elaborate.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? Don't ask me. I just pulled it out of thin air.  
Actually, half of what I say is just spur-of-the-moment stuff,  
so can you try not to think too hard about it?  
  
**Teacher：**  
...You girls over there! No chattering during assembly.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh crap. She's glaring daggers.  
  
**Yuni：**  
How crude of us.  
Please do continue, Mother Hilda!  
  
**Teacher：**  
Ahem! Now, St. Theresa's Academy for Girls  
has long maintained its distance from the outside world  
in the name of ensuring a secure life for our students.  
  
**Teacher：**  
However, we cannot grow stagnant.  
The time is ripe for us to reassess our isolationist policies.  
Our ongoing experiment with a single male student is but one example.  
  
**Teacher：**  
While maintaining a healthy respect for the ways of our forebears,  
we must forge a new path befitting of the modern age.  
  
**Teacher：**  
As such, we have decided  
to implement a new program in the days to come.  
  
**Chloe：**  
A new program.  
Huh... What's it gonna be this time.  
  
**Yuni：**  
What indeed.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Still, this academy... Pursuing new ventures is all well and good,  
but I certainly hope they haven't forgotten.  
We Yuni-ettes are still awaiting our promised scholarship funds.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yep, for real!  
Why do they think we even formed the Yuni-et—  
  
**Chieru：**  
Guorgh, that was close!  
I almost went with the flow and let the reject guild name slip out!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hahah. Admit the truth, young Chieru.  
It's clear that the glorious return of the Yuni-ettes is your heart's desire.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Heck no, heck no, not a chance.  
In the first place, I'm pretty fond of our actual guild name, so—  
  
**Yuni：**  
Enough from you, superego.  
Right now, it's your id with which I have business.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? What's this crazy girl babbling about?  
  
**Chloe：**  
See? Creepy, ain't it?  
  
**Chloe：**  
This is why I told ya,  
we gotta hold a proper exorcism for that hellfire-bait guild name.  
One slip of the tongue and it'll be crawling back from the dead.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oh? Has my candidate guild name  
achieved autonomy on a higher plane?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Um, it's not a \"candidate.\"  
The real name was approved on paper ages ago.  
We all belong  
 to the St. Theresa's Academy (Friendship Club) guild!  
  
**Yuni：**  
(Citation needed!)  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Hm? Did you hear a fly buzzing just now?  
  
**Chloe：**  
See, what'd I tell you? This is what happens when you  
speak forbidden words.  
 Ugh, pass me the salt.  
I ain't salty, I just know my rituals. Someone shut me up.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Young Chloe, that's enough.  
Cease sprinkling table salt at the feet  
of your friend and celebrated upperclassman.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Ah... So, yes.  
 Our last special presentation  
was a most worthwhile undertaking.  
 It is the calling of all students  
to broaden the mind and shed the veil of ignorance.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Knowledge, however, achieves little while confined to the mind alone.  
It must be put into practice through innovation and proactive pursuits.  
In my own youth, I took part in a number of vocational training schemes...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Too long.  
Gimme the short version.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Do we even need this?  
The whole entire-life-story-before-the-recipe dealie.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. According to my notes,  
this marks the twelfth extended personal anecdote  
Mother Hilda has subjected us to this semester.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Ehm... So this is why our academy's new project  
will be a more practical course.  
 One might call it a valuable  
preparation for your future real-world endeavors.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Namely, we will be inviting a group of women  
who have already become successful in Landosol society...  
  
**Teacher：**  
...to offer a \"Special Lesson in Entrepreneurial Spirit\"!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Entrepreneurial spirit...  
 Huh. Say what.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well, it sounds to me like a course on how to start a business.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Like, a seminar on student venture enterprise?  
  
**Teacher：**  
Whether or not you plan to start your own business someday,  
this lesson is guaranteed to provide a valuable experience.  
Anyone who is interested, please apply after the assembly.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Startups, huh...  
Sure, there's profit potential,  
 but it's basically a big gamble, right?  
And you'd need to pony up capital... Yeah, I don't think it's for me.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Common folk like us gotta stick to the safe ol' daily grind.  
One rupie in the hand's worth a thousand in the clouds,  
 and all that.  
Pff... When's my next shift.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. An exercise in economic acumen would pique my scholarly interest,  
but if the topic is spirit—mere idle aspirations—then no, I need not apply.  
Pff... Back to library sweet library.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hmm... Being a company prez someday does tickle my fancy a little,  
but I'm all-in on youth-y magic right now, so if my pals are out, so am I!  
Pff... Chelleree, chelleray.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Hold it right there.  
This is no time to chelleray the day away.  
You three... no, you four... will be joining this lesson without fail.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Excuse me?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Wait, me too?  
**Choice: (4)**  Ooh! Me too!  
`Tag 3`  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, why the blank look, kid.  
Like, what. Were you gonna run off and leave us?  
Aren't all four of us the Friendship Club together?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Indeed.  
My lad, this guild is a band of fates entwined.  
Since the day we made our vows, we live and die as Yuni-ettes.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yes, agreed.  
We live and die as the Friendship Club.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, why the eager energy.  
Don't just raise your hand and make it look like we're all up for this.  
Does this look like a \"Yes please!\" face to you?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Off he goes again with his freaky positivity.  
Are your eyes actually sparkling? Haven't you ever heard of saying no?  
You're a Landosol boy—show some street smarts already.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Quite right. Learn that your sparkles are the fruits of those around you.  
Why, even I could easily muster a sparkle or two...  
 Behold!  
N... nguahh...! My eyes! They're turning to dust!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Um, listen. Loving the whole clown act and all,  
but can you go and do it over in the corner.  
I don't wanna be seen with you.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Teacher：**  
Settle down!  
I'm afraid there is no room for argument.  
Your participation in this lesson has already been decided.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Tyranny! Teach, doesn't this fall under  
some harassment code or other? Are you legally okay?  
  
**Teacher：**  
That's enough cheek. I'm acting in the interests of your education.  
Or what? Have you all abandoned your scholarship applications?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Scholarship applications...  
 Hrm. You refer, I presume,  
to the assessment in which we were tasked with representing our peers  
through harmony with the male transfer student.  
  
**Teacher：**  
The very same, Dr. Yuni.  
If the four of you produce fine results in this special lesson,  
I assure you they will contribute a great deal to your appraisal.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Checks out.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Chells out.  
  
**Yuni：**  
The logic is sound.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Well then, I trust you have no objections.  
I look forward to your performance, members of the Yuni-ettes.  
  
**Chieru & Chloe：**  
We're not Yuni-ettes!  
  
**Narration：**  
Thus the members of St. Theresa's Academy (Friendship Club)  
were officially enrolled in the Special Lesson in Entrepreneurial Spirit.
