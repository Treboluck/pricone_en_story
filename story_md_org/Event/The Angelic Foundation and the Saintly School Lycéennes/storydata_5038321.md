**Chieru：**  
Wha... The heck is that?!  
It's like a gang of unhinged Merc cosplayers  
getting ready to merc some guys!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Why, it's...  
 the Friendbot Hologram!  
By analyzing a target's appearance, personality and motions,  
it projects a shadow indistinguishable from the original!  
  
**Yuni：**  
A 3D optical projection...  
 would hardly account for what we're seeing.  
Why, observe! They even have physical mass!  
This practically amounts to cloning!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Damn, she's right. Crazy tech.  
Gulping broth, munching 'yaki, counting rupies and cackling like Santa...  
They've even got the vibes of the originals right on the money.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Wait a minute.  
I don't ever drink as crudely as that!  
  
**Yuni：**  
A golden liquid flows without end from the magical tankard.  
Not missing a single drop, she downs it as fast as it can emerge.  
Circus performers take payment for less. In layfolk's terms, it's appalling.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Even I'm nope-ing out on this one.  
  
**Yukari：**  
You've got it wrong!  
Mifuyu! Let's wipe those faulty fakes out of existence!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yes, you're right.  
They can't compare to the original...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Mifuyu...?!
