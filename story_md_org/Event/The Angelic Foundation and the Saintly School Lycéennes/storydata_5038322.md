**Chloe：**  
Pff...  
Well, that takes care of the fakester Mercs.  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
CHERU-CHERU-CHERU-CHERU-CHERU-CHERU-CHERU-CHERU!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh? What is it now?  
The lame-ass scrapbot's gone into a full rabid frenzy.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
The robot's energy core has started to go into meltdown!  
Right nyow, Friendbot X is wielding power beyond its own specs!  
This is bad! Let's turn tail and run for our nyine lives!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Excessive energy from overheating?  
 Hah. The old limit break, eh?  
A nasty trick, yes, but strangely,  
 my heart beats ever faster in my chest.  
In the terms of the layfolk,  
 this is getting so hype!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Our little Yuni gets really worked up over the most hokey stuff, huh?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ohh... My little bros are into that too.  
Y'know, overdrives and limit breaks and stuff.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Um, so, what now?  
Doesn't overdrive mean we're looking at double the danger?  
Should we just run? We can leave Yuni here to have her fun.  
  
**Akino：**  
That wouldn't be remotely acceptable!  
As the developers behind Friendbot X, we must fight to the bitter end!  
Wouldn't you agree, Tamaki?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Slo~wly... snyeakily... quietly...  
 ...Huh?!  
O-  
of course! I'll fight to the end!  
That's the myeaning of responsibility!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, loving the passionate declaration,  
but your body's still frozen in sneak-the-heck-outta-here mode.  
We've caught you red-handed in the act of shirking responsibility.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Leave her be, young Chloe. The enemy is readying intense attacks.  
In this crisis, we must unite our hearts and trust in the bonds we share!  
Mustn't we, young Chieru?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Chellily... sneakillily... quiechelly...  
 ...Huh?!  
Oh—  
yes! Nyaturally! Together, we'll nyever lose!  
Ain't nyo dirty chickens who'd flee at the first sign of danger here!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Nyicely said! Nyicely said!  
  
**Akino：**  
Now—here we come, Friendbot X!  
We'll demonstrate to you that we stand even stronger united!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh? Our hearts are in united mode now? Who knew.  
Bleh... Well, whatever. Let's just do this thing.  
  
**Chieru & Yuni：**  
Nyicely said! Nyicely said!
