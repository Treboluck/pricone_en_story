**Yuni：**  
Cherun.  
Your guildmaster here, greeting you exactly as instructed by our junior.  
I'm led to believe you've finished a momentous twenty battles. Good job.  
  
**Yuni：**  
And yet, life is a battlefield without end.  
If you truly wish to impress, keep working like a Yunihorse. Only then  
will the Insult Queen herself come to shower you with chellish praise.
