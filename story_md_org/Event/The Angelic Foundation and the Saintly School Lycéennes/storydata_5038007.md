# The Yearnings of Youth
Due to the fiasco it caused, the special lesson is buried away, never to be spoken of again. But the students of St. Theresa's still remember the bonds of friendship they saw that day, and they hail the Friendship Club members as the saviors of the academy.
  
## Subtitle: The Yearnings of Youth
  
**Narration：**  
The morning after Friendbot X's rampage and subsequent subjugation...  
The members of the Friendship Club happen to run into each other  
just outside the school gates.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hey, Yuni! Hey, Chloe!  
Oh, and I guess you too, {player}!  
Morny chelling~! ☆  
  
**Chloe：**  
Never knew it worked that way 'round too. But hey.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Morning!  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuni：**  
Yes, good morning to you all.  
Your guildmaster Yuni is here.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Rare sight much?  
Didn't think Yuni woke up at normal person hours.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? Yeah, tell us, Yuni, why's the lone member  
of the no-normal-lessons club up at this time?  
Bright and early at the less-old schoolhouse, even.  
  
**Yuni：**  
True, in ordinary circumstances, I'd be preparing to retire to bed  
at this hour.  
 However, yesterday's incident still weighs on my mind.  
So I came to see how things are going.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well, that figures.  
The school did kinda burn down...  
Though we all headed home in a hurry. AKA, fled the coop.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Don't make us out to be petty criminals.  
We simply accepted young Akino's kind offer  
and let the Foundation handle the rest.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Bet they had to do a ton of explaining to the authorities...  
Welp, can't be helped.  
Yuni remembered she had somewhere to be, after all.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hold on. According to my notes, it was you who suddenly recalled  
a prior commitment.  
 I, meanwhile, came down with a sudden fever,  
while young Chieru had an insatiable craving for crepes.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh. What. Crepes?  
Couldn't you come up with a *slightly* more legit excuse?  
It was kinda assy of us to ditch 'em like that, y'know.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well,  
 that's true.  
The whole school *was* still flaming like a pretty bonfire.  
Didn't stop us hightailing it, though. AKA, saving our own hides.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Don't phrase it in such an incriminating fashion.  
Besides, none of us were in the wrong in this instance.  
We were just victims of a heinous case of IP theft.  
  
**Chloe：**  
If anything, we're heroes. Saviors of the school.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes. If we hadn't stopped Friendbot X's rampage,  
one school building would be the least of our losses.  
  
**Chieru：**  
So if we explain, will the teachers be all  
\"My, how brave of you!\"  
 then, d'you think?  
  
**Chloe：**  
If we believed that, we wouldn't've run for the hills.  
  
**Yuni：**  
They do seem more likely  
to treat this as another of the academy outcasts' misdeeds.  
  
**Chieru：**  
AKA, we reap what we sow.  
  
**Yuni：**  
When they examine the incident,  
Friendbot X's distinctive cries of \"Cheru~n\"  
will doubtless be foremost in their minds.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? Wait, am I gonna be the main villain here?  
'Cause if they ask, I'll say I was just following Chloe's orders.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Nah, that piece of junk was basically one of Yuni's creations.  
Let's just hand 'em the Doc.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Now, now. Did yesterday's impromptu lesson teach you two nothing?  
Have you forgotten the Declaration of Friendship  
that moved even our metal foe to tears?  
  
**Yuni：**  
The Yuni-ettes are united by unbreakable bonds.  
If one of us errs, then in the name of friendship,  
let us fairly distribute the blame in order of juniority.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, Chloe~! I think the little Doc's trying  
to leverage her senior status and throw us to the dogs!  
Is this guild corrupt or what?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Corrupt? Hell, it's fallen into the dark side.  
The Dark Yuni-ettes.  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Dark... Yuni-ettes...?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Stay with us, Chloe! Don't stray down the wrong path!  
Even if you attach a Chloe-bait descriptor,  
this is still the Yuni-ettes we're talking about!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ahh, good point!  
Damn, close call. I almost fell to the Yuni side.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Heh heh. You just wait.  
In time, I'll make the whole world fall to the Yuni side!  
  
**Yuni：**  
No, wait. Did I say \"fall\"? Absurd.  
That would suggest my soul exists on a lower level than others'.  
If anything, they should \"ascend,\" or perhaps \"awaken\" to the Yuni side.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh... Sure thing. Whichever.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Heh heh. You just wait.  
In time, I'll make the whole world ascend to the Yuni side!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, Yuni~?  
What're you doing? You'll be left behind!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah! Wait! Wait! Don't abandon me!  
  
**Friendship Club：**  
...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? Too normal.  
The school looks ultra normal.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes... I see nary a scratch.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uhh...? So this means what?  
Like, what was the stuff we saw yesterday?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It was all a dream?  
**Choice: (3)**  It was just an illusion?  
`Tag 2`  
**Yuni：**  
A dream...?  
 Hrm, an intriguing interpretation.  
Each and every one of us had identical dreams...  
In other words, we entered the collective unconsciousness together.  
  
**Yuni：**  
The information we each obtained therein was synchronized,  
instilling us all with matching false perceptions of reality.  
Yes, I see... A most ingenious theory, young {player}.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Yuni：**  
An illusion...?  
 Hrm, an intriguing interpretation.  
It's true that in a previous research project of mine, I postulated  
that we may live in a simulation by some higher-dimensional entity...  
  
**Yuni：**  
No, strike that. It's nothing. The matter is already settled.  
My attention should not be focused on grander truths.  
I must use it to enjoy these chellious days with my sweet juniors.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Chloe：**  
I gotta say, for all her smarts,  
Yuni comes out with the most paranormal-sounding stuff sometimes.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Call it spiritual or whatever, but isn't it just... you know?  
Like, the condition over-imaginative minds fall into around  
eighth grade.  
 Where you overuse words like \"dark\" and \"daybreak.\"  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh...? First I've heard of that. Well, can't hate on people's tastes.  
Wouldn't wanna hear any brutally honest opinions  
on Chellish, would ya?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well, no. I mean, when did I ever say it was a bad thing?  
  
**Chloe：**  
...  
Sorry. Forget that. I said nothing. Guess I've got a victim complex.  
  
**Akino：**  
Ohoho!  
Good day to you, St. Theresa's Academy (Friendship Club) members!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh. The energetic gal. Morning.  
  
**Akino：**  
A good morning to you too.  
For the trouble we caused you in yesterday's sudden test run,  
I must express my deepest apologies.  
 Ohohohoho!  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Did we need the laugh there?  
  
**Yuni：**  
I can see she meant no harm.  
A true aristocrat; she laughs as naturally as breathing.  
  
**Chloe：**  
This energetic gal sure is energetic.  
  
**Yuni：**  
So, young Akino, might I ask what brings you here this morning...  
No, strike that. I sense from you a deep fatigue not unlike my own.  
May I presume you haven't left the site since yesterday?  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, of course! I oversaw the project from beginning to end!  
As you can see, the long night's work has given me a natural high!  
Ohohohoho!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Guess that tracks.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Honestly, I can't tell if she's acting any different from usual.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. \"Project,\" you say.  
Then, young Akino, is the current state of this school building...?  
  
**Akino：**  
Yes! With the aid of the finest artisans the Foundation could enlist,  
plus a team of elite construction mages,  
we restored the building overnight!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeesh. Fortune's a scary thing.  
  
**Chieru：**  
So with enough money, you can work literal miracles.  
My whole concept of value is shook.  
  
**Yuni：**  
No, even with the funds to hire a mountain of workers, such a feat  
requires boundless trust, efficient coordination, resource management,  
and a leader with the drive and charisma to bring them all together.  
  
**Chieru：**  
The Merc gals are amazing!  
So they really weren't just a band of quirky old clowns!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Indeed. I trust you'll never refer to them as Chellurious again.  
  
**Chloe：**  
I knew it.  
Only the best from the Mifuyurius Foundation,  
home of the Dragon Slayer.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. Actually, where *is* young Mifuyu?  
And the rest of your guild members and workers?  
  
**Akino：**  
Why, as soon as they each finished their tasks,  
I told them to go home and rest!  
  
**Akino：**  
As their guildmaster...  
 no, as the lead special tutor,  
I alone remained to offer one last sincere apology to you all.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  To apologize... as a tutor?  
`Tag 5`  
**Akino：**  
Yes.  
Due to the sheer fiasco it caused,  
this special lesson initiative has been canceled in its entirety.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh?  
  
**Akino：**  
I really am so terribly sorry!  
We had hoped to gather your fine ideas  
and transform them into inspiring new business projects...  
  
**Akino：**  
But due to our failures...  
after a heated debate on all sides...  
we were sadly forced to abandon those plans.  
  
**Akino：**  
I cannot fault you if you blame us for this injustice.  
After all, in the end, though we called ourselves special tutors,  
we have done nothing but betray your expectations and trust.  
  
**Chloe：**  
No, uh, I mean...  
  
**Chieru：**  
I think we all saw *that* coming...  
  
**Yuni：**  
'Tis the way of the world.  
In the terms of the layfolk... What? Is that all?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Sounds like business as usual.  
`Tag 6`  
**Akino：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Chloe：**  
I mean, it's no biggie. Nobody's holding grudges here.  
Honestly, once the pitch thing was over,  
we mostly forgot about all that business funding stuff.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Exactly. And while we're being honest,  
I've gotta say all our ideas were pretty chelled up to begin with.  
Oh—not correct Chellish, bee-tee-dubs.  
 Don't go copying that.  
  
**Yuni：**  
In the first place, reflecting upon it logically,  
the funds offered in this lesson were solely for business purposes.  
It was never an opportunity to get rich quick without effort.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Even if the funds enabled us to found a revolutionary enterprise,  
would managing that business to maintain a sustainable flow of profit  
have been within our capabilities?  
  
**Chloe：**  
For real.  
I was kinda trying not to think about it,  
but yeah. What she said.  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, you girls...  
 As if you could have missed such basic considerations...  
Haha. I see you're telling a little white lie  
to lighten the load of our guilt, aren't you?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh... Yeah. Let's go with that.  
  
**Yuni：**  
To think that our thoughtless and narrow-minded greed  
would miraculously transform into such a touching conclusion.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Isn't it just the sweetest~?  
  
**Akino：**  
S-so can it be that you are truly willing to forgive us...?  
Despite our heinous betrayal of the trust you placed in us as tutors?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Like, yeah, whatever,  
but let's not forget your real crime was burning down half the school.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Besides, if you dredge up the lesson stuff,  
we'll have to question whether we had any plans to learn to begin with.  
  
**Yuni：**  
And tutor though you may be,  
you are, after all, no older in years than I.  
  
**Yuni：**  
So yes, I do forgive you. And if I may, let me extend a hand of amity.  
In the terms of the layfolk, let's be friends.  
I may not get out much, but I'll visit Lucent Academy from time to time.  
  
**Akino：**  
L-Lucent...?  
What's that? It's not a jewel I've heard of.  
  
**Yuni：**  
But for now, a word from student to tutor...  
The studies you taught us remain firm in all our hearts.  
Results and assessments are of lesser importance, or so I personally feel.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Hey, I get that.  
Like... dunno if I'd call it academic learning or whatever,  
but I did go \"Oh, hey, neat!\"  
 at least a couple times back there.  
  
**Chloe：**  
So yeah.  
I don't think those lessons of yours were a waste at all.  
...Just my two rupies.  
  
**Chieru：**  
I had a chelleroonie of a time, so it's all good by me!  
Cheru~n! ☆  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, you girls...!  
  
**Akino：**  
Even if they are not entirely true,  
your words are greatly appreciated.  
For me personally, the greatest result of this exercise...  
  
**Akino：**  
...was meeting all of you,  
 I suppose!  
  
**Students：**  
Aaaahhhh~!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pyeargh?!  
  
**Student 1：**  
Marvelous!  
Oh, you were simply marvelous,  
members of the Friendship Club!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh? Wait. Where'd all this come from?  
Eh? Since when have we got an audience?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well, it *is* the start of school,  
so I guess there would be lots of students passing through.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. It would appear they were all listening surreptitiously.  
That's our academy for you. Despite outward pretenses,  
its students have learned the true ways of society.  
  
**Student 2：**  
Oh, Friendship Club!  
We witnessed your brave efforts yesterday!  
  
**Student 3：**  
Friendship Club!  
Thanks a bunch for defending the school!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeesh...  
Who asked for all this cheering and applause.  
Talk about a shock. It's kinda creepy.  
 ...Gonna make me blush.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Agreed.  
I have long since abandoned notions of nerves and anxiety,  
but faced with this many gazes, even I'm unsure how to react.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Thank you! Thank you! Always a pleasure!  
But keep the compliments coming!  
 Cheru~n! ☆  
  
**Chloe：**  
*One* of us sure adapts quickly.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Settle down, everyone!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Whoa! Teach?!  
  
**Teacher：**  
The school day has already begun!  
What is this commotion? Hurry to your classrooms!  
  
**Chieru：**  
'Kay... Sorry 'bout that...  
  
**Teacher：**  
...is what I would usually say,  
but just this once, I think I'll make an exception.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh?  
  
**Teacher：**  
I've heard all the details, young ladies of the Friendship Club.  
It appears it was the bonds you share that saved this academy from peril.  
An unlikely tale,  
 but if it is true, the heavens will surely smile upon you.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ooh, really~?  
Then maybe you can hurry that scholarship thingy along for us too!  
  
**Teacher：**  
That's a different kettle of fish.  
Sadly enough, such is the will of the heavens.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Didn't know the heavens were so offhand.  
  
**Teacher：**  
That said, yes, I will take this into account as a mark in your favor.  
You have done well, Miss Chieru, Miss Chloe, Miss Yuni.  
And of course...  
  
**Teacher：**  
And of course... our friend from Lucent Academy!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, {player}.  
Has she seriously still not learned your name.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well, then!  
We've got Teach's approval!  
Everyone, let's get this party chelled up!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ready, and...  
Friend! Ship! Club! Friend! Ship! Club!  
  
**Students：**  
Friend! Ship! Club! Friend! Ship! Club!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah...! Young Chieru has roused the masses into a coordinated cheer!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, god...  
For real? Since when does our school have vibes like this?  
  
**Akino：**  
This is a parade to herald the triumphant heroes!  
I should say such acclaim from the masses is only natural!  
  
**Chieru：**  
That's right!  
 C'mon, Yuni & Chloe, you join in too!  
Ready, go! Friend! Ship! Club! Friend! Ship! Club!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, cut it out. Like, tell her, Doc.  
We'd sooner dance the Chellarena wearing nothing but Yukari's barrier  
than join in some kind of lame-ass chant with all those—  
  
**Yuni：**  
Aaahh! This looks fun! Show me the magic of youth!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ahh... Shoulda known.  
Sometimes the Doc's head goes full chelleroonie.  
  
**Students：**  
Friend! Ship! Club! Friend! Ship! Club!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yu! Ni! Ettes! Let's hear it! Yu! Ni! Ettes!  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, Miss Chloe? It seems everyone is looking at you.  
How long do you plan to keep them waiting?  
  
**Chieru：**  
C'mon now, Chloe!  
Summon a bit of that youth energy and chell in the moment!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Precisely, young Chloe!  
In this twisted world, what's wrong with a little chellation of the mind?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pff... Fine, I'll do whatever.  
  
**Chloe：**  
I mean... It's fine. Really.  
  
**Akino：**  
Well! All of St. Theresa's, student body and faculty alike!  
Let's hear a Declaration of Friendship! Ready~?  
  
**All：**  
The Friendship Club are...?!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  All the best of friends!  
`Tag 7`  
**Narration：**  
Thus the Mercurius Foundation's special lesson came to a close.  
The Friendship Club girls had conquered adversity and renewed their  
bonds, and the magic of youth sparkled endlessly through the academy.
