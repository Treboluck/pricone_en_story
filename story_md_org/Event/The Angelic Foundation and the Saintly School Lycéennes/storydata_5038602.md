**Yuni：**  
Ah... There's yet another shard over here.  
This is...  
 Hrm. A control circuit, I'd wager.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What are you doing?  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, young {player}. Good to see you.  
If you ask what I'm doing, there can only be one answer.  
I'm always in pursuit of fresh and exciting knowledge.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Looks like you're picking up trash.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yuni：**  
How sad. A sad state indeed. You trust only what your eyes can see.  
That's how the soul grows short-sighted. You'll be lost to the truth.  
From a certain perspective, this area is a trove of treasures right now.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Now then—  
observe the physical evidence. These are the scattered parts  
of Super Yuni-ette the Great...  
 or, ah, Friendbot X, rather.  
Though the school has been rebuilt, it seems these scraps still persist.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Friendbot X... For good or for ill, it was a revolutionary project.  
A beast of flair and ambition, untamed by preconceptions.  
I saw in its every inch the magic of science fiction.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ironically enough, it triggered a breakthrough in my synapses.  
My prior assumptions of normality were shattered in an instant.  
Each \"Holy cow!\"  
 that shook my brain was a catalyst for personal growth.  
  
**Yuni：**  
To ensure its rare potential doesn't go to waste,  
or perhaps to record its impact in the clearest form,  
I came to pick up tra...  
 ah, to engage in intellectual retrieval.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Answer me this: do you not feel it too?  
The desire to experience that intellectual stimulation a second time?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Maybe I do.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yuni：**  
Yes, well said.  
As expected of my young research fellow, you have a fine spirit.  
  
**Yuni：**  
In that case, you can lend a helping hand.  
You have a duty to aid this feeble recluse with your physical strength.  
Come, locate these piles of trash...  
 I mean,  
 treasure... and retrieve them.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. You still appear decidedly confused.  
I must apologize. To put this in the terms of the layfolk...  
  
**Yuni：**  
...No, perhaps not.  
It's crude to put everything in simple terms.  
I'm a literary scholar. I should respect the element of surprise.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well then, with that settled, let's begin.  
It's time to create it...  
  
**Yuni：**  
My very own Friendbot X Mk. II!
