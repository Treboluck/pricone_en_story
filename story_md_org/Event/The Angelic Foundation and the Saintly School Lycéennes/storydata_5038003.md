# The Formidable Fashionista
Chloe pitches a new street fashion brand to the Foundation judges. After a practical demonstration, they find her excessively frank style of customer service more than a little high-risk, so the proposal is doomed to rejection.

**Narration：**  
After failing to convince Akino and her guildmates,  
Chieru returns to her friends' side with her head hung low.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Good effort, Chieru.  
  
**Yuni：**  
We observed your entire pitch through the half-ajar door.  
The content aside, we were thoroughly impressed by your  
passionate performance. ...Yes, the content aside.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, Yuni & Chloe...  
I'm so sorry. It looks like I've failed you.  
After all the help you gave me designing my product...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oh yes, we helped. Young Chloe created the plush figure,  
while I programmed the conversation magic. Your own contributions,  
as I recall, were limited to a stream of executive quibbling.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ahhh...  
After I put my heart and soul into working you both to the bone...  
I don't have the faintest idea where we could have gone wrong...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Your entire spiel.  
  
**Chloe：**  
You always go off on these spontaneous rants...  
What was that \"universal language\" crap.  
How's that gonna sell anything?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Who knows? It's a mystery to me too.  
Once I was chelling away, I got a bit caught up in the mood.  
Chloe, you shouldn't think too hard about anything I say, you know?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Who's thinking.  
I'm just putting you in your place.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Settle down, young Chloe.  
Your turn is almost upon us.  
Go forth and restore the lost honor of the Yuni-ettes.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yuni's right, Chloe!  
Go restore the lost honor of St. Theresa's Academy (Friendship Club)!  
  
**Chieru：**  
And... Urgh! I'm begging you...!  
Please avenge me and my beloved li'l Chatterbox Chellypon...!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, please. Avenge you?  
You're the one who walked in and committed business suicide.  
  
**Chieru：**  
No waaaay! You're too cruel, Chloe...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, I dunno 'bout avenging, but I'll do my best for the cash.  
...You can count on me.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ah! The \"dere\" move!  
Blink and you'll miss it!  
Didja see that, Doc Yuni?! She turned on the cute again!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Really now, young Chloe.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Mrgrgrgrgr...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
All right, next student! Enter when you're ready.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pff...  
Well, guess this is it, then.  
  
**Chloe：**  
'Sup.  
St. T's second-year, Chloe. Pleasure and stuff.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
This one seems to be missing her myotivation...  
  
**Akino：**  
Miss Chloe... She has a very unique atmosphere.  
I hope her business ideas  
 are no less original!  
  
**Akino：**  
Let's see... According to these school records...  
 Oh?  
I see a warning or two for \"antisocial behavior.\"  
We may have something of a rebel on our hands.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
That could explain it...  
The truth is, since we first saw her,  
I, um—how to put this—feel like she's had her eye squarely on me...  
  
**Chloe：**  
There she is. The Dragon Slayer. The woman who's killed a legend.  
Huh... I love it.  
 Yeah, she's so badass.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Y-you see? She's definitely glaring at me, isn't she?  
What, did I do something to make her angry?  
Oh, heck! I have no idea what the youth of today are thinking!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ahhh...! I wanna ask about all her exploits,  
but I don't wanna look like one of those crazy obsessed fans...  
Wait, maybe I *am* one of those fans. Hilarious.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I-it's true...  
She's glaring daggers straight at Mifuyu...  
With a creepy smyirk on her face, even!  
  
**Akino：**  
Whatever are you two muttering about?  
We can't keep Miss Chloe waiting. Let's begin, shall we?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Go for it.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
W-well then, Miss Chloe.  
This may be a little awkward for a first question,  
but do you hold a particularly strong grudge against adults or society?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Who you callin' a delinquent.  
Want me to smash all the school windows at night?  
  
**Chloe：**  
No, but for real. I'm really not like that.  
People think I'm a hoodlum, but I'm as above-board as they come.  
I'm taking this thing serious as serious can be, so let's do it.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  We're counting on your support.  
`Tag 1`  
**Akino：**  
Oh, my dear {player}! Joining us again, are you?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh?  
But wait, then... could this mean...?  
  
**Chloe：**  
While we're here, Merc gals.  
Heard you've been munching taiyaki, so you must be thirsty.  
Yo, staff dude? Hand our friends the goods, why don'tcha.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Hand out drinks.  
`Tag 2`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh, not another bribe!  
And in concert with the last girl, too! What is these students' problem?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Systemic corruption...  
The \"antisocial behavior\" nyotes were nyo lie...  
  
**Yukari：**  
H-hold on!  
Why is my glass full of bubbling barley broth?!  
This is a school! Aren't there rules against this?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh? There some kind of problem?  
I just asked our guy to give each gal  
a drink that'll suit her personal vibe.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  There was really no other choice.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yukari：**  
O-oh? You chose this for me...?  
Then I suppose it's OK... Geez. Just one sip, then!  
...*glug*  
  
**Yukari：**  
Aaaahhhh~!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, Miss Yukari.  
That really the expression you're going with for an \"I suppose\"?  
'Cause it looks to me more like a \"praise the heavens\" or something.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
This girl... She's worrying about Yukari's public image!  
A form of kindness that all of us have long forgotten...  
She looks all tough, but she might secretly be a nyice kid...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Her kind soul must have been twisted by society...  
It's our duty as adults to show her fairness and respect.  
  
**Akino：**  
Well then, looking at the handouts Miss Chloe gave us...  
Hmm... It seems she's proposing a new street fashion brand?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, yes. Yeah.  
Well, the gist is, I'll whip up some original gear, see?  
Then we lay it out in a boutique store kinda deal.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
An original brand from a high schooler?  
That'll be tricky from a commercial perspective.  
So tell me, do you have the skill to back the idea up?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, prob'ly. Yeah.  
The customers always like the items I pick out for 'em.  
I've had a bunch of requests to put together full outfits, too.  
  
**Chloe：**  
And I always enjoy that kinda work.  
So, y'know, if I could have my own shop and items,  
I figure I'd be able to take things to a new level of personal.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh—so you already have professional experience in the area.  
...Hm? Doesn't this academy forbid part-time work?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ah. Uhhh... Well, about that....  
 Hm?  
Wait, hang on a sec. I just noticed, but, Yukari...  
Have I seen your pretty face somewhere before?  
  
**Yukari：**  
O-of course not!  
Oh, you charmer! I wasn't expecting pickup lines here of all places...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
That was... a very forceful change of subject.  
My whiskers sense the scent of illicit labor.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
That aside, I'm not sure why Yukari looks so pleased with herself.  
I think she's glancing at our gentleman friend in hopes of more flattery.  
And her idea of flirting seems more than a little outdated.  
  
**Akino：**  
Everyone, aren't we getting off topic?  
  

---  
  
**Akino：**  
To begin with, what exactly is \"street fashion\"?  
Is it the style I so often see in Landosol that dispenses with  
upper-body clothing in favor of lickable bladed implements?  
  

---  
  
**Chloe：**  
'Kay, so, that *is* common.  
Legit can't deny it's literally everywhere.  
Can't walk two feet in the city without running into ten guys like that.  
  
**Chloe：**  
But knife-licking dudes are *not* the style I'm into.  
When I say \"street fashion,\" I just mean...  
Pff. Putting this stuff into words is tough. Or like, not happening?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Um, isn't that this pitch's entire goal?  
Providing a clear explanation of the concept you've developed.  
...Does this girl even know what she's signed up for?  
  
**Chloe：**  
No, don't worry.  
The basic thing I'm going for here's real simple.  
Here's the deal...  
  
**Chloe：**  
I find punks, and I smack a serving  
of fashion sense up their asses.  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Or something?  
  
**???：**  
Pfft! Ehe... ehehe...  
  
**???：**  
Wh-what was that?! T-too cool! Gwaha... ahahah...  
Oh god, I'm getting cramps... Eehehee...  
I can just see... her straight face... Pfffrttt...  
  
**Yukari：**  
My, what's this?  
I think I hear some merry voices coming from the corridor...  
  
**Chloe：**  
...  
  
**Chloe：**  
...H-how's it sound?  
  
**Akino：**  
Ohohoh!  
You certainly have guts, Miss Chloe!  
I don't dislike that attitude! In fact, it's inspiring!  
  
**Akino：**  
However... Words alone are not enough to run a business.  
I think we will need to see for ourselves  
how effective your fashion sense truly is.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Sure. Bring it the heck on.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I think a practical trial seems most efficient.  
You can set up shop here, and we'll approach you as customers.  
How does that sound?  
  
**Yukari：**  
So a sort of roleplaying activity to simulate the retail environment?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeah, I like it.  
Lovin' your style, Slayer.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Okay, picture this.  
We're in your shop. You're serving customers.

![503800301.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/503800301.webp)  
**Chloe：**  
My shop. I'm serving. Got it.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ooh, this sounds like fun!  
Tell you what, I'll try it out first!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Come on in.  
What'cha lookin' for.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
That's your attitude?!  
Aren't boutique assistants usually more lively?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh, for real?  
Gonna be honest, I ain't smiled this hard in weeks.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...Well, whatever.  
For nyow, just sell me the outfit that looks best on me!  
  
![503800302.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/503800302.webp)  
**Chloe：**  
No can do.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
What the myaaargh?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
M-my pride's in tatters...  
She thinks I can't pull off a single outfit...  
I walked into a boutique and got served an emotional gut punch...  
  
**Chloe：**  
No, uh, look. Those threads you've got on now, they're you to the core.  
Nothing I can come up with is ever gonna beat 'em.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
O-ohhh? That's all you meant?  
You shocked me! You've got a face built for heavy dissing,  
so you oughtta pick your words more carefully...  
  
**Chloe：**  
That gear really is outta this world, though.  
The whole rig's packed full of fancy Togoku motifs,  
but it's still function over form all the way down. How do you do it.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Actually, I dunno if anyone else could even pull it off.  
Yeah, trust me, you wanna stick hardcore to that look.  
Don't screw it up with my street styles. You know you, girl.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
O-oh, all right!  
I can't feel nyasty after all that flattery...  
I'll let you off the hook for today!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Glad to hear it. See ya 'round.  
  

---  
  
`image display end`  
**Chloe：**  
Pff... Perfect.  
I'm the customer service queen.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I didn't see you sell anything, though...  
`Tag 4`  
**Chloe：**  
You said it.  
Yup. Saw that coming.  
  
**Chloe：**  
But look, what else could I do in that scene?  
I can't lie when fashion's on the line.  
You want me to send her away looking worse?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
That's true. You did show professional integrity.  
...Though I'm not sure it works as a pitch.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Well then, I think I'll be the next customer!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hm-hm-hm-hmm~♪  
Today I think I'll cook a seafood paella for my fiancé!  
Oh, but what's this stylish-looking new boutique?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It's nyice you're getting into it,  
but I don't think this roleplay needs your personal fantasies.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ka-clunk. Come on in.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
We don't need sound effects either!  
This is a business pitch, not an improv show at a run-down theater!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, hello there!  
Tomorrow, I'm meeting my darling's parents for the first time!  
Do you have anything to suit a happy bride-to-be?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Nope.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Wha—?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
I-I'm so hurt... She said my fashion's beyond fixing,  
and my relationship sounds bogus too!  
I walked into a cute boutique and got served a fatal dose of reality...  
  
**Chloe：**  
No, listen. It's street fashion we're selling here.  
But look at you—you want something classic,  
like, uh, a slick respectable-young-woman ensemble.  
  
**Yukari：**  
O-oh! That's what you meant? I was shocked...  
Your face looks so actively hostile, I must have gotten the wrong idea.  
But thank you. I'll go and look for a different boutique!  
  
**Chloe：**  
No probs. Take care now.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pff...  
Yep. Perfection, Take 2.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  And still zero actual sales...  
`Tag 5`  
**Chloe：**  
Uh-huh. Saw it coming.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Actually, that entire scene  
was almeowst a carbon copy of what happened with me.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Geez... What's the big idea, Tamaki, Yukari?  
Nothing for it... I guess I'll have to do this myself.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ready whenever.  
Skit #3. \"The Boutique.\"  
  
**Tamaki：**  
She straight-up called it a skit this time!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ka-clunk. Come on in.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hello there.  
So this is a street fashion boutique? Yes, I'm aware.  
No, I don't care if it suits me. Just sell me something—  
  
**Chloe：**  
Hell no.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Wha...?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I-I can't take it...  
She said I'm not worthy of a street urchin's rags...  
I walked into a boutique and got served the coup de grâce...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, whaddaya expect.  
We're talkin' *the* Dragon Slayer here, see?  
They'll be singing freakin' ballads about you in a thousand years.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Clothes that'll go down in legend? That's way outta my league.  
I dunno what'll be in fashion for epic murals in the future, and I don't  
want jabs like  
 \"Ancient Landosol styles were lame!\"  
 to be my fault.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I... see...  
I don't think I understood a word of that,  
but try to be more sensitive in the future. Goodbye.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Gotcha. Come again.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pff...  
Perfection Central, third season confirmed.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  How many items did you sell?  
`Tag 6`  
**Chloe：**  
Well, somewhere around zero...  
  
**Chloe：**  
But look, who's even sending me these customers?  
One glance at the shop oughtta tell you they're not my clientele.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
She's even started blaming the customers!  
I've seen stores like this, and they nyever last...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I don't think we need to hear it,  
but Akino, can you give her the final verdict?  
  
**Akino：**  
Yes! For this pitch...  
  
**Chloe：**  
...!  
  
**Akino：**  
It's another decisive \"No Rupie\"!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh?  
  
**Akino：**  
Personally, I found your unique style of service entertaining,  
but my guildmates...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
You can't have a business with nyo sales!  
Principles alone nyever fed a single kitten!  
And all I'll remember from today is the verbal abuse!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Yes... My thoughts are the same. It still stings.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yes, agreed. I'd rather forget it.  
  
**Akino：**  
In conclusion,  
I'm afraid your proposal seems too dangerous in this state.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Wha... Hold it, hold it. Say what?  
The sales stuff, okay, fair point.  
 But abuse? Huh?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ugh... Screw this utter bull. What. The hell. Verbal abuse? Me?  
I've never cussed a single word in my damn life. Not once! I'm a damn  
angel who's never even heard the word \"crap\"! You wanna freakin' die?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
That poor girl...  
I knew she must bear ill will toward society...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Her repressed frustration's leaking out in a big way...  
  
**Yukari：**  
I'm sure she has her own reasons.  
Let's see if we can refer her to a good therapist.  
  
**Akino：**  
However, for the moment...  
It's time we showed her the door! ♪  
  
**Narration：**  
Chloe's business pitch ended in abject failure,  
and the ladies of the Mercurius Foundation would always remember her  
as the verbal barbarian of the Friendship Club.
