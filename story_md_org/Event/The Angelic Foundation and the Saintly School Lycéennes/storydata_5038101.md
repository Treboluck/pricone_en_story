The St. Theresa's Academy (Friendship Club) girls find themselves signed up for a new special lesson. With impressive rewards on offer for a successful proposal, they let their motivation (read: barefaced greed) run wild!
  
**Chieru：**  
Jeru~~n...  
This month's Chieru Allowance is looking grim...  
  
**Yuni：**  
How curious.  
The funds I receive from my village are also running dry.  
  
**Chieru：**  
It's all right for you though, Doc!  
You're such a big shot here,  
they'll throw piles of funds at you if you say it's for research!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Not untrue. But alas, I've abused that privilege one time too many.  
The school budgeteers have long since grown wise to my demands.  
Lately, I begin to contemplate pursuing illicit side work like young Chloe.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, listen. If you know enough to call it \"illicit,\"  
would you mind *not* casually bringing that stuff up in public.  
This school ain't kind to part-timers.  
  
**Chieru：**  
That reminds me. Just a few months back,  
weren't you off school for days, Chloe?  
Was that a part-time thing too?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, yeah. Got called in real sudden-like.  
Weird job—beating up giant armor things that just won't die.  
  
**Yuni：**  
What in the world...?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Don't ask me.  
No, seriously. They didn't tell us a thing. Just threw us straight out there.  
Well, whatever. Guess I saved the world and stuff.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh!  
 What was the pay like?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Good question. Don't think I got the paycheck yet.  
Actually... Who do I even bill that job to?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Dear me. I see this world is as unhinged as ever.  
Will it ever cut us a break, I wonder?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Right~? I'm not asking for rupies to rain from the sky,  
but like, have you seen all the talent I've got?  
Can't some mogul toss me a chellerific roll of cash or two sometime?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. The proverbial angel of fortune.  
  
**Chieru：**  
\"Angel\"...?  
Since when do you go in for fancy metaphors like that, Doc?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Probably just seeing things on her deathbed.  
Let her R.I.P.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Simpletons. I speak not of heavenly spirits.  
The angels of business I refer to  
are private investors who provide capital to emerging enterprises.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh-huh...  
Honestly, that \"investors\" and \"capital\" stuff?  
It sounds about as alien as the holy angle.  
  
**Yuni：**  
To provide an analogy... Members of the nobility often adopt  
struggling artists or musicians to cultivate their future talent, yes?  
In the simplest of terms, this is the business version.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Those who offer support to promising young startups—  
in the jargon of financial circles, they're known as \"angel investors.\"  
  
**Chieru：**  
Aww, sounds sweet!  
I wanna meet an angel of my very own!

**Chieru, Yuni & Chloe：**  
Coming soon: The Angelic Foundation  
and the Saintly School Lycéennes.

So this is St. Theresa's Academy for Girls.  
Now I'm getting excited! Ohohoho!
