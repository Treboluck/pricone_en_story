**Yuni：**  
Hrm?! I sense abnormal readings!  
Everyone, hold your attacks! Beware the enemy's movements!  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
CHERU... GAGA... GAH...!  
Damage... Severe. Component Output... Heavily Reduced.  
This Spells Chellin' Trouble.  
  
**Chieru：**  
The bot's in chellin' trouble! It said so itself!  
  
**Yuni：**  
I see...  
 If it says so, then so it must be.  
Good. Attention, all troops!  
Friendbot X is on the verge of collapse!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pff... Took long enough, didn't it.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Friendbot X... You chelled your best.  
You even exceeded your nyatural abilities...!  
  
**Akino：**  
As your creators, we're deeply proud!  
Friendbot X, the lessons you've taught us  
will surely serve us well next time!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
What \"next time\"?!  
Do you have any idea how much this project cost?!  
Akino, you'd better look over our massive pile of bills later!  
  
**Yukari：**  
And Tamaki... \"Exceeded its abilities,\" my foot.  
I hope you're ready to explain all the unnecessary features you added!  
  
**Tamaki & Akino：**  
...Yes, ma'am.  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
Bi-bip... Power Core: Full Release.  
Friendbot X: Entering Final Mode.  
If I'm Going Down, You're Going With Me.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hm? What?  
Did anybody hear what the robot just said?  
  
**Friendbot X：**  
CHE... RUUUUUUUUUUUUUN!  
  
**Chieru：**  
It's rebooted again?! And it looks even stronger!  
  
**Chloe：**  
No. Please. Just stop. So don't wanna hear this.  
Hey, Doc. What was that about collapse?  
Wasn't the bot on its last legs? Hadn't we cornered it?  
  
**Yuni：**  
A cornered rat may bite the cat.  
An all-too-common occurrence in a battle's final stages.  
Stay on your guard, young Tamaki.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Why me specifically?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
*sigh*... Look, okay, whatever.  
Point is, if we beat it this time, it'll actually die, right?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Indeed. As such, this is the final clash.  
Follow me, young Chloe, young Chieru!  
Let us seize glory in the name of the Yuni-ettes!  
  
**Chieru：**  
That's right!  
Let's seize glory in the name of the Friendship Club!  
  
**Akino：**  
Don't forget us! Mifuyu, Yukari, Tamaki!  
Let us bring an end to this battle  
on our honor as the Mercurius Foundation!  
  
**All：**  
Yeahhhh!
