# The Predictable Progression
Yuni's proposition is an autonomous flying contraption with photographic capabilities that she dubs the \"Floaty-Woaty Yunicopter.\" However, it malfunctions mid-demonstration and activates its own self-destruct feature, leaving Yuni with a unanimous No Rupie verdict.
  
## Subtitle: The Predictable Progression
  
**Narration：**  
Chieru and Chloe's pitches have both crashed and burned,  
leaving Yuni as the Friendship Club's final hope.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Kill me. Ugh. I really can't even.  
That verdict made literally no sense at all.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Perhaps you should have considered selling products.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well, for the moment, at least you tried!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Pff... They served me a diss parade  
and had the nerve to act like *I* was the rude one.  
  
**Chieru：**  
With Chloe, they aren't insults, just razor-sharp digs.  
If you don't set her off with gags or jabs or teasing,  
she honestly doesn't even bite that much.  
  
**Yuni：**  
And you would know, young Chieru, given your propensity  
to provoke her with all of the above.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, as if you don't. Gags, jabs, dumb plays for attention—  
you've got 'em all covered too, Doc.  
If I'm biting, you're gonna be as full of holes as her.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Aw man... We're batting zilch for two...  
  
**Chloe：**  
This enterprise stuff ain't easy...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well, do not despair, my young friends.  
You still have much time yet to learn.  
Your failures today will serve as stepping stones to new horizons.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh? What's up, Doc?  
You're sounding almost like some kind of upperclassman.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Which indeed I am—an elder role model for you both.  
As such, I have a duty to live up to your expectations.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Young Chloe, young Chieru.  
For both your sakes, I will prevail where you could not.  
I'll ensure that we conclude this lesson victorious.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, Yuni...!  
 I'm so sorry. I guess I had you all wrong.  
I always assumed you were just some kind of weirdo spirit  
haunting this school because you had no friends, but I was wrong!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Dang, Yuni...  
 I'm sorry. When I scold my li'l bros,  
I always scare 'em by saying \"Do you wanna end up like Yuni?\"  
but I'll put that all behind me. I'll tell 'em you're a real human.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, sweet suckling infants!  
If you revere me any further, my underdeveloped chest may burst.  
I can scarcely restrain my cheeks from reddening.  
  
**Yuni：**  
In the terms of the layfolk: you flatter me, baybeh.  
Now, the time is nigh.  
Your idol Dr. Yuni must take her place in the shining spotlight.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Excuse me.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ehm, so you're...  
 Miss Yuni, is that right?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Indeed. Third-year at St. Theresa's, Yuni of the Ivory Tower.  
Please feel free to address me as the venerable Dr. Yuni.  
I will not rebuke you.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'm smelling yet anyother whole new flavor of annyoying.  
Are there any non-crazies at this school?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  We're counting on your support.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yukari：**  
Not you *again!*  
What's going on? Is this your job today or something?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, he is a cherished junior and research assistant of mine.  
I'm informed that your members have long been partial to his charms,  
so I brought him in the hope that it would aid me in achieving your favor.  
  
**Akino：**  
Should you be admitting that?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
This pattern... I think I knyow what's coming next.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Young lad, present these ladies with the goods.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It's only a trifling gift, but please accept this.  
`Tag 2`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Not another blatant bribe?!  
What is it this time?  
 An envelope...?  
Huh? Seems like just paper inside. Don't tell me it's... hard cash?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
An actual cash bribe?!  
That's a nyo-go! Like, it's actually straight-up illegal!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Then why, Tamaki,  
 are you eagerly inspecting the contents?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hm...? Wait, what's this?  
...A photo?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Indeed. A magical imprint upon high-grade paper,  
decorated with my signature. It's what those in young  
Chieru's circles might call an \"autographed pinup.\"  
  
**Mercurius Foundation：**  
It really was a \"trifling gift\"...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well, the proud Yuni-ettes will soon leave their mark on history.  
And that snap features the autograph of their first guildmaster.  
Considering its future value, it may indeed serve as monetary incentive.  
  
**Yuni：**  
However, do not let it affect your judgment.  
I wish only for you to offer me fair treatment,  
in accordance with the principles of this fine institution.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Huh...? This girl... She's kidding, right?  
She doesn't *actually* think this will work as a bribe, right?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
This one-two-three punch of weirdos is frazzling my whiskers.  
Is this school really gonna be okay...?  
  
**Akino：**  
I donate to this academy to invest in bright young talent,  
but they seem to be raising crazy young terrors instead...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Indeed.  
 It is I, the Crazy of St. T's.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Why does she look so proud of that...?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, look—my compatriot has completed the preparations.  
That's my cue to begin the pitch.  
  
**Akino：**  
That looks like... what, exactly?  
A round saucer fitted with wing-like attachments?  
  
**Yuni：**  
I'm very glad you asked.  
This is the product that you ladies are about to witness  
in an exclusive sneak peek. I call it...

**Yuni：**  
The Floaty-Woaty Yunicopter!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Floaty Woaty...  
 Um, what?  
  
**Yuni：**  
\"Yunicopter.\"  
 I spied upon the latest developments that may or may not  
have been underway in the field of engineering and reconstituted them  
on my own initiative into a fresh magical interpretation.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
So, um, I get the \"Yuni\" part, but what the heck's a \"copter\"...?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Who knows.  
  
**Yuni：**  
The minutiae of engineering do not concern scholars of the humanities  
like myself.  However, the fanciful tales that engineers tell featured  
a pleasant-sounding contraption of similar name, so I appropriated it.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I'm not sure I follow...  
But anyway, this \"Yunicopter\" product...  
Can you explain what it does?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Let me see.  
Perhaps in the case of you ladies,  
 it will be easiest  
if I describe it as a miniaturized airship.  
  
**Yukari：**  
An airship? In such a tiny form factor?  
Are you saying this thing can actually fly?  
  
**Yuni：**  
As an early prototype, its output leaves something to be desired,  
but a brief demonstration is no trouble. Observe.  
  
![503800402.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/503800402.webp)  
**Tamaki：**  
Whoaaa?!  
Nyo way! It really is flying!  
And it moves faster than I thought, too!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Very impressive!  
I was beginning to give up hope on today's pitches,  
but it looks like we may finally have a viable candidate!  
  

---  
  
`image display end`  
**Akino：**  
Oh, outstanding!  
A truly outstanding invention!  
  
**Yuni：**  
I stand on the unwitting shoulders of neighborly giants.  
Please don't grant me such undue credit.  
My incredible contributions are yet to come.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
That's nyot even the end of it?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Of course.  
This project's main focus still lies ahead of us.  
Now, dear ladies, do you recall the photographs I bestowed upon you?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Frankly, I was trying my best to forget.  
Are they relevant somehow?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hahah. Try not to let your jaws hit the classroom floor.  
For those photographs  
were taken by this Floaty-Woaty Yunicopter!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Cry out in sheer amazement.  
**Choice: (4)**  Smash a hole in the floor with your jaw.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yukari：**  
Huh...? What was that for? The very exaggerated cry of shock.  
I mean, with that timing, you just look like a paid shill...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hahah... A perfect reaction, just as we rehearsed. They say effective  
product pitches are akin to theater. Which makes me the director.  
Ladies of the Mercurius Audience, let's hear a round of applause.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huhhh?! Wh-why did you hurtle face-first into the ground?!  
Please stop! We don't need you to kill yourself overreacting!  
Who told you to do that?! Not that I even need to ask!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm... I did request a spectacular reaction, but perhaps we went too far.  
It may have been a mistake to ask him to picture young Chloe  
fully hyperactive and chelled in the head as a point of acting reference.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Yuni：**  
Ah well. Let me explain further.  
This Yunicopter is enchanted with a number of magical algorithms.  
  
**Yuni：**  
The most basic charms are to provide lift and thrust, as well as  
photographic capabilities.  
 These charms are then further calibrated  
to activate under specific conditions.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hmmm... Nyope, I don't get it.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Apologies. Let me use the layfolk's terms.  
Uhhh...  
 It flies around and takes pretty pictures.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
We're not three-year-olds!  
I mean, I do think the product itself is intriguing...  
  
**Akino：**  
So, if it goes into full production,  
it will allow our customers to photograph distant scenes  
from the safety of their own homes, yes?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Precisely. Indeed, it was the thought  
\"I don't wanna go outside!\"  
 that led me to arrive at its conception.  
Though as a working prototype, it still has a few issues to overcome.  
  
**Akino：**  
You claim that it flies and takes photos all on its own,  
but would you be able to demonstrate that functionality for us all?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Naturally that is my intention.  
Well then, would anyone like to propose  
a target for it to capture on film?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
How about a cat?!  
Make it snyap some pictures of cats!  
  
**Yuni：**  
A cat, you say...  
 Interesting. An agile and elusive target.  
The ideal opportunity for my Yunicopter  
to demonstrate its tracking functionality.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well then, my dear {player}.  
I'm sorry to always work you to the bone, but...  
  
**Yuni：**  
...So here we have it.  
  
**Cat：**  
Meow!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ehm... My intrepid co-researcher has brought us  
the half-feral feline Mr. Puss-Puss  
that has lately taken to inhabiting our school grounds.  
  
**Akino：**  
My dear {player}...  
Are you all right? Your face seems positively covered in scratches...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Thank you, my compatriot!  
Your noble sacrifice... Your blood and tears...  
May they never be forgotten!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Now, moving on quickly.  
 Let me input the Yunicopter's objective.  
By applying a number of conditions,  
we can teach it to focus on feline targets.  
  
**Yuni：**  
When we are done, my trusty Yunicopter  
will perceive cats as photogenic, and snap them doggedly on sight.  
There will be no escaping it.  
 It will chase them to the ends of the earth.  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Well,  
 perhaps I exaggerate.  
The ends of the earth may be too far.  
Its magical charge would elapse first.  
  
**Yukari：**  
That's still incredible!  
 What remarkable technology...  
  
**Yuni：**  
If only academic societies were so eager to accept my theses.  
...Now, the setup is complete.  
Let's begin the practical demonstration.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Floaty-Woaty Yunicopter, go forth!  
Target the feline, and snap it until the end of days!  
  
**Cat：**  
Meow!  
  

---  
  
**Yunicopter：**  
Biiiing! Target: \"Cat\" Sighted And Identified!  
Initiating Auto-Tracking Mode!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It talked!  
It's a tiny little flying chatterbox!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes—to entertain and inform any onlookers,  
I saw fit to install my beloved mineral, the talking stone Rosetta,  
as a passenger... I mean, a special feature.  
  
**Rosetta：**  
Capturing Photograph! Capturing Photograph!  
  
**Akino：**  
How fabulous!  
Why, it's keeping perfect pace with the creature,  
and rapidly photographing it from every angle!  
  
**Rosetta：**  
Capturing Photograph! Capturing Photograph!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Amyazing! What an incredible innyovation!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes, my pilfered mechanism...  
Er, my inspired invention is most functional.  
Heheheh... Wretched fools. I can't wait to see the looks on their faces.  
  
**Yuni：**  
This will teach those closed-minded gearheads  
to tell me  
 \"Etymologically, wouldn't Yunipter be the correct name?\"  
and such outrageously petty observations.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hmph. Scientific types are always this way.  
Their minds are as inflexible as dirt.  
I should number from zero rather than one? Hah. See how much I care.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Wh-what's gotten into this girl?  
She's suddenly muttering like a petulant child...  
  
**Yuni：**  
\"Yunicopter\" sounds a thousand times better than \"Yunipter.\"  
This is about aesthetics. Spirit. Gut feeling. I informed those sciencey  
dullards that the literary tradition sticks its tongue out at their critiques!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I... I see... Sounds like you've been through a lot...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh...? But isn't considering etymological roots  
more of a literary concern than scientific?  
  
**Yuni：**  
That's just the kind of fastidious retort that I despise.  
You're a science type, aren't you? Learn the ways of the heart!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Mya-myah?!  
Wh-what's this thing doing?!  
  
**Akino：**  
...Hmm?  
Tamaki, is something the matter?  
  

---  
  
**Rosetta：**  
Biiiing!  
New Candidate Resembling Settings Identified!  
Adjusting Objective! Proceeding To Track Target!  
  

---  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I-I'm nyot the kitty-cat you want!  
Go snap the other one! That cat there!  
Wh-where do you think you're aiming?!  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh my...  
 What's going on here?  
The Yunicopter is chasing our dear Tamaki around the room!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. Perhaps my specifications were too vague.  
Come to think of it, I did just input general factors such as  
pointy ears and incessant meowing.  
  
**Rosetta：**  
Ears—Tail—Meow Rate Analysis: Felinity Exceeds 50%!  
Lazily Defining Target As: Basically A Cat!  
Proceeding To Pursue To Ends Of Earth!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
You've got it all wrong!  
I'm a cat, but I'm not your kitty!  
Please just stop chasing me already!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Dear me. Try to calm yourself, young Tamaki.  
If you do not flee,  
my Yunicopter will have no reason to give chase.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Actually... Tamaki has, um... you might call it a phobia?  
I can't go into the reasons,  
but she instinctively hates being monitored or recorded.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yuni, please stop that contraption!  
At this rate, Tamaki will scamper around the school,  
causing chaos wherever she goes!  
  
**Yuni：**  
That *would* be a problem.  
 Understood.  
  
**Yuni：**  
\"OK Yunicopter.\" Adjust your settings.  
The target you're pursuing is \"not a cat.\"  
  
**Rosetta：**  
Biiiing! Warning To Dr. Yuni!  
Access To Setting Adjustments Denied!  
All Changes Rejected Until Lock Expires!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm?  
 Oh... I remember.  
I did lock the settings to avoid malicious tampering.  
Dear me. The precautions of the past are a curse upon the present.  
  
**Yuni：**  
\"OK Yunicopter.\" You scientific dullard.  
This is an urgent order. Requesting flexible operation.  
Adjust your settings at once. That is not a cat!  
  
**Rosetta：**  
Bi-bing?!  
Not A... Cat...? Target Is... Cat... But Target... Is Not... Cat...?  
Biiiing! Definition Conflict Detected! Logic Error! Logic Error!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Excuse me?  
Hold on, Yunicopter. Don't give up so easily.  
Wait. Uh-oh. Don't tell me you're triggering *that* protocol?  
  
**Rosetta：**  
Be-beep! Fatal Error Detected...  
Activating Conflict Resolution Protoc— Ba-boop... Bip...  
  
**Akino：**  
Excuse me? Miss Yuni?  
What exactly is happening now?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. By the by, ladies.  
Have you heard of the theory that the world  
was created by a monumental explosion?  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh...?  
  
**Yuni：**  
In the fabric of history, even the rise and fall of nations  
is a sequence of creation and destruction.  
For the new to arise, the old must be laid to ruin.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  And in layfolkese?  
`Tag 6`  
**Yuni：**  
The old is about to end.  
Ladies, ready yourselves for impact. If you can cast barriers, do so.  
As I explained, this Yunicopter is a prototype with several failings.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
What're you getting at?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
The logic eludes me.  
It's a black box of engineering nonsense.  
But I daresay those dullards would phrase it thus...  
  
**Rosetta：**  
Activating Self-Destruct Sequence!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Inventing is... a blast.  
  
**Mercurius Foundation：**  
Huh?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eeeek!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wh-wh-what just went the big kaboom?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, don't look at me. Pff... Nearly jumped outta my skin.  
  
**Chieru：**  
H-huh?  
I thought I heard a super adorable squeal around here just now.  
Who could that have been?  
 Huh? D'you think she's okay?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Beats me. You prob'ly imagined it.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well, as you see,  
my Yunicopter has burst into flames like the phoenix,  
so I must conclude my product pitch forthwith.  
  
**Rosetta：**  
Blorf... Ladies, The Verdict, If You Will?  
  
**Akino：**  
That's a No Rupie.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
A No Rupie from me.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Definitely No Rupie.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyot a single rupie.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Final answer: No Rupie.  
`Tag 7`  
**Yuni：**  
Most aptly put.  
  
**Narration：**  
With the Floaty-Woaty Yunicopter's maiden voyage  
going down in flames,  
the product proposal received a sound rejection from all present.  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Thus, I return.  
I did my very best as the Yuni-ettes' last hope,  
but there was an unexpected hitch...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, Doc, good to see ya. Care to rub my shoulders?  
  
**Chieru：**  
I'm feeling hungry, so run along and buy me a sandwich!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oh, sure! I'd love to! ♪  
  
**Yuni：**  
...is *not* my response. Really now.  
Must you force your heartbroken idol to play along with a tired gag?  
What became of the air of awe and respect with which you saw me off?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Nonetheless, I must admit  
I sadly failed to live up to your high expectations...  
Yes, I cannot fault you. Please accept my apology.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh?  
I mean, no biggie... Not like us two did any better.  
  
**Chieru：**  
That's true! We're all as hopeless as each other!  
Doesn't that sound best? It's so like us!  
Isn't that right, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  All hopeless, all the best of friends!  
`Tag 8`  
**Yuni：**  
M-my beloved juniors...!  
 I'm so deeply moved...!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ain't this the sweetest?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Sappily ever after.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well then, better head home.  
Oh, Chieru, lemme throw the creepy doll in the trash for ya.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Don't you dare!  
Yuni & Chloe were kind enough to build her for me,  
so I'm keeping this li'l cutie for life! She sleeps in my bed now.  
  
**Yuni：**  
A sleep-learning course in Chellish?  
That sounds like a recipe for nightmares.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, that's good. Like, think about it?  
Let's put the creepster on the Merc girls' pillows while they sleep.  
We'll get our revenge by chelling up *all* their damn heads.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Mercurius Foundation today, Chellurious Foundation tomorrow!  
Cheru~n! ☆  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes, it's a plan.  
This will be a bold new step for our guild.  
I call it \"Revenge of the Yuni-ettes: A Proud Foundation Falls\"!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yes, that's right!  
It's called \"Revenge of the Friendship Club: A Proud Foundation Falls\"!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Why do I hear a terrifying plot taking shape in the hallway?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Let's hope it's just a joke...  
and keep all our bedroom doors firmly locked at nyight.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Whew... That was the last pitch, right?  
It's a relief that...  
 well, I can't claim this went smoothly,  
but we made it through, at least.  
  
**Yukari：**  
When Mother Hilda asked us to tutor at a prestigious academy,  
I didn't know what to expect at first, but...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Some of the pitches weren't so bad,  
and even failures are nyice experience for the kids,  
so I'd call this lesson a success!  
  
**Akino：**  
...A success, you say?  
This lesson is far from over yet.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Mya-myah?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh? Wait. Akino...?  
  
**Akino：**  
My dears, have you forgotten this project's original objective?  
This is a Special Lesson in Entrepreneurial Spirit!  
  
**Akino：**  
True, none of our candidates earned a rupie investment today.  
However! Can we really be happy to leave it at that?!  
  
**Akino：**  
If we do not set a fine example for our students,  
how can we call ourselves tutors?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ah... When Akino gets like this, it never ends well...  
  
**Yukari：**  
I thought she was keeping herself under control this time...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Here we go again, I guess...  
  
**Akino：**  
Let's unite the strengths of the Mercurius Foundation  
and give our students a demonstration!  
Show them what a truly magnificent business idea looks like!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Enyough vague declarations.  
What are we actually doing?  
  
**Akino：**  
Haha. Well, let's see...  
Tell me, Mifuyu, Yukari, Tamaki.  
Which of the students we saw today stuck in your minds?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Well, um...  
  
**Tamaki, Yukari & Mifuyu：**  
...The Friendship Club.  
  
**Akino：**  
As I thought, we stand united in our opinion!  
In that case,  
 we must begin at once!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Seriously, begin *what?!*  
  
**Akino：**  
To gather the finest ideas, bring them together,  
and produce something still greater!  
Is that not the fundamental rule of business?!  
  
**Narration：**  
With Akino's proclamation echoing confidently through the room,  
the Mercurius Foundation set about preparing one final special lesson.
