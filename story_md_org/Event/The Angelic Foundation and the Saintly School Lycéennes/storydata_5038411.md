## Subtitle: High on Youth Magic
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm, so today our lesson is complete.  
Many things happened, but in the end, I'm sorry to see it go.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Congratulations on your graduation, Doctor Yuni!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Gonna bawl.  
Knowing I'll never see the Doc again  
makes my eyes leak 7 trillion liters of brine.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, the fun of the sports festival!  
Ah, those battles with Friendbot X!  
Today, this class says farewell to our academy!  
  
**Yuni：**  
...is *not* what we're here to say.  
Must you force me to engage in an extended comic farce?  
My academic pursuits are far from over. It's only this lesson that's ending.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ohhh, is that all? Teehee-cheru! ☆  
That's great news! Yuni's never graduating after all!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Chieru, don't worry.  
Yuni's with us for the long haul.  
She never finishes a single thesis.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Huh? Are you suggesting I'll be held back a year?  
  
**Chieru：**  
So yeah, that's enough of the merry \"girl talk.\"  
  
**Yuni：**  
What?! Merry girl talk, you say?!  
S-say these things sooner! So this is the stuff of legends...?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
I never knew...  
To think that the sparse diary of my empty youth  
had already been blessed with the floral magic of feminine dreams...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Please, my juniors.  
Taunt me with more allusions to academic failure.  
I crave the magic of youth. So taunt me! Now!  
  
**Chloe：**  
You all right too, {player}?  
The special lesson's almost over. Try not to have regrets.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Chloe's so right, {player}!  
 You can't miss this chance  
to burn the ultra-cutie Chierun into your eyeballs!  
Cheru~n! ☆  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hahah... Is this what the layfolk call \"getting blanked\"?  
Ah, the magic of youth surrounds me!  
How beautiful friendship is! Noble Yuni-ettes, shine on!  
  
**Chieru：**  
You said it, sister!  
Friendship Club forever!  
Ain't that the sweetest thing~?
