# Isle of No Escape
As they work together to catch a mighty fish, the group begin to adapt to the castaway life. When they find a boat on the beach, they attempt to leave the island, but suddenly become drowsy and find themselves right back where they started.
  
## Subtitle: Isle of No Escape
  
**Narration：**  
Finding themselves somehow stranded on an unknown beach,  
{player}, Tamaki and Mifuyu have decided to split up  
and explore the immediate vicinity.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Any luck, Tamaki? Did you find any signs of life?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Actually, I did! I found a whole bunch of cats!  
Big kitties, little kitties, stripy kitties and spotty kitties...  
And they were so eager to play with me! It was adorable...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I see... Well, that certainly sounds like good news...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Wait, no it doesn't! Is this the time to be playing with cats?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I... I did keep my eyes peeled for people, too!  
But as far as I could tell, there was nyobody to be seen!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I see. Well, that matches my experience, too.  
I saw a few small animals like dogs, but no sign of human life.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
How about you, {player}?  
From that forlorn-looking face, I suppose you had no luck either.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
*sigh*... Nyow I'm starting to feel pretty hungry, too...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Good point. I don't know the exact time of day, but it must be  
close to dinnertime.  
 Since we lost our boat along the way,  
we don't have any fish... What should we do for food tonight...?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ah... I think I just saw a big fish out there in the sea!  
{player}, Tamaki, let's work together  
and see if we can catch it!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
{player}, get into the water and chase the fish this way.  
Then I'll flip it out of the water with my spear,  
and Tamaki, you catch it when I do!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Got it!  
C'mon, {player}, chase that fish our way!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm coming for you, fishy!  
**Choice: (2)**  Ew... it's all slippery...  
`Tag 1`  
**Mifuyu：**  
That's right, {player}! You're doing great!  
Keep it up like that!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Mifuyu：**  
You don't have to grab the fish yourself!  
Just chase it in my direction!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Here goes! Tamaki, get ready to catch the fish once I flip it!  
Hyaaaahhh!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'm on it!  
Caaaaaaaatch!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
The fishie is miiiiiiine!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Excellent work! Let's cook it and dig in right away!  
I'll rub some sticks together to make a fire!  
I didn't do all sorts of part-time work for nothing! Hyaaaahhhh!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Whew... That was delicious...  
I feel like the cat that got the cream!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Heheh... You know, the three of us  
might be pretty well suited to the castaway life!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ooh! Don't you think these fluffy grass piles  
look like the purr-fect sleeping bags?!  
Let's rest up here for tonight!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Good call. We've all worked pretty hard today...  
It's time we gave our bodies a rest.  
Good night, everyone!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Morning's here!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
These grass bags were even comfier than I expected!  
Now then... If we could just find some way to get off the island,  
I'd have no complaints...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh yes—there was an area I didn't get to explore yesterday.  
I tried to go there, but there were monsters prowling around,  
so I decided it wasn't efficient.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Well then, let's wake ourselves up properly  
by sharpening our claws on some monsters!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yes, that's a fine idea!  
This way, everyone. Follow me!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
As I thought... Those monsters are still around.  
Let's teach them a little lesson!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRRAAAAGGHHH!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myahah! You're nyot gonna scare us like that! Hip-huppety hop!  
Kitty... Cat-aclysm!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Well, that was easier than I expected...  
Could it be these monsters are incredibly weak?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Well, all the better. Time to explore the area.  
Let's see, what's over this way... Oh?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Look! There's a raft lying on the shore!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
You're right! D'you think we can use it?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yes! The logs are tied together firmly...  
I can't see any problems. Let's head out to sea on this!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
All righty! To the open seas we go!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Whew... With these winds, the raft's just sailing along!  
I guess that's it for our desert island life!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
While we don't know the island's exact location,  
I expect if we head north, we should be able to reach the Marjan Coast.  
It's a good thing I took on a navigating job once upon a time!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
For a while there, I was really worried...  
But in this gentle wind, I'm sure we'll be fine!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Whew... Such a relief...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yes... I'm feeling so relieved, it's actually making me drowsy...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It's all this comfy sunlight's fault  
that we wound up stranded there in the first place...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
It really is so warm... and comforting...

**Tamaki：**  
Unnhhh...  
 Myaaaaagh?!  
We're back at the beach where we started?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
H-huh?! Wh-what happened to our raft?!  
{player}, wake up!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Urgh... I let my guard down...  
Why did I let myself fall asleep again...?  
  
`image display end`  
**Tamaki：**  
Actually, we should nyever have trusted a raft like that!  
We need a proper boat that's not going to sink!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
You're right... But we were lucky to even find a raft.  
We're hardly going to just stumble across an actual...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ahhhhh! There's a boat lying over there on the beach!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
No way?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
It's true...  
There's a small boat, and it's in fully working order...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I wanna get back to Landosol right now!  
Mifuyu! {player}! Let's try this one more time!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
A-all right! This time, let's be careful to stay awake...  
OK, we'll set off at once!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ahhh... The wind feels so good...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
This boat is much sturdier than that raft,  
so I'm sure it can handle the waves.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Still, we certainly did luck out, didn't we?  
This time, I'm sure we'll be fine!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
*yawn*... Thank goodness... We're finally safe... Myahhh...  
  
![500500101.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/500500101.webp)  
**Tamaki：**  
Myagh! Nothing's safe about this at all!  
We're back where we started again!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
H-huh?! The boat's gone too...  
Are you telling me I fell asleep after all that?!  
  
`image display end`  
**Tamaki：**  
Seriously, Mifuyu?! Again?!  
You should be more responsible as our captain!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I think you'll find you fell asleep before I did!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'm a cat! Sleeping's what we do!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
But what are we going to do nyow...?  
If even that boat's nyo good, we might need a full-on ship...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
We'd need a real miracle to just stumble across...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ah! Mifuyu!  
 There's a gigantic cruise ship,  
the kind with luxury rooms and a pool and entertainment,  
washed up on the beach over there!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
You have *got* to be kidding me, right?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nope! I think fate's rewarding me for all my good deeds!  
We've got to try this one out, right?!  
If we don't get home, everyone'll be worried sick!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
...Well, I suppose... Since it's such a huge ship, and so sturdily built...  
All right, then. Let's set sail!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myahoooo! So huge! So fast! This is the best!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
If this ship can't get us back home, I'm pretty sure nyothing will!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yes... We could hardly ask for a... more... certain...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It's the... perfect...  
  
![500500102.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/500500102.webp)  
**Tamaki：**  
Myaaarghhhhh!  
Even the ship was nyo good?! We're back here yet again!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Wh-what can all of this possibly mean...?  
  
**Narration：**  
Finding that all attempts to leave the island ended in failure,  
the three castaways were completely at a loss for words.
