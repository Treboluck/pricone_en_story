At a seaside resort where rumors abound of an island that grants wishes, Tamaki and Mifuyu suddenly become sleepy and pass out. They awaken to find themselves... on a desert island?!
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myahah! The beach awaits!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I hate water, so it's nyot like I'm gonna swim, but I love the beach!  
Yakisoba noodles, shaved ice, taiyaki! Beach cafes are a treasure trove of treats!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
What are you talking about, Tamaki? Only amateurs waste  
their finances on tourist traps.  
 On a work trip, we'd have funds  
to spend, but a private outing calls for thriftiness!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
You're no fun at all, Mifuyu...  
Summer's a time to break out of your shell  
and let your true desires run free!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
My true desires, you say...?

**Tamaki & Mifuyu：**  
Coming soon: Tamaki and Mifuyu's Desert Island 0-Rupie Life!

**Mifuyu：**  
Oh! In that case, I want to visit bargain sales every day!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Then I'll live in a cat-filled paradise,  
with more taiyaki than I could ever eat!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Wouldn't that be the purr-fect life?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
It sure would be something!
