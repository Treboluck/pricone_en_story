Another Island Whale to fight!  
But that's nyo problem for us. We'll send him flying into next week!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Wait a moment, Tamaki!  
This whale seems somehow different from the one we fought before!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
You're right... There's a fierce gleam in its eyes,  
like a cat who hasn't eaten in weeks...  
Let's keep our wits about us!
