# The Terrible Truth
In a cave on the island, the group come across an abandoned notebook, and learn that they have been captured by the illusions of an Island Whale—a gigantic monster that feeds on human desires. Meanwhile, Akino and Yukari arrive on the island and begin the search for their guildmates.
  
## Subtitle: The Terrible Truth
  
**Narration：**  
Hoping to develop their island further,  
Tamaki, Mifuyu and {player} set out to explore a cave  
that they have not yet ventured inside.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
To make even more of this island our own...  
The Tamaki Explorers have returned!  
  
**Cats：**  
Meow!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hold on, Tamaki.  
Could you not mix me up in this strange new team of yours?  
Still, this cave certainly seems to have been around for some time...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It's got a weird sort of atmosphere.  
Oh, I knyow! Let's make this our very own temple!  
Then we can be worshipped as gods! I'll be the cat goddess!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh, that does sound nice!  
But I'm tempted to make it a hot spring bath.  
Bathing in a cave like this has a certain appeal, doesn't it?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ooh, that's nyot bad either!  
Cave-bathing sounds like a profit opportunity...  
Hmmm... Which is best...?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Tamaki, what's that on the ground?  
**Choice: (2)**  Mifuyu, watch where you step.  
`Tag 1`  
**Tamaki：**  
Hmm? Oh, nyicely spotted!  
Is this... a sheaf of paper?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Good point. I wouldn't want to trip over anything...  
 Oh?  
There's something lying on the ground...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mifuyu：**  
It's rather old and tattered, but this is a diary!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Then we've finally found our first sign  
of other people here before us!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Very true!  
 But what could have happened to the owner?  
I haven't seen any particularly nasty monsters around...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Let's read the diary and see what it says!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Yes... Let's see now...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
\"Some time has passed since our pirate crew washed up on this island.  
My crewmates are partying the days away with reckless abandon,  
but I alone investigated the island and uncovered its secret.\"  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
\"This island is in fact a gigantic monster.\"  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
\"The island seems to grant dreams, but the truth of the matter  
is that all the wonders we enjoy within its bounds  
are illusions created by this great Island Whale.\"  
  
**Tamaki：**  
O-oh nyo! What a shocker!  
B-but actually, I guess things have been  
going unnyaturally well since we washed up here!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Now that I think about it, the Tamaki Palace and my training dojo  
do seem bizarrely well-crafted for the work of cats.  
We were being deceived from the very beginning...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Even so... If it seems totally real to the both of us,  
can you really call it just an illusion?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Well... N-never mind that.  
Let's read a little more.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
\"Many times I have tried and failed to escape from this beast.\"  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
\"Though for a time my crewmates enjoyed their time here,  
soon they grew weak, and died one after another.\"  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
\"The Island Whale is a monster that feeds on the desires of men.  
As such, it lures humans with strong desires onto its body.\"  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
\"And then, those who set foot here are drained of their desire,  
and ultimately of their very lives...\"  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Then... if we stay here, we're all going to die?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh—wait! There's still more here!  
\"However, one day, I had an idea.  
I am a weak man, so I cannot defeat the Island Whale.\"  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
\"So instead, I tried to negotiate with the beast.  
If it released me, I told it, I would spread word of the island,  
so that others filled with desire would return in my place.\"  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
\"And my plan was a success.  
Before I depart, I leave this journal here as one final record  
of the truth I have learned in this foul place.\"  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
...I see...  
So that's why we heard those rumors back on the coast...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
But hey, if this journal's for real,  
that means the Island Whale can be bargained with, right?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
In that case... Our next step should probably be...  
  
**Narration：**  
Meanwhile, back on the Marjan Coast...  
  
**Tourist：**  
Wh-what's that flying this way?  
A bird? A monster? No...  
  
**Tourist：**  
Waaahhhhhh!  
An airship is about to land on the beach!  
Everyone, get back!  
  

---  
  
**Akino：**  
Ohohoh!  
We have made our grand arrival on the Marjan Coast!  
There's no means of transport faster than the Wisteria airship!  
  
**Yukari：**  
A-Akino, I think this may be going a little overboard...  
  
**Akino：**  
Not at all! This is an emergency situation!  
I will make use of all means at my disposal!  
  
**Akino：**  
Now then...  
This is the area where Tamaki and Mifuyu were last seen  
before their disappearance.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hold on a minute. I'll go ask at the beach cafe over there  
to see if anyone's heard anything.  
Excuse me!  
  
**Yukari：**  
A-Akino! I found some information at the boat rental stall!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Apparently, the two of them rented a boat along with a young man.  
According to the records, his name was {player}...  
...Wait, {player}?! N-no way!  
  
**Akino：**  
Sir {player} was here as well?!  
So, what, the three of them sailed out together and never returned?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hmph... That's not fair at all... How could they leave me behind?  
Wait, I guess I'm the lucky one, since they went missing...  
  
**Akino：**  
Still, why would they go missing around here?  
From what I hear, the waters have been calm lately...  
What could have happened...?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, there is one other interesting thing I heard.  
Apparently there's a rumor going around here recently.  
Something about an \"island that grants wishes\" in the waters nearby.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Perhaps the three of them managed to find it.  
The rumor did say it attracts those who have strong desires...  
  
**Akino：**  
An island that grants wishes... Hardly the most plausible notion.  
But if it does exist, I can see how the profit-hungry Tamaki and the  
efficiency-obsessed Mifuyu might find themselves drawn towards it.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Most of the people who've gone missing were sailing south,  
so the island must be in that general direction.  
  
**Akino：**  
Well then, let us set out in the same direction ourselves!  
We sail for the island that grants wishes!  
Excuse me, Mr. Boat-Lender? Could we rent a boat for our own use?  
  
**Akino：**  
Ah—naturally we will be taking  
the highest-grade vessel you have available!  
  
**Akino：**  
Now, let us go forth into the waves!  
Yukari, picture your greatest desire.  
If we are to reach our goal, we must let our desires go unchecked!  
  
**Yukari：**  
I want to find a wonderful boyfriend!  
  
**Yukari：**  
S-someone like {player}, for instance...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, and I'd like to drink till I drop every day!  
  
**Akino：**  
I wish for the further success and prosperity  
of House Wisteria and the Mercurius Foundation!  
  
**Akino：**  
And someday, I will turn this into the world's greatest guild!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Mmrnhhh...  
  
**Akino：**  
...Zzzz...  
  
**Akino：**  
Unhhh... Ah! Where am I?! This is an oddly deserted island...  
I suppose it must be our destination. Despite that sudden drowsy spell,  
it seems we achieved our goal quite easily.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hey, Akino...  
Doesn't this place seem to have an awful lot of cats?  
  
**Akino：**  
Why, you're right.  
What's more, they seem to be exchanging some kind of currency!  
  
**Cat：**  
Meow!  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh my, whatever could this be?  
Do you wish to trade those coins for something of mine?  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, I see—you like this precious jewel, do you?  
I would part with it for a price of twenty coins, let's say!  
  
**Cat：**  
Meow!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Y-you're amazing, Akino...  
Do you always carry jewels around?  
  
**Akino：**  
I never leave the house without at least two hundred carats  
of precious stones in my accessories alone.  
A true merchant must be ready to do business anywhere!  
  
**Yukari：**  
All of a sudden, I feel struck  
by the injustice of class inequality...  
  
**Akino：**  
Now! We must proceed to explore this strange island!  
And then... Tamaki and Mifuyu!  
We are coming for you!
