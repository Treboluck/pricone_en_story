# Land of Dreams
As they explore the desert island, Mifuyu comes across an unmanned shopping district with all kinds of goods on sale, while Tamaki finds a fully-automated taiyaki maker. Declaring that this is the island of their dreams, the two resolve to make a life here.
  
## Subtitle: Land of Dreams
  
**Narration：**  
Abandoning their hopes of sailing off the island,  
{player}, Tamaki and Mifuyu return to the task  
of exploring their new home.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Now then... We've gathered plenty of food,  
so I think it's time we explored the island's center.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Nothing will change if we don't take action,  
and there's still a chance we'll find people deeper in.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hmmm... I'm nyot sure there's much point in going,  
but I don't have any better ideas.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
*pant*... *pant*... We've come quite a ways...  
This island is bigger than I thought...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
But the scenery's been the same this whole way...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ooh! Look, another cat! Aren't you a little cutie! ♪  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh, please... Could you forget about the cats  
and try to find something more useful?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Something like what...?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I really need to get off this island, and soon!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
W-well, I knyow that!  
I'm sure the other Mercurius Foundation members are worried sick...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
If I don't get back soon...  
I'll miss the big bargain sale in Landosol!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...Huh? Bargains?  
*That's* why you want to get back?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Well, of course! Bargains are a big deal! No, they're outright war!  
What kind of mercenary deserts in the face of battle?!  
Bargains to me are as important as my own life!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
R-right... Well, to each their own, I suppose...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Urghh... Bargains... My bargains...  
I haven't seen one in so long, I'm getting withdrawal symptoms...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ahhh...! Bargains! Bargains!  
I don't care how or what, I just need to see a bargain sale!!!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Mifuyu... A-are you OK...?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Huh? I think I see some buildings over there.  
Looks tidier than the rest of the island...  
But there's no sign of people.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh, there's some kind of flyer here. What's this?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
What is it, Tamaki?  
What does that flyer say?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyo... This must be some kind of mistake.  
I've never seen a flyer like this...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Let me take a look too. Let's see...  
  
**Flyer：**  
\"We're holding a bargain sale on bargain sales!  
Buy our 90%-off coupons at 90% off!  
Regards, your friendly neighborhood unmanned shopping district.\"  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Wha... Wha... Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaat?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
A-a-a-a-a-  
a \"bargain sale on bargain sales\"?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Coupons for 90% off available at 90% off...  
But that means... It's basically 99% off, right?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I've never seen a bargain like it! How wonderful!  
A bargain sale on bargain sales...  
This is the stuff dreams are made of! I'm in heaven!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
E-ehhh...?! Y-you're not making any sense...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hmm? What's this...?  
There's some kind of machine hidden in the grass over there...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
\"Automatic Taiyaki Maker for Cat Lovers\"?!  
Wh-what is this contraption?!  
I've nyever seen anything like it!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I-if I twist... this key...  
Oh! The machine started rumbling!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
A pile of steaming taiyaki came out!!!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Where did all these cats come from?!  
Hey, kitties! You like this taiyaki, do you?  
Here, eat on up!  
  
**Cat：**  
Meow!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Huh? What's this coin...? I'm nyot sure where you found it,  
but are you trying to pay me?  
  
**Cat：**  
Meow!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myahahah! Well, thank you!  
I guess this must be the currency these cats use?  
What a purr-fect reward!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
If I use this machine,  
cats everywhere will love me... and I'll be rich to boot!  
It's a double whammy!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
This is no island, it's a paradise!!!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Tamaki, this seems fishy.  
**Choice: (2)**  Mifuyu, try to calm down.  
`Tag 1`  
**Tamaki：**  
Nothing's fishy about this at all! The world's a big place!  
Why shouldn't there be an Automatic Taiyaki Maker for Cat Lovers  
out there somewhere?!  
It's like this island was made for me!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Mifuyu：**  
No, you're the one who needs to calm down and think!  
They're selling 90%-off deals at 90% off!  
Do you have any idea how amazing that is?!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mifuyu：**  
This really is an island of dreams!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Yep, yep!  
I'm gonna found a Kitty Kingdom!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
A fine idea! Let's create a utopia of our very own!  
A land where everyone can live in luxury  
and enjoy efficient peace and security!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
The future's so bright!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Tamaki, what about escaping?  
**Choice: (5)**  Mifuyu, we have to get back home.  
`Tag 4`  
**Tamaki：**  
We can escape later! There's no time for that nyow!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh no, that wouldn't be an efficient move at all!  
Let's think about how to improve our lives here!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Tamaki：**  
Don't worry! While we're living a life of luxury,  
I'm sure someone will come and find us!  
  
**Narration：**  
As Tamaki and Mifuyu basked in the discoveries of their dreams,  
{player} could do nothing but stop and stare.
