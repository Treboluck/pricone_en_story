**Majimun：**  
...!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Punchy-punch! ♪  
Done already?  
We're still going strong here!  
Another hundred or thousand won't change anything! ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yeah, no. That's way too many.  
Seems like it's ready for one last hurrah, though.  
  
**Maho：**  
Aye... Its presence is making my ears and tail tingle.  
My legs are shakin'. Just standing is a struggle!  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's as serious as can be!  
Our souls'll go bye-bye if we slip up for even a second!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yeah. I'm terrified, in all honesty.  
I wanna run away right this second.  
  
**Makoto：**  
But you're not the only one ready to end this, you know.  
We're gonna show you what real determination looks like!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Yeah. It doesn't matter how strong it is.  
We'll win, no matter what!  
  
**Maho：**  
My prince. Kaori. Makoto.  
Arthur and everyone else, too.  
We all need to pool our strength together!
