Ryukyu-Ken Spiral Shot!  
I-I won!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I know I conjured them up,  
but they sure were strong!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'm beat!  
But I can still aim even higher!  
  
**Kaori：**  
As for now, though, I'm gonna lie down on the beach and rest.  
It'd be great if I had a nice, comfy, pillow,  
but I'll just have to imagine that I do.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hm? How come the sand's so comfy?  
...{player}?  
Is that your lap I'm lying on?  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'm not imagining this, right?  
Aha! This feels great. You can't beat the real thing. ♪
