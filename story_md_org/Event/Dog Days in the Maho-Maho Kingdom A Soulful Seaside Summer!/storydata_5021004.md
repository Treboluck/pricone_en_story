**Narration：**  
Having reclaimed Arthur, the party sets  
out to recover the rest of Maho's plushies.  
  
**Maho：**  
The plan is for us to split into two groups.  
I assume we're all fine and dandy with that?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Sure thing!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yup. Makes sense now that we know how to proceed,  
and that'll help us deal with the sheer number of plushies.  
  
**Maho：**  
I'll leave Makoto in your capable hands, my prince.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  No problem.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll take good care of her.  
`Tag 1`  
**Maho：**  
You really are as reliable as they come, ain't ya?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey now. If anything, I'll be the one protecting him.  
I mean, sure, he is reliable...

`Tag 2`  
**Makoto：**  
Wh-where'd that come from?!  
You should save those sort of lines for Yui!  
  
**Kaori：**  
You're as red as a tomato, Makoto. ♪  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Maho：**  
Anyway, let's meet up later.  
We'll rendezvous at the beach before sunset.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Don't let yourselves get distracted, okay? ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Look who's talking!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sheesh.  
C'mon, let's get going.  
We're checking out the wharf, which is farther into the village.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hmm. Nothing seems out of the ordinary here.  
Notice anything on your end?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Guess not, judging from your expression.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh well. No sense in wandering around aimlessly,  
so let's wait for a bit and see what happens.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hm?  
What's wrong? You can sit down, you know.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Sit I will.  
`Tag 4`  
**Makoto：**  
You feeling nervous or something?  
Don't worry.  
I'll protect you if anything pops up. ♪  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Oh? It's rare to see a young couple here.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Couple?!  
N-nah, you got it all wrong!  
Who are you, even?!  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Oh, just a regular old lady.  
I haven't seen you folks around before, so I came by to make  
sure you're not trying to do anything funny with our boats.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh, makes sense.  
Sorry about that, miss. I guess we are kind of suspicious.  
That's not the case, though. We're with Caon—  
  
**Old Lady：**  
It's fine, it's fine.  
I'm not senile enough to interrupt a young couple on their date.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Didn't I just tell you that's not the case?!  
{player}! Back me up here!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I have no idea who she is.  
**Choice: (6)**  I'll take good care of her.  
`Tag 5`  
**Makoto：**  
U-uh...  
I wasn't expecting you to put that much distance between us.  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Makoto：**  
That's literally the opposite of what I asked!  
You gotta...  
Argh! Whatever!  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Old Lady：**  
Hohohoh. I jest.  
Do take care, though. A Majimun was spotted around here.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh, so you heard about all that?  
That Majimun is why we're here, actually.  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Oh?  
I assume it's more than just a simple test of courage, by the sound of things.  
  
**Makoto：**  
You seem like you know your stuff,  
so mind if I ask you a question?  
What exactly is a Majimun, anyway?  
  
**Old Lady：**  
I haven't seen one myself, alas.  
All I can tell you are the legends passed down here.  
  
**Makoto：**  
That's fine.  
We need as much info as we can get right now.  
  
**Old Lady：**  
The term \"Majimun\" refers to evil spirits, yokai,  
and all sorts of terrifying things.  
It's said that they appear in all shapes and forms.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Just like Kaori said.  
What makes them steal people's souls, then?  
They must have a reason.  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Who knows?  
All I can say for sure is that Majimun are attracted to benevolent souls.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Benevolent souls...  
That might explain why the plushies were targeted in the first place...  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Regardless, don't flirt too much, okay?  
Otherwise you'll attract a Majimun yourselves.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Enough with that already!  
  
**Makoto：**  
So much for finding clues about the plushies, I guess.  
She didn't see any around either.  
  
**Makoto：**  
What's our next plan of action?  
It's starting to get late, so should we meet up with the princess and Kaori?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey, what's with the blank stare?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Look over there.  
`Tag 8`

**Lancelot & Gawain：**  
...  
  
`image display end`  
**Makoto：**  
Huh? Those are the princess's plushies...  
Lancelot and Gawain!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hm? Wh-what is it?  
Am I not allowed to remember their names or something?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Don't give me that look!  
I know what you're thinking, and it's wrong!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Argh, we ain't got the time for this!  
Let's go!  
  
![502100005.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/502100005.webp)  
**Lancelot & Gawain：**  
...  
  
`image display end`  
**Makoto：**  
Hey there, Lancelot. Gawain.  
The princess is super worried about you two.  
  
**Makoto：**  
We just gotta give them a good scare, right?  
Let's do it!

**Lancelot & Gawain：**  
...!  
  
`image display end`  
**Makoto：**  
Tch! They're both coming at us at once!  
And they're fast, to boot!  
  
![502100005.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/502100005.webp)  
**Lancelot & Gawain：**  
...!  
  
`image display end`  
**Makoto：**  
Guess they don't want us getting too close!  
{player}! Stick by my side!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Got it!  
`Tag 9`  
**Makoto：**  
Actually, don't stick too close!  
My swimsuit's kinda coming loose...!

`image display end`  
**Makoto：**  
Shoot! We let them close the distance!  
What's going on?! It's like something's entering my body!  
  
![502100005.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/502100005.webp)  
**Lancelot & Gawain：**  
...!  
  
`image display end`  
**Makoto：**  
I'm losing all my strength!  
This is bad. Are they taking my soul?!  
{player}, run!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  No can do.  
`Tag 10`

**Makoto：**  
What're you...?!  
Why are you coming closer?  
Aaaahhh?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Y-you're way too close!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Quit it! This isn't right...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ahhh! Calm down! Calm down, Makoto!  
He does realize I'm in my swimsuit, right?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Both of us can feel all sorts of stuff like this!  
What the heck's going through his head?!  
  
![502100402.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/502100402.webp)  
**Makoto：**  
Huh...? Why's he bringing his face closer?  
No way... This can't be happening...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Is he really gonna...?  
  
**Makoto：**  
I'm sorry, Yui!

**Makoto：**  
?!  
Huh?

**Makoto：**  
Lancelot and Gawain are back to normal?  
  
**Makoto：**  
I feel a lot better, too...  
How come?  
  
**Makoto：**  
...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ohhh, now I get it!  
You did that to help me, didn't you?  
And I fell right for it,  
which pushed the Majimun out of my body.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Makes sense, yeah.  
Come here for a sec, will ya?  
  
**Makoto：**  
What if my soul had popped out along with the Majimun?!
