# Anima Purification
After entering the forest where the Majimun was spotted, the party is attacked by one of Maho's plushies, Arthur. Though unable to fight one of Maho's precious plushies at first, Kaori uses knowledge from her homeland to defeat the Majimun.

**Narration：**  
The party asks around the fishing village for clues  
regarding the Majimun, only to hear about sightings  
of floating plushies.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey.  
You don't think...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hm...  
Ideally it'd just be a coincidence, but that feels like wishful thinking.  
  
**Maho：**  
Did they all run off and become bad kids?  
  
**Makoto：**  
H-hey now.  
Nothing's been confirmed yet.  
  
**Maho：**  
There ain't no excuse to be stealin' people's souls.  
If there's even a chance that it's true, then I...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's believe in them.  
`Tag 1`  
**Maho：**  
Believe in them?  
  
**Makoto：**  
He's right.  
It doesn't matter if they're really involved or not.  
If we don't believe in them, then who will?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Yeah!  
Well said, {player}! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Either way, it'll be okay!  
It's said in my homeland that benevolent spirits make their  
homes in objects that've been treated well!  
  
**Kaori：**  
If that's really true,  
then there's no way those plushies would become bad kids! ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
For sure. You talk to them and brush their hair every day.  
There's no way they could do anything bad after being treated that well.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hehe. Thanks, y'all.  
You're right. I oughtta believe in them.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh. We're almost at the area it was sighted.  
Sheesh. Having to walk through a forest in my swimsuit isn't what I  
had in mind when we talked about coming to the beach.  
  
**Kaori：**  
This is where things went down, so there's not much else we can do!  
More importantly, I wonder if there's any goya around here?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Much as this place might resemble your homeland, I doubt it.  
Look around. It's just trees, grass and a plushie.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  A plushie?  
**Choice: (3)**  There's bugs, too.  
`Tag 2`  
**Makoto：**  
Yup. Right over th—  
Wait, what?!

**Makoto：**  
Ugh, no! Keep them away!  
Wait, that's not the point!  
I just said something weird, didn't I?

**Maho：**  
Arthur!  
  
**Makoto：**  
That's your plushie, for sure.  
It really is floating! The heck's going here?!  
  
**Maho：**  
Arthur! Can you hear me?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Princess! Watch out!  
  
**Makoto：**  
There's real bad vibes coming from that black aura  
surrounding the plushie—I mean Arthur.  
  
**Makoto：**  
It might really come after our souls.  
  
**Maho：**  
But...!

**Maho：**  
My prince?!  
I can't believe you used your body as a shield!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Looks like it's on the offensive!  
Good stuff, {player}!  
I'll leave the princess to you!

**Makoto：**  
This is gonna be tricky, though...  
I don't have it in me to harm the princess's plushie!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Don't sweat it!  
  
**Maho：**  
Kaori?!

Gotcha! ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Kaori! Watch out!  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's fine, it's fine. ♪  
This is the best way to handle this situation. ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
WAH!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Whoa?!  
Don't raise your voice out of nowhere!

**Maho：**  
That black aura is leaving Arthur's body...?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  You okay?  
`Tag 6`  
**Kaori：**  
Always am! ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
What the heck did you even do?  
Far as I can tell, you just shouted.  
  
**Kaori：**  
That's pretty much it.  
  
**Kaori：**  
They say in my homeland that  
you drop  
your anima when you're given a shock.  
  
**Maho：**  
Anima?  
That means your soul, doesn't it?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Yup!  
It'll pop right out of your mouth if you sneeze, too. ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Your homeland sure sounds wild.  
But man, I can't believe that solved it.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Okay, Arthur!  
Back to Maho you go. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Arthur! Welcome back...  
I can't thank you enough, Kaori.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  It's great that he's back.  
`Tag 7`  
**Maho：**  
Thanks for protecting me too, my prince.  
Are you okay? Still got ahold of your soul?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Princess! His heartbeat's got nothing to do with his soul!  
You're way, way too close!  
  
**Makoto：**  
And you should at least try and push her away a bit!  
Sheesh...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Either way,  
it really was possessed by something in the end.  
  
**Maho：**  
I noticed a snake-lookin' thing pop out of Arthur's body  
after Kaori hollered and spooked it.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Majimun have different forms based on different legends.  
Snakes are the most common out of them.  
  
**Maho：**  
Which means everyone else has been possessed by that Majimun...  
  
**Makoto：**  
That's a pretty safe bet, given the circumstances.  
Man. This ain't gonna be easy,  
given just how many plushies there are.  
  
**Kaori：**  
We know what've got to do now, at least. ♪  
That makes the rest a lot simpler!  
  
**Maho：**  
Aye.  
Kaori's right.  
  
**Maho：**  
Just wait, everyone.  
I'll save each and every one of you.
