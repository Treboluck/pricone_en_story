**Makoto：**  
Today marks the end of our vacation, huh?  
Sure feels like it flew right by.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aww. I haven't had nearly enough fun!  
And the sea's still calling for me!  
  
**Maho：**  
Aye.  
I'm still in the mood to play some more myself.  
But summer'll come around once again.  
Let's focus on the present and make sure  
we've got no regrets. ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yup!  
All right. Kaori, Princess! Let's have a little swimming competition!  
You too, {player}!  
Don't worry if you can't swim well.  
It's all about having fun!  
  
**Kaori：**  
You sure are fired up! ♪  
I'm not about to lose a swimming contest, though.  
I'm gonna win this and make it an even more memorable summer!
