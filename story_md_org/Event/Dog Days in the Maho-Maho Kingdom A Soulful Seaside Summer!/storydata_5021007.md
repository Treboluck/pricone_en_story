**Maho：**  
Would y'all mind  
gatherin' up for me?  
  
**Makoto：**  
What's up, Princess?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Are we all gonna dance together?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hm? Didn't realize you were here too, {player}.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Now we really gotta dance! ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's dance, Kaori.  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's dance, Makoto.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaori：**  
Woo! ♪  
Makoto can play some music for us! ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
No chance that's happening!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Makoto：**  
Huh?! Where'd that come from?!  
Are you for real? Then, uh,  
guess we might as well...  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'll play some music for you, then! ♪  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Maho：**  
Yes, yes.  
Dancing's all well and good, but there's somethin'  
I'd like to give y'all first.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Something you'd like to give us?  
  
**Maho：**  
Aye. I caused a whole lot of trouble for y'all, didn't I?  
So I figured I'd repay y'all.  
Not just for that, but for everything else as well.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ohhh... Is this a plushie of me?  
It's super cu— Err, it's super well made!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Wow! I'm so happy!  
You really are good at making stuff!  
  
**Maho：**  
Glad y'all like them.  
Kasumi was over the moon, too.  
Sure was worth it.  
  
**Makoto：**  
You really didn't have to go out of your way, though.  
It's not like we did anything special.  
  
**Kaori：**  
We just followed our hearts. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
It's fine.  
This is my way of conveying my feels.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Your feelings?  
  
**Maho：**  
Aye.  
My way of sayin' that y'all are precious to me.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Thanks so much, Maho!  
Now we really gotta dance!  
Come on, Makoto!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey, quit tugging!  
Fine, fine! I get it!  
  
**Maho：**  
Heehee.  
Oh, my prince.  
Terribly sorry for the wait.  
  
**Maho：**  
This li'l one's for you.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Thanks.

**Maho：**  
Would you mind takin' this, too?  
  
**Maho：**  
It's a plushie of me.  
  
**Maho：**  
I wouldn't mind takin' care of it myself.  
  
**Maho：**  
But, well.  
I'd be mighty happy if someone else cherished it.  
  
**Maho：**  
You said it yourself, right? That feelings don't go unfulfilled.  
I'm sure both myself and this plushie would be  
real happy if  
you cherished it.  
  
**Maho：**  
Can I leave it in your care?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'll treat it well.

**Maho：**  
Thanks, my prince.  
  
**Maho：**  
Should it ever come to have a benevolent soul,  
I'm sure it'll keep you safe.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hm? What about a plushie for myself?  
Don't worry. I've already got everyone here. That, plus—  
  
**Maho：**  
I've always entrusted you with the duty of protecting me. ♪
