# The Maho-Maho Kingdom on the Beach
Maho brings her plushies along to the beach, setting them all down in their own spot before going off to play with everyone else. When the party returns, however, it turns out that every last plushie has disappeared.
  
## Subtitle: The Maho-Maho Kingdom on the Beach
  
**Narration：**  
The crew hop on a boat and cross the ocean,  
arriving at their destination. Once there,  
they change into their swimsuits and get ready to enjoy the beach.  
  
**Maho：**  
I'll need protection from the rays.  
It's time for the ol' parasol from Landosol.  
  
**Maho：**  
There we go.  
Been a li'l while since we last went out. The wind feels mighty  
fine, too. If there was ever a time for a swim, it's now.  
  
**Makoto：**  
*huff, puff*  
I can't believe we had to lug every single  
plushie at the guildhouse along with us.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Now that's what I call a warm-up!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey, Princess.  
What made you bring these all in the first place?  
  
**Maho：**  
Come now, Makoto. These li'l ones are part of the Caon family.  
It'd be terrible if we left them back home.  
  
**Kaori：**  
She really treats those plushies well.  
And hey! The more the merrier. ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
I know just how well she treats them.  
But I gotta admit, they do look extra cute when lined up on the beach like this.  
  
**Maho：**  
Well, I'll be!  
Glad you understand just how charming they are. ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
I mean, come on.  
It's not like I hate cute stuff or anything.  
  
**Kaori：**  
If anything, you're more attached to them than most of the other members.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Kaori! Don't go running your mouth like that!  
A-ahem.  
S-speaking of other members,  
we gotta talk about Kasumi.  
  
**Makoto：**  
The princess went to the effort of arranging all this,  
but Kasumi had the nerve to refuse  
because her books could get damaged.  
  
**Maho：**  
Don't worry that pretty li'l head of yours now,  
Makoto. Much as  
I'd have loved for her to join us,  
I reckon we'll have a much easier  
time relaxing knowin' that the guildhouse is in her safe hands.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I mean, you're not wrong...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You feeling lonely?  
`Tag 1`  
**Makoto：**  
Wh-where'd that come from?! As if!  
  
**Maho：**  
Besides,  
take a gander over there.  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's the ocean! Time to swim!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Holy! She dove in at lightning speed!  
  
**Maho：**  
Right?  
You just hafta to  
go all out and enjoy it.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yeah, fair enough.  
I'm surprised you knew about this place, though.  
Sure feels a lot different from the Marjan Coast.  
  
**Maho：**  
Kaori tells us all sorts of things about her homeland, doesn't she?  
I reckoned she'd enjoy somewhere  
with a similar atmosphere, so I did some diggin'.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You're as kind as always.  
`Tag 2`  
**Maho：**  
Always a pleasure to be praised by you, my prince.  
I wouldn't mind if ya kept it up, in all honesty.  
  
**Maho：**  
Let's start with the swimsuits we brought.  
Perk those ears up now, Makoto.  
The praise'll be comin' any second now.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Why's *that* the topic you had to choose?!  
Hey, you! Quit staring!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You both look cute in them.  
**Choice: (4)**  Quite the alluring pick, I'd say.  
`Tag 3`  
**Makoto：**  
Q-quit it already!  
  
**Maho：**  
Hehe.  
That's my prince for ya.  
Always honest.

`Tag 4`  
**Makoto：**  
You better not be looking at us with pervy eyes!  
  
**Maho：**  
He is a boy, after all.  
Happy as I am, though, it is a li'l bit embarrassing.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Kaori：**  
Hm? What's up? You're both red as a tomato.  
More importantly, {player}! Let's go for a swim!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Huh? You're still not used to swimming?  
Oh, right.Amnesia and all that!  
But don't worry. I'm right here with you! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Look! There's nothing to be afraid of.  
Ease yourself up and you'll be able to float. ♪  
Okay, I'll let go now.  
There!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Kaori! He's drowning!  
Totally drowning!

**Kaori：**  
Oh no. Grab onto me!  
That's it. Don't panic. Just relax.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hehe. All calmed down now?  
Then it'd be nice if you eased your grip a bit.  
My swimsuit's just about to come off.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Sorry.  
**Choice: (7)**  Just a bit longer...  
`Tag 6`  
**Kaori：**  
Don't worry. I'm the one that rushed you.  
Okay, ease yourself up again.  
Relax. It's all about being relaxed.

`Tag 7`  
**Kaori：**  
It's okay. I'm sure you were scared,  
so hold on for as long as you want.  
It'd be nice if you held onto a different part of me, though.

**Maho：**  
How are our stomachs holding up, y'all?  
What say we head back  
and get ourselves some lunch?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sounds good to me.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Sure wish they had goya here.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Don't worry. I made lunch with that in mind.  
Though it's a goya veggie stir-fry, not the real thing.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Anything you make is perfect to me. ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sheesh. You've sure got a way with words.  
Hm? What's got you frozen up like that, Princess?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Is something wrong, Maho?  
  
**Maho：**  
Why...?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Princess? What's the deal...  
Hold up. What's going on here?  
  
**Kaori：**  
The parasol means this  
is definitely our spot, right?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sure, we weren't looking and all,  
but there's just no way.  
  
**Kaori：**  
They're definitely all gone, though.  
  
**Maho：**  
Everyone...  
  
**Maho：**  
Where did all the li'l ones go?  
  
**Narration：**  
Maho and co. stared in disbelief at the area where Maho's plushies  
had initially been lined up, not a single one left anywhere in sight.
