**Maho：**  
Makoto, Kaori!  
There's too many of them!  
They'll get us good if we deal with them individually!  
  
**Maho：**  
It's okay to attack them—  
  
**Makoto：**  
No it's not!  
  
**Kaori：**  
We can't do that!  
  
**Makoto：**  
We've seen you take care of them every single day!  
  
**Kaori：**  
We'll save them, and keep them in top shape while we're at it! ♪  
  
**Maho：**

The darker it gets, the harder it'll be for us to deal with this.  
We oughtta do somethin', and fast.  
  
**Maho：**  
I planned this trip in the hopes that everyone could relax,  
but they've all been helpin' me out instead.  
  
**Maho：**  
We haven't made any  
proper summer memories together yet.  
  
**Maho：**  
That ain't right.  
I'm Caon's guildmaster. It's time I act like it.  
  
**Maho：**  
Sorry, my prince.  
Mind if I have Arthur and co. back?

Didn't we rescue them already?

It's like they're protecting Maho of their own will!

**Makoto：**  
Look!  
The Majimun are leaving all the other plushies as well!  
  
**Kaori：**  
They can't control them anymore, so they've got no choice. ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
That settles everything, then!

No. Not yet.

The Majimun are all gathering up!  
  
**Majimun：**  
GRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Makoto：**  
You gotta be kidding me.  
They're turning into one giant monster!  
  
**Kaori：**  
There's mega power coming from it!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I can feel my strength being sapped away just through proximity!  
Is it trying to steal as many souls as it can?!  
  
**Maho：**  
It doesn't matter.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Princess?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Uh-oh. She's angry.  
  
**Maho：**  
This thing took my friends and corrupted 'em.  
I reckon a li'l bit of payback in is order.  
  
**Maho：**  
We're lookin' to make some good memories, ain't we?  
Takin' this thing down sounds like a fine way of doin' that.  
  
**Maho：**  
Everyone! Let's go all out!  
  
**Maho & Makoto & Kaori：**  
Yeah!
