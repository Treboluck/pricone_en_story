Jun attempts to put a stop to a strange commotion in the palace, but the culprit behind the chaos remains unclear. Who could be behind it all? Only the knights of Nightmare can see that justice is served!
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hey, Tomo!  
Don't you think Captain Jun's been acting weird lately?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Yes... You're not wrong.  
She hasn't been herself at all.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
She's been showing up in the beastfolk quarter  
and acting like a total bully!  
What could've gotten into her?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
It's as though it's not even her inside that armor.  
...  
Perhaps we should ask her in person.  
  
**Tomo：**  
If she really has lost her way...  
It may fall to us to strike her down.  
  
**Matsuri & Tomo：**  
Coming soon: Ironclad Nightmare!  
  
**Jun：**  
...What's this? I hear a commotion within the palace.  
Could it be an enemy assault?  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh...? And it looks like they're no ordinary enemies.  
Hahah! We may have quite the situation on our hands!  
  
**Jun：**  
What in the world is going on?!
