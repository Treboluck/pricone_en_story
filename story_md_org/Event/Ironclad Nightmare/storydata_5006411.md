**Christina：**  
So, we reach the last day of this struggle.  
Ahhh, why must the thrill of battle ever end?  
 It pains me to see it go!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
What're you talking about?!  
Peace is what we've all been fighting for!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha... I quite agree, Matsuri.  
But the battle isn't over just yet.  
Let's keep it up until the final hour.  
  
**Jun：**  
Lend us your strength, young man.  
Together, we will stand firm!
