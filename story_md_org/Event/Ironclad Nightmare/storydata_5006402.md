**Matsuri：**  
We did it!  
T-taking down a monster like that... You guys are amazing!  
  
**Jun：**  
All thanks to this young man.  
It was his power that turned the tide.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Yes, we have a lot to thank you for.  
Without your help, we might not have made it.  
  
**Christina：**  
Well, I suppose there's some truth in that.  
Still, I'm not nearly satisfied yet!  
You'll find me at the next battle!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hey, wait up! I'm coming too!  
I'll keep fighting till peace is restored!  
  
**Jun：**  
Wait! The next enemy could be just around the corner!  
We should proceed with caution!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Good grief... That Christina is nothing but trouble.  
I guess we'd better hurry after her, too.
