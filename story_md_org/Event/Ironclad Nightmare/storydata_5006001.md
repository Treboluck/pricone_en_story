# Enduring Enmity
Worried that Matsuri has been skipping training sessions lately, Tomo pays a visit to her home in the beastfolk quarter. She invites Matsuri to join her for lunch so they can talk things over properly.
  
## Subtitle: Enduring Enmity
  
**Narration：**  
Tomo, one of Nightmare's newer recruits,  
is on her way to a district on Landosol's outskirts  
that is mainly home to beastfolk.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmm. This is the first time I've visited the beastfolk quarter,  
but it looks like any normal district. Well, I suppose that makes sense,  
since beastfolk customs are hardly any different from our own.  
  
**Tomo：**  
In fact, aside from a few animal-like traits such as tails,  
they are entirely human.  
  
**Tomo：**  
They're not like monsters...  
Beastfolk aren't going to attack me just for entering their territory.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Even so, I should be careful how I tread.  
Beastfolk have never been fond of those aligned with the palace,  
and that goes double for knights of Nightmare.  
  
**Tomo：**  
For years they suffered persecution and harsh oppression at our hands.  
This all happened before I was born,  
but still, I would be a fool to think of them as friendly neighbors.  
  
**Beastfolk Woman：**  
...  
  
**Beastfolk Man：**  
...  
  
**Tomo：**  
See, they're glaring at me already...  
I know this is an ordinary beastfolk reaction to our kind,  
but it still saddens me to be faced with such hostility.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I doubt I could lighten this mood with jokes and friendly banter.  
They'd spit at my feet and chase me out of town.  
Hmmm... What now?  
  
**Tomo：**  
I do need to ask directions.  
But most passersby seem to be armed,  
and I wouldn't want to inadvertently start a fight.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Nothing for it, I guess.  
I don't have any training or missions today,  
so I'll take my time and search.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Let's see...  
When I see a shop with a large grandfather clock,  
head down the street to the north.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ah, could this be it?  
Is this two-story house where Matsuri lives?  
  
**Tomo：**  
...So her home really is down here in the beastfolk quarter.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Waaahhh! I hate you, Mom!  
 Why don't you get it?!  
There's no way in the whole wide world Captain Jun's a bad person!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
She's my idol and aspiration!  
I'm gonna be a defender of justice like Jun someday!  
  
**Tomo：**  
...Oh? Matsuri!  
You shouldn't leap out into the street like that.  
You could get run over by a passing carriage.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wahhh?!  
Huh? Oh, hey, Tomo!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wait. Wh-what're you doing here?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Well, Matsuri... You've been skipping training, haven't you?  
I thought something might be wrong, so I came down here to find you.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Taking care of you is part of my job.  
 And besides, I was curious.  
I can't imagine a bright and energetic girl like you getting sick,  
and it's not like you at all to miss training without a word.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I was honestly worried that you might be in trouble.  
So I looked up the address on your official Nightmare documents,  
and came down to find you myself.  
  
**Tomo：**  
On my day off, I might add.  
Still, this is reassuring. You seem to be well, at least.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
E-eurgh...  
 Listen, you've got it wrong!  
It's true I live in the beastfolk quarter, but that doesn't mean I'm a...  
I mean... There's a really good explanation!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmm... I didn't want to mention it since it seemed to bother you,  
but it's always been obvious that you're a beastgirl.  
You've got animal ears under that cap, haven't you?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
O-of course not! I'm no beastgirl, honest!  
If I was, I'd have to be crazy to sign up for Nightmare,  
the guild everyone here hates, right?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ummm...  
Well, all right. There's no point interrogating you.  
  
**Tomo：**  
More to the point, this isn't a great place for a conversation,  
so do you want to head to a restaurant?  
It's almost lunchtime, so let's talk over a meal.  
  
**Tomo：**  
It'll be my treat.  
I came in first place in a swordfighting tournament recently,  
and I've still got prize money to spare.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Whaaa?! I can't let you do that!  
Although, there is something I wanted to talk about, too...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha. Really, though, I insist.  
Quickly, now... I think I see your mother over there,  
chasing after you with a face like a High Orc! ♪  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Aaagh! Mom's seriously scary when she gets like that!  
I've seen that face before when she had a fight with Dad,  
and she went so berserk, half the house was ruined!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Wooow, that's not good.  
Let's make a swift exit.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Take my hand, little princess.  
I'll escort you to safety in a jiffy! ♪  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Aahhh... I've just gotta grab your hand?  
Gotcha! Let's join hands and dash like our lives depend on it!
