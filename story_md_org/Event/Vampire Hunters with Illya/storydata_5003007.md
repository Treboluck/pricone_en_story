# An Udon Party for All
Having returned to the guildhouse, Maho and Kaori treat Illya to udon with goya veggie toppings. The sheer bitterness takes Illya by surprise, though she persists in eating it to avoid hurting their relationship.
  
## Subtitle: An Udon Party for All
  
**Narration：**  
Maho and Kaori return to Caon's guildhouse with Illya  
and {player}, where they are greeted by Makoto and Kasumi.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Welcome back.  
Pleased to see you're both safe.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Man, though.  
I feel so dumb for believing those rumors without any solid proof.  
Sorry! I shouldn't have made a big deal out of it!  
  
**Maho：**  
I-I was mighty surprised, too.  
There wasn't any legendary vampire after all. Imagine that!  
  
**Kaori：**  
R-right?  
E-entirely unrelated, let's give Illya a big welcome!  
  
**Illya：**  
Qu-quite a shock, wasn't it?  
H-hahaha...  
Thank you for having me.  
  
**Makoto：**  
...?  
Well, that was weird.  
But hey.  
We like ourselves a good guest, so feel free to kick back and relax!  
  
**Maho：**  
Now then.  
Tonight we celebrate our friendship with Illya.  
Not just with a toast, but with a lovely ol' dinner party!  
  
**Illya：**  
Ohh! Now *this* is a feast!  
Certainly worth waiting for!  
  
**Maho：**  
The main dish is udon with goya veggie toppings.  
Me and Kaori made it together!  
  
**Illya：**  
Allow me to judge the taste...  
  
**Illya：**  
I-is it *supposed* to be this bitter...?  
  
**Maho：**  
We reckoned it'd be fine considerin' what you said about them before.  
Don't worry. There's plenty of other goya-based snacks, too.  
  
**Maho：**  
I even used the monster horn when making the udon.  
Turned out pretty well, too, I'd say!  
  
**Illya：**  
E-excellent!  
I can tell you put effort into this!  
  
**Illya：**  
Th-these goya-like veggies are far more bitter than I ever anticipated!  
What sort of magic are they employing to eat them so readily?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're looking a bit pale.  
**Choice: (2)**  Something up?  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
Th-these are my natural looks! Leave me be!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
N-nothing at all!  
I'm just, uh, at a loss with my emotions!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kaori：**  
You are looking a bit stiff, you know.  
Sure there's nothing wrong?  
  
**Illya：**  
Fear not!  
This is merely an expression of joy over  
friends treating me to a delicious meal!  
  
**Illya：**  
I-I can't bring myself to reveal the truth...!  
These goya veggies are by all means edible,  
but the taste is too overwhelming!  
  
**Illya：**  
I-I'm an adult, too! I should be able to eat them with ease!  
And if I don't, then it poses a risk to our friendship...!  
I can't afford that!  
  
**Illya：**  
S-simply... d-delectable. Verily...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Good to hear!  
We made a whole bunch, so feel free to ask for more!  
  
**Maho：**  
There's a famous udon restaurant in the Maho-Maho Kingdom.  
I tried to make the taste as close to it as possible,  
so do savor the flavor for me, won't ya?  
  
**Illya：**  
O-of course... Urgh.*munch*  
*munch, munch* Urghhh...!  
  
**Maho：**  
Y-you're gettin' even more pale than usual, Illya!  
Are goya veggies too bitter for you, maybe?  
  
**Illya：**  
Th-that would be ludicrous!  
Your cooking is delicious, Maho!  
  
**Maho：**  
Wow! Now that's one way to make a gal happy.  
You've earned yourself another big bowl!  
  
**Illya：**  
Gurgh.... Ugh...  
I must... persevere...!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus Illya fell further into goya veggie hell,  
all for the sake of protecting her new bonds.
