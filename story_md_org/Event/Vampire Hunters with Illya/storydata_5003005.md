## Subtitle: A Brush With the Legend
  
**Illya：**  
Tell me. What's this about slaying a vampire?  
  
**Maho：**  
What's wrong, Illya?  
Me and Kaori here are full-fledged vampire hunters right now!  
  
**Illya：**  
Vampire hunters, you say?  
  
**Maho：**  
Aye. We caught wind of rumors that a legendary vampire  
had been revived. And vampires are mighty terrifying, so someone  
had to rise up to the occasion. That was us.  
  
**Maho：**  
According to those legends, said vampire spread  
terror all through Landosol.  
  
**Kaori：**  
And it'll happen again if we don't do something about it!  
I mean, it *is* a legendary vampire after all!  
  
**Kaori：**  
That's why we're here. Vampires are weak to  
garlic and wooden stakes,  
so we went  
hunting for something even stronger!  
  
**Illya：**  
I see. And thus you deemed goya veggies and  
an udon rolling pin suitable candidates, respectively.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Actually, that gives me an idea!  
It'd be awesome if you could help us during the actual fight, too!  
  
**Illya：**  
Heh... Hehehe...  
  
**Illya：**  
Ahhhahaha!  
No can do, I'm afraid.  
  
**Kaori：**  
How come?  
  
**Illya：**  
My furry little friends.  
You wouldn't happen to know  
that vampire's name, would you?  
  
**Maho：**  
Not yet, no...  
  
**Illya：**  
Very well. Allow me the honors, then.  
  
**Illya：**  
Her name was none other than Illya Ornstein!  
Shiver and quake in fear!For the legend herself, the vampire that  
ruled over Landosol with a reign of terror, stands before you!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Illya Ornstein...  
Wait, whaaaaaat?!  
  
**Kaori：**  
You were the legendary vampire all along?!  
  
**Kaori & Maho：**  
...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hah! As if!  
There's no way a little kid could be a scary vampire!  
  
**Maho：**  
Ain't heard a joke that good in a li'l while.  
Oh. Maybe those rumors all started 'cause  
Illya was playin' pretend?  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'd believe it!  
Guess Makoto was just jumping to conclusions!  
  
**Illya：**  
You dare call me a child?  
Insinuate that I like to play pretend?  
Know your place!  
  
**Illya：**  
Very well. Allow me to show you terror incarnate.  
  
**Illya：**  
{player}!  
Your presence allows me to return to my adult form!  
And my magic reserves will skyrocket during that time!  
  
**Illya：**  
Th-that requires hugging you, so be still for me!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm not ready for that sort of action!  
**Choice: (2)**  Now, now. Let's all calm down.  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
Silence! Quit acting like a child!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
Calm down? Never!  
Accept the hug already!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Illya：**  
H-here I go! Hug!  
  
**Illya：**  
Urgh...  
Why does my heart always flutter  
so much upon hugging him?  
  
**Illya：**  
Ahh...  
M-my body... It's getting all hot...  
  
**Kaori：**  
What the?!  
She's... she's getting bigger!  
  
**Maho：**  
N-no way...  
You gotta be kidding me!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hehehe...  
I can feel my power swelling.  
My true form has been unleashed anew...  
  
**Illya：**  
Haaahahaha!  
Behold! For I am the pinnacle of all lifeforms!  
The Ruler of the Night, Illya Ornstein!  
  
**Illya：**  
You thought that moniker was a mere joke? Nay!  
  
**Kaori：**  
How could we be so stupid?  
I genuinely thought she just made it up...!  
  
**Maho：**  
Likewise...  
What's more, I thought my prince was just playing along with it.  
  
**Illya：**  
Heh heh...  
Oh, to be alive. Never would one expect  
to be saved by the very people hoping to slay you.  
  
**Illya：**  
Nor to assist them in procuring the tools  
required to do so!  
  
**Illya：**  
Heheh... Ahaha!  
What a riot, indeed! But you see, my former furry friends.  
I have little intent of accepting my end here.  
  
**Illya：**  
Now then. What say we  get started?  
  
**Illya：**  
You have your tools.  
So come at me!  
  
**Maho：**  
Ugh... We ain't got much of a choice here, Kaori...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Do we... do we really need to do this?!  
She's our friend! Our comrade!  
  
**Maho：**  
I feel the same, you know!  
Gettin' to know how reliable and knowledgeable  
she is for her size really took me by surprise!  
  
**Maho：**  
It honestly feels like we've been best buds forever now...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Same here!  
We worked together, fought together...  
So why did it come to this...?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Why did the legendary vampire have to be *her*?  
  
**Illya：**  
Yet you cannot hide from the truth.  
I am your enemy. The vampire feared by the world at large!  
  
**Illya：**  
As for myself.  
I should be able to make short work of you two.  
I *should* be able to do so with ease...  
  
**Illya：**  
Argh! This is most irritating!  
Enough talk... Have at you!  
Show me what you're capable of!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Let's not do this.  
**Choice: (5)**  Go back to being a kid for me.  
`Tag 4`  
**Illya：**  
But we *must*.  
I have no intention of giving up my life!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Illya：**  
Now, of all times?  
I'd be a fool to do so!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Illya：**  
Step back, {player}.  
This is a matter between the three of us!  
  
**Narration：**  
With their weapons at the ready, the three of them faced off, preparing to engage in what would undoubtedly be a battle for the ages.
