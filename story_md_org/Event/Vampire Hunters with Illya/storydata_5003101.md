With the dreaded vampire of legend plotting for world domination anew, Maho and Kaori take up the mantle of vampire hunters to slay the beast once and for all!
  
**Kaori：**  
Maho, this is bad!  
Real bad!  
  
**Maho：**  
Well, ain't you in an awful panic?  
Let's take some deep breaths.  
Inhale, exhale... Inhale, exhale...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Now's not the time for that!  
Landosol's got vampire troubles!  
*Legendary* vampire troubles!  
  
**Maho：**  
Vampire? Oh, I've heard of those.  
They're those mighty scary things that suck  
the blood of young princesses, right?  
  
**Maho：**  
...Wait. That means I'm in trouble!  
Am I gonna have my blood sucked?!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Not if we rise up and defeat it ourselves!  
If anyone can keep Landosol safe, it's us!  
  
**Maho：**  
You're right.  
Landosol's our second home.  
It ain't right to let a mean ol' vampire wreak havoc here!  
  
**Maho：**  
We'll do it. We'll be the vampire hunters Landosol needs!

Achoo!  
Wh-what in the world?Is someone, somewhere talking about me?  
  
**Illya：**  
Heh. Words of praise from my loyal bloodkin, no doubt.  
Oh, the woes of the beloved vampire. ♪
