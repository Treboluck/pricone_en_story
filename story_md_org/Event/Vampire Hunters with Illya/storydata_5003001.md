# The Legend Never Dies
Maho and Kaori, having learned about a vampire's weaknesses from Kasumi, set out to acquire wooden stakes and garlic. That is, until they decide they'd be better off gathering something even more effective. And thus the search for a goya-like veggie and an udon rolling pin begins.

**Kaori：**  
Righty-o! It's time to get vampire hunting!  
Fear not, Landosol! We'll protect you!  
  
**Maho：**  
Not so fast, Kaori.  
We ain't never faced no vampires now, have we?  
How d'you suppose we go about fightin' somethin' like that?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Worry not, my dear guildmaster.  
Vampires' weaknesses are well documented.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ohhh!  
Kinda like Makoto's weakness to cute stuff!  
  
**Makoto：**  
W-would you let that go already?  
Also, that's not what she meant!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
First and foremost, we have garlic.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Makes sense.  
That smell sure packs a punch.  
  
**Maho：**  
Aye. Even worse if the odor gets all into your cute clothes.  
Mighty scary, that garlic...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...I guess we've found a new weakness for you two, too.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Back on topic. While vampires are weak to garlic,  
it's only good enough to debilitate them.  
You'll have to deliver the final blow following that.  
  
**Kaori：**  
How do we do that?  
Will a good ol' Ryukyu-Ken Knuckle Cannon not cut it?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
There's a certain weapon they're weak against—wooden stakes.  
Thrust one straight through their heart, and they'll turn to ash.  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh... Does it really gotta be through the heart?  
Almost makes me feel a li'l bit bad...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
They'll keep coming back otherwise, I'm afraid.  
And let's not forget that they're vile beasts.  
Even the slightest bit of mercy can lead to trouble down the line.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Well, at least we know now.  
And knowing's half the battle!  
We should be able to put up a fight now!  
  
**Maho：**  
Yup.  
Mighty grateful for the information, Kasumi.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Good luck. I'm sure the two of you will be fine.  
  
**Kaori：**  
No problemo!  
Leave it to the pro vampire hunters!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Righty-o! Guess we can gather up  
garlic and wooden stakes while we search for the vampire!  
  
**Maho：**  
You know, about that...  
I've been havin' a big ol' think,  
and well... Are those really gonna be enough to defeat it?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hm? What do you mean?  
  
**Maho：**  
Kasumi was kind enough to tell us a regular ol' vampire's  
weakness. But this is a *legendary* vampire we're dealing with.  
Surely it ain't gonna be that simple...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Th-that's a good point!  
Now I'm all worried...  
Are plain ol' stakes and garlic really gonna be enough?  
  
**Maho：**  
My thoughts exactly.  
So...  
  
**Maho：**  
Kaori! Let's gather up somethin' even stronger!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Like what?  
  
**Maho：**  
Super items!  
Loads more powerful than garlic and stakes!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Got it! Let's have a look around town, then!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Excuse me! Is anyone around?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hello there.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaori：**  
Whoa! You scared the life outta me!  
  
**Maho：**  
Well, if it ain't my prince! ♪  
Fancy meeting you in a place like this.  
Fate really does keep bringin' us together. ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ohhh, now it makes sense.  
Didn't realize you were working here.  
But hey, that works out for us!  
  
**Kaori：**  
You wouldn't happen to have anything way more  
amazing than garlic and wooden stakes in stock, would ya?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Does ginger work for you?  
**Choice: (3)**  How about a nice spear?  
`Tag 2`  
**Kaori：**  
Nope! Ginger smells too nice!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Maho：**  
Well, that *would* be a lot stronger...  
A regular ol' weapon probably won't be enough, though.  
Sorry for wasting your time, my prince.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Kaori：**  
Hm... That didn't go well.  
Finding something super amazing is gonna be harder than expected, huh.  
  
**Maho：**  
You can say that again.  
Speakin' of. Are you okay helpin' us out, my prince?  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh. You've finished up for the day, so you'll give us a hand?  
Hehe. Thanks. Would be a waste to turn you down. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Back on topic, though.  
How do we go about findin'  
somethin' even more potent than garlic?  
  
**Kaori：**  
...Ohhh!  
Something just came to mind!  
  
**Kaori：**  
The shape and taste has way more impact  
than garlic,  
but it's super delicious stuff!  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh, really? Is it somethin' I've heard of?  
  
**Kaori：**  
They're like the goya melons we eat back home,  
so I call 'em \"goya-like veggies\"!  
  
**Maho：**  
Goya-like veggies?!  
Gosh, they sure do sound powerful!  
  
**Kaori：**  
They look and taste it, too!  
But cook 'em right and bam!  
They're delish!  
  
**Kaori：**  
They don't sell 'em often in the business district, though.  
So let's go on the hunt for some ourselves!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Might take some effort, but it'll be worth it!  
Goya veggies, here we come!  
  
**Maho：**  
Darn tootin'!  
Now we just need somethin' to surpass a wooden stake...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hm... That one's not so easy.  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh. A rolling pin!  
How does that sound?  
  
**Kaori：**  
A rolling pin?  
Is that really more special than a stake?  
  
**Maho：**  
Not just any ol' rolling pin, of course.  
It'd be an udon rolling pin,  
made using traditional Maho-Maho Kingdom crafting techniques!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Traditional Maho-Maho Kingdom crafting techniques?!  
Now that *is* special!  
  
**Maho：**  
You can use it to whack, thwack, flatten, and it even doubles  
as a weapon! A wooden stake only serves one purpose,  
so it's loads more versatile, I'd say!  
  
**Maho：**  
There's nothin' quite like udon made with one.  
Nice, chewy noodles steeped in a fine broth are just so, so...  
Whoops. I'm gettin' myself homesick.  
  
**Kaori：**  
That's so cool! If it can do all that,  
then vanquishing a vampire should be no sweat!  
How do we go about getting one?  
  
**Maho：**  
Doubt they'll be sellin' 'em around town...  
Only the real old udon stores had 'em, even back home.  
Guess that's another li'l search we gotta go on.  
  
**Kaori：**  
That's all settled, then!  
We're gonna defeat the legendary vampire!  
And we'll do it with a goya veggie and an udon rolling pin!  
  
**Kaori：**  
First up, let's go find us a goya veggie!  
  
**Maho：**  
Have you got any idea where to find one?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Nope! But we should be good if we just leave town!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Let's get going, you two!  
That vampire's just waiting to be slain!  
  
**Illya：**  
Achoo!  
  
**Illya：**  
Wh-what in the world?  
Is someone, somewhere talking about me?  
  
**Illya：**  
Heh. Words of praise from my loyal bloodkin, no doubt.  
Oh, the woes of the beloved vampire. ♪  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus Maho and Kaori's  
search for a goya-like veggie and an udon rolling pin began.
