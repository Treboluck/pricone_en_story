# Our Dear Vampire
Realizing that their friendship had developed much more than they thought, the trio lower their weapons and reflect on their journey together. That is, until the monster they had dispatched of rears it head once again, leading them to team up once more.
  
## Subtitle: Our Dear Vampire
  
**Narration：**  
Illya, having revealed her identity as the legendary vampire,  
squares off against Maho and Kaori. Will today  
truly see a battle for the ages unfold...?  
  
**Maho：**  
...  
  
**Kaori：**  
...  
  
**Illya：**  
...  
  
**Maho：**  
I'm out.  
  
**Maho：**  
I just can't do it... I can't fight her.  
So... I'm out.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Yeah... same here.  
I don't have it in me to slay a friend!  
  
**Maho：**  
Those legends may be true and all, but...  
They're just legends. We have the real deal in front of us.  
And she's no scary vampire... She's our friend!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Yeah! She's helped us loads on this journey!  
We've been through so much together, even just today!  
There's no way I'd be able to treat her as an enemy now!  
  
**Illya：**  
Well then.  
Quite the coincidence, that is.  
  
**Illya：**  
I seem to be facing the very same struggle myself.  
So allow me to opt out of this battle.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  There was never any need to fight in the first place.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm glad you guys didn't end up fighting.  
`Tag 1`  
**Maho：**  
Aye.  
We're good buds, and that's all that matters.

**Kaori：**  
Yeah! We're gonna get even closer now!  
Evil vampire? Never heard of it!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Waaahhh! Illyaaaa!  
I'm begging you! Don't stop being friends with us!  
  
**Illya：**  
My cause for world domination remains firm.  
  
**Illya：**  
But, well... I've yet to specify *when* that will happen.  
It could be a hundred years from now. Perhaps two hundred.  
Who's to say?  
  
**Illya：**  
Hehe.  
I, for one, would like to spend  
some more time with the two of you.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hear, hear!  
Don't worry! We've got plenty o' time to get to know each other!  
I'll even invite you to the Maho-Maho Kingdom!  
  
**Illya：**  
Ohh! Now *that* sounds exciting!  
  
**Kaori：**  
*sniff* I'm so glad we didn't end up fighting!  
  
**Maho：**  
We oughtta be thankful for how we met.  
  
**Illya：**  
Hehe.  
Though somewhat embarrassing to admit,  
I'm quite fond of this whole \"friendship\" business.

**Illya：**  
If anything, we may have been locked in combat already,  
had you two not saved me during our first meeting.  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'm so glad we managed to avoid that!  
But also, we'd probably still be hunting for  
a goya veggie if we hadn't met you back then!  
  
**Illya：**  
Most likely. Speaking of that, though.  
You've reminded me of Maho's run-in with those bugs.  
Now *that* was a sight to see!  
  
**Maho：**  
D-don't be laughin' at someone's trauma!  
I'll never forget that creepy-crawly sensation...  
Urgh... Just thinkin' about it gives me chills!  
  
**Illya：**  
Haha... Hahaha!  
Still as amusing now as it was back then!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hey! You had your own issues with them, too!  
  
**Illya：**  
Indeed, but only because they dared to suck my blood!  
Mere bugs, hoping for a taste of the legendary vampire herself!  
Unbelievable! Meanwhile, you seemed to be having no issues at all.  
  
**Maho：**  
And with that part of the journey over,  
we came here in search of a replacement for an udon rolling pin.  
  
**Illya：**  
Indeed. Which reminds me.  
Why did you deem goya veggies and an udon rolling pin  
as suitable replacements for garlic and a wooden stake?  
  
**Kaori：**  
We talked it out for a bit and decided that a legendary vampire  
was gonna need something equally legendary to defeat.  
  
**Illya：**  
Not to rain on your parade,  
but you never would have defeated me with those!  
  
**Illya：**  
I *do* appreciate the warped taste required  
to reach that conclusion, however. Haha...  
  
**Maho：**  
Hey! We were serious about it!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aye! Serious as can be!  
  
**Illya：**  
What if the two of you actually  
appeared before me with those in hand...  
  
**Illya：**  
Hahaha... Ahahaha!  
Goodness! Just the thought has me in hysterics!  
  
**Maho：**  
W-we probably couldn't have, though.  
It'd have been mighty difficult to tell  
who you are when you're in kid form!  
  
**Illya：**  
Oof... I don't assume that form by choice, I'll have you know!  
Reverting to my original form requires hugging  
{player}!  
  
**Illya：**  
'Tis a cruel world we live in. Truly.  
  
**Illya：**  
All that said, though.  
Our journey was an eventful one.  
  
**Kaori：**  
A real fun one!  
  
**Maho：**  
Aye. Mighty fun!  
  
**Illya：**  
Now then. It's about time we all return ho—  
  
**Garoog：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Illya：**  
What the—?! Blast!  
You dragged yourself all the way back up here?!  
  
**Garoog：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Illya：**  
Urgh! I won't make it!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hiyaaahhhhh!  
  
**Garoog：**  
GRUOOOOGGGHHHH!  
  
**Illya：**  
Kaori?!  
Thank you! I owe you one!  
  
**Kaori：**  
No sweat! I just did what friends do!  
Right, Maho?  
  
**Maho：**  
You betcha.  
Ain't no one who wants to see  
their dear friends get hurt! As for you, li'l monster,  
you've done crossed the line.  
  
**Illya：**  
Heh. Of course.  
The three of us are friends, all on equal footing.  
  
**Illya：**  
Come, trusted companions!  
This beast dares stand before us once more,  
so let us show it the full extent of our might!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Lend them your power.  
`Tag 4`  
`image display end`  
**Kaori：**  
W-woo! We did it!  
  
**Illya：**  
Indeed. And it's all thanks to your help.  
  
**Maho：**  
Never thought we'd be able to defeat a monster that strong...  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's 'cause the three of us were together!  
The power of friendship!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  You might be forgetting someone...  
**Choice: (6)**  It was actually four of us...  
`Tag 5`  
**Illya：**  
Hm?  
And who might that be?  
Please, do remind me.

**Maho：**  
Oh! How could I ever forget about my prince!  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Kaori：**  
Oops! Sorry!  
You played a big part in that, {player}!  
  
**Illya：**  
Well.  
I suppose it's only fair to give credit where credit is due.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hey, wait a minute.  
Illya, you're, uh...  
  
**Illya：**  
Hm? What the?!  
When did I return to this form?!  
After depleting my magical reserves?!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Well, we can't let a kid wander around at night.  
So come on over to our guildhouse!  
  
**Maho：**  
You'd be most welcome.  
And we'll treat you like a mighty fine guest!  
  
**Illya：**  
Very well. I see no reason to decline.  
All the more so considering our previous promise!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus, with precious new bonds formed,  
the crew make their way back to town to celebrate.
