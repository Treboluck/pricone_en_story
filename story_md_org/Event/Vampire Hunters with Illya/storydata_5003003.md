# Search for the Veggies!
The crew arrives at the forest with the goya-like veggies, but they are forced to fend off a swarm of bugs before collecting the goods. Their search for an udon rolling pin proves to be difficult, leading them to change plans and enter a cave in search of a monster horn.
  
## Subtitle: Search for the Veggies!
  
**Narration：**  
Maho, Kaori and {player}  
make their way through the jungle with Illya's guidance.  
  
**Maho：**  
*huff, huff*  
It just gets more stuffy the further in we go...  
  
**Illya：**  
Sunlight is proving to be a nonissue now,  
but I could very much do without my clothes  
feeling like they've become a part of my skin.  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'm feeling better than ever!  
This sorta heat just reminds me of back home!  
  
**Maho：**  
Reckoned you'd be used to it.  
I'm havin' some real trouble just walking  
'cause the ground's all squishy.  
  
**Illya：**  
L-likewise!  
Not to mention this obscene humidity!  
It's all so distressing!  
  
**Illya：**  
The foliage is far thicker than in times past, too.  
  
**Kaori：**  
The heat must be helping it all grow big and strong.

**Maho：**  
Eeeeeek?!  
  
**Illya：**  
Wh-what in the world?! Did something happen?!  
  
**Maho：**  
Th-there's a bug...  
There's a bug in my clothes!  
  
**Illya：**  
A bug? Blast...!  
There's far more where that came from, too!  
Stay away! Stay away, I tell you!  
  
**Illya：**  
You pesky little...!  
How dare you approach me after I've swiped you away!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Deal with Maho's bug.  
**Choice: (2)**  Swat away the bugs around Illya.  
`Tag 1`  
**Maho：**  
Gosh! Y-you can't go touchin' me around there, my prince!  
We oughtta be much, much closer before that sorta action!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
Ouch!  
Maybe you should aim for the bugs  
rather than my face, you dolt!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kaori：**  
Man, you guys are overreacting.  
They'll leave you alone if you stay still.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oh, hey! There's a bunch of goya veggies over there!  
I'll go get 'em!  
  
**Maho：**  
Someone, please... I'm beggin' ya!  
This gal does *not* like bugs!  
  
**Illya：**  
Grrr...!  
Only a foolishly foolish bug would dare  
hope for a morsel of my mighty blood!  
  
**Kaori：**  
They're gonna keep going at you if you don't stay still.  
Just chill out and enjoy the vibes.  
  
**Maho：**  
Wh-what's there to enjoy about this?!  
I-Illya! Please get this bug off my back for me!  
  
**Illya：**  
V-very well!  
Have at thee!  
  
**Illya：**  
Wah hah hah!  
Behold my power, you insignificant little—  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh.  
One got on your head!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hm...?  
Waugh! Stay away! Stay away!  
  
**Illya：**  
Grrr...  
I could wipe these little nuisances out  
with a snap of my fingers if I was at full power!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hang in there, troops.  
I'll be back with a bunch of goya veggies in a jiffy!  
  
**Illya：**  
Sh-she's awfully laid-back about this situation...

**Kaori：**  
Heave-ho, heave-ho...  
Phew. That should be plenty!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Sorry for the wait!  
  
**Illya：**  
Quick! Let us take flight from this bug-infested hellscape!  
  
**Maho：**  
Wait!  
Don't leave poor ol' me behind!  
  
**Illya：**  
*huff, huff*  
That was the worst experience of my entire life...  
  
**Maho：**  
I-I'm never setting foot in a place like that again!  
Y'all can be sure of it! Never, ever again!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Good job holding out.  
  
**Illya：**  
Now then.  
What was our next objective?  
  
**Maho：**  
The plan was to find an udon rolling pin...  
  
**Illya：**  
Hm...  
And you're sure those aren't sold in stores?  
  
**Maho：**  
Udon-making ain't a popular trade in Landosol, alas...  
  
**Illya：**  
Hm... Udon is a dish I have yet to savor myself,  
now that I think about it.  
More proof that  
finding a rolling pin will be quite difficult, I believe.  
  
**Maho：**  
Aww... Figured as much, but that still ain't ideal...  
You reckon there's anything we can use in its place?  
Somethin' long, hard, and mighty strong...  
  
**Illya：**  
Something long and hard...  
Heh... I may have just the ticket!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ooh, really? Where can we find it?  
  
**Illya：**  
My feud with the sun causes me to take refuge in  
caves rather often, you see. And one in particular  
is full of countless monster corpses!  
  
**Maho：**  
M-monster corpses?  
Sounds awfully scary, if you ask me.  
  
**Illya：**  
Verily. From what I gather, powerful monsters  
have turned it into a grave of sorts for themselves.  
And among them, naturally, are the horned kind.  
  
**Illya：**  
A cavern full of sharp, durable horns, free for the picking!  
One of them should prove a suitable replacement.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Now *that* sounds like a plan!  
Even better if we won't have to deal with live monsters!  
  
**Illya：**  
Then let us be off!  
The cave in question is conveniently nearby, so follow in my stead!  
  
**Narration：**  
With their original goal now nixed,  
the crew set off to procure a monster horn.
