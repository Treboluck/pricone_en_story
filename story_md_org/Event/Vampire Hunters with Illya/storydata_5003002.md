# No Road Is Long With Good Vampire Company
Illya crosses path with monsters while in a particularly weakened state, only for Maho and Kaori to mistake her for a child and make the save. The group hits it off immediately, and so Illya joins them on their hunt for a goya-like veggie.
  
## Subtitle: No Road Is Long With Good Vampire Company
  
**Narration：**  
Maho, Kaori and {player}, on the hunt for  
anti-vampire goods, are making their way down the road  
together. Little do they know, though, that they aren't alone...  
  
**Illya：**  
Urgh...  
The sun is overstating its presence far too much today.  
  
**Illya：**  
Mighty as I may be, this is quite the struggle...  
  
**Maho：**  
Look over there, Kaori.  
That li'l girl don't seem to be doing so good...  
  
**Kaori：**  
You're right!That's a dangerous situation if I've ever seen one!  
We gotta help her!  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh no! Incoming monster!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRRAAAAGGHHH!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hm? A monster, is it?  
  
**Illya：**  
Argh! Wretched beast!  
How dare you target me in my weakened state!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Watch out!  
  
**Illya：**  
Huh...? And who might you be?!  
Wait! If it isn't {player}!  
  
**Illya：**  
Perfect timing!  
I'd expect no less of my lovely little bloodkin!  
  
**Illya：**  
Oof...  
A-another bout of dizziness...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Stay back.  
**Choice: (2)**  You're still a kid. Don't push yourself.  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
V-very well. I leave this in your hands.  
Fight for my sake, strangers though we may be!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
A kid?! You insolent little miscreant!  
I have half a mind to obliterate you along with that monster!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Maho：**  
Stay behind us, li'l miss!  
We'll take care of the big bad monster!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Don't think we'll let you get away  
with attacking a defenseless child!  
  
**Monster：**  
GREEOOOUGHHHH!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Awesome! Down it goes!  
  
**Illya：**  
Ohhh...  
Impressive. Very impressive indeed!  
  
**Illya：**  
Urgh...  
The light, it's too much...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hey! You okay?!  
  
**Illya：**  
Barely...  
Th-this sunlight almost has me turning to dust...  
  
**Maho：**  
Gosh! Let's get her into the shade!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Here you go! Some fresh, cold water!  
  
**Maho：**  
What a happy accident, runnin' into a friend of my prince.  
It's a relief to know you're fine now.  
  
**Illya：**  
I owe you my thanks. Truly.  
It seems my body can't quite  
adjust itself to the sun yet.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Your face is so pale, too!  
You sure you don't need to go to the hospital?  
  
**Illya：**  
You dare judge my natural looks?!  
  
**Maho：**  
It's awfully dangerous for a li'l girl to be roamin'  
these parts on her own.  
How about  
we take you back to town?  
  
**Illya：**  
Worry not, my furry friend.  
I'm not quite that frail.  
  
**Illya：**  
More importantly.  
Were the three of you on your way somewhere?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Yup! We're actually in the middle of  
looking for a goya-like veggie and an udon rolling pin!  
  
**Illya：**  
Oh-ho? Quite the peculiar items, there.  
I'm ever so curious what you need them for.  
  
**Illya：**  
Oh, an idea has struck me.  
What say I join you, as thanks for your help?  
  
**Maho：**  
Really?!  
You sure about that, all things considered?  
We'd rather you not push yourself...  
  
**Illya：**  
'Tis a nonissue. I've gotten plenty of rest thanks to you.  
And if worst comes to worst, I always have {player}!  
  
**Kaori：**  
She sure likes you, huh, {player}?  
  
**Maho：**  
Never would have expected any less from my prince.  
Makes me all proud seein' how fond everyone is of ya. ♪  
  
**Illya：**  
I might just have an idea of where to find one of those \"goya-like veggies\" as well.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Wait, for realsies?!  
  
**Illya：**  
Indeed.  
I recall seeing some growing in the jungle,  
long before I awoke in these times.  
  
**Illya：**  
That *was* an age ago, however.  
Whether or not they're there now is anyone's guess.  
  
**Maho：**  
An age ago, long before you awoke in these times?  
That's an awfully funny way of saying \"yesterday.\"  
I like it.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Everyday's an adventure for kids her age!  
Even yesterday must feel like ages ago!  
But yeah. That's a bigger clue than we ever could've hoped for.  
  
**Maho：**  
We really appreciate it.  
You're such a kind li'l girl, ain't ya?  
  
**Illya：**  
Not at all.  
As they say, no road is long with good company!  
  
**Illya：**  
Ah, forgive me. Introductions are in order, are they not?  
My name is Illya,  
otherwise known as the Ruler of the Night  
and {player}'s mistress.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Haitai! Name's Kaori!  
I'm part of Caon, a guild keeping the peace in Landosol!  
Firm believer that anyone and everyone should get along!  
  
**Maho：**  
And I'm Maho, the guildmaster of Caon.  
Also the princess of the Maho-Maho Kingdom,  
but I'm livin' over here in Landosol now.  
  
**Kaori：**  
\"Ruler of the Night\" sounds so cool, though!  
I should start calling myself Ruler of the Tropical Lands!  
  
**Illya：**  
I'm not simply announcing myself as such to sound \"cool,\" I hope  
you realize...  
Also, the Maho-Maho Kingdom?  
I don't recall any place by that name...  
  
**Maho：**  
It ain't listed on any maps,  
but I guarantee that it exists.  
  
**Illya：**  
The world is vast, truly.  
I assume goya veggies are scarce around these parts?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Sure are!  
Doesn't seem like many people eat them here.  
  
**Illya：**  
I've never partaken of one myself, though rumors of  
their bitter taste have certainly reached my ears.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Yup yup, that's right!  
The bitterness and shape are just what we need, though!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hm...  
Planning on using it for a special dish, mayhaps?  
Not that it's any of my concern.  
  
**Illya：**  
As it stands, having an extra person  
will make the search much more efficient.  
And I'm more than willing to assist.  
  
**Maho：**  
Well then.  
Our journey's fixin' to get even more lively.  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's gonna be a blast!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus the group, now with an extra member,  
sets out toward the jungle in search of the elusive goya-like veggies.
