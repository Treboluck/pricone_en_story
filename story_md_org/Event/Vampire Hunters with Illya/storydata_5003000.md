## Subtitle: The Legend Never Dies
  
**Narration：**  
Today's events take place not long after  
Diabolos revived the legendary vampire Illya Ornstein.  
  
**???：**  
Heh heh heh...  
  
**???：**  
You hope to slay me with such paltry amounts of light?  
  
**???：**  
Nonsense! Utter nonsense, I say!  
None can hope to impede my awakening!  
  
**???：**  
Hahaha...  
Ahahahahaha!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hahaha... Haha...  
*yawn*  
Well. I tried, but one cannot oppose the will of their own body.  
Alas, I am oh so tired.  
  
**Alarm Clock of Doom：**  
Rise and shine? Not on my time!  
Get back in those sheets, 'cause we're gonna sleep!  
  
**Illya：**  
Thus spoke the alarm clock of doom.  
  
**Illya：**  
That said...  
I don't quite have the luxury of sleeping the day away.  
  
**Illya：**  
It's all well and good that I've been revived,  
but I'm still a shadow of my former self.  
  
**Illya：**  
Coming into contact with {player}  
will return me to my adult form, but only on a surface level.  
My magic reserves remain dry as a corpse.  
  
**Illya：**  
I can only assume my long slumber  
took a heavy toll on my body.  
  
**Illya：**  
Hm... Exercise hasn't exactly been a part  
of my daily routine since awakening, either.  
Perhaps a nice, long stroll is in order.  
  
**Illya：**  
Akari was a big proponent of the idea of exercise, as I recall.  
  
**Illya：**  
Very well! A stroll it is!  
  
**Alarm Clock of Doom：**  
Close your eyes nice and tight!  
Outside's so bright it'll give you a fright!  
  
**Illya：**  
Quiet, you!  
  
**Narration：**  
Around the same time,  
a certain rumor had made its way to Caon's headquarters.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Everyone! Stop what you're doing! I've got bad, *bad* news!  
  
**Maho：**  
What's got you flustered, Makoto?  
Ain't like you to burst in and make a scene.  
  
**Maho：**  
Don't worry that pretty li'l head of yours.  
If it's sweets that're on your mind, we left plenty for ya.  
Here, have some mame daifuku. Open wide and say \"ahhh.\"  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey now, Princess...  
Huh? A-ahhh...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Wait, no! This ain't the time for sweets!  
  
**Makoto：**  
So there I am, working away at the usual tavern,  
when suddenly I overhear these two demongirls...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Get this.  
There used to be a legendary vampire aiming for world domination.  
And now it's been revived, right here in Landosol!  
  
**Kaori：**  
A legendary vampire?  
That sounds... kinda familiar? Or maybe not.  
  
**Makoto：**  
First I've heard of it too, actually.  
But vampires are like, these fanged sorta beasts...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oh! You mean a shisa?  
No worries, then! They're guardian deities!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I said vampire, not shisa!  
Try to keep up!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ah, yes. Vampires.  
Beasts that roam the night, quenching an insatiable  
thirst through the blood of young women.  
  
**Maho：**  
Well, I'll be.  
That sounds like a big ol' problem right there.  
  
**Maho：**  
A li'l bit familiar, too, now that I think about it. I remember  
a picture book passed down in the Maho-Maho Kingdom  
about a vampire that threw Landosol into chaos.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Right? We gotta take action!  
It's our job to keep our fellow beastfolk—our brethren—safe!  
Let's wipe the floor with that vampire!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'm down for that, but do we know where to find it?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Urgh... Well, uh...  
  
**Maho：**  
Always in a rush, ain't ya?  
We gotta do some proper intel gatherin', first and foremost.  
  
**Maho：**  
And we're busy enough as it is.  
Wouldn't do much good for all of us  
to pile onto this all at once.  
  
**Makoto：**  
That's fair enough.  
I can't just ditch my patrol duties, either.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And I still have plenty of paperwork left.  
Gathering intel requires both time and preparation.  
Running around on a wild goose chase right now wouldn't be wise.  
  
**Maho：**  
Aye. No point in sending anyone out  
if it ends up being at the expense of other important work.  
  
**Maho：**  
Makoto's got her patrols, and Kasumi's got her paperwork.  
So leave the intel gatherin'  
to me and Kaori.  
  
**Maho：**  
Our work for the day's already done anyway.  
Does that suit ya, Kaori?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Yuppity yup!  
We'll bring peace and love back to Landosol!  
  
**Maho：**  
Reliable as ever, ain't ya? ♪  
Got me feelin' like we'll go the whole way  
and vanquish it in a jiffy.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm...  
I suppose this would make the two of you  
full-fledged vampire hunters.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Campfire hunters?  
What's that got to do with anything?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
*Vampire* hunters, you dolt.  
People that hunt evil vampires, spoken about in similar legends.  
  
**Maho：**  
That sounds mighty cool to me. ♪  
Now then, Kaori. Let's get goin'.  
We'll slay the beast and save the country.
