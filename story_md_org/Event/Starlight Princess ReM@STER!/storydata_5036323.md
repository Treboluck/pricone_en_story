**Uzuki：**  
Ueki-chan still has this much strength left...?!  
  
**Mio：**  
It's like nothing's enough to satisfy it!  
  
**Rin：**  
But Ueki-chan does seem less confident than before.  
  
**Mio：**  
Then if we push on a little bit longer,  
we might get through to it?!  
  
**Rin：**  
I think so.  
Uzuki, Mio. Let's fulfill Ueki-chan's wishes with our own strength.  
  
**Mio：**  
Of course!  
We can't give up until Ueki-chan finally acknowledges us!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Yes, that's right.  
 I feel exactly the same way!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Come on, Rin, Mio! This has to be our final battle!  
Let's show Ueki-chan all our hopes and dreams as \"New Generations\"!
