**Rin：**  
Just how much chaos does that monster need to cause...?  
  
**Mio：**  
It's not going down easily.  
What a tough cookie!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
We're all feeling pretty worn out right now...  
But that must go for the monster too, right?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Agreed. I feel like it's getting frustrated.  
We must almost have it beaten!  
  
**Mio：**  
Oh, nice!  
In that case, let's use the last of our strength,  
and take it down at full power!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Yes! Let's give it everything we've got!
