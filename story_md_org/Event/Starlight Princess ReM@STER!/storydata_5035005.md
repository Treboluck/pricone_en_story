# The Adventure Goes On!
With the monsters defeated, the members of \"New Generations\" begin their audition. Thanks to their rivals' interference, the music that starts playing is a different song from the one they rehearsed, yet somehow they are able to perform it perfectly. Just as the results are announced, the guardian bud Tsubomi-chan grows to enormous size.

**Narration：**  
{player} and the Gourmet Guild  
successfully defeat the monsters attacking \"New Generations.\"  
  
**Karyl：**  
Whew.  
Is that the last of them?  
Guess they weren't so tough!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Everyone, thank you so much!  
  
**Rin：**  
Your... \"Princess Knight\" ability, did you call it?  
That strengthening power is really something.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yep!  
He's crazy powerful, our {player}! ☆  
Eheh!  
  
**Mio：**  
Man, I'm so glad nobody got hurt, and the audition stage was OK too!  
Thanks, you guys!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It certainly is a relief to see everyone safe.  
However...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Before this, you all seemed quite concerned  
by the state of your own memories.  
Is... everything all right on that front?  
  
**Rin：**  
Hmm...  
To be honest, I'm still not sure what to think...  
  
**Mio：**  
Y-yeah.  
But... the panic just now actually helped calm me down a little.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Right now, it's not the time  
to be worrying about memories we might have had.  
  
**Mio：**  
Right on! ♪ When we're on stage, we've gotta smile!  
For the judges, the audience...  
And for you guys who'll be watching too!  
  
**Rin：**  
Yeah.  
We mustn't let our focus slip.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh.  
It seems there was no need to worry after all.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahh!  
I think the audition's about to kick off!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well then, get out there and win it, guys!  
  
**All Three：**  
Right!  
  
**Rookie Idol 1：**  
What the heck?!  
The supposed obstruction from our beast tamer fan  
didn't work at all!  
 What good was that?!  
  
**Rookie Idol 2：**  
Those bodyguards... They're way too strong!  
Still...  
 Heheh. We've got one last trick left!  
  
**Rookie Idol 1：**  
Y-yes, good point!  
You just wait, \"New Generations\"!  
We'll make a laughingstock of you!  
  
**Announcer：**  
Well, folks, it's time for our audition  
to welcome its final unit of up-and-coming idols!  
Show us what you've got!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
We are...  
  
**All Three：**  
\"New Generations\"!  
  
**Audience Member 1：**  
Wooooo!  
  
**Audience Member 2：**  
We were waiting for ya!  
  
**Judge：**  
Heheh... Those girls are finally here!  
  
**Judge：**  
I'm sure they have potential,  
but let's see how they fare in an actual performance.  
I'll be sure to judge them fair and square!  
  
**Mio：**  
Ahaha...  
 That lady was one of the judges, huh?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
But that doesn't change our mission here!  
  
**Rin：**  
Right! Let's sing with everything we've got!  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh...?!  
  
**Mio：**  
What's this intro?!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
This isn't the song we rehearsed at all...?!  
  
**Rookie Idol 1：**  
Heheh!  
We switched out their Sound Record for a different song!  
  
**Rookie Idol 2：**  
It's a super-minor track even we've never heard of!  
They'll never be able to sing it!  
  
**All Three：**  
—♪  
  
**Uzuki：**  
I know it...!  
This song... I know it!  
  
**Mio：**  
The lyrics, the dancing, they come to me so naturally!  
My body remembers it all!  
  
**Rin：**  
It's as if I've sung it dozens...  
No, more like hundreds or thousands of times before!  
  
**Rookie Idol 1：**  
Wh-what the—?!  
They're all performing this random song perfectly!  
But how?!  
  
**Rookie Idol 2：**  
H-how should I know?!  
Where did you find that Sound Record in the first place?!  
  
**Rookie Idol 1：**  
Huh...? Some ugly green costumed mascot  
dropped it while trying to stop the monsters just now...  
  
**Rookie Idol 1：**  
Ahhh...! Don't tell me that thing  
is in cahoots with the \"New Generations\" girls?!  
  
**Rookie Idol 2：**  
You dummy!  
Wh-what do we do now?!  
They're gonna steal our hard-earned victory!  
  
**Rookie Idol 1：**  
Th-there's nothing left *to* do!  
And actually...  
  
**Rookie Idol 2：**  
Actually...?  
  
**Rookie Idol 1：**  
...They really are good, aren't they?  
  
**All Three：**

Awesome! Too awesome!  
This is what idols are all about!  
  
**Audience Member 2：**  
\"New Generations\" forever!  
New! Generations! Forever!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"New Generations\" forever! ☆  
  
**Choice: (1)**  \"New Generations\" forever!  
`Tag 1`  
**All Three：**  
Th-thanks, everyone!  
  
**Judge：**  
You girls really are something!  
Are you really new to this?!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
U-um, well...  
  
**Rin：**  
Actually...  
  
**Mio：**  
We can't really explain  
that we're not even sure ourselves, can we?  
  
**Judge：**  
You were like real stars!  
I felt as though I was witnessing a top idol unit's performance!  
  
**Judge：**  
You're a match for the latest big sensation, Carmina!  
No one on this continent...  
No, nobody in this world can stand in your way!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Th-thank you very much...  
But...  
  
**Mio：**  
Um, madam... Listen, we...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Everyone!  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh—you guys...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Your live show was an incredible sight! ☆  
I think it actually touched my heart!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I too felt my eyes beginning to brim with tears.  
It was a truly remarkable performance.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I loved it!  
`Tag 2`  
**Mio：**  
Eheheh... Thanks! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
But, uh, why'd you suddenly pick a different song?  
I'm sure I never heard you practice that one!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
True enough... I was also a little curious about that.  
Despite the substitution, you sang it with such zeal...  
  
**Mio：**  
Oh—yeah...  
The thing is... We don't really know what happened there either.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh...? You mean someone else switched out your song?!  
  
**Rin：**  
That would be one explanation.  
It's a good thing the new song was one we all knew...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
But... when and where did we learn it?  
I can't seem to remember at all...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh—you guys!  
I think they're about to announce the winners!  
  
**Mio：**  
Huh? Already?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, after all that applause and the reactions of the judges...  
There probably wasn't much need to debate over a winner.  
  
**Announcer：**  
Well then, it's time for the big moment!  
Let's award the Up-and-Coming Idol Audition's grand prize!  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh...? What now? Is the ground shaking?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Is this also part of the show...?  
  
**Announcer：**  
Our winner is: the guild New Generatio...  
Wuoaghh?!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Aaahhhh!  
I can't stand up straight!  
  
**Judge：**  
Wh-what in the world is this quaking?!  
And at such an important moment!

Doesn't it look like it's getting bigger and bigger?!  
It's towering over the whole town!  
  
**Judge：**  
Wh-what is happening to you, Tsubomi-chan?!  
  
**Mio：**  
No...  
That thing isn't Tsubomi-chan at all!  
Right, Shiburin?! Shimamu?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Right.  
Could it really be...?!  
  
**All Three：**  
\"Ueki-chan\"?!
