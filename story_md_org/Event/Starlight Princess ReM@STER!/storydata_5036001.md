**Judge：**  
Wh-what is happening to you, Tsubomi-chan?!  
  
**Mio：**  
No...  
That thing isn't Tsubomi-chan at all!  
Right, Shiburin?! Shimamu?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Right.  
Could it really be...?!  
  
**All Three：**  
\"Ueki-chan\"?!

**Rin：**  
...Uzuki, Mio, and me, Rin.  
A guild of three: \"New Generations.\"  
  
**Uzuki：**  
In the midst of our activities as adventurers,  
one day, we learned of the existence of idols.  
And we decided then and there to become idols ourselves!  
  
**Mio：**  
Together with the Gourmet Guild  
and an ug...  
 um, a green creature named Piña Colata,  
we made plans to enter a big audition for new idols!

**Rin：**  
Working at lessons, holding a guerilla concert...  
Becoming idols sure wasn't an easy task, but...  
Yeah, it was more fun than I thought.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
But... the harder we worked to become idols,  
the more we noticed a strange feeling...  
as if something wasn't quite right in some way.

`image display end`  
**Mio：**  
Until at the big audition itself,  
we somehow sang a song we'd never learned...  
  
**Rin：**  
And we finally felt certain that our feeling was on the mark.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
All three of us must have  
forgotten something really important...!

**All Three：**  
\"Ueki-chan\"?!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Waaaahhhh?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
*cough* *cough*  
What's all this?! A smoke screen?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Achoo!  
No, Karyl, it's not smoke!  
  
**Mio：**  
Aaaatchoo!  
Why am I sneezing...?!  
  
**Rin：**  
This stuff... Could it be pollen?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Even if I cover my face, it seeps right through... Atchoo!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
...Huh?  
Over down there, by Ueki-chan's roots...  
That one spot looks strange... As if it leads... somewhere else...?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Waaahhh?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Uzuki, be on your guard!  
It seems that something lurks beyond the cloud of pollen!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Achoo!  
What is it this time?!  
  
**???：**  
*rustle rustle*... *rustle rustle*...  
  
**Mio：**  
Are those... giant plant bulbs?!  
  
**Rin：**  
And there's an awful lot of them...  
 Atchoo!  
  
**Rookie Idol 1：**  
Wh-what are these things?!  
  
**Rookie Idol 2：**  
Aaaahhhh!  
Don't touch me! Somebody heeelp!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Screams are echoing all around us!  
Achoo!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Are those things attacking the townsfolk?!  
But... Atchoo!  
  
**Mio：**  
With this cloud of pollen...  
I can't even tell who's being attacked where!  
  
**Rin：**  
Each individual enemy is weak... Atchoo!  
But at this rate, they're a real danger!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Achoo!  
 Oh, geez!  
At this point... I'll just fire off a big attack  
and blast Ueki-chan away, pollen and all!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Pecorine! Koro!  
Keep me safe from those things while I cast the spell!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Okay, Kar...  
 atchoo!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl?  
Wherever have you gone, Miss Karyl?!  
  
**???：**  
*rustle rustle rustle rustle*  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?  
...Aaaaaghhhh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl?!  
Kaaa... tchooooo!  
  
**Rin：**  
Among the cloud of impenetrable pollen...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We did our very best to save the townsfolk...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
But we couldn't find any trace left of Karyl...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We've come a long way,  
so I think we should be safe for now, but...  
  
**Girl：**  
A-anyone!  
Have you seen my partner?!  
  
**Judge：**  
Those bizarre bulbs...!  
They abducted almost all of our budding idols!  
This is terrible!  
  
**Mio：**  
Looks like it's not just our Karyl-Karyl that's gone missing!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ehm... It seems the bulb-like monsters have been seizing people  
and dragging them inside the overgrown Tsubomi-chan,  
or so eyewitnesses have attested.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
No way!  
But then...  
 does that mean Karyl's trapped inside Ueki-chan too?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
\"Ueki-chan\"...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Umm... If you don't mind me asking,  
why do you all seem to know that big monster by name?  
  
**Mio：**  
Well, uh... I don't really get it either,  
but the word just sort of came to me.  
Just like how I call Shiburin and Shimamu by those nicknames.  
  
**Rin：**  
Same here.  
For some reason, it feels almost nostalgic...  
  
**Rin：**  
Hmm...  
I feel so close to remembering something.  
If something could jog our memories...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
U-um...!  
Just now, I think I glimpsed something.  
Something that might give us the final push we need...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What did you see, Uzuki?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
This might be difficult to believe,  
but through the pollen, down by Ueki-chan's roots,  
I thought I saw a scene from a different world.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
It was only a little glimpse,  
but even so, it gave me a really, really nostalgic feeling...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
So then... I wondered.  
Is there any chance... that right now we've forgotten,  
but we came from that world originally?  
  
**Rin：**  
Another world...  
  
**Mio：**  
Our original world...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If that's really true,  
 then what a surprise!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Actually... haven't we met people who came from somewhere else  
once or twice before now, Kokkoro?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm... That is indeed quite true.  
In which case...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Young ladies of \"New Generations.\"  
Though we have little proof, I find your speculation most believable.  
  
**Mio：**  
Why's that, Korokoro?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
According to the old woman on the panel of judges,  
that guardian bud, Tsubomi-chan, has lain in this town for many years.  
  
**Rin：**  
Now that you mention it, I do remember  
she said something like that...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yet that same Tsubomi-chan  
suddenly grew to great size, transforming into \"Ueki-chan.\"  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The trigger for this may have been the sound of your song,  
or so it seems to me.  
  
**Mio：**  
Huhhhh?!  
This is all our fault?!  
  
**Rin：**  
No, not exactly.  
This \"Ueki-chan\" probably comes from the same world as us,  
so our presence affected it... is what she's trying to say, I think.  
  
**Mio：**  
Oh, I get it!  
Sorry, Korokoro!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
No, no.  
I too am only speaking out of pure speculation.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Hmmm... I still can't remember any details,  
 but was our world  
really home to such bizarre, gigantic plant monsters?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A good question.  
It could be that this \"Ueki-chan\" has changed from its original form.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Just as the three of you  
forgot your original selves upon arriving here.  
  
**Mio：**  
Our real selves, huh...  
  
**Rin：**  
For all we know, we might not have even had  
these adventurer abilities back home.  
  
**Piña Colata：**  
Pinya!  
Pinya-nya!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh—Piña Colata!  
Good to see you're OK! ☆  
  
**Piña Colata：**  
Pinya, piiinya!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Hmm?  
What's he trying to tell us?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  His form is a deviation from reality too, he says.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mio：**  
Huh? He's a deviant?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Piña Colata... So you were a deviant all along...  
  
**Piña Colata：**  
Pi...?!  
Pinya! Nya-pinya!  
  
**Mio：**  
Ahaha. Sorry, sorry!  
We're just kidding! ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Do you think...  
Piña Colata comes from the same other world as us, then?  
He does seem weirdly familiar somehow.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Yes, I'm sure he does!  
  
**Piña Colata：**  
Pinya, piiinya!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well then, now that we know Piña Colata's safe and all...  
Maybe it's time we thought about how to get poor Karyl  
out of the big plant that's eaten her up.  
  
**Mio：**  
And let's not forget the other idol hopefuls!  
They may be strangers, but we can't just leave them!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, I quite agree.  
However...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
However...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Why did this \"Ueki-chan\"  
abduct all of those people in the first place..?  
  
**Karyl：**  
...U... unhh...  
Urngh...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Urgh... My head's killing me...  
Hm?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Was I knocked out just now?  
Wait, hold on—where am I?  
It's so dark, I can't see a single thing...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey~! {player}!  
Koro! Pecorine! Rin, Mio, Uzuki!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...No response.  
Urghh...  
My head feels so weird right now...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Did I breathe in a bit too much of that pollen?  
I've gotta find an exit before I pass out again...  
  
**Karyl：**  
First up, let's try some night vision magic.  
...Seriously, what is this place?  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Hm?  
  
**Voices：**  
~♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Singing...?  
It's coming from over here...  
  
**Rookie Idol 1：**  
We have to keep practicing... and get better!  
  
**Rookie Idol 2：**  
Yes!  
To send Ueki-chan back to its home world!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Urk... What's with them? Big yikes!  
They're muttering weird stuff,  
and something's growing from their heads!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I've gotta run for it!  
...  
Huh?  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Atchoo!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Guehhh!  
This is that pollen from before...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahhhh... I'm getting dizzy...  
  
**Kyukon-chan：**  
*rustle rustle*... *rustle rustle*...
