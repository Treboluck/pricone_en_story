# Find Our Way
Our heroes realize that the strange hole at Ueki-chan's base leads to Uzuki and friends' world, and to widen it, they need to hype up a crowd at a concert. To achieve this, {player} makes a certain suggestion.

**Karyl：**  
U-urghhh...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Kary~l!  
  
**Mio：**  
Karyl-Karyl! Are you OK?  
  
**Rin：**  
...Sorry.  
I didn't think our singing would blast you away like that...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
However, thanks to the efforts of \"New Generations,\"  
the sprouts upon Miss Karyl and her fellows' heads have fallen off.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yep!  
Which should mean...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Ahh!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Karyl!  
`Tag 1`  
**Piña Colata：**  
Pinya!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...{player}?  
And, uh...  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Ngh!  
Owww... My head hurts...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, Karyl!  
Do you recognize me?  
Your bestest friend Pecorine is here! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huhhh?!  
Wh-who the heck made you my best friend?!  
Get lost, you dummy!  
  
**Rin：**  
Ah...  
She's not talking like a cat anymore.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Thank goodness! So she's really back to normal! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Urk...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-whatever do you mean?  
I've never been the type to make cat noises!  
N-nope, doesn't sound familiar...  
  
**Mio：**  
\"Super Idol Karyl makes her meowvellous debut! ☆\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Kyaru-kyaru~n! ☆\"  
  
**Karyl：**  
Stoooooooooop!  
I'll kill you! I'm actually going to kill you!  
  
**Mio：**  
Ahaha! Sorry, sorry...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, geez!  
Seriously, why do these things always happen to me...?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Ummm, Karyl?  
I know you're probably still disoriented, but...  
  
**Rin：**  
It would be great if you could tell us exactly what happened  
after Ueki-chan abducted you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The two members of Prosperity who joined you in your idol unit  
have sadly fallen unconscious.  
They do not appear to be injured,  
 but I fear they can tell us little.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So we need to ask... Karyl.  
How did you end up doing all that stuff?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, uh... it's about that.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
\"That\"...? Oh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Near the base of Ueki-chan is a hole the size of a fist...  
And through it, I see entirely different scenery.  
Is it some kind of spacial distortion...?  
  
**Mio：**  
Is that... the thing you were talking about, Shimamu?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh...? Let's see...  
Lots of big, rectangular buildings... Hmmm...  
It really does look different from the world we know.  
  
**Rin：**  
H-hey, Mio, Uzuki...  
Isn't that city...?!  
  
**Mio：**  
It's our home!  
I know it is!  
I can't remember the details... but I'm so sure!  
  
**Piña Colata：**  
Pinya!  
Pinya-pinya!  
  
**Rin：**  
Could this hole... take us there, I wonder...?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
But the hole's so small right now.  
I doubt we'd fit, and I guess Piña Colata  
would stand even less of a chance...  
  
**Piña Colata：**  
Pinya...  
  
**Karyl：**  
We'd need to make it pretty wide,  
or Uzuki's butt would get stuck for sure!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Uwehhh?!  
M-my b... I'm not all that big!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well... At present, even I, the very smallest among us,  
would be unable to fit through entirely.  
If you all wish to return home, we will need to enlarge it somehow.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Agreed.  
And... that seems to be this overgrown potted plant's goal, too.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Then... is Ueki-chan just trying its best to get home as well?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Seems that way.  
But right now, it doesn't have the energy,  
so a hole this size is the best it can manage.  
  
**Mio：**  
Energy...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I dunno what it was like originally...  
But the Ueki-chan in this world  
draws energy from the excitement of concert audiences.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Oh, is that true?!  
Drawing energy from fans' enthusiasm...  
It's almost as if Ueki-chan's an idol! ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Yeah, although unlike us,  
I doubt it can put on any concerts of its own.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's just a plant in a pot, after all! ☆  
  
**Mio：**  
Oh...  
Then the reason Ueki-chan was abducting all those budding idols...  
Could it be...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yep. Ueki-chan needs a ton of audience energy,  
but with just you \"New Generations\" girls,  
there's a limit to how much you can provide.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That's why it's after anyone who has any interest in being an idol.  
To control them with pollen, gather them, raise them...  
all so they can hype up a bigger audience.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We were attempting to release those potential idols,  
which is why Ueki-chan sent Miss Karyl  
under its own control to obstruct us.  
  
**Rin：**  
If all of that is really true...  
I guess this Ueki-chan is pretty wild.  
Despite the goofy face.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, I can see why you'd doubt it.  
Even I wouldn't have guessed all this  
if I hadn't seen it first-hand while being controlled.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
By the way... There's something I'm wondering, Karyl...  
  
**Karyl：**  
What?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Just now, you said it's going after  
anyone who \"has any interest\" in being an idol, right...?  
  
**Mio：**  
Ah...  
Does that mean Karyl-Karyl...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh my.  
Do you dream of becoming an idol, Miss Karyl?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? Is that the truth, Karyl?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Aaaaaghhhhh!  
No! Of course not!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I mean, maybe I did think about it!  
But just a little! Only the tiniest little bit!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I mean, wouldn't basically any girl around my age  
want to wear fancy clothes and be pampered like a star?!  
Just a little, you know?!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Ahaha...  
  
**Rin：**  
Of course, actually becoming one isn't so simple.  
  
**Mio：**  
No, no, I understand exactly how you feel, Karyl!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Rin, Mio, Uzuki, you're idols already, so whatever...  
But Pecorine! And you, Koro!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Why didn't you two get captured by the Kyukon-chan bulbs?!  
Haven't you ever... you know... thought about being an idol?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In my case... serving my lord faithfully is everything to me.  
Of course, if my lord were to wish it,  
I would not be averse to the idea of combining the two professions...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
As for me, I sort of need to succeed my parents!  
And of course, I'm used to fancy clothes.  
...Oh! I don't mean I've got no interest in idols at all!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Quit trying to make me feel better!  
Aaghhh, geez!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Stupid overgrown shrub, showing me up like this!  
I'll burn you to the ground with my magic after all!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
T-try to calm down, okay, Karyl?  
  
**Mio：**  
That's right!  
Your kitty-cat act back there was actually super cute!  
  
**Rin：**  
Agreed.  
Though... I'm more of a dog person.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Besides, if you burn down poor Ueki-chan,  
we might lose our only chance  
for the \"New Generations\" girls to get back home!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Oh...  
  
**Mio：**  
Ahh...  
  
**Rin：**  
...Hey, Uzuki. Mio.  
Do you want to go back to that world?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Well, um... Ummmm...  
  
**Mio：**  
I... I don't know.  
I mean, I still can't even remember it properly.  
But...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
I feel like there was...  
something I needed to do back home...  
  
**Rin：**  
...Yeah.  
We were getting ready for something important.  
That's what it feels like.  
  
**Mio：**  
All right!  
In that case...!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Let's look for a way back home!  
  
**Rin：**  
I agree.  
There might be people worried about us over there.  
  
**Mio：**  
Yep!  
It's not like we know we'll never be able to come back!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
And I want to remember the things I've forgotten!  
To understand who we really are!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If that is how you all truly feel...  
We will of course do everything in our power to assist you.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, fine, I guess.  
I've come this far, so I'd better see it through!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's OK, right, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Of course.  
`Tag 2`  
**Piña Colata：**  
Pinya!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Thank you so much, everyone!  
  
**Rin：**  
We're counting on you.  
  
**Mio：**  
With that decided...  
 Um, where should we actually start?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thanks to Miss Karyl's information,  
our next step has become far more clear than before.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We've just gotta get that hole  
big enough for a person to slip through, right?  
  
**Karyl：**  
And to do that, we need to give Ueki-chan energy...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Ueki-chan's energy comes  
from all the enthusiasm that people produce  
when they see idols perform, isn't that right?  
  
**Rin：**  
I'm not sure how that works...  
But if making people happy will give us the energy we need, I'm all for it.  
  
**Mio：**  
But just the three of us aren't enough, right?  
That's why Ueki-chan went after the others.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We can't just leave the other idols under its control, though.  
So, assuming we're going to rescue them...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
There must be some other way to do this.  
Something that will let us reach  
lots and lots more people with our singing...  
  
**All：**  
Hmmm...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  How's this for an idea?  
`Tag 3`  
**All：**  
...Huhhhh?!
