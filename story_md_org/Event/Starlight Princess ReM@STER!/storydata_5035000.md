# Cast a Spell On...
The Gourmet Guild accepts a mission to defeat a new type of monster, but upon seeing how scared the monster looks, they decide to let it go. The next day, the monster appears at their guildhouse, along with the members of a guild called \"New Generations\" who want to become pop idols.

## Subtitle: Cast a Spell On...
  
**Narration：**  
Having accepted a new mission from the Guild Association,  
{player} and the members of the Gourmet Guild  
are out on a monster hunt.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...!  
My lord, this way!  
I do believe I heard an unfamiliar monster cry!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Yeah!  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
This new type of monster the mission mentioned...  
I can't wait to see what it tastes like! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hold up. Pecorine?  
Just so we're clear, I'm not eating that stuff!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aw, don't say that, Karyl!  
Everything's more tasty if you eat it together!  
Or what, are you on a diet?  
  
**Karyl：**  
That's not the issue!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Everyone.  
Please lower your voices.  
I feel the presence of a monster nearby.  
  
**Both：**  
...!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  There it is...!  
`Tag 2`  
**???：**  
...!  
P-pinya...?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wow~! ♪  
It's green all over, and round and fluffy too!  
Like a big edamame bean! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
It doesn't look familiar, that's for sure.  
Is it a new type of orc, or a giant moss ball that grew legs?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, whatever.  
Let's beat it up and finish the mission!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I will provide support.  
My lord, please lend us your strength!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let's pound it into a big green mochi ball!  
Here goes nothing!  
  
**???：**  
P-pinya?!  
Pinyaaaahh!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Wait, guys!  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh?!  
What's wrong now, {player}?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, come on—this is a battle!  
Power us up already, will you?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord...?  
Is something concerning you?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  The monster looks really scared...  
`Tag 4`  
**???：**  
Pinya...  
Pinyaaa...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I think you may be right.  
It is cowering in fear without making any attempt to attack.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Are you saying it's a harmless monster?  
 I wouldn't be so sure...  
What if it's waiting till we let our guard down,  
so it can leap in for an easy kill?  
  
**???：**  
Pinya!  
Nyapipi!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  It says it won't do that.  
`Tag 5`  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh?  
{player}, can you understand what it's saying?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I think so, sort of...  
`Tag 6`  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord...  
I had no idea you possessed such a talent.  
You truly are the most remarkable of fellows. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmmm...  
 Well, if {player}  
wants to let the poor thing go, I don't mind!  
Even if I am still curious about what it tastes like...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Naturally, I will do as my lord wishes.  
However... in that case, it seems inevitable  
that this mission must end in failure.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Karyl, are you OK with this too?  
`Tag 7`  
**Karyl：**  
*sigh*... Fine, fine, whatever.  
That dumb face and the sound of its weird squeals  
are making it really hard to take seriously anyway.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yaaay! ♪  
You're such a sweetie, Karyl! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ohhh, quit grabbing me like that!  
Anyway, listen up, you big, green, ugly lunk!  
  
**???：**  
P-pinya?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Looks like you're off the hook this time.  
But if you cause anyone any trouble... next time I'll roast you  
and feed you to Miss Bottomless-Stomach-on-Legs here!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Roast monster... I love it! ♪  
*drool*... ☆  
  
**???：**  
Pinya!  
Pinyaaaa!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh... ♪  
Well then, shall we return to the city? My kindhearted lord... ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Since I didn't get to eat the monster,  
I'm absolutely starving now!  
Let's head home and buy a nice big dinner! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ah... Hey, hold it!  
Don't go running off on your own!  
  
**???：**  
...  
...Pinya...  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day...  
The Gourmet Guild's members have come to the usual bulletin board  
in search of another new job.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmmm...  
  
**Karyl：**  
How's it look, Koro?  
Did you find any decent-looking jobs?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Let's see...  
\"Please find my stray dog.\"  
\"Looking for a babysitter.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Defeat the goblin ravaging our fields!\"  
\"Seeking help moving rubble!\"  
So many different options! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmmm...  
None of them exactly leap out at me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Are you sure?  
If we can be of use to these people,  
I would be quite happy to offer our services...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Geez... What are you, a saint?!  
You're making me look like a miser by comparison!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't worry!  
Everyone here knows that you're the kindest  
and sweetest girl there ever was! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, look, Karyl—how about that flyer posted over there?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm?  
Which one?  
Let's see...  
 Huh?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
\"Turn us into real pop idols!\"  
...That seems to be all it says.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huhhh?  
What the heck? What a freaky request.  
Actually, is this even the kind of job you're supposed to post here?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Idols... They're performers who sing and dance, right?  
Sounds like lots of fun to me! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
I mean, sure, they're probably fun to *watch.*  
But as a job? Seems like a clear \"no can do\" to me.  
  
**???：**  
...Pinya...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Oh?  
That large, green individual... He seems familiar.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't tell me he followed us all the way here?  
  
**???：**  
Pinyaaaa!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahh!  
Hey, stop that! You can't just rip flyers off the board!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
How in the world did he grip the flyer with those hands?  
Perhaps he is surprisingly dextrous...  
 Oh?  
  
**???：**  
Pinya.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Thanks.  
`Tag 8`  
**Karyl：**  
Don't just accept it, {player}!  
Oh heck, and isn't that  
the \"turn us into idols\" job we just totally ruled out?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Could it be... he's actually  
trying to recommend that we accept this job?  
  
**???：**  
Pinya.  
  
**Karyl：**  
\"Pinya\"?  
 Oh, gimme a break!  
Pin that flyer back up!  
If we're holding it, somebody might get the wrong idea and—  
  
**???　：**  
Ahhhhh!  
  
**???：**  
Look over there, Shiburin, Shimamu!  
That guy—he's taken the job request flyer we posted!  
  
**???：**  
Um, Mio? Not so loud...  
  
**???：**  
You don't think he's really planning to accept it, do you?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Guehh!  
I don't like the way this is going...  
  
**???：**  
Um... It's nice to meet you!  
We're the ones who posted that flyer—  
a small guild by the name of \"New Generations\"!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heyas!  
I'm the perpetually peckish Pecorine!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Greetings. We are the Gourmet Guild.  
My name is Kokkoro,  
and this is my lord, {player}.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  It's great to meet you.  
`Tag 9`  
**Uzuki：**  
I'm Uzuki! ♪  
It's a pleasure!  
  
**Mio：**  
I'm Mio!  
Hi there! ♪  
And this stoic girl over here is...  
  
**Rin：**  
...Rin.  
Hmm.  
So you're taking on our request, are you?  
  
**Karyl：**  
By \"request\"... you mean, uh...?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
That's right!  
Ready, guys?  
  
**Mio & Uzuki：**  
We need you to turn us into real idols!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Sorry... That's not happening!  
  
**Mio & Uzuki：**  
Whaaaat?!
