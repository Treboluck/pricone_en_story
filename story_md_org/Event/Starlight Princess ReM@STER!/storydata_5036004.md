**Narration：**  
A few days after {player} and friends  
begin their plan to energize Ueki-chan...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ah, ah... Testing.  
Hey, Karin, can you hear me?  
  
**Karin：**  
Yes—this is the Guild Association.  
We're reading you loud and clear, Gourmet Guild!  
  
**Karyl：**  
OK.  
How about you guys at Caon?  
  
**Maho：**  
Sure thing! ♪  
We're all hearin' your voices clear as day!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Good, good... Looks like everywhere else is fine too.  
Linking about ten different places with communication magic  
seemed like a big ask at first...  
 but I guess it worked out!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Wow! ♪  
Karyl, you're amazing!  
  
**Mio：**  
Right now, we're talking to the Association guys from a long way away...  
If we can send the music from our concert like this too,  
people from towns all over will be able to hear us sing!  
  
**Rin：**  
I had no idea this was possible...  
But it must take a lot of magic.  
Are you all right, Karyl?  
  
**Karyl：**  
'Course I am. No problem.  
Turns out {player}'s support is good for more than just battle.  
  
**Mio：**  
Thanks a bunch, {player}!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're welcome.  
`Tag 1`  
**Uzuki：**  
You reached out to not only the Association,  
but so many of your other friends, too...  
And you helped us set things up in all these different towns...  
  
**Mio：**  
Honestly, we couldn't have done it without your connections!  
You really are something!  
  
**Rin：**  
A humanfolk maid. An elven mage. A demonfolk teacher,  
a beastfolk princess, a detective. Even a vampire...  
I was pretty surprised that all of them were girls...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Indeed.  
Even I, who am all too familiar with your connections,  
was quite taken aback, my lord.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Ahahaha...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karin as well, through her Guild Association influence,  
will be organizing widespread distribution of flyers and the like.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"See the budding idols who prevailed in the big Musa audition  
in their historic first concert!\"  
That's how we're billing it! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What's more, it'll be broadcast across the continent  
in a world-first \"live tuning\" event!  
This is sure to get the public hyped up big-time! ☆  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Th-this sounds like a big deal!  
  
**Rin：**  
You've brought us this far... so we'd better not disappoint.  
  
**Judge：**  
Say, my dears...  
  
**Mio：**  
Oh! The old lady from the judges?!  
  
**Judge：**  
I'm not privy to all the details...  
but I hear you're holding a concert.  
  
**Judge：**  
In that case, you should use this Sound Record.  
It's a new song that we prepared for the winners of the audition.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Thank you so much, madam!  
  
**Rin：**  
Yeah... It's a great song.  
  
**Judge：**  
Good luck out there, my dears.  
This town may be in a state of confusion now...  
  
**Judge：**  
But personally, looking at Tsubomi-chan...  
No, \"Ueki-chan\" up there,  
I still can't believe it would do anything wrong.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Leave it to us, madam!  
We'll take care of Ueki-chan without any trouble!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hold it. It's done nothing wrong?  
Did you forget it brainwashed me?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, as for Ueki-chan's state...  
It occasionally becomes active,  
spreading pollen and Kyukon-chan bulbs even now.  
  
**Karyl：**  
If the brute causes too much trouble, let's beat it up until it stops.  
With that big, tough body, it's not like we'll leave much damage.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A naughty Ueki-chan needs a good spanking! ☆  
  
**Choice: (2)**  We'll keep Ueki-chan under control, so...  
`Tag 2`  
**Piña Colata：**  
Pinya!  
Pinya-nya-nya!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You guys work hard at your lessons!  
`Tag 3`  
**All Three：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so, the day of the concert arrives...

**Kokkoro：**  
Everyone... The scheduled time is upon us.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You should see the crowd that's gathered in front of the stage!  
  
**Karyl：**  
The \"live tuning\" broadcast network is all set up, too.  
I hear there are tons of people gathered in all the towns' plazas!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Understood!  
Thanks for letting us know!  
  
**Mio：**  
Oh, heck...  
All those people gathered just to hear us sing, huh~?  
Mmm... Makes me nervous! ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Mio... Your face says you're loving this.  
  
**Mio：**  
Heheh... ☆ You noticed?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Well, of course!  
I can hardly wait, either! ♪

Shimamu?  
What's up?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Oh, well...  
 Eheheh.  
I guess it's just funny.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What is funny, Miss Uzuki?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
You know, it wasn't that long ago  
that we were too nervous to perform for that little village.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
But now... there's a gigantic audience here  
and people across the continent waiting for us...  
and we can't wait for it to begin!  
  
**Rin：**  
You're right.  
But in the past... I feel like we've performed  
for even more people than we're about to today.  
  
**Mio：**  
Ahah!  
Then maybe we used to be seriously amazing idols! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Haha!  
I'm sure you were! ☆

`Tag 4`  
**Uzuki：**  
Pecorine... Kokkoro... Karyl, too...  
Thank you so, so much for helping us to come this far!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You need not thank us.  
It was our pleasure to be able to aid you.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Though it's a little sad to think  
that if this succeeds, it'll be the last time we hear you sing...  
  
**Rin：**  
Haha.  
If we include practice, you sure have heard us sing a lot.  
  
**Karyl：**  
We've worked our butts off to give you this big opportunity.  
So don't you get nervous and mess it up or anything, OK?  
  
**Mio：**  
No problem, no problem! ♪  
Leave it to us!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Oh, yes!  
Piña Colata...

Huh?  
What the heck...?

Ah, c'mon. Sounds like fun, right, Shiburin?

I agree! ♪  
Thanks to spending all this time with the Gourmet Guild,  
we've had so many tasty meals lately! ♪

Hmmm.  
Then what should we pick?  
Let's see, lately we've eaten...  
  
**Mio：**  
Crispy Gryphon wings...?  
  
**Rin：**  
Stir-fried Killer Bee larvae...?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Slimy Gellatina risotto...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hold it!  
Shouting creepy stuff like that as you leap on stage  
could jinx your whole performance!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Oh, of course!  
We're trying to think of favorite foods, right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I know what I like—rice balls!  
Nothing beats a fluffy ball of freshly-cooked rice!

Sheesh...!  
After all that time we spent struggling to remember... Haha!

A silly thing like this just brings it all flooding back?  
Ahaha! That's so dumb!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whaaaaa?!  
Are you telling me all three of you  
recovered your lost memories at a time like this?!

H-hold on!  
The show's gonna start! Can you sing like this?!
