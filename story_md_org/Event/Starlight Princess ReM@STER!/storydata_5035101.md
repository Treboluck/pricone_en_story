One day, the Gourmet Guild meets a trio of girls from a guild named \"New Generations.\" An adventure to achieve idoldom begins here!
  
**Mio：**  
Whew... Today's job sure was a toughie.  
  
**Rin：**  
For such a high reward, it seemed about right.  
By the way, Uzuki, did I see the client give you some kind of bonus?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Oh—yes. He gave me these.  
 We should all go together, he said!  
  
**Mio：**  
Ooh! Aren't those tickets to Carmina's upcoming gig?!  
They aren't easy to get hold of!  
  
**Rin：**  
...Carmi-what?  
  
**Mio：**  
...Wha?! Shiburin, you haven't heard of Carmina?!  
How 'bout you, Shimamu?!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
I don't really know them either.  
What are these tickets for?  
  
**Mio：**  
Carmina's an idol group that's really big right now!  
They sing, and dance, and... look, they're just amazing!  
...Not that I've seen them yet either...  
  
**Rin & Uzuki：**  
...\"Idols\"?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
\"Idols,\" huh... What are they?  
I don't know the word...  but it sounds so familiar...?  
  
**Mio：**  
Okay!  
We can't miss this chance, so let's all go together!  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh? Do we have to?  
It's not my thing...  
  
**Mio：**  
Whaaaaa?!  
These tickets are super-duper rare, Shiburin!  
  
**Rin：**  
Well, yes, but...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Um, Mio!  
I think... I'd like to see them! These... \"idols\"!  
I'm not exactly sure why, but I feel like it's really important...  
  
**Mio：**  
That's our Shimamu! ♪  
Now c'mon, Shiburin! You don't wanna be left out, do you?  
It'll be fun if you give it a try!  
  
**Rin：**  
*sigh*... Oh, all right then.  
I can't leave the two of you on your own, so I guess I'll come.
