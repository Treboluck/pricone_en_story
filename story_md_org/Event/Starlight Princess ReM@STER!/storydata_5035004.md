# What Have We Forgotten?
The party arrives at the town where the audition is to take place. The \"New Generations\" girls are challenged by a rival group, but wow them with an impromptu performance. They realize that they seem to have forgotten something important, but just then, they are attacked by monsters.
  
## Subtitle: What Have We Forgotten?
  
**All Three：**  
We made it! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Musa... It is a larger town than I expected.  
What's more, the main street is as lively as a festival.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hm...  
But the actual town can't be even half the size of Landosol.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I suppose it just means there's tons of visitors like us right now.  
  
**Mio：**  
Oh, that's why there were all those carriages parked outside!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But with this many people...  
I bet Piña Colata will attract lots of attention...  
  
**Rin：**  
We don't want to cause a panic...  
But I'm sure it'll be fine if he stays in the carriage.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well then, though it is a shame...  
Please remain here for now, Mr. Piña Colata.  
  
**Piña Colata：**  
Pinya!  
Pinya-nya!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  \"Go get 'em, girls!\" he says.  
`Tag 1`  
**Uzuki：**  
Wow...!  
  
**Mio：**  
Shiburin! Korokoro!  
Take a look at this!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ladies? Is something the matter?

**Rin：**  
...Wait...  
What is this thing?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha!  
What a funny face! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm sensing a goofy aura a lot like Piña Colata's...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
But why's there a face sprouting out of the ground?  
It doesn't exactly look alive, but...  
  
**???：**  
Oh, that?  
That's the Guardian Bud, Tsubomi-chan.  
  
**All：**  
\"Tsubomi-chan\"?!

**Old Lady：**  
Yes, that's right.  
I wouldn't go so far as to call it a deity,  
but it's a symbol of this town that's watched over it since ages past.  
  
**Mio：**  
Huh... Pretty interesting!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
By the by, who might you be...?  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Oh, just a silly old woman who likes to show tourists around.  
I'm guessing you're here to enter the idol audition?  
  
**Rin：**  
How did you know that?  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Well, you know.  
Everyone who visits around this time is either here to see the audition,  
or a budding idol hoping to actually take part.  
  
**Mio：**  
Budding idols...  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Let's see... So there are six of you.  
Does that mean you're a six-member unit?  
  
**Karyl：**  
H-huh?!  
Of course we're not part of this!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We're just here for protection and support!  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Oh, is that so?  
Terrible shame. You all look like you have so much potential.  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Well, anyhow.  
If you're going to join the audition,  
just head down this street, and you'll find a big open theater.  
  
**Old Lady：**  
You should be able to apply there.  
Although you might want to hurry.  
If my memory serves correctly, they're closing for applications soon.  
  
**Mio：**  
Ahhh!  
Let's get moving!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Thank you for your help, madam!  
  
**Rin：**  
Excuse us!  
 It sounds like we need to get going!  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Haha.  
Good luck out there!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...  
Idols, huh...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hey, Karyl~?  
Aren't you coming?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh—wait up!  
I'll be right there!  
  
**Mio：**  
Phew!  
We made it just in time!  
  
**Rin：**  
Looks like we were actually the final applicants.  
That was a close call...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But you fulfilled all requirements and passed the initial screening,  
so all that remains is to demonstrate your skills at the audition proper.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Yes! I'll do my best!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Mm.  
Well then... I guess our job here's just about done, isn't it?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Huh...?!  
Why would you say that, Karyl?  
We still don't know if we'll pass the audition!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, whether you pass or not...  
Honestly, the three of you are already idols now.  
As far as I can see, anyway.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Good point. Just like Karyl is saying...  
The job you originally gave us, to \"turn you into idols,\"  
seems to be pretty much complete.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Strictly speaking, rather than us having completed it,  
it would be more accurate to say  
that you achieved it through your own efforts.  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh...? Wh-when did we...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Of course, I'm far from being an expert on idols or anything,  
but during these past few days, I thought about what  
being an idol means, and I realized something.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Being an idol isn't just about singing and dancing.  
It's about bringing happiness and smiles to the people who see you.  
...A little bit like my own original job.  
  
**Mio：**  
Peccy-o...?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Bringing everyone happiness... and smiles...?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Why does that sound so familiar...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, even this hungry moron talks sense once in a while.  
So I suppose you three are already budding idols, at the very least.  
  
**Rin：**  
...Karyl...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
However, we will nonetheless be sure  
to stay and support you in the audition itself.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Agreed!  
I wouldn't miss this audition for the world! ☆  
We've gotta see the moment you win it!  
  
**Rin：**  
Yeah. We'll do that.  
  
**Mio：**  
Eheheh!  
We're gonna win and become shining stars together!  
  
**Rookie Idol 1：**  
...Hmph.  
Who are those clowns?  
  
**Rookie Idol 2：**  
Think they've won already, do they?  
Isn't it a bit soon for that?  
  
**Mio：**  
O... ohhh...?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Umm... Who are those girls...?  
  
**Onlooker 1：**  
Whoa! It's the idol duo guild, Prosperity!  
  
**Onlooker 2：**  
They're favorites to win the audition!  
I wanna get their autograph!  
  
**Rin：**  
Favorites to win...?!  
  
**Rookie Idol 1：**  
Hey. It sounds like you're planning to join the audition too.  
If you're so confident, you must have some skill, right?  
Go on—let's hear you sing, then.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Whaaa?!  
You mean... right now?  
  
**Rookie Idol 2：**  
That's right!  
We'll judge whether you're actually ready  
to stand on that stage and face us!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Talk about a big-headed pair!  
You guys, don't bother giving these bullies the time of day!  
  
**Mio：**  
No, Karyl-Karyl!  
We're fine!  
  
**Rin：**  
We were hoping for a chance to rehearse before the big event, anyway.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Yes!  
Let's do this here and now! ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well then... I will begin the backing magic.

**Onlooker 1：**  
...Hey, what unit are those girls from?  
D'you know them?  
  
**Onlooker 2：**  
I don't...  
 But dang, they're good!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha! ♪  
Everyone in earshot is spellbound by their singing!  
How crazy is that?! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
After their efforts in the village, it seems they have grown immensely.  
Their confidence in their own abilities shines through.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Agreed.  
...But something's bugging me.  
Is it... really right to say they've \"grown\"?  
  
**All Three：**  
Thank you very much!  
  
**Onlooker 1：**  
Yeahhh! Great show, you girls!  
  
**Onlooker 2：**  
I've decided!  
I'm gonna be your fan!  
Gimme an autograph!

**Rookie Idol 1：**  
I-I wasn't expecting all that!  
They're rivals to watch out for...  
  
**Rookie Idol 2：**  
H-hmph!  
What a bunch of posers!  
We're still the favorites, and we're not about to lose to you!  
  
**Rookie Idol 1：**  
That's right! We've spent tons of time  
meticulously preparing for this audition!  
  
**Mio：**  
Hahah!  
Well, we won't lose either!  
Even if we only decided to become idols recently!  
  
**Rookie Idol 2：**  
Huh?  
Recently? Like, how recent?  
  
**Rin：**  
Hm?  
Let's see...  
 About a week, I suppose.  
  
**Rookie Idol 1：**  
One week?!  
You're kidding me...?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm afraid it's true.  
A few days ago, they could barely sing in front of a crowd.  
  
**Rookie Idol 1：**  
...!  
We're gonna need a counterplan...!  
Let's go!  
  
**Rookie Idol 2：**  
O-okay!  
  
**Mio：**  
Heheh! ♪  
The one-week thing really shocked them, huh?!  
Maybe we really have got talent! ♪  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Uhhh...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Uzuki?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Mio says we might have talent, but...  
Is that really what this is?  
  
**Rin：**  
...Yeah.  
That does feel a bit off to me, too...  
The phrasing doesn't sit right for some reason.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You as well, Miss Rin...?  
  
**Rin：**  
Mm... I can't put it into words...  
But like, even during our lessons...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
When we practice singing techniques, or new dance movements...  
Rather than learning something new,  
it feels almost like remembering something I knew a long time ago...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh...? What about you, Mio?  
  
**Mio：**  
U-uhhh...  
I guess now that you mention it...?  
  
**Rin：**  
I wonder...  
Could all three of us have forgotten something really important?  
That's how it's starting to feel...  
  
**Mio：**  
Forgotten what, though, Shiburin...?  
  
**Rin：**  
I don't know what exactly...  
...But hold on.  
  
**Rin：**  
Mio, why do you call me \"Shiburin\" in the first place...?  
  
**Mio：**  
Huh?!  
Well, I mean... You're Shiburin, aren't you?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Yeah... \"Rin\" is my name.  
And Mio, you give people nicknames as soon as you meet them.  
But then, where did the \"Shibu\" part come from?  
  
**Mio：**  
U-umm...  
It was, uh...  
Hmmm... where *did* it come from?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Wait a minute, Mio.  
Instead of \"Uzuki,\" you call me \"Shimamu,\" don't you?  
But somehow that's never seemed weird to me at all...  
  
**Mio：**  
H-hang on a minute!  
It's not like I came up with those for some special reason!  
I just... just, uh...!  
  
**Rin：**  
...Yeah.  
That's why I think we might have forgotten the reason.  
Along with... a lot of other things.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
O-ohhh...!  
This is making my head feel funny!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Have the young ladies of \"New Generations\"  
had their memories taken from them somehow?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Being forgotten about is tough...  
But I'm sure it can't be easy  
knowing your own memories are missing, either.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Looks like these girls really do have some kind of hidden issues.  
I bet that big lunk holds the key somehow...  
But is he likely to spill the beans?  
  
**Onlooker 1：**  
Eeeek?!  
  
**Onlooker 2：**  
H-heeeeelp!  
  
**Karyl：**  
H... huh? What now?!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGGRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Monsters...?!  
In the middle of town?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't worry, I'll take them out in a jiffy!  
Here goes...  
  
**Monster：**  
GGGRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wait, huh?!  
Where's this one going?!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Huh?  
...Aaaaaghhh!  
  
**Rin：**  
These monsters... They're aiming straight for us?!  
  
**Mio：**  
Uh-oh...!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGGRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord!  
Let us defend the members of \"New Generations\"!
