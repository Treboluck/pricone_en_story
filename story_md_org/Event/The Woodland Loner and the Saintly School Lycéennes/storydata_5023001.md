## Subtitle: Meet the Friendship Club!
  
**Narration：**  
A few days after Misato's sudden request,  
Aoi finds herself standing hopelessly outside the gates  
to St. Theresa's Academy for Girls.  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Why, good day!  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Ah, a good day to you too!  
  
**Aoi：**  
The greeting to end all greetings...  
\"Good day\" is echoing all around me...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Urgh... The refined aura is blinding my poor eyes!  
I knew this school was no place for someone like me...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Now what? What now?  
I even left My Little Buddy V3 behind at home...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ah... That's right!  
 I almost forgot!  
  
**Aoi：**  
The sample I brought for my presentation!  
This Mandragora!  
  
**Mandragora：**  
...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Heheh... You seem pretty lively, huh?  
More than I can say for myself...  
  
**Aoi：**  
I knew a hopeless loner like me could never survive here.  
Not in a place filled with this aura of glittering youth...  
  
**Aoi：**  
I-I know!  
Mr. Mandragora, could you help me do a bit of practice?  
  
**Aoi：**  
I should a-at least make sure I can greet my classmates!  
G-g-g-g-g-g-g...!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Good day.  
`Tag 1`  
**Aoi：**  
Pueaagh?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ahh! Mr. Mandragora?!  
P-please don't leave me all alooooone!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Urgh... He ran away...  
I knew it... I'm fated to be a loner here, too...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You're not alone.  
`Tag 2`  
**Aoi：**  
Th-that voice again?!  
So it wasn't a hallucination...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ah... But you're... {player}!  
Wh-what are you doing here?!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I came to greet you.  
`Tag 3`  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? Miss Misato asked you to lend a hand...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Now that you mention it,  
I guess you did say something about attending this school...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Thank goodness... My life is saved!  
I can't believe I found the BB Brigade captain in a place like this!  
  
**Chieru：**  
And here's Chieru!  
 Cheru~~n! ☆  
  
**Aoi：**  
Hyeaargh?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, Chieru. Drop the 'tude.  
You come on way too strong.  
The kid's quaking in her boots.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Hyeuugh?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. A most unusual reaction. How very intriguing.  
Is that a breathing exercise unique to the elvenfolk?  
But no, I've never heard such a noise from our resident elf Chloe...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Hyeooghh?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Aahh... Aaahhh... So many... strange people...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Welpie, guess we've got ourselves a shyster.  
C'mon, {player}, I think you'd better introduce us!  
This girl's going all dizzy from new character overload!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  These girls are...  
`Tag 4`  
**Yuni：**  
Hold it, young man.  
 Do you mean to poach from your compatriots  
the all-too-rare experience of introducing oneself to a transfer student?  
Spare us your assistance. We would be glad to do the honors ourselves.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I'm Yuni.  
 As you've doubtless deduced from my mature and  
intellectual bearing, I am the eldest among us, a venerable third-year.  
If you ever have any concerns, you can always turn to me. Next, Chloe.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh? Me?  
Uhhh...  
 'Sup. Nice to meetcha. I'm Chloe, in second year.  
Guess we're both elves too. So, we cool?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Last but not least,  
 the first-year with flying colors in cute—me, Chieru!  
Cheru~~n! ♪  
 This greeting is gonna be the next big thing in Landosol,  
so you oughtta jump on the bandwagon early!  
  
**Aoi：**  
S-so blinding...!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ummm...  
 Is there a reason you're not even looking at me?  
I know my cuteness shines brighter than the sun, but I've never had  
a reaction like that before,  
 so I'm feeling a teensy bit hurt right now.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm... Ah, of course. I do believe I have it.  
Young Aoi, after careful observation, might I dare to deduce...  
  
**Yuni：**  
You're what is known as...  
 a loner!  
  
**Aoi：**  
H-how did you find me out?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Is such surprise quite necessary?  
I simply sensed a similar aura to my own.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wowie, our Yuni's on fire!  
Declaring herself a loner without a hint of shame!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh, now I see it.  
Her weird fidgeting did look kinda like Yuni, I guess.  
Nice eyes, loner-girl.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Eheh... Oh, you! You flatter me too much, you two!  
  
**Aoi：**  
U-um,  
 so who exactly are they...?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  They're the St. Theresa's Academy Friendship Club.  
**Choice: (6)**  They're the Yuni-ettes.  
`Tag 5`  
**Aoi：**  
Friendship Club...?!  
What a glittering and wondrous-sounding name!  
It's so bright, my eyes are watering...!  
  
**Chieru：**  
For realsies? Our guild name brought tears to your eyes?  
Even I wasn't expecting much praise for that part!  
  
**Chloe：**  
A rain of praise for our lazy-ass guild name that made no one happy?  
Words. I've got none.  
 ...Uh, are you still crying?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrmph.  
 I'm still not ready to concede  
my own superior proposal.  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, no.  
That proposal got shot down in one second flat.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Our guild's official name is \"Saint Theresa's Academy (Friendship Club),\"  
of course!  
 C'mon now, Yuni, let that name go!  
You know we sent it on a one-way trip to hell's incinerator!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oh, I've yet to abandon hope.  
It will be revived, and lo, the name of the Yuni-ettes  
shall ring out throughout the land!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Like some kind of zombie?  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Aoi：**  
Umm, so is your guild  
mainly about making friends with each other?  
  
**Aoi：**  
That's the BB Brigade's captain for you...  
Wherever he goes, he works to fulfill our brigade's noble goals...!  
  
**Aoi：**  
But, um, what are the members of this fine club  
 doing here...?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Young {player} requested our aid.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yeppers! He was all, \"I'm meeting a girl who's transferring in,  
but she'll be nervous on her first day, so why don't you guys come with?\"  
We're here to get the party started!  
  
**Yuni：**  
{player} has helped me greatly with my theses.  
I could hardly ignore a request from a compatriot.  
  
**Aoi：**  
{player}... All this for me...?!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  The BB Brigade and the Friendship Club are the same.  
`Tag 8`  
**Aoi：**  
I see... Both of our institutions  
share the goal of fostering friendships...!  
  
**Chloe：**  
I still don't totally get that, uh, \"BB Brigade\"(?) thing, but, y'know.  
I'm not busy, so I could show you 'round and stuff.  
  
**Yuni：**  
And I would, by all means, be willing to join you.  
Cultural exchange is an academically most valuable endeavor.  
Or in the terms of the layfolk,  
 friendship is beautiful.  
  
**Yuni：**  
As fellows in the loner caste, let's assist one another.  
  
**Chieru：**  
I'm fine with whatever as long we all have chellerific fun!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Y-you're too kind...!  
A... a-a-all right! It's a pleasure to meat chew wall!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Those are some nerves!  
Awww, Aoi, you're the adorbiest! ♪  
  
**Aoi：**  
H-hyeeegh?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Th-this Chieru girl smells so good!  
She hugs without a second thought, and seems like everyone's friend...  
This must be what they call a \"normie\"!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Young Chieru... Do curtail your wanton bodily contact.  
 Each individual  
is entitled to a conceptual boundary known as \"personal space.\"  
Your social-butterfly mannerisms are far too radical for the unprepared.  
  
**Yuni：**  
As one of similar disposition, I'd surmise that young Aoi has no resistance to the \"normie aura.\"  
In the terms of the layfolk... back off a little.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Awww, do I really gotta~?  
Making friends with anyone and everyone is my specialty!  
I'm sure she'll be fine,  
 won'tcha, Ao...  
  
**Aoi：**  
...*squeak*  
  
**Yuni：**  
I was too late to save her...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ah, geez. Still, sending a kid like this to our school?  
This Miss Misato chick must be a real tough cookie.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  She's a kind person really.  
`Tag 9`  
**Chloe：**  
Eh?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Excuse me?  
Say, are you mayhaps acquainted with this Miss Misato already?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Really? This again~?  
{player}, how many more of these girls  
have you been seeing behind our backs, anyway?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh... Well, whatevs. Not like it's my biz.  
  
**Chloe：**  
So is this... Miss Misato(?) chick  
 thinking this transfer deal  
is gonna be like, a trial by fire thing?  
Like, \"if you love 'em, let 'em go\"? Or whatever.  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Hrm? What's wrong, young {player}?  
Your face betrays a certain measure of deliberation.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well, it's pretty obvious what he wants.  
You're hoping us three will look after Aoi while she's at school, right?  
  
**Chieru：**  
And my answer is...  
 \"Are you for real,  
 you silly billy?\"  
As if you even need to ask us to do that!  
 Right, Yuni?  
  
**Yuni：**  
So be it, then. Anything for the magic of youth.  
Wouldn't you agree, young Chloe?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well... Don't see why not, I guess.  
I mean...  
 sure, works for me.  
  
**Narration：**  
So it was that Aoi made first contact with the members of  
the St. Theresa's Academy (Friendship Club) guild.  
A brand-new way of life was about to unfold before her.  
  
**Mandragora：**  
...
