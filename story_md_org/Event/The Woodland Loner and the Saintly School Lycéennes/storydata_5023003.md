# Presentation Brainstorming!
Aoi asks the Friendship Club for advice about her special presentation. This initially invites apprehension from her classmates, who are suspicious of the delinquent Chloe and her friends, but Yuni deftly solves the misunderstanding. That night, a teacher faints after witnessing a gigantic apparition.
  
## Subtitle: Presentation Brainstorming!
  
**Narration：**  
A few days into her life at St. Theresa's Academy,  
Aoi has begun to feel somewhat comfortable in this new environment.  
  
**Teacher：**  
May I have a moment, Miss Aoi?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Y-yes?!  
D-did I do something horribly wrong?!  
  
**Teacher：**  
No need to panic, my dear.  
I was just hoping to check in on your progress.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Progress...?  
  
**Teacher：**  
I'm sure you haven't forgotten,  
but you are scheduled to make a presentation in a few days' time.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Presen... tation...?  
  
**Teacher：**  
Everyone is looking forward to it.  
Well then, a good day to you.  
  
**Aoi：**  
...Aaaaaahhhhhhh!  
  
**Chieru：**  
So, why'd you call us all here today?  
  
**Chloe：**  
After school, even.  
I mean, it's fine. Not like I've got any shifts today.  
  
**Aoi：**  
I-I'm very sorry!  
I-I-I-I-I'd just completely forgotten!About my, um, presentation...!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. \"Presentation\"...?  
 Ah, yes, of course.  
Your transfer arrangement involves a lecture to your fellow students.  
  
**Aoi：**  
But I, um, completely lost the plant I was going to talk about!  
So I asked {player},  
and he said I should talk to you guys!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's a job for the Friendship Club!  
`Tag 1`  
**Chieru：**  
And how d'you figure that one?  
Have you gotten us mixed up with some sort of odd-jobs crew?  
I never signed up to be your adorable handyman~!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Le sigh...  
I wanted to offer to help on my own,  
but you had to go and mess up my motivation, didn't you?  
  
**Chloe：**  
And uh, I know we agreed to help Aoi and stuff.  
But like, lectures? Y'know, all that academic-type stuff  
doesn't really seem like our area, does it?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, of course!  
Clearly  
 this is indeed a task for the Yuni-ettes!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Someone's in her element!  
  
**Chloe：**  
For real though, Yuni, what's your obsession with that reject guild name.  
Are you possessed?  
 Do you need a pinch of salt to exorcise the cringe?  
  
**Aoi：**  
I-I'm very sorry, everyone!  
I know this is an awful lot to ask of you all, but, ahhh...!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oh, don't apologize to us, young Aoi.  
The Yuni-ettes are a guild with ambitions of worldwide renown.  
  
**Yuni：**  
We'd never shame ourselves by abandoning a compatriot in need!  
  
**Aoi：**  
O-oh, Yuni...!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Um, anyone?  
Where did the sudden passionate mentor act come from?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Shrug... Beats me.  
Maybe Yuni's craving more respect  
than that pocket-size body gets her.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well then!  
Let's do what we do best, my fellow Yuni-ettes!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Thank you so much, members of the Yuni-ettes!  
  
**Chieru & Chloe：**  
We are *so* not Yuni-ettes.

**Yuni：**  
Ehm... Well then.  
Let's begin by deciding on a topic for this presentation.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Young Aoi, you belong to a guild named Forestier, yes?  
I understand it's an elven organization,  
but what work do you do exactly?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ummm...  
 Guiding people who visit the forest?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, I see. Then perhaps you could teach the sheltered young ladies here  
about the charms and dangers of the forest from an elven perspective.  
Include a nature conservation angle, and the faculty will also approve.  
  
**Yuni：**  
In addition...  
 Let's see.  
You could actually brew up an herbal concoction or two.  
Practical demonstrations always go over well with the audience.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wow, Yuni's on point.  
I mean, I always *knew* she was smart, but I never quite *believed* it.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeah, she sure hides it well.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Young Chloe, perhaps as a fellow elf yourself,  
you could lend young Aoi some words of advice.  
  
**Chloe：**  
As a fellow elf? I'm a city girl to the bone...  
But uh, sure. On it. I'll do the elf thing.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hey, hey! What about me, Yuni? What should I do?  
  
**Yuni：**  
You can sit in the corner and...  
No—you should inform us if you have any questions.  
Your intuition is a valuable asset.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Did you just try to get rid of me for a moment there?  
You did, didn't you?  
Have you forgotten I get top grades in every subject?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I want to help too!  
`Tag 2`

`image display end`  
**Yuni：**  
Et tu, young {player}?  
Well, ah, that goodwill is a virtue...  
Hrm, let's see. You can... You can...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hey, Yuni, don't let your brain overheat!  
  
**Chloe：**  
How's an amnesiac gonna help.  
His brain's at kindergarten level.  
  
**Aoi：**  
It's all right, {player}!  
Just having you around fills me with motivation!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Dang, Aoi's so kind!  
...But also kinda harsh.  
  
**Chieru：**  
That was a nope on the Chieru chart.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? Huhhh?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well... erm.  
Let's say then, {player}, you can, ah...  
give my shoulders a hearty rub.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Welp, it's official.  
You've been made redundant.  
Giving him the old \"tap on the shoulder\"?  
 God, that's lame.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Massage like a pro.  
**Choice: (6)**  Massage like your life depends on it.  
`Tag 5`  
**Yuni：**  
Mm... Aahhh... A shoulder rub from a strapping young man...  
S-so this is how it feels... Mmmhh... Not bad...!  
I've never felt anything like it!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ooh, that looks pretty heavenly...  
Hey, {player}, you're doing me next, 'kay?  
I'll have the one-hour full-body course~!  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Yuni：**  
O-ow, that hurts!  
 But it's not bad!  
This intense pressure...  
The aches are being squeezed from my body...!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, bodies aren't meant to bend like that.  
Like, can you still even move.  
You've been folded up like an origami pretzel.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Aoi：**  
Everyone, thank you so much for your help!  
I never thought I'd come up with a plan so quickly!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Think nothing of it, young Aoi.  
It's any senior's duty to come to the aid of her juniors.  
Be sure to come to me whenever you're in need.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Chieru? Why're you blowing on her?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, just inflating her ego.  
It seemed to be the thing to do.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Now all that's left is to present this content  
to your eager classmates on the day.  
I wish you the best of luck, young Aoi.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Right!  
 ...Huh?  
P... present it...? To people...?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh... Yeah, that figures.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Looks like the hardest part is only just beginning, huh?  
  
**Aoi：**  
I-I can't possibly talk in front of a crowd!  
What should I do, Master Yuniii?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrmm. Dear me.  
This is quite the pickle.  
But worry not. The dependable Yuni will solve your woes!  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Urgh... A live presentation...  
How am I supposed to even consider it?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
But Yuni did say she'd take care of everything...  
So if I train hard,  
 maybe it'll work somehow...?  
  
**Female Student：**  
Um, Aoi?  
Do you have a moment to talk?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Eek?!  
Wh-wh-what seems to be the matter?!  
  
**Female Student：**  
Sorry if I surprised you.  
It's just, you always vanish off somewhere after school,  
so I was a little curious...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh... Um, Yuni and the others  
were helping me prepare for my presentation,  
 so I...  
  
**Female Student：**  
\"Yuni\"...?!  
Surely you don't mean the academy's number one genius,  
Dr. Yuni herself?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Um, \"Doctor\"...?  
Well, ah... She does seem very academically minded, but I'm not sure...  
  
**Female Student：**  
L-listen, Aoi! Dr. Yuni is a living legend of St. Theresa's Academy,  
blessed with the greatest mind in generations.  
She's far beyond the reach of us mere mortals—  
  
**Aoi：**  
B-but Yuni and all her guildmates  
are very kind people who are always willing to—  
  
**Female Student：**  
Her guildmates?  
 I have heard that Dr. Yuni is often accompanied  
by Chloe and Chieru...  
  
**Female Student：**  
But Chloe is infamous as an outright delinquent!  
  
**Female Student：**  
I have heard rumors about this Chieru girl as well...  
That she is a wild free spirit  
who the teachers don't know what to do with...  
  
**Female Student：**  
Aoi, are you sure you're all right?  
Spending time with such an outrageous group...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Would you excuse us? Sorry to intrude.  
  
**Female Student：**  
D-Dr. Yuni?! And her associates, too!  
G-good day to you all...!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes, good day.  
I'm afraid I couldn't help hearing from the corridor.  
As a senior student, I have a duty to clear up any misunderstandings.  
  
**Yuni：**  
This girl... Young Aoi  
 is a kindhearted soul.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, pretty much.  
She's even nice to outcasts like us.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Indeed. She evaluates her fellows without prejudice or preconceptions.  
Her heart lies ever open to any who would accept her.  
A noble gift of gracious tolerance  
 born from years of hermetic solitude.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Such a rare and fine quality deserves my utmost respect.  
As such, I should hope that you'll follow her example  
and foster a virtuous friendship unblemished by trifling matters.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Or... as the layfolk say,  
 you'd better be nice to her!  
Cheru~n! ♪  
  
**Yuni：**  
Young Aoi, forgive us.  
It seems your association with us  
has caused consternation among your peers.  
  
**Aoi：**  
O-oh no, that's OK...  
I mean, thank you very much, Yuni.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Eheheh... The way you talked about me back there  
made me feel really happy somehow...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, yes.  
For an unrehearsed performance, I put on quite the act, didn't I?  
Heheh... It seems I may have a hidden talent for theater.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? ...Huh?!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm? Why the surprise?  
 Back in my village days,  
I spent much of my time reading flowery tales of academic life.  
  
**Yuni：**  
In one such volume, there was a notable scene much like your situation.  
So how could I resist reciting those lines from memory?  
In the terms of the layfolk, I crave the magic of youth.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I'm glad my audience... ah, I mean you, young Aoi, enjoyed the show.  
To move others' hearts is the heartfelt wish of any actor.  
Now, perhaps we should end our small talk and return to practicing—  
  
**Aoi：**  
...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Young Aoi? You seem remarkably stiff all of a sudden...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Big oof.  
Yuni, you done messed up this time.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Really driving the ol'  
\"A loner knows not her fellow loner's heart\" home, huh, Yuni? ♪  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrmm? Whatever do you mean?  
  
**Aoi：**  
W-waaaaaahhhh! You're the worst, Yuniiiiii!  
  
**Yuni：**  
H-hrmm?  
Wait, young Aoi! Why would you react this way?!  
You misunderstand...  
 or perhaps not, but at least let me explain!  
  
**Yuni：**  
It's not like that!  
 Yes, those words may find their roots in fiction,  
but that doesn't preclude my underlying sincerity...!  
Y-young Aoiiiiii!  
  
**Narration：**  
That night...  
  
**???：**  
...  
  
**Teacher：**  
...Hello?  
Is there someone around?  
  
**Mandragora：**  
GGGGRRRUOOOGGHHH!  
  
**Teacher：**  
Aaghh?! Wh-what in the world is this?!  
  
**Teacher：**  
Ahhhh...
