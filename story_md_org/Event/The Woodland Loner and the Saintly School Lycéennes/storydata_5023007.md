## Subtitle: The Magic of Youth Goes On
  
**Narration：**  
The day has come for Aoi to bid farewell to life at the academy.  
  
**Aoi：**  
...Goodbye, St. Theresa's.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hey, Aoi!  
 Cheru~n! ☆  
  
**Chloe：**  
Chieru.  
Can you try *not* leading with that lame-ass greeting.  
It's a tough act to follow.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Cheru~n. ☆  
  
**Chloe：**  
Not you too.  
What's the deal, are you chelled in the head?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ahh!  
 Even Chloe started speaking Chellish at last!  
That made zero sense though. Learn what words mean.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Y-you guys! Why are you...?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  We came to see you off.  
`Tag 1`  
**Aoi：**  
Not only greeting me on my arrival,  
but seeing me off as I leave too?  
  
How could I possibly deserve all this special treatment?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Who says you don't? Not me.  
We're just doing this 'cause we want to, anyway.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yep, yep!  
And besides, look over at the school!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Female Student：**  
Aoi~! We'll miss you!  
We hope you come back soon!  
  
**Teacher：**  
There's always a place for you at St. Theresa's!  
  
**Aoi：**  
A-aaahhh... So many people...!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Indeed.  
They were as keen as us to see you off in person,  
but we thought that might overwhelm you a little.  
  
**Chieru：**  
So I came up with a compromise!  
Just call me the Queen of Tact!  
  
**Aoi：**  
N-nobody's  
 ever done anything like this before!  
All for the likes of me...?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Drop the \"likes of.\"  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ah...  
  
**Chloe：**  
You've worked your ass off. Hold your head high,  
 Aoi.  
  
**Aoi：**  
A... aaahhh... Ch-Chloeeee...!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yep, yep!  
Tears only make a girl more beautiful, so let 'em all out!  
  
**Yuni：**  
What a moving sight. Mm...  
...By the by, young Aoi.  
  
**Aoi：**  
U-uhhh?  
  
**Yuni：**  
I hate to interrupt your rush of emotion,  
but there's something we'd like to confirm.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Wh-what could that be?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Don't s'pose you could find...  
 any more Mandragoras?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? Huuuuh?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Y'know, those things grow in the Elven Forest, right?  
So we thought you could smuggle...  
 um, I mean,  
 gift us?  
One or two of them? Maybe?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  There go all the warm fuzzies...  
**Choice: (3)**  You monsters...  
`Tag 2`  
**Chloe：**  
Like, those are two separate things?  
Friendship good. Profit also good.  
...  
Stop looking at me like that.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Chieru：**  
Is that a look of pure digust?!  
L-look, I'm Chieru the supercutie~!  
 Cheru~n! ♪  
Not working? Still mad?  
 Yep, I figured!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Yuni：**  
L-listen, Aoi, it isn't like that!  
It's just that, from a scientific perspective,  
a source of Mandragora samples would be most beneficial...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh! Hey, I've got it!  
Why don't we publish this whole adventure as a novel?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Written by who.  
Oh, but actually,  
 if we did do that,  
wouldn't it count toward our scholarship assignments?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Intriguing.  
 A fine idea.  
Then allow me to summarize the Yuni-ettes' activities  
in a full and thorough report!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, super!  
We'll leave all that to you, then,  
leader of the Yuni-ettes!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh-huh. You said it.  
Yuni-ettes forever.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Astounding!  
 Finally, some recognition for the Yuni-ettes!  
I'm awash with elation!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Very well, my charming juniors!  
As your dependable guiding light,  
I'll produce the finest report you have ever witnessed!  
  
**Chieru & Chloe：**  
Wow, what a pushover.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Haha... Ahaha... haha...!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I'm so, so glad I was able to meet all of you!  
  
**Yuni：**  
...As am I.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Me three!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, same...?  
I mean, well...  
Yeah.  
 It's been good.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Well then... I should be going!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  See you around.  
`Tag 5`  
**Aoi：**  
Right!  
  
**Aoi：**  
...U-umm...!  
Next time we meet, I...  
  
**Aoi：**  
I'd love to become friends with you all!  
  
**Chieru：**  
And she's gone...  
  
**Yuni：**  
She ran off like a speeding rocket.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh-huh.  
...What did she say at the end there?  
  
**Chieru：**  
For serious!  
Did she really just say that?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Honestly, of all the absurd things to say.  
Young Aoi.  
 Whether you realize it or whether you don't...  
  
**Chieru, Yuni & Chloe：**  
We're already friends!  
  
**Narration：**  
As they waved goodbye to Aoi's rapidly-retreating back,  
the members of the Friendship Club  
had the kindest of smiles on their faces.
