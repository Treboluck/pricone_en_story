# A High Bar to Clear
Though Aoi's presentation goes well during practice, when the time comes to face her classmates, she gets cold feet and runs away. But thanks to a few choice words from Chieru about how to work up courage, she finds the confidence to make her special lesson a success.
  
## Subtitle: A High Bar to Clear
  
**Narration：**  
The day before Aoi's big presentation,  
she has gathered {player} and the others  
to rehearse her plan one last time.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Th... that's a wrap!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Very good. I see no pressing issues.  
You were still a little stiff,  
but that's simply a matter of finding the confidence.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeah... It was fine?  
Good going, kid.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Applaud Aoi.  
`Tag 1`  
**Aoi：**  
I-i-  
it's all thanks to your help!  
Y-you guys are the besht!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Big congrats, Aoi!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Eek!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Why'd you run away?  
C'mon, I'm just gonna hug you and give you headpats!  
That's how us girls show we love each other!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Yeaarghh!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Hold up.  
Why're you hiding behind *me*.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Sheesh, Chloe, you thief!  
Don't try to steal my cute Aoi!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ehm. The girl is not your property...  
In fact,  
 this is precisely your problem.  
I can understand how young Aoi feels.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hu~h? What's wrong with me?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeah... I guess I'm with Yuni.  
Chieru, you're always way too... intense, y'know?  
  
**Chieru：**  
I'm what now?!  
I mean, it's true that I'm always shining bright!  
Like gold or silver or a priceless jewel!  
  
**Chieru：**  
But that's beside the point, right?  
You're not scared of little old Chieru, are you, Aoi?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Hyeeugh...!  
  
**Chieru：**  
No way.  
 ...No way.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Heh. With loners like ourselves, proactivity can be a blunder.  
It's like romance. Sometimes you need to step back  
and let them come to you.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh, Yuni. I didn't know you had any romantic experience at all!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Nghh...!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Chieru, that counter was a low blow.  
You've sent her into the fetal position.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Th... that's not it!  
  
**Aoi：**  
It's just, Chieru tells me I'm cute like nobody has before,  
and talks to me so freely, it just... surprises me a little...  
  
**Chieru：**  
A-Aoi...!  
Then if I take it slowly, it's fine, right?  
Shuffle... shuffle...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Eeeeeek!  
  
**Chieru：**  
The shock...  
Usually it only takes me seconds to make friends with anyone...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's do some training!  
**Choice: (3)**  Cheru~n.  
`Tag 2`  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? T-training, you say?  
As in, to get used to Chieru...?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Training?! For real?!  
Just talking to me is that big a deal?!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? Huh?  
 What's this all of a sudden?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Cheru~n! ♪  
You totally get it, {player}!  
As a little reward from me, let me  
 blow you a smooch! ☆  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Aoi：**  
Oh, I see... If I get used to Chieru,  
I'll have no trouble acting confident in front of everyone else!  
  
**Chieru：**  
So I'm, what, a trial to be overcome now?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes, the logic seems sound.  
One with the daring to brave young Chieru can overcome any hurdle.  
Though it will be no easy task.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, yeah, I guess? I'm not arguing.  
Though it won't be easy.  
  
**Aoi：**  
A-all right, then!  
I'll do my best to train myself to talk to Chieru!  
Though it won't be easy!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? Wait, wait, wait. Are we just rolling with  
the idea that I'm the world's hardest person to talk to?  
That's so not me in the slightest!  
  
**Chieru：**  
...It's not, right?  
  
**Narration：**  
And so, the day of Aoi's presentation arrives...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Guehh. What a crowd.  
Can I leave?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Not so fast, young Chloe.  
Don't you wish to bear witness to the fruits of young Aoi's labor?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeah, yeah, I know.  
Just a little straight-talking joke.  
  
**Chieru：**  
So you did mean it...?  
Still, I'm a little worried...  
 Like, we did all that training,  
but Aoi never did conquer me in the end, did she?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Someone's accepted her role as the ultimate trial...  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Say, where *is* Aoi?  
Won't she be late if she doesn't begin her preparations soon?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Good question.  
She hasn't even distributed the handouts we made.  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Could it be...  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Don't tell me...  
  
**Chieru：**  
...You don't think...  
  
**Chieru, Yuni & Chloe：**  
She chickened out?  
  
**Chloe：**  
So... what now?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrmm...  
I should have had the foresight to place a magical tracer upon her.  
Still, we can't change the past. Come, young Chloe, let's search—  
  
**Chieru：**  
Okies, I'll go look for her!  
You two get things ready for the presentation, OK?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Look for her?  
 You?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Is that the wisest of ideas?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Let's trust in Chieru.  
`Tag 5`  
**Chieru：**  
Thanks! You're the chelliest, {player}!  
Well then,  
 I'll be back in a chelleroonie~!  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Never gonna be a thing.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm... Well then, it seems we have preparations to attend to.  
  
**Chloe：**  
On it.  
  
**Aoi：**  
...Wh-what should I do?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
When I tried to enter the classroom,  
all those people turned to look my way...  
  
**Aoi：**  
So I panicked and ran all the way out here...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Now {player}, and Yuni, and Chloe, and Chieru...  
They'll be so disappointed in me...  
  
**Aoi：**  
It's already too late for apologies, isn't it...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Cheru~n! ♪  
  
**Aoi：**  
Hyeaaargh?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
'Sup, li'l Aoi?  
I knew I'd find you in the same empty classroom as last time!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ch-Chieru...!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I-I'm so sorry!  
A-a-after all the help you guys gave me, I just...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yep, you sure threw us for a loop!  
Who'd've thought you'd bail on us after all the practice we did?  
  
**Aoi：**  
A-aaurgh...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Pretty impressive stuff!  
I know *I* could never do that. Takes a lotta guts.  
Not even kidding—that's a talent you've got there!  
  
**Aoi：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Chieru：**  
So listen. If you ask me,  
I think you might have more courage than any of us.  
Like, you hightail it for the hills in seconds flat...  
  
**Chieru：**  
But like, doesn't that take its own kind of courage too?  
It's not like running away is an easy thing to do.  
  
**Aoi：**  
I've got courage...?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yep! So I'm thinking maybe all you've gotta do  
is point it in a different direction, see?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Like, think back a second.  
What did you do to prepare yourself for today?  
  
**Aoi：**  
...  
  
**Aoi：**  
I guess I... I worked really hard to prepare.  
Chloe helped me be more positive...  
Yuni helped me work out what I should do... and Chieru, you...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Just now... you gave me my confidence.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Now you're just trying to make me blush~! ♪  
Chieru liked and reposted that comment!  
 Cheru~n! ☆  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ch-cheru~n... ♪  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ooh!  
 Impressive!  
Even Chloe doesn't have the guts to do that greeting!  
That proves you're not afraid of anything!  
  
**Aoi：**  
R-right...!  
I... I should get back to the classroom!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Thank you so much, Chieru!  
  
**Aoi：**  
...Th-thassall for today!  
Th-thank you for coming to my presentation!  
  
**Yuni：**  
I confess I was worried for a while,  
but she did even better than I'd hoped.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Mmm... Ten outta ten.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Thank Chieru.  
`Tag 6`  
**Chieru：**  
Heheh~!  
That's right, worship and adore me, {player}!

**Aoi：**  
Aahh... Awaaaahhh?!  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Hey, Aoi!  
Could you tell us just a little bit more  
about those forest animals you mentioned?  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Are there any more specialized uses  
for that concoction you just showed us?  
  
**Aoi：**  
H-huuuhhh?!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ahh... She dropped outta the zone. She's totally losing it.  
We didn't do any Q&A practice, either...  
 This is gonna be trouble.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Indeed...  
We should have anticipated these inquisitive minds.  
Hrm, perhaps we should aid her.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hmm... Are you sure?  
I think she might be just fine.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Why don't we wait and watch a little longer?  
  
**Aoi：**  
(I just need to point my courage  
 in a different direction, right...?)  
  
**Aoi：**  
U-ummm...!  
So those animals are actually...  
  
**Aoi：**  
And, um...  
The paste I made is used for hunting, too...  
When applied to arrows, it explodes...  
  
**Chieru：**  
...See?  
  
**Narration：**  
Aoi's special presentation was a hit with the students.  
As the members of the Friendship Club watched from afar,  
there were smiles of pride on their faces.

**Teacher：**  
Excuse me.  
Miss Aoi, do you mind if I ask you a question of my own?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Wh-what is it?  
  
**Teacher：**  
Are there any plants in the Elven Forest that grow to massive size?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh?  
Yes,  
 I suppose there are a few...  
  
**Teacher：**  
Then perhaps my eyes were not deceiving me...  
That plant that looked like some kind of colossal root...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Could you possibly mean...  
 a Mandragora?!
