**Chieru：**  
Wha—it's gone totally berserk?!  
You've gotta be kidding!  
  
**Aoi：**  
It's way too dangerous! Get back, everyone!  
  
**Yuni：**  
I'm afraid we don't have that luxury.  
If we let these riches escape...  
 Awahh! I said nothing.  
  
**Chloe：**  
For real though, isn't it time we gave up on capturing it?  
One wrong move and we're all gonna be plant food.  
  
**Aoi：**  
It was such a sweet little thing, and look at it now...  
The least I can do is end it quickly!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm... I'd hate to betray young Aoi's kind intentions.  
Let's all respect her wishes as best we can.  
This is the final battle! Yuni-ettes, full steam ahead!
