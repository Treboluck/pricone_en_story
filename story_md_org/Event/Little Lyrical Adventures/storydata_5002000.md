# Teach Me, Miss Kyoka!
When Misogi gets awful test results, she askes Kyoka to help her study. Delighted to be relied upon, Kyoka gets carried away and asks difficult questions, causing Misogi to give up on studying entirely. The two of them end up fighting.
  
## Subtitle: Teach Me, Miss Kyoka!
  
**Narration：**  
Kyoka, Mimi and {player} are playing in the Elven Forest  
as they wait for Misogi to arrive.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Aaa... Achoo!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Mimi? Are you OK?  
 Here, have a tissue.  
  
**Mimi：**  
Thanks, Kyoka!  
Hmmm, is this because I slept with my tummy out yesterday?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Really, you mustn't do that!  
You need to wrap up nice and warm or you'll catch a cold!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahhh... *sniffle*  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Even when the days are warm, it's chilly at night, you know  
Oh, and remember to wash your hands when you get home!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Eheheh... Kyoka, it's like you're my mommy...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're so meticulous, Kyoka.  
**Choice: (2)**  Mommyyyy!  
`Tag 1`  
**Kyoka：**  
Of course I am!  
I can't spoil my perfect attendance record!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kyoka：**  
Wh-what kind of nonsense is this now, you big baby?  
Don't tell me this is the sort of thing you're \"into\"?!  
You really are a suspicious, creepy guy!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kyoka：**  
...Mimi, make sure not to push yourself too hard, OK?  
If you feel unwell, you should go straight home!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Okay...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Kyoka! Kyoka!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Hmm? Ah! Misogi!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Kyoka! You gotta help me! It's an emergency!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wahh! What's this all of a sudden?  
  
**Misogi：**  
My mom went and found the test results I've been hiding!  
She got mad like you wouldn't believe!  
  
**Misogi：**  
If I don't get good grades on the next test,  
she's gonna cut my allowance in half!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Then, um... Maybe you should try studying?  
  
**Misogi：**  
You know me—just looking at a textbook makes me sleepy!  
And I don't get any of the things it says at all!  
  
**Misogi：**  
So, Kyoka, you've gotta show me how to do this stuff!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Absolutely not. The point of studying is to put in the effort yourself!  
If you rely on me for this test, what will you do for the next one?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Just this once! I swear! I'll put in the work myself, too!  
So please, Kyoka! No—Miss Kyoka! Teach me!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
A... a teacher? Me?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
W-well, if you really insist, I suppose there's no harm...!  
Just for you, Misogi, I'll try my hand at teaching!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Wow! You're amazing, Kyoka!  
Good luck, Misogi! I know you can both do it!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Right! To begin with, I'll teach you about reflection of light!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Okay! Let's hear it, Teach!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
First, light travels in perfectly straight lines!  
This line approaching the mirror is the incident ray,  
and this separate line is the reflected ray!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? Huh? What's all this about incidents?  
Weren't we talking about light?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
The first step in understanding reflection is to identify the incident ray!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ummm... So there's an incident... that gets reflected?  
Then the light hits the mirror, and we need to find an angle...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
You see, reflection of light is extremely closely related  
to light refraction. If you compare...  
  
**Misogi：**  
R-refraction?  
 Umm... What was that again?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Eheheh... I sound just like a real teacher! All right!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
First of all, you can try solving this problem.  
Also, this question, and this one over here!  
  
**Misogi：**  
H-huhhh?! That's too many things at once...  
What's all this?! I don't get it at all!  
I don't think this is even on the test!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
It might be a little bit difficult,  
but with me teaching you, you'll be fine!  
If you get it down now, you'll even be ready for—  
  
**Misogi：**  
None of this is fine at all!Oh, forget it!  
Mimi, mister, let's play a game!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
W-wait a minute!  
You're the one who asked me to help you study!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Well, yeah, I did... I was really pumped to get started,  
but none of the stuff you said made any sense!  
All you do is ask hard questions!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I chose those questions for your own sake!  
So you won't get bad grades anymore!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Aaahhhhh! Both of you, please stop fighting!  
Let's all get along! *sniff, sniff*...  
  
**Misogi：**  
I'm not trying to start a fight... It's all Kyoka's fault!  
Not everyone can do this stuff like you do, Kyoka!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
You're the one who's not trying!  
Forget it! I'm not speaking to you anymore!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh, bahhh! Fine then! Be like that!  
I don't need you anyway!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahh... Misogi, wait!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Excuse me. I think I'll head home for today!  
Goodbye now! I'll see you later, Mimi!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Ahh... Ohhh... This isn't... right at all...  
Can you help, mister? You've got to get them to make up!
