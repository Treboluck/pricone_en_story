Kyoka and Mimi are having fun in the Elven Forest when Misogi shows up begging for help with her studies. Kyoka agrees to help teach her, but then...
  
**Mimi：**  
Hoppety-hop, hoppety-hop~! ♪  
Kyoka, what should we play today?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Let's decide when Misogi gets here.  
Hmm, what would be good? We could play tag... or hide-and-seek...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Kyoka! Kyoka! You gotta help me!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wahh! What's wrong, Misogi?  
Why the panicky rush?  
  
**Misogi：**  
I got the worst grades on my last test, and now my mom's sooo mad!  
Kyoka, you gotta help me study!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Study? Honestly, Misogi...  
This is what happens when you don't review your lessons properly.  
  
**Misogi：**  
I know, I know!  
So you gotta help me, Great Teacher Kyoka!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Oh, wooow! Kyoka, are you a teacher now?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
A teacher?! Me?!  
...W-well, I suppose... If it's just this once...!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Yaaay! You're the best, Kyoka!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Well then, let's get down to studying!

**Misogi：**  
Uhhh... Hey, Kyoka...  
Can we just forget studying and play instead?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Of course not!  
 Here, we'll do this page next!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Misogi, good luck with your studying!
