## Subtitle: Recipe for Friendship
  
**Narration：**  
The day after her fight with Kyoka,  
Misogi struggles to concentrate on studying  
because of her lingering worries.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Aw man, I don't get what this textbook's saying at all!  
Why does studying have to be a thing...  
  
**Misogi：**  
If it weren't for those dumb tests,  
I wouldn't have fought with Kyoka either!  
It's all the tests' fault! I'm innocent!  
  
**Misogi：**  
...Ahhhh... I guess I oughtta apologize to her, though...  
But I don't know what I should say...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Wh-who knows if she'd even accept my apology?!  
She did seem super angry!  
  
**Misogi：**  
What if things stay like this forever?!  
Urghh... I can't stand feeling like this much longer!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Even yesterday, I wanted to play together once we were done studying...  
Is she never gonna talk to me again?  
I mean, that's what she said, so...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hey, Misogi!  
`Tag 1`  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? Mister {player}?  
What could he be doing here?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh, I know! I should get him to help me!  
He might know how to make up after a fight!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hey! Mister!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Wait, he totally disappeared?!  
...Oh, right. I dug a pitfall over there.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  H... help me...  
**Choice: (3)**  Who put this pitfall here?  
`Tag 2`  
**Misogi：**  
Geez, you're always such a klutz, mister!  
When you came running over, you seemed like a cool hero!  
Couldn't you keep it up for two seconds?  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Misogi：**  
A-ahaha... Digging helps when I'm feeling stressed.  
But y'know, mister, you could at least not fall into traps  
when I'm feeling down and stuff!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Misogi：**  
There we go!  
Ahaha, you're all muddy!  
You really oughtta watch where you're walking!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? You've got a delivery?  
Forget that for now, I need you to help me with something!  
  
**Misogi：**  
You know me and Kyoka had a fight, yeah?  
And sure, her teaching sounded like total gobbledygook,  
and those tough questions were really annoying...  
  
**Misogi：**  
But... I was the one who asked her to teach me,  
so I probably shouldn't have given up right away...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Besides, when we're fighting, even pranks aren't any fun,  
and I can't concentrate on anything either...  
  
**Misogi：**  
So... Umm...  
  
I was thinking I wanna make up with her!  
I've gotta tell her I'm really sorry!  
  
**Misogi：**  
But... I'm sure she's still really mad... She won't talk to me...  
Hey, mister, do you know how to make friends again?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Try giving her something she likes.  
`Tag 5`  
**Misogi：**  
Something she likes? Uhhh... How about a cupcake?  
This one time, I remember her saying  
cupcakes help take her mind off nasty stuff...  
  
**Misogi：**  
And they're simple, so maybe even I could make one!  
Ohhh, but the ones Kyoka likes  
are the proper ones they sell in the city...  
  
**Misogi：**  
It's okay? The feeling's what counts?  
...Maybe you're right! You say some cool things sometimes, mister!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Yeah... That's it. I'll make a cupcake and give it to her!  
Then we'll be friends again for sure!  
  
**Misogi：**  
All right! Time to do some hardcore baking, then!  
You're gonna help too, right, mister?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ummm... Mix some butter and sugar, and add eggs...  
After that, we sieve this floury stuff?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Uwehh! *cough, cough*...  
How does making cupcakes cause explosions?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
That's weird... I'm sure I did what it says in the recipe...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Wait... Aghhh!  
This isn't flour at all! It's the flash powder I use for my pranks!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Awww, man...  
Maybe I should've helped Mom out with the cooking more often...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh well, no point crying about it.  
I've just gotta do the best I can right now  
and make a tasty cupcake for Kyoka!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Maybe it won't be as pretty as the ones in the shops,  
but that's not what matters!  
  
**Misogi：**  
I'm not gonna let our friendship go!  
I couldn't have half as much fun playing pranks  
without Kyoka to keep me in check!  
  
**Misogi：**  
I'm as bad at cooking as I am at studying, but... but...  
I'm done with giving up! I know I can do it if I try!  
  
**Misogi：**  
This should be... the right amount.  
I've gotta get the order right... Set up the timer...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Now put it in the oven...  
Please please please! This time it's gotta come out all right!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hey mister, hey mister! Something smells really good!  
This has gotta be the one!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Right, I'm gonna open the oven. Shazam!

**Misogi：**  
Whoaaa! It's all round and fluffy!  
No way, no way! I think I actually did it!  
  
`image display end`  
**Misogi：**  
Thanks for lending me your kitchen, mister!  
I couldn't do it at home, 'cause my mom yells at me to study!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Eheheh! I'm sure Kyoka's gonna love it, right?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahhhhh! B-but how am I gonna give it to her?!  
She'll be all like, \"And what do *you* think you're doing here?\"  
if I go see her right now!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hmm? Why've you got a letter for me?  
Ahh! You didn't write me a love letter, did you?!  
It's way too soon for that!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Umm...? Let's see... \"Exploration Invitation\"...?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Th-this is a letter from Kyoka?!  
Oh, right! You must've come here to deliver it to me, huh?  
  
**Misogi：**  
This'll be my chance to give her the cupcake...  
Thanks, mister! All right! Let's go exploring!  
  
**Narration：**  
With Kyoka's invitation safely in hand,  
Misogi couldn't wait  
to show her friend the fruits of her baking.
