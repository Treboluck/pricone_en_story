Considering it's the holidays, it sure is quiet around here.  
The snow is getting heavier, and the air is much chillier than before.  
At this rate, we'll all turn into ice cubes...  
  
**Christina：**  
It's enough to make you want to move your body to get warm.  
Come, if we are to battle, then we should make haste!  
Boil your blood in the flames of war, and reclaim your warmth... ♪

To say you are hot-blooded would be an understatement.  
Eagerness is a splendid thing, but be sure not to let your guard down.  
Step too far forward, and you might loose your footing—  
Argh!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahahah. ☆ Yet it appears to be you who have lost your footing.  
That being said, getting a foothold in such deep snow is not easy.  
Boy, you should take the most care, because you will fall the hardest... ♪  
  
**Illya：**  
Nngh... You have my gratitude for helping me to my feet, loyal minion.  
As you are already holding my hand,  
you can continue to as we walk.  
That way, we can effectively prevent any slipping.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...I, um... I also feel like I'm might slip...  
Er, I mean, nothing! Don't worry about it!
