**Christina：**  
Come, reindeer, show us what you have in store for us next.  
My preparations are complete... ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Producer, please be careful!  
It looks a heck of a lot angrier than before!  
  
**Illya：**  
Anger can become the very source of one's strength.  
And apparently, it cannot stomach any more of us...  
However, I, for one, cannot be defeated!  
  
**Christina：**  
Be it anger or be it hatred, I care not.  
And neither should you. Now is the time to use your power!
