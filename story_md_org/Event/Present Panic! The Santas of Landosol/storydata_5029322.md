**Christina：**  
Despite being imitations, they were rather violent creatures.  
The fact that those reindeer see us like that  
makes my heart hurt somewhat.  
  
**Illya：**  
Hoohh! Christina is showing reflective behavior!  
*Christina* is contemplating the things she has done!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Thank goodness...  
Even Producer  
is starting to understand how the reindeer feel.  
  
**Christina：**  
...Am I a monster?  
  
**Christina：**  
Regardless, it seems as though they still have some fight left in them.  
I shall have them heal my aching heart.  
  
**Illya：**  
I seriously doubt that will soothe your pain.  
That oversized reindeer is brimming with even more power.  
To the point that I care not to receive a single one of its blows.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
No problem! If we all combine our strength,  
there's no attack that can stop us!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Mr. Reindeer,  
there's no way that we'll lose!
