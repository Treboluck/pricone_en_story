# Bursting with Pudding
The first person to be encountered by the trio of Santa Claus candidates is Miyako. Each prepares Miyako's absolute favorite thing—pudding—but in the end, the business district is devastated by the ridiculous amount of pudding that Christina has Santa's reindeer gather for her.
  
## Subtitle: Bursting with Pudding
  
**Narration：**  
Christina, Illya, and Nozomi are candidates to become the next Santa Claus.  
They begin to deliver gifts to the people of Landosol.  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Well then, Santa candidates.  
You can take my trusty reindeer with you on your trial.  
  
**Reindeer：**  
Brooough?  
(*These* are the candidates to be the new Santa?)  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Reindeer!  
  
**Illya：**  
Those red cloaks and hats certainly do evoke an image  
suitable for Santa's entourage.  
  
**Christina：**  
In addition, they are of very strong build.  
I'm sure we'll put them to good use... ♪  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
You're absolutely right.  
I chose this group for being reindeer among reindeer—  
elite reindeer.  
  
**Illya：**  
Not the most creative name...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Reindeer!  
  
**Elite Reindeer：**  
Brooough, broough!  
(Nice to meet you too, Master!)  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Well then, you can get started. I will observe from a distance.  
In the end, I will decide who has brought joy to the most people.  
  
**Santa Claus：**  
Go forth and spread joy, my Santa suitors!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hm-hmm, holidays are here. ♪  
I've been the bestest girl, so Santa will definitely  
bring Miyako lots of presents! ♪  
  
**Miyako：**  
A heap! ♪  
A pile! ♪  
A bucket! ♪  
  
**Illya：**  
Could that perhaps be Miyako over yonder?  
What a perfect opportunity.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I knew it.  
Everyone's looking forward to getting presents from Santa.  
Let's give them what they're waiting for!  
  
**Christina：**  
Good, time for a practice run.  
First we give a gift to that girl.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hey, boy. Considering your flair for making friends,  
I suppose she's an acquaintance of yours, yes?  
Tell me what that girl desires.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Pudding!  
**Choice: (2)**  Pudding!!  
**Choice: (3)**  Pudding!!!

This should be very straightforward. ♪

Yes, I am aware.  
Every day, without fail, I hear of it.  
So much so that it occasionally manifests in my dreams.

**Nozomi：**  
Enough to yell it at us like that?!  
Sh-she must really like pudding, huh...  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Illya：**  
I am all too familiar with Miyako's favorite thing.  
Come with me, {player}!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, Illya's going to get there first...!  
Hey, {player}, won't you come with me?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Go with Illya.  
**Choice: (6)**  Go with Nozomi.  
`Tag 5`  
**Illya：**  
Now then. First of all, we need to acquire pudding.  
  
**Illya：**  
Miyako will surely require more than one or two.  
What would be the optimum number to prepare?  
  
**Illya：**  
Hm? That song from earlier?  
Ah, the one Miyako was singing?  
Er... what was it now...?  
  
**Illya：**  
A heap, a pile, and...  
did she say \"bucket\"...?  
  
**Illya：**  
! I see, a bucketful...!  
A pail filled to the brim with pudding should suffice!  
  
**Illya：**  
As expected from my minion.  
I praise you for your sound advice!  
Here, let me pat your head!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hehe. Being able to pat your head like this  
is rather pleasant.  
  
**Illya：**  
However, I also feel somewhat sad...  
that we need not hold hands  
and embrace as we are accustomed to.  
  
**Illya：**  
! What drivel am I spouting?!  
Hey, forget that right now! It was but a passing fancy!  
  
**Illya：**  
See here, {player}! Why are you the one patting my head?  
I am your master, am I not?!  
You're aware?  
...Then so be it.  
  
**Illya：**  
Come, this is not the time.  
Prepare the pudding pail!  
  
**Miyako：**  
The holidays are here!  
Today Santa will bring pudding to good kids! ♪

Today is not that kind of day, Miyako...  
However, luck is with you. For this year, I am Santa Claus!  
Your wish shall be granted by yours truly!  
  
**Illya：**  
Now, accept your gift!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Eep! A bucket falled from the sky!  
It's...  
pudding!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Wow! Santa really did bring Miyako pudding!

Time to eat it all up! ♪

Mm-hmm. She is feasting quite heartily.  
Pure jubilation, I presume!

Ahhh, all gone.  
  
**Illya：**  
You're already finished?! Did you even take a breath?!  
Regardless, with this I am one step closer...!

Hmmm, but it wasn't enough.

Huh? What do you mean, what am I doing...? I'm going to make pudding.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Sure, it'll take a lot of time and effort,  
but giving away something you bought is just plain meaningless, isn't it?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
A present from Santa  
has to be filled with sincerity!

Ah, we can probably get the ingredients from that grocery store!
