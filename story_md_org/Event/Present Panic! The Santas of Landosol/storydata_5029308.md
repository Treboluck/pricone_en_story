Hmph. It still insists on getting back to its feet?!  
What tenacity... It would definitely defeat us in a battle of wills!  
  
**Christina：**  
I never thought that I would end up having so much fun!  
But while I wish I could indulge in an endless battle,  
it is somewhat troubling to see the holidays come to an end.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Please listen, Mr. Reindeer! You need to calm down!  
...It's no use. I don't think my voice can reach it.  
  
**Illya：**  
Christina, Nozomi! The time has come  
for us Santa Claus candidates to unleash our true power!  
  
We shall bring forth a genuine holiday miracle!  
  
**Christina：**  
A miracle? How romantic of you, Illya Ornstein.  
Be careful what you say—you just might send my  
pure maiden heart into a flutter... ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
P-Producer... Talking about your pure maiden heart while swinging a  
sword around is a little jarring...!  
But yeah, Illya's totally right—today *is*  
the day for miracles.  
So let's finish this using our own power!
