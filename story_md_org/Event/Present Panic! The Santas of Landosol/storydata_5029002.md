# Justice for the Brave
It is decided that the next target of the Santa candidates will be Matsuri. She is given the opportunity to play an active role in her quest to become a hero, but the magic power bestowed upon her by Illya is far too powerful, and leads to the devastation of Nightmare's headquarters.
  
## Subtitle: Justice for the Brave
  
**Narration：**  
It's the holidays, and bells are ringing throughout the town.  
The next stop for the three Santa candidates is  
the headquarters of Nightmare.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Whew! Snow shoveling, complete! ☆  
  
**Matsuri：**  
We don't want anyone slipping in the snow.  
Though I guess I'm the only one careless enough to do that.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Achoo!  
Urgh, I should've dressed a little warmer...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Okay, now a hundred swings!  
You gotta move your body when it's cold!  
For a novice like me to become a hero of justice,  
training is indispensable!  
  
**Christina：**  
I have returned, my old haunt... ♪  
It is I, Christina, beloved by all. Home at last.  
Come—greet me, glorify me, fall before me... ☆  
  
**Illya：**  
Really now! Why the grand entrance through the front door?  
We might only be candidates, but we are still trying to embody Santa!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
That's right, Producer!  
Everyone knows Santa Claus enters through the chimney!  
  
**Illya：**  
Um, that's not exactly what I was getting at...  
  
**Christina：**  
Secretly creeping around like rats is utterly classless.  
...But  
perhaps we could conform to the beauty of form.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Thirty-one! Thirty-two! Thirty-three!  
Achoo!  
...Whoops... How many was that...?  
Okay, back to zero!  
  
**Christina：**  
My, that adorable, fumbling figure over there.  
Is it Matsuri, perchance...? ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
I see she still loves flitting about.  
I don't have a taste for sentimentality... but when I see her like that,  
I really want to dote on her. ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
That kid's amazing. Even though it's the holidays, she's shoveling snow,  
keeping up with her training... She seems like a really hard worker!  
That kind of kid deserves a great present!  
  
**Illya：**  
Then our next target...  
I mean,  
the recipient of our next gifts  
is her!  
  
**Illya：**  
Now, {player}, tell me what that girl desires!  
Surely there is no need to inquire with her, as you must already know.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Tora Tiger.  
**Choice: (2)**  Magical Girl Bella-Lou.  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
Tora... Tiger?  
Don't those two words mean the same thing?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ah! I've heard of him!  
He's the hero of justice in those stage shows, right?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
Bella-Lou...? Whatever is that?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
\"As long as you have love in your heart,  
my bell will bring you good fortune!\"  
  
**Nozomi：**  
\"Hi there, everybody!  
It's me, Magical Girl Bella-Lou! ☆\"  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Right?  
I've seen it before too.  
...I couldn't help but imitate her. That was a little embarrassing...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Christina：**  
Hmph, I've already won.  
I know exactly what Matsuri wants.  
I can read her mind... ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
Say, boy, could you assist me?  
If you refuse, I don't mind taking just your arm with me... ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You can't do that, Producer!  
{player}, come here. You can help me!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Lend Christina a hand.  
**Choice: (5)**  Help Nozomi.  
`Tag 4`  
**Christina：**  
Heheh. Many thanks, boy.  
Come, let us bestow holiday blessings upon Matsuri...☆  
  
**Christina：**  
Matsuri was always declaring she wanted to become  
a hero of justice...  
How awfully charming!  
Even though there's no such thing as absolute justice... ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
However, the benevolent St. Christina  
shall grant her that wish... ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
Hm? How, you ask?  
Why, it's a marvelously simple task.  
  
**Christina：**  
Justice requires evil!  
In order to birth an ally of justice,  
is it not befitting that we call upon a servant of evil...? ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
I considered standing in her way as evil,  
but earlier I declared I would conform to the beauty of form...  
Therefore, is it not right to subjugate?! Reindeer!  
  
**Elite Reindeer 1：**  
Broough?!  
(What now?!)  
  
**Christina：**  
Hm? Why are you so taken aback?  
I merely commanded you to storm over there and rampage... ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh, just don't cause any injuries.  
Promise Christina Claus that... ☆  
  
**Elite Reindeer 1：**  
Br—brooooough!  
(Ch-chaaaaarge!)  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hm? What's that noise...? Screaming?  
Whoa, there's something charging this way!  
  
**Elite Reindeer 1：**  
Brooooough!  
(It's nothing personal!)  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Reindeer?! Reindeer can scream?!  
Uwahhh! It's a rabid reindeer rush!  
  
**Christina：**  
Good, good. What a lovely cry.  
Hmm? Which one?  
Both, of course.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wait, this reindeer is crazy strong!  
And I only have my training sword with me!  
Uwahhh! Those antlers look mean!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hm. She's being juggled by those antlers.  
That will not do, Matsuri.  
At this rate, you will never become a hero of justice... ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
But I suppose I did miscalculate the strength of those reindeer.  
Hey, boy. It's a bit unfair, but could you lend Matsuri your strength?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hm... Huh? Suddenly I'm brimming with power!  
Even though {player} isn't here...  
Could it be? Is the power of justice finally awakening within me?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I can do this!  
  
**Elite Reindeer 1：**  
Brooough!  
(She's so strong all of a sudden!)  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I did it!  
I chased the reindeer away!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I defended the royal palace all on my own!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmmm. What a satisfied expression.  
This is what being Santa is all about... ♪  
  
**Elite Reindeer 1：**  
Brooough...  
(I get the feeling this isn't a reindeer's job...)  
  
**Christina：**  
Good work to you, too. You make a great agent of evil. ☆

`Tag 5`  
**Nozomi：**  
All right! Let's do our best!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
So she dreams of becoming a hero of justice, right?  
I wonder what would make a great gift...  
Any ideas, {player}?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? Something that only I can do?  
...In other words...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
All right, I've got it... Let's give it a shot!  
Mr. Reindeer, could you please help me out?  
  
**Elite Reindeer 3：**  
Brooogh...?  
(Help you out...?)  
  
**Matsuri：**  
It sure is peaceful.  
Since it's the holidays, everyone's probably at home relaxing.  
It's got me feeling a bit lonely...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wait, I can't think like that!  
A hero of justice doesn't take a day off!  
I need to get a hold of myself in case something goes down—  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Eeeeeek! Somebody save me!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
What was that scream just now?!  
  
**Elite Reindeer 3：**  
B-brooooogh!  
(Ummm, prepare yourself!)  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Th-this is bad!  
A woman dressed like Santa is being assaulted!  
What's more, is that... a reindeer?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wh-whatever, I have to save her!  
Hey you, are you okay?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh... thank you!  
Hero of justice, Tora Tiger!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? Huh?!  
*I'm*... Tora Tiger?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
That's right! You gallantly came to my rescue when I was in distress.  
There's no doubt about it! You're the hero of justice, Tora Tiger!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
! I know this exact situation...!  
There's a cry for help and a dashing entry,  
followed by these words:  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Feast your eyes!  
It's the fearless superhero of the forest,  
Tora Tiger... ☆  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Yaaay! It's Tora Tiger!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Er... I have a few questions,  
but this feels amazing!  
  
**Elite Reindeer 3：**  
Broogh, broooooogh!  
(Bring it on, Tora Tiger!)  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hmph! Cease this at once, evildoer!  
The great Tora Tiger will end you!  
Tiger Slash!  
  
**Elite Reindeer 3：**  
Broough.  
(Weak.)  
  
**Matsuri：**  
M-my sword snapped on its antler?!  
This reindeer is ridiculously strong!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Mr. Reindeer! Pretend! Pretend!  
  
**Elite Reindeer 3：**  
B-broogh...!  
  
(Oh, right...!)  
  
**Matsuri：**  
D-did it suddenly start to feel it?!  
Don't tell me, that last attack worked?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
It's running away...!  
I won... I won!  
Justice reigns supreme!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Thank you, Tora Tiger!  
You're a true hero!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ahhhh... Aw shucks, you're gonna make me cry...!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Illya：**  
Hmph. I'm falling behind...  
But I have a plan!  
  
**Illya：**  
Simply put, that girl desires power.  
Now that I am in my original form, it is but child's play!  
  
**Illya：**  
Come, bid me to bestow upon you my magic!  
Be joyous and excited to receive such a gift from Santa!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh...?  
I feel like I'm brimming with power...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
It feels different from {player}'s...  
I mean, it's like I'm surrounded by an aura.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Let's see what happens if I try this now...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Tiger flash! ☆  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
H-hey, Illya!  
What was that just now?  
  
**Christina：**  
What incredible power.  
  
It's a good thing she wasn't aiming at anything in particular.  
If she's not careful, she could cause a disaster.  
  
**Illya：**  
Heh.  
  
**Illya：**  
...I overdid it. ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
This isn't a laughing matter!  
  
**Illya：**  
You see, since I'm back in my original form, things feel quite different.  
Well, the power I bestowed upon her is only temporary.  
  
**Illya：**  
Assuming she doesn't release all her power at once, there is no problem.  
That is, as long as she doesn't inadvertently strain herse—  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ngh... I'm gonna sneeze... A—...  
A—...  
  
**All：**  
Uh-oh.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
ACHOOOO!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus, the devastating holiday incident  
came to be known for generations as  
the nightmare that befell Nightmare.  
  
**Elite Reindeer 3：**  
Broooggghh.  
(What the—?!)  
  
**Elite Reindeer 2：**  
B-broooogh.  
(Things just keeps getting worse!)  
  
**Elite Reindeer 1：**  
Broooogh.  
(My magnificent fur is singed...)
