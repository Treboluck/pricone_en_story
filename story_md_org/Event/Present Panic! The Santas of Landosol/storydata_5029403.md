## Subtitle: A Happy Holy Night for All
  
**Nozomi：**  
It looks like the reindeer are still willing to put up a fight.  
We've gotta do something...  
If they stay this angry, there's no way they'll enjoy the holidays!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
We've gotta do everything in our power  
so that we can all enjoy this special time together!
