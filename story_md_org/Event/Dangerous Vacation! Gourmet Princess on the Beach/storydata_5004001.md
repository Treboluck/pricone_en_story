# A Midsummer Day's Disappearance
Noticing something off about Pecorine, Karyl brings up the issue with Kokkoro and {player}. She mentions Pecorine not wearing her Royal Equipment and seemingly having nightmares in particular, but by the time she's done talking, the others are nowhere to be seen.
  
## Subtitle: A Midsummer Day's Disappearance
  
**Narration：**  
Set on making the most of their vacation,  
the Gourmet Guild members spend the entire first day playing at the beach.  
  
**Narration：**  
Exhausted after the fact,  
they make their way back to their cabin to relax.  
  
**Narration：**  
Four days and three nights.  
Their vacation was guaranteed to be full of entertainment.  
Or so they thought, until the events that unfolded the next day...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahh, man...  
My whole body's killing me.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Guess we went a little bit *too* wild yesterday.  
Sure was a bunch of fun, but going all out for that long when  
we weren't used to it wasn't smart.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Even worse, I got barely any sleep thanks to Pecorine,  
so I'm still pooped. How am I gonna last the entire  
vacation when I'm already like this on day two?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Urgh... Maybe I should just use some stamina recovery magic.  
Then again, I used a bunch of magic yesterday as it is.  
My reserves are pretty much all dry.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Talk about exhausting myself in  
more ways than one from the very first day.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But well. I don't really mind it that much.  
There's something nice about just having fun with  
people you get along with, no strings attached.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I actually feel like, super happy right now.  
Ehehe. ♪

**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl!  
A very good morning to you. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Good morning to you, too.  
Man, you two sure must be full of energy  
if you're already going at it this early in the morning.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed. Sleep was our best friend last night,  
so needless to say, we're more than well rested.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As for today...  
Just the thought of being able to have so much fun  
all over again left me feeling restless and excited.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A stroll along the beach seemed like the perfect morning exercise,  
but it proved to be so fun that, well... We couldn't help  
but end up playing with this beach ball we brought along.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And thus we've been having a good time since.  
Would you care to join us?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm beat, so I'll have to pass.  
I'm not exactly good with mornings in the first place.  
Going wild with you two might make me pass out.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
You really are quite the frail one.  
Regular exercise would do you well.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Nah, I'm good. It's a mage's destiny to be frail.  
Man, though. I can tell you two got some great sleep.  
That slick, glossy skin is a dead giveaway.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Good stuff. Not gonna lie, I was a bit worried  
when we settled on me and Pecorine in one room, and  
you and {player} in the other.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I get that the two of you are pretty much family and all,  
but well... A guy and a gal sleeping the same room?  
You never know what can go down in a scenario like that.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hm.  
And what do you propose would have \"gone down,\" exactly?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Regardless. You yourself seem awfully exhausted,  
judging by the dark circles under your eyes.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh. Good eye.  
You're right, too.  
Pecorine was tossing and turning all night.  
Every time I actually drifted off, she just woke me up again. Sheesh.  
  
**Karyl：**  
What's worse, she kept talking to me after that as well.  
And then she tried to sneak into my bed, like some kid that'd  
just had a nightmare. I spent all night kicking her off.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahaha...  
Letting her sleep beside you may have been the smarter choice.  
  
**Karyl：**  
No way.  
Last thing I need is her choking me  
to death in her sleep with that gorilla strength.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Actually, wait. That strength comes from her Royal Equipment,  
now that I think about it...  
And she was in regular pajamas  
last night. Maybe it wouldn't have been much of an issue after all?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Not that I could've thought that far ahead, considering how tired I was.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah yes, Miss Pecorine's Royal Equipment.  
One would assume it consists of just her armor,  
but the tiara she always wears is part of it as well.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Her abnormal strength is entirely due to that ensemble,  
but she spent all of yesterday in her swimsuit.  
Perhaps that left her feeling weaker then usual?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It's rare for her not be wearing her Royal Equipment, after all.  
And upon further reflection, she seemed quite... slow yesterday.  
Not to mention she would tire out easily.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
She seemed fine otherwise, though, so I didn't pay it much heed.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That's a good point, actually.  
That equipment's pretty much her lifeline,  
but she seems intent on going the whole trip without wearing it.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I get that it's a holiday, but she's gotta be more careful.  
It'd be pretty disastrous if anyone tried to  
take this as an opportunity to get rid of her for good.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
I don't foresee a sudden development  
like that happening anytime soon.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wahhh...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-what's up with you?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Err...  
Did you sense anything... odd from the ocean just now?  
Or perhaps I'm just imagining things...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It seems as calm and still as it did yesterday, upon first glance.  
And the Marjan Coast—these shallow areas in particular—  
are known to be quite safe. Monsters rarely appear here.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm...  
I can use a quick spell to search around, if you want.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
No, it's fine.  
You must be tired after how much magic you used yesterday.  
So please, focus on letting yourself recover for today.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Thanks.  
The only way to replenish your reserves is through  
sleep or eating, though. So I guess I should have some breakfast first.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Also.  
Could you do me a favor and go wake Pecorine up?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm gonna take a walk to clear my head,  
then go find somewhere to eat.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Seems like the beachside cafe's not open yet, either,  
so I might have to head back to town first.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahh, man. Wish I'd brought my own stuff to cook with.  
Figured the \"luxurious\" part would include food as well,  
but nope. Guess that much was too hard.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I was wondering why it was so quiet all of a sudden...  
Koro? {player}?  
Where'd you go?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Uhhh... Wh-what's the deal here?  
How'd they both disappear so quickly?
