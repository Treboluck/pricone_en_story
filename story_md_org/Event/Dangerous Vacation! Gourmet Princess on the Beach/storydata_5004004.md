**Karyl：**  
W-we gotta go save her, quick!  
Resuscitation's an option if she isn't a goner already!  
Lemme use some magic to find out where she is!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh. We might be able to narrow her location down a bit first.  
  
**Suzume：**  
According to {player},  
the monster was bringing them to the ocean floor.  
What's more, there seemed to be some ruins there.  
  
**Suzume：**  
If I were to wager a guess,  
I'd say that's where Kokkoro is being held.  
  
**Suzume：**  
There's no guarantee of that, of course.  
So we'll need magic to determine her exact location.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm hardly a pro at magic, but I can help a little.  
Besides, Kokkoro isn't just a guest anymore.  
She's part of the Sarendia Orphanage family now.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I want to save her, no matter what.  
Someone as caring and gentle as her  
should never have to suffer.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Needless to say, we agree.  
Let's work together to save her.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You bet your butt!  
So much for a relaxing vacation, though.  
Should have figured it'd turn out this way,  
'cause it always does!  
  
**Karyl：**  
But well, no point in complaining! Let's just save Koro,  
slay that monster, and wrap this whole case up!  
Then we can look back on today and laugh about it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yup!  
{player}, do you mind  
powering us up?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I might not be as useful when I don't  
have my Royal Equipment, but still.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
My body still remembers how to fight.  
I can wipe out any small fry we  
run into if you power me up.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Got it!  
`Tag 1`  
**Karyl：**  
That's the spirit!  
Suzume, right? I'll leave  
locating Koro to you and your magic! Meanwhile,  
I'll cast a spell that lets everyone move normally underwater!  
  
**Karyl：**  
We'll definitely need that if we're heading to the ocean floor.  
But it won't last forever,  
so we gotta wrap this up nice and quick!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Right! And just to be safe, I'll bring oxygen tanks  
from the cafe and compress them with storage magic!  
That'll make them easier to carry when we're underwater!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, nice. Didn't think you could use storage magic.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohh. That's what you used on our first day here, isn't it?  
Took me by surprise when you started making  
a bunch of stuff appear out of nowhere.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That's pretty advanced magic, you know.  
Which means you're a lot more skilled than you  
make yourself out to be, huh?  
  
**Suzume：**  
No no, not at all. Advanced magic isn't my forte,  
but storage magic is really helpful for chores,  
so I put a lot of effort into learning it! That's just what maids do!  
  
**Suzume：**  
That's my number one priority, after all.  
Not to be a skilled mage, but to serve milady!  
  
**Saren：**  
Suzume!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Eeek?! Oh! Milady!  
Speak of the devil!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wh-what made you come all the way here?  
Oh no. Don't tell me I forgot something.  
Is that it?  
  
**Saren：**  
No, no!  
Today's newspaper mentioned that there's been trouble  
here lately, so I panicked and came chasing after you!  
  
**Saren：**  
I'd rather not expose Kurumi and Ayane to any danger, though,  
so I made sure they didn't follow suit.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Excellent call, milady!  
We're right in the middle of a perilous situation, in fact!  
  
**Suzume：**  
A lot has happened, to say the least.  
Now we plan on making our way to some underwater ruins  
to rescue Kokkoro. How about yourself, milady?  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm... I'd love to join you all, but it might be smarter to  
prepare for the worst. I've got good connections through  
Nightmare, so I'll get in touch with the proper authorities.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'll get them to deploy backup and ensure no one comes  
near the beach. Otherwise we'll run the risk of more people  
getting caught up in all of this.  
  
**Saren：**  
I can chase after you guys once that's all sorted out.  
If all goes well, it won't take too long.  
Also, get in touch with communication magic if anything happens.  
  
**Saren：**  
Right then!  
There's no time to waste here!  
Let's get this wrapped up swiftly!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Thank you, milady!  
You really are so reliable at times like this. ♪  
  
**Saren：**  
Ahaha...  
I'm just doing what I can, to be honest.  
I'd hate for you to think that being by my side isn't worth it.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Okay, that's enough chitchat!  
We need to move fast here, so let's focus on preparing!  
  
**Karyl：**  
First step is to wrap us all in individual air bubbles.  
Then I'll use wind magic to propel us through the water!  
  
**Karyl：**  
That'll get us to the ruins in no time!  
Chances are we'll be engaging in battle right off the bat,  
so make sure you're ready for it!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't worry, Koro! We'll be there soon!  
So please be safe until then...!
