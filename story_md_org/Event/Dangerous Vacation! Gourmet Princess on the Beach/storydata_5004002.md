## Subtitle: And That's When She Saw It!
  
**Narration：**  
Suzume is working part-time at a beachside cafe  
as a means to support the Sarendia Orphanage.  
  
**Narration：**  
Though not used to the labor at first, she finds herself  
enjoying it more and more. And thus she makes her  
way to work today with a spring in her step.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Now then. Time for me to go to work! ♪  
  
**Saren：**  
Okay. Have a safe trip...?  
  
**Ayane：**  
See you later!  
Don't worry about things here.  
We'll get all the housework done while you're away!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Good luck at work! ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ehehe.  
Let's go see her off, Kurumi. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Yeah...! ♪  
  
**Saren：**  
Now, now.  
It's bad manners to leave your seat in the middle of a meal.  
  
**Suzume：**  
She's right! Finish off your breakfast first.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Besides, there's no need to make a big deal out of this.  
We'll be seeing each other again later today.  
All right, then. Now I'm really off. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Okay!  
See you later! ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ehehe. She sure was in a good mood.  
Working at the beachside cafe must be a bunch of fun.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Well, Big Sis Suzume really loves working...  
Also, it's been really humid lately.  
It must be nice and cool when you're working by the beach...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Aww. That's no fair. We should go too!  
We even bought our own swimsuits  
along with Kokkoro and everyone else!  
  
**Saren：**  
You kids won't be going to the beach on your own, I'm afraid.  
If you want to go, then wait for when I've got a day off.  
There'll be big trouble if you try and sneak out, understood?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Okay...  
You're *always* working though, Mama Saren.  
I don't think you've ever had a day off...  
  
**Ayane：**  
She's right!  
We'll be sitting here forever if we just wait.  
You need to make some time yourself!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
We can even help out with your work, if you're okay with that...  
The sooner we go, the better.  
I'd like to go see Suzume while she's working. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Me too, me too!  
She's the biggest klutz in Landosol,  
so I wanna see if she's working properly! ♪  
  
**Saren：**  
Nope. You little rascals will just make it harder to get things done.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Aww. All you ever say is no!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Umm...  
Are you okay, Mama Saren?  
You look a bit down...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I guess you're not used to Suzume being away...?  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm... Yeah. You're probably right. It's got me a bit down,  
especially when she looks like she's having fun.  
Can't help but think about the reason behind that.  
  
**Saren：**  
She's the one that asked if she could work in the first place, after all.  
Makes me wonder if maybe she  
felt dissatisfied working as my maid.  
  
**Saren：**  
No doubt she had all sorts of things she wanted to do herself.  
But here I am, taking up all her time.  
During an important stage of her life, to boot.  
  
**Ayane：**  
*That's* what you've been worried about?  
You're so silly. Has Suzume ever once said anything like that?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Yeah...  
Please don't worry.  
Big Sis Suzume loves you to bits. ♪  
  
**Saren：**  
I mean, that much I can accept.  
Arghhh... I should be taking this much better than I am.  
  
**Saren：**  
I might just be the biggest child here.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm...?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Is something wrong?  
  
**Saren：**  
I just had a look at this morning's newspaper, and, uh...  
This isn't good.  
  
**Saren：**  
Look here.  
\"Trouble on the Marjan Coast! A strange monster has been sighted!\"  
That's where Suzume's working, isn't it?  
  
**Saren：**  
This is terrible! I need to bring her back!  
She can't have gone too far, right?  
  
**Saren：**  
Come back, Suzume!  
The beach is far too dangerous...!  
  
**Suzume：**  
And here we are!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hehe. Hitching a ride on that carriage was rather lucky.  
Getting here took barely any time at all.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Now I just need to change into my swimsuit.  
The manager... doesn't seem to be here yet. But I have a key,  
so it's fine. Maybe I'll do some cleaning before we open up shop.  
  
**Suzume：**  
That said. It might just be because it's early,  
but there's really no one around today, either...  
I might end up spending the day whiling away the hours.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Yesterday was no better, either.  
The only people that came along were the Gourmet Guild...  
Which is odd, considering we're in the middle of beach season.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Not that it bothers me too much.  
The less people that see me in my swimsuit, the better...  
  
**Suzume：**  
I can't say I'm a fan of getting paid to do nothing either, though.  
  
**Suzume：**  
So... I'll try my best to bring in customers today.  
If it comes to it, I can make my way to town  
during the afternoon to do some adver—  
Hm?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ummm.  
There's... definitely something moving by the shore.  
  
**Suzume：**  
B-but what is it? A monster?  
Wait. Isn't that...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Is that you, {player}?  
I hope I'm not wrong...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Confirm her suspicions.  
**Choice: (2)**  Pretend to be a monster.  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzume：**  
Oh! I knew it!  
You're all soaked and covered in seaweed,  
so I thought you were some sort of weird life-form at first!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzume：**  
Eeek?! P-please don't do that!  
You scared the life out of me!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I-I recognize that voice, though...  
It really is you, isn't it, {player}?  
What are you doing here? You're soaked to the bone...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Suzume：**  
Err... Are you okay?  
I assume you're not lying there for fun.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Gosh. You really are drenched.  
Thankfully I have a towel, so let me dry you off.  
Wipe, wipe. ♪  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wait. You're all covered in cuts!  
L-let me heal you up.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Take this!  
And please get better...! ☆  
  
**Suzume：**  
D-did it work?  
Are you still sore anywhere?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Thanks.  
`Tag 4`  
**Suzume：**  
Not at all, not at all.  
More importantly, do you mind explaining what happened?  
I'm more than willing to help out!
