**Pecorine：**  
La la laaaa! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Phew. Now *that* was a big meal! And what a variety!  
My belly's all full and satisfied. La la la! ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A delectable meal it was, indeed.  
That said, \"big\" might not justify just how much we ate today...  
Urkkk... My stomach is on the brink of bursting.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Absolutely same. I strictly remember  
some idiot going,  
\"Let's join in on the eating contest!\"  
And that idiot's name? Pecorine.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Why do you always feel the need to  
get us involved in your nonsense?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I just couldn't help it!  
It's so rare for eating contests to involve guilds as a whole!  
And even rarer for us to do things together as a proper guild!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We're supposed to work together and overcome hardships!  
What's the word I'm looking for here...  
Solidarity? Camaraderie?  
I wanted a nice taste of that!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Argh, whatever. You do you.  
I'm gonna put on some serious weight at this rate, though.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's almost time for beach season, too.  
You expecting me to walk around the Marjan Coast looking all flabby?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No worries! A chubby Karyl is still a cute Karyl!  
If anything, you should put some more weight on!  
All that delicious fat... *drool* ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't you dare give me that starved look!  
I know for a fact you're ready to take a bite out of me!  
  
**Karin：**  
Well, if it isn't the Gourmet Guild!  
Good evening! Always nice to see  
the four of you getting along. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh!  
Hello, Karin!  
What're you doing here?  
  
**Karin：**  
Hehe. Just a little bit of work. I'm not sure why, but the  
government has been a bit understaffed lately.  
People are being  
sent out to help other departments and the like, so here I am. ♪  
  
**Karin：**  
That aside. How about trying your hand at a lottery?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A lottery?  
  
**Karin：**  
Indeed. The business district is currently running a promotion  
where shopping or eating out earns you points on a stamp card.  
You can spin this wheel once per each completed card.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhh... I was wondering why all the stores were doing that.  
Hmm.  
I *should* have a few...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Here we go!  
These should let us participate, right?  
  
**Karin：**  
Yep, those are the ones!  
One, two, three...  
You've got four completed cards, so that's four spins.  
  
**Karin：**  
Feel free to give it a shot.  
Assuming you're not busy, of course. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohh! Should we go for it, then?  
I know what I'm aiming for, at the very least.  
The premium fruit bundle in tier three. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm... These prizes are all pretty lame, if you ask me.  
Not like we've got anything to lose though,  
so I don't see why not.  
  
**Karin：**  
Oh... You work for the government too, if I recall.  
Then you should be aware of our circumstances.  
  
**Karin：**  
Budget increases for the military have left  
regular public services struggling quite a bit.  
We're really scrounging for funds at this point.  
  
**Karin：**  
It's our job to keep the people and the economy  
stimulated, though. So we've been coming up with all sorts of ideas.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wow, that's amazing! Talk about a model worker!  
Me and you could learn a thing or two from her, Karyl!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Speak for yourself, girl.  
I've been working my butt off over here.  
You're the one that just eats and sleeps for a living!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I-I do part-time jobs sometimes!  
It's not like I don't want to work!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, I guess she doesn't really need to work in the first place.  
She's a princess, not some random bum.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Anyway.  
It's pretty late already, so let's spin this and head home.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Four cards equals four spins.  
That means all of us can take a turn doing it.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'll go first.  
Spin, spin...  
A white ball? Dunno what that means.  
  
**Karin：**  
Aw, tough luck!  
White's no good, I'm afraid.  
You can have this piece of candy as a consolation prize, though.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, nice! Food!  
Looks like you hit the jackpot, Karyl. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
She literally just called it a consolation prize, you know.  
Okay. Koro and {player} are up next.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're going last, Pecorine.  
Just in case you break the thing with that gorilla strength of yours.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
O-oh, Karyl! Your words wound me so!  
Can't you see how much I love you?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Argh! How many times do I gotta tell you  
to quit being so touchy-feely?! It's so irritating!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
Very well. I'll go first.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ehmmm...  
What should I do, exactly?  
Do I use the lever to spin it?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh. Will you show me how to do it, my lord?  
Thank you very much. Allow me to offer up  
a prayer for good luck in exchange.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Go, go, my lord. May your roll bring a great bounty. ♪  
  
**Karin：**  
Ahaha...  
Too bad. That one was a miss, too.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Inconceivable. Now it falls to me to avenge my lord.  
Spin, spin... ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hm... We meet again, white ball.  
This is no good, correct?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Man. Three in a row?  
Lemme see what's inside that thing, lady.  
Just to be sure, you know?  
And you can bet you're in for a surprise if those balls are all white.  
  
**Karin：**  
Wait! Hold on!  
Please don't touch anything other than the lever!  
Th-this is all fair, I promise!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heh! I've got it!  
Give me a big old power-up, {player}.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
See, I know your ability boosts our strength and endurance.  
But I get the feeling it does more, too!  
If it can affect my luck, then that fruit bundle's all ours!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh.  
I don't think you can really power up something as fickle as luck.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh well. Guess it's worth a shot.  
I don't wanna walk away without  
winning *something* after this!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Woo!  
Now *this* is what I'm talking about!  
A full-on power-up, ready and waiting to be made use of!  
Thanks, {player}! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And now, with the power of these mighty fingers!  
Spin, spin... ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hm...?  
This ball looks very... gold.  
  
**Karin：**  
W-wow!  
Congratulations! You hit the jackpot!  
  
**Karin：**  
Which means... Ta-da! An invitation to our  
Tantalizing Tropical Tour! Four days and three nights at a  
luxurious resort! Even better, it's good for up to four people!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, baby! Great work, Pecorine!  
Actually, I guess it's thanks to  
{player} powering you up? Either way!  
I'm absolutely all in for a luxurious resort tour!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hold up.  
What's with that look?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ummm, Karin...  
Is it possible to exchange this for the fruit bundle?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Say WHAT?! I'm gonna kill you thrice, you reprobate!  
Who in their right mind would pick fruit over tropical islands?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Man, this is like a dream come true!  
Now I can get away from this stupidly hot place  
and enjoy a nice vacation!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh...  
Y-you *are* gonna invite us, right?  
Especially when it's good for four people...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Of course I am!  
Ehehe. The Gourmet Guild always rides together! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And hey, we can probably pick our own fruit while we're there!  
I should bring a fishing rod, too.  
It'd be a waste to  
not fish up something delicious at the beach... ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
You might wanna think about taking an interest in  
something that isn't food for once in your life...
