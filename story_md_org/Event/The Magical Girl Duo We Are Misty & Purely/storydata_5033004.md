# The Third Magical Girl (?)
Kasumi and Shiori are struggling against the Antibeasts, which are getting stronger by the day, when Nanaka suddenly bursts onto the scene. Through completing her nonsensical (?) training, the duo learn new magic techniques, and as a result, grow to the next magical girl level.
  
## Subtitle: The Third Magical Girl (?)
  
**Narration：**  
Landosol—the new home of the magical girl.  
Where its light does not shine, there lies a deep darkness.  
  
**???：**  
...Beaten again.  
  
**???：**  
Even with all this love,  
I guess things won't always work out as I hope.  
  
**???：**  
But I won't give up.  
First, I have to eliminate the obstacles.  
  
**???：**  
...Those magical girls.  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Man：**  
Hey, look!  
It's the magical girls!  
The monster went thataway!  
  
**Woman：**  
Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi!  
Magical Huntress Purely★Shiori!  
Give that monster what for!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
We will!  
...Thank you for your support...!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Th-thanks...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Kasumi, look.  
The townsfolk are waving at us.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
I-I've mostly gotten used to this appearance, but still...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're both celebrities now.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mora：**  
You're right, Sir Knight!  
They're this far from becoming bona fide magical girls!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
This close?  
Does that mean there's still something we're lacking?  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Can't you just deem us qualified already?  
...You know, I've been wondering for a while now—  
Mora, you're not just making this up as you go along, are you?  
  
**Mora：**  
What an awful thing to say!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Then please tell us, o troublesome little rabbit—  
what is it that we're missing?  
  
**Mora：**  
It's, um, yeah.  
You're still not in the magical girl frame of mind, you see...  
  
**Mora：**  
Er... Ah!  
I can sense the Antibeast!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
He ran for it.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Flew right out of here.  
...  
Oh, I see it!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Indeed.  
Let's dispose of it quickly.  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Here it comes.  
Eeek!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Shiori!  
This Antibeast is faster than the others...!  
Ngh. Misty Bullet!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Wha—?! It dodged it?!  
Wahhh!  
  
**Mora：**  
Listen up!  
This Antibeast is different to the ones you've fought so far!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
We noticed...!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Its speed is on another level.  
Why so sudden...?  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Ahhh!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Wahhh!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Step forward.  
`Tag 2`  
**Mora：**  
Sir Knight!  
Even though only magical girls can fight it... What bravery!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
But it's too dangerous for him...!  
We have to do something!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
We need to concentrate our firepower...  
But its movements are too fast!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
My dear assistant!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
No...!  
  
**???：**  
Nanaka Infinite Blast!  
  
**Mora：**  
Wh-what the heck?!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Magic?!  
No, it's more than that!  
The Antibeast flinched!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
This is our chance! Shiori, concentrate your firepower!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Right!  
Purely Arrow!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Eat this! Misty Bullet!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Mora：**  
...Somehow you did it.  
But that magic just now—whose was it...?  
  
**???：**  
You're doing it wrooooooooooooooooooong!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Ah!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Eh!  
  
**Mora：**  
Wh-who are you?!  
  
**???：**  
I don't need to tell you my name!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Thanks for saving us, Nanaka.  
`Tag 3`  
**Nanaka：**  
Oh, you're welcome.  
I mean...!  
{player}, what's with the spoiler?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Well, if I've been exposed, so be it!  
I'm just a totally OP magical girl—or rather,  
a magical girl who  
dreams of being a passing savior—Nanaka! ♪  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
That flashy outfit, the unusual behavior... Could she be the rumored  
Collector?  
  
...I surmise the magical girl title is self-proclaimed, however.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
But casting powerful exploding magic all over the place with such  
reckless abandon...  
Urgh, how dreadful... I'd rather not get involved with such a person...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
You ladies are the magical girls that everyone's talking about, right?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Uhhh... Yes.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Heh. When I first heard the rumors,  
I thought that my time as a famous  
magical girl had finally come—  
I even started practicing my autograph.  
I was totally stoked.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I never thought that I would be disregarded,  
and others who call themselves magical girls would show up...  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Apologies for the imposition.  
And thanks for your assistance.  
Well, we're in a hurry, so...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Oh no, you're not getting away that easily!  
Magical girls tried to escape! But it failed!  
  
**Mora：**  
You're quite the strange one, aren't you...?  
Do you need us for something?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
That fight just now—I saw the whole thing.  
Turns out you're missing something vitally important as magical girls.  
  
**All：**  
?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
\"And  
wh-what is thaaaat?!\"  
is what I was hoping to hear. Well, let me tell you!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
What you don't have...  
is a special mooooove!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
All right! The great Nanaka's special magical girl training is about to  
begin!  
From now on you can call me the Undefeated—...I mean, Master!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...Why did we come here again...?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...We were pressured into it, so we had to...  
  
**Mora：**  
But I think what Nanaka's saying is right, you know!  
The Antibeasts are getting stronger, and if you keep fighting them  
using the same magic, at this rate you'll reach your limit pretty soon.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Well, you have a point...  
 maybe?  
But then why in the world were we brought indoors?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Right. If we're going to do special move training,  
it's too dangerous not to be outdoors...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ohohoh. The reason that you're all here is...  
to see all the cool loot I've collected!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Wh-what's wrong with you?!  
`Tag 4`  
**Nanaka：**  
Ohoh.  
I love how easily shocked you are!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
My dear assistant, how do you keep up with her...? I'm already exhausted.  
However... we'll get to see all the things the Collector has accumulated.  
Whether it's special training or not, my interest is piqued.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Yes... The place is full of books I've never seen before...  
In fact, I think some of these shouldn't be here...?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ohhh, you sure know your stuff.  
But today, none of that matters!  
What you need to see is here!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
This is...!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Magical girl... books, costumes, merchandise...?  
Oh, this staff belonged to Bella-Lou...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I also highly recommend my favorite book, Magical Girl Celly!  
Please, read it until there are holes in it!  
Oh, but don't actually  
put holes in it.  
  
**Mora：**  
Um, Nanaka?  
What does this have to do with special moves...?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
It certainly seems unrelated.  
...But just a little...  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Aaand we've lost her...!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
There's nothing but stuff here I've never seen before...  
  
Like that doll—it's so cute...  
I-I want to hold it...!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
...Go ahead. Pick it up.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
? W-  
well, if you say so...!  
  
**Mora：**  
Eek! Kasumi's gone now too!  
Sir Knight, what should we do?!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  This is interesting.  
**Choice: (6)**  Admire the figurines.  
`Tag 5`  
**Mora：**  
You're already distracted?!  
Urgh, I hope this is really okay...  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Mora：**  
He looks so serious...!  
Maybe now's not the time to talk to him...!  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Master, I can't seem to find the next volume...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I think it's lost in that pile there—  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Master, Magical Girl Celly's signature pose is like this, correct?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ahhh, no, no. You need to angle your neck downward a bit.  
  
**All：**  
............  
  
**Mora：**  
Hey, listen!  
Kasumi, Shiori, have you forgotten why you're here?!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Hold on a second please, I'm at the good part...  
...Huh?!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
If I can perfectly imitate these poses...  
...Ah?!  
  
**Mora：**  
Sheesh, have you both returned?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ohohoh!  
Men and women, young and old, all becoming entranced—  
  
*that* is the allure of the magical girl!  
  
**Mora：**  
Come on! What would you do if an Antibeast showed up right n—  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
A wild Antibeast appeared!  
It's almost as if you summoned it.  
  
**Mora：**  
You see!  
We haven't even got a plan. What're we gonna do?!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...Worry not.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...I'm sure all will be well.  
  
**Mora：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Mora：**  
This intensity... It's much worse than the last one...!  
Kasumi, Shiori—will they be okay?!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Let's believe in them.  
`Tag 8`  
**Mora：**  
Sir Knight...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hohohoh.  
Now go, my disciples!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Yes, Master!  
If its movements are too swift, then first we have to put a stop to it!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Solving mysteries in a heartbeat!  
Binding the culprit with the power of love. ☆  
Misty Wrapping!  
  
**Mora：**  
Is this... new magic?!  
She tied up the Antibeast with a magical ribbon?!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Now, Shiori!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Yes, leave it to me!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Focusing my aim on your heart!  
Certain death with the power of love. ☆  
Purely Aiming!  
  
**Mora：**  
Shiori's concentrating her power into her arrows...?!  
When the heck did she learn to do that?!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
I won't let my prey get away!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GROOAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Heh. Nice work!  
*That* is how magical girls get things done!  
  
**Mora：**  
I see... A magical girl's magic is born from her imagination.  
Being exposed to your collection has broadened their magical girl  
horizons...!  
  
**Mora：**  
So it really *was* special training...!  
  
**Mora：**  
Nanaka,  
you were an amazing person all along!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Fwahahahah! I don't call myself a magical girl for nothing!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Frankly, I just wanted to show off my collection  
to my new magical girl frens.  
But somehow it went well! Woot!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Keep up the good work,  
Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi! Magical Huntress Purely★Shiori!  
  
**Both：**  
Yes, Master!  
  
**???：**  
............  
  
**Choice: (9)**  What was that?  
`Tag 9`  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Is something the matter?  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Hm? You feel like we're being watched?  
But it doesn't look like there's anyone around here.  
  
**Mora：**  
! Oh...! It's different from the Antibeast you just defeated—  
it feels much stronger... But it looks like it's gone already...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
A strong power... different from the Antibeast...?  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Hmmm.  
There's a chance it could be some kind of reconnaissance.  
  
**Mora：**  
This sensation... It's like the Antibeasts' power, but mixed in with  
something else.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
It seems like it's time to say it...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Our battle's only just beginning!  
  
**All：**  
...*sigh*  
  
**Narration：**  
Magical girl Nanaka joined your party without your consent! Huh? That's  
it for my screen time?! There must be a mistake! Don't forget about  
me, Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi, Magical Huntress Purely★Shiori!
