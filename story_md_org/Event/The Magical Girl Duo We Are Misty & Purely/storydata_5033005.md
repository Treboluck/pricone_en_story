# Deep Love, Dark Shadows
The girls take a crepe break at the stall where Shizuru works. While they are making inferences about the enemy, something strange happens to Shizuru. She turns into the Sister of Darkness, and sets an Antibeast on the girls.
  
## Subtitle: Deep Love, Dark Shadows
  
**Narration：**  
After having grown as magical girls via the acquisition of new  
techniques, the duo are once again made aware of the existence of a  
great enemy.  
  
**Shiori：**  
The Antibeasts are getting stronger day by day...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
They're really starting to get serious.  
I'd like to do something about it, but we still don't know what they're  
after...  
  
**Mora：**  
Yeah, right...?  
But, but fortunately, no one's been hurt by the Antibeasts yet.  
So I think you're doing a fine job as magical girls!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...?  
Really? No injuries at all?  
  
**Shiori：**  
That's right. Because we always manage to get there  
before the Antibeasts starts rampaging.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Get there before...?  
Come to think of it, until now, the Antibeasts...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Something wrong?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm? Ah, apologies, my dear assistant.  
I was just doing a little thinking.  
It's just that all we've been doing lately is patrolling. I haven't had the  
chance to wrap my head around any of it...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, then do you like eating crepes?  
I hear sugar is good for your brain.  
I actually know a nice little crepe stall around here...!  
  
**Mora：**  
So you like sweet things, do you, Shiori?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, um...  
I do.  
But just a little.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  That crepe stall...  
`Tag 2`  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh? Do you also know of this stall, my dear assistant?  
I see... Well then, let's investigate.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Little Brotheeeeeer!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Eek?! Wh-what's all this about?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Welcome, Little Bro!  
Did you come to see your big sis?  
Of course you did. I'm so happy! Head pats for you!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Big sis... She's your big sister?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
That's right!  
I'm my little brother's big sister,  
  
and a big sister among big sisters. ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I-is that so...?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
What a powerful person...  
But my assistant looks a little troubled...  
Is it because he has amnesia, so he's not sure?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  One crepe, please.  
`Tag 3`  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, you want a crepe?  
So you came to eat one of your big sister's crepes!  
In other words, you came to eat your big sister... ♪  
  
**Shiori：**  
Is that how it works...?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It sure is! ♪  
All right! I'm gonna whip up the tastiest crepes you've ever put your  
lips around!. Don't you go anywhere!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
*chomp*  
...Hmmm.  
The normal amount of sweetness; the normal amount of sourness.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes. Very normal.  
  
**Mora：**  
Yeah. A totally normal taste.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Here you go, Little Bro, open wide. ♪  
Oh, you've got a little cream on your cheek.  
Let me wipe it off...  
Actually, I'll eat it for you. ☆  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...This bit is too sweet though.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Um, is your stall okay...?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, don't worry about that.  
We don't usually get many customers.  
Besides, my top priority will always be my little bro! ♪  
  
**Mora：**  
Wow, so much love... I've never felt anything like it before.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Love...?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Kasumi, what is it?  
Have you just had an epiphany?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh heck, Little Bro, I think I made these crepes a little too sweet.  
Do you  
need some water? Here you go. I thought this might happen, so I kept it  
for you!  
It's a little bit warm, but it's okay, because it's my warmth. ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...That's not it.  
Well, if I had to say,  
something's been bugging me.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Listen, Mora.  
You told us that Antibeasts seek out love, correct?  
  
**Mora：**  
Yup. They're the opposite of we who create magical girls out of love  
and hope—  
Antibeasts try to take love away from living things.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh? Little Brother, you're looking kinda run down.  
I think your muscles are a little tight.  
That's where I come in—time for a big sis massage! ♪  
  
**Shiori：**  
...Um...  
What exactly is it that's been bugging you, Kasumi?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
What has me bothered is the fact that there have been no Antibeast-  
related injuries. Think for a moment, would you, of the locations where  
they've appeared. Were any of them in our vicinity...? No, not one.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Now that you mention it...!  
But if you think about it, isn't it a bit strange?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
According to Mora,  
Antibeasts are natural disasters. But considering that...  
  
**Mora：**  
Are you saying that they apparently have a goal?  
  
**Shiori：**  
But what is it that's driving them to... appear around us?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Rub, rub. ♪  
You're so stiff, little bro.  
Hey, hey! You can't run away from me.  
Big Sis Submission! ☆  
  
**Kasumi：**  
W-well, that's distracting... I mean, he's to blame too.  
Right when we're trying to have a serious discussion.  
You're supposed to be my faithful assistant. ...Honestly!  
  
**Shiori：**  
...Wait. Um, Kasumi.  
Come to think of it, when we first encountered an Antibeast,  
it actually did appear nearby us.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Indeed.  
Back then, we'd just met Mora...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And my dear assistant was already fighting it...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Um, maybe I'm wrong, but...!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
From the outset, the Antibeasts' target was...!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Awww, I can't help it! You're so cute, Little Bro. ♪  
But, but I'm worried about you. I know you've been through a lot lately.  
Are you all right? You're always—  
  
**Shizuru：**  
—with those magical girls.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
{player}, come here!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Reach out toward her.  
`Tag 4`  
**Shizuru：**  
My, my.  
Little Brother was taken away.  
  
**Mora：**  
Urk! ...That reaction—is it an Antibeast?!  
Girls, transform!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Misty, Theory, Truly!  
Magical Ribbon: Spiral!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Pure Heart Lock-On!  
Magical Arrow: Critical!

**Shizuru Noir：**  
Eheh.  
Magical girls are on the case, I see.  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
How dare you take my little brother from me.  
...You will not be forgiven.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Shizuru... You...!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
I deduce that look isn't to be taken lightly...!  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
I am his big sister.  
My little brother's big sister.  
But now, well—  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
I suppose I am the Sister of Darkness.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
The Sister of...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Darkness...?!  
  
`image display end`  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
Heheh. Seeing as you're all here, I might as well show you.  
...Come!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
It's enormous...!  
And the pressure is just—...!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Could this be the Antibeast's true form?!  
  
**Mora：**  
You're right on the mark.  
It's like every Antibeast we've faced until now was spawned by this  
sucker!  
  
**Mora：**  
Moreover, that girl's power—I've definitely felt it before!  
It's mixed in with the Antibeast's power. So strong, and so deep...  
There's no doubt—it's the power of love...!  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
Heheh. This little thing actually assaulted me in the beginning.  
But my  
attacks had no effect, so I was desperate...  
Then, just as I was thinking  
of Little Bro, I bonked it on the head, and it suddenly became tame.  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GROOAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
And since then, it's been following my every command.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Don't tell me you've managed to tame it?!  
  
**Mora：**  
No, there's no way she could have!  
Antibeasts don't have free will!  
And it's not something that can be done by force...!  
  
**Mora：**  
No, could it be...? Is her love too powerful...?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Is that the reason it won't leave Shizuru's side?  
If it stays close to her, it can constantly feed on the power of her love...?  
  
**Mora：**  
There's probably no better host for it!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Is she okay?  
`Tag 5`  
**Mora：**  
I don't think you can stay with an Antibeast that long and suffer no  
consequences. It's bound to affect you in some way...  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
Eheheh. You're so thoughtful, Little Brother.  
You're worried about me, aren't you?  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
Argh, I can't hold back any longer!  
I want to be with you forever! I want to hold you forever and ever!  
I want to spoil you forever and ever and ever!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...For future reference,  
she's not always like that, is she?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  She's always like this.  
**Choice: (7)**  She's never like this.  
`Tag 6`  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Surely you jest?!  
You're telling me nothing about this is out of the ordinary?!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
This is all the Antibeast's doing... maybe.  
  
Jump to tag 8  
`Tag 7`  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
As I suspected, the Antibeast is manipulating her.  
What now? She's usually much worse?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...She's somewhat beyond imagination...  
  
`Tag 8`  
**Mora：**  
In all likelihood, she's under the influence of the Antibeast,  
and her love has started to go out of control!  
Be careful, both of you!  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
Heheheh. I can't take it anymore! ☆  
Now, bring me my little brother!  
I'm going to spoil him to death with all my love!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Mora：**  
Here it comes! Kasumi, Shiori, Sir Knight!  
Defeat that Antibeast!  
If you do, peace is sure to return to Landosol!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Let's all restore the peace together!  
`Tag 9`  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Certainly!  
Let's solve this case once and for all!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Yes, let's.  
I'll blast it away with all my power!  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
Magical girls!  
How dare you try to rend the love between me and my little brother  
asunder. Absolutely unforgivable!  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
Now, eliminate these interfering reprobates!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
What was that?!  
Pathetic! Misty Bullet!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GROOAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
How do you like that? It's the power of the Magical Detective!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Whoa there!  
Th-that was a bit close, don't you think?!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Kasumi!  
Let me handle it!  
  
Purely Arrow!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
I'm going to shoot it down!  
Yaaahhh!  
  
**Mora：**  
Wow!  
You really did shoot it down!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
The name Magical Huntress isn't just for show...!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Mora：**  
My judgement was spot on!  
You two have already become fine magical girls!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Good grief.  
Finally, after all this time.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
But we're happy to hear it...!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Kasumi, let's end this in a flash!  
Purely Aiming!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
By all means, Shiori, let's.  
What say we put a ribbon on it?!  
Misty Wrapping!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Mora：**  
Great, it's all tied up!  
Now, girls! Put it out of its misery!  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
I won't let that happen.  
  
**Mora：**  
Huh? Ahhh!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Mora!

You're my rabbit now. ♪  
Mora, was it?  
Your power... Give it. ♪

L-let me go!  
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
What?! It broke free of my Misty Wrapping?!  
Is Mora's power making it stronger?!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Kasumi!  
Our power is weakening!  
I think the supply from Mora is dwindling...!  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
Wow, there's so much power.  
This will help me take even better care of my little brother. ♪

Heheh. Don't go anywhere, Little Brother.  
Big Sis is gonna give you a nice hug.  
Let my squeeeze you tightly, and show you just how much I love you... ♪

H-her love is too strong...  
At this rate, I'm going to...!

**Misty★Kasumi：**  
What the devil?!  
Th-the Antibeast is... getting even bigger...?!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Wh-what... can we do...?!  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
Eheh, eheheh.  
Now the tables have turned.  
After all, love only deepens when we overcome large obstacles... ♪  
  
**Shizuru Noir：**  
Ready, Little Brother...

power has the magical girls and me in a bind! What will happen next,  
Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi, Magical Huntress Purely★Shiori?!
