## Subtitle: Magical Girls Never End
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Our days as magical girls have come to an end...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...Huh?  
What's with up you all of a sudden, Kasumi?  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Oh, the days have been filled with fierce battles.  
Even now, I can still see them when I close my eyes...!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Kasumi,  
um... I think...  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
I shan't forget these days we spent as magical girls...!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Kasumi... Even if you act all final like that,  
I don't think this is the end of our magical girl adventures...  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Urgh...!  
I knew it! There's no escaping this ridiculous fate...!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
As long as... you and {player} are with me,  
I can keep on doing my absolute best forever...!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
How pure and dedicated you are, my dear Shiori...  
Goodness, it sounds like I'm being a spoiled brat.  
Providing I'm with you and my dear assistant, I'll always be comfortable.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Then let's keep endeavoring together,  
Misty★Kasumi.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Certainly. I wouldn't have it any other way,  
Purely★Shiori.
