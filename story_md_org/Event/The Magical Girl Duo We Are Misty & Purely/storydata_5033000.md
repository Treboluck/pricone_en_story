## Subtitle: We're Magical Girls?!
  
**Narration：**  
It's another pleasant day in Landosol.  
A pair of girls are strolling through the peaceful streets.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'm grateful you invited me today, Shiori.  
I had a splendid time.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm so glad you did.  
You told me once that you like detective novels too,  
so I thought I'd ask...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'd never been to an author's meet and greet before.  
It had quite a friendly atmosphere.  
The whole experience turned out to be rather interesting.  
  
**Shiori：**  
For me as well. Usually, I can only make it to events when I'm in good  
health, so you really helped me today by just being here.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That's quite all right. It's no bother at all.  
By the way, if you're feeling up to it, would you like to go somewhere  
and discuss the novel in-depth?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, I'd love to...!  
The tricks in this novel are so interesting,  
I've been dying to talk to someone about them...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
They're certainly outlandish, and rather original.  
Like the one using the meteor shower to calculate the time difference  
is unheard of—  
Hm?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Shiori, did you see that?  
There was a light in the sky just now...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Magical...?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Girls...?  
  
**Mora：**  
That's right! With pure hearts, and pretty faces!  
And overflowing with endless love!  
Fighting in the name of peace: magical girls!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Shiori,  
do you have any idea what this little mystic fellow is talking about?  
I'm afraid I'm not very good with illogical themes...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Um...  
Mora,  
why did you choose Kasumi and me?  
  
**Mora：**  
The queen of the Kingdom of Magic is always saying that  
somewhere in the world there exist people who will come to save us!  
  
**Mora：**  
Kasumi and Shiori!  
You two rescued me when I was in a bind, did you not?  
No doubt about it—this is fate!  
  
**Mora：**  
My mystic senses are tingling! Without a doubt,  
the two of you are the magical girls that I've been searching for!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Er, no matter how you look at it, this was nothing more than a  
chance encounter...  
  
**Shiori：**  
...Think about it, Kasumi.  
Magical girl stories always begin with this  
kind of coincidence...! Crossing paths with a cute mascot suddenly  
changing the course of their ordinary everyday lives—  
  
**Kasumi：**  
My dear Shiori, you talk much more than I expected...!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ah, n-no... I'm sorry.  
It's just, I was reading Magical Girl Bella-Lou recently, so...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Eheheh. It's good that you can get so passionate about something.  
Well then, what happens next in those magical girl stories?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Um, after meeting the mascot,  
most of the time—  
  
**Mora：**  
! This evil presence...  
Be careful, you two! It's somewhere nearby!  
  
**Shiori：**  
—an enemy appears.  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Right.  
You know the genre well.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Wait, there's a monster in the streets of a city like this?  
What on earth are the guards doing?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
What's more,  
I've never seen a monster like that in any book...!  
  
**Mora：**  
So it decided to show up!  
That thing is an Antibeast! Its presence in this world brings about disaster!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Mystic creatures, Antibeasts...  
I need a minute to let it all sink in...!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ah, Kasumi, look over there!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Hm?  
Someone's battling the Antibeast...?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Isn't that...?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Stay back!  
`Tag 1`  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's my assistant!  
In the wrong place at the wrong time—what terrible luck...!  
  
**Shiori：**  
This is bad—he's overwhelmed...!  
I'm going to save you, {player}!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Huh? It has no effect...?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Our attacks don't work.  
**Choice: (3)**  Our attacks don't land.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kasumi：**  
Right.  
It seems as though your attacks are being hindered by some sort of  
shield.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Shiori：**  
Yes.  
Before my arrow could pierce the monster,  
it just bounced right off...  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Kasumi：**  
Hmmm. I think I already know what will happen,  
but just in case, let's give magic a shot!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
No luck, as expected.  
That shield—it seems to have some special, hidden power.  
  
**Mora：**  
Normal attacks are no use!  
The Antibeast's body is protected by a barrier  
that can only be destroyed  
by love-infused magical girl power!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
What...? Where's the logic in that...?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ah! The Antibeast is—  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
My dear assistant!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Kasumi...!  
It looks as though in order to defeat the Antibeast and save  
{player}, we have no choice but to become magical girls!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...If that's what it takes, Shiori.  
I can't say it doesn't feel forced, but if we want to rescue him, then there's  
no other alternative than to... grant Mora's wish.  
  
**Mora：**  
All right!  
Are you both ready to fulfill your destiny?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...I  
suppose.  
  
**Mora：**  
Then take my power!  
And transform into magical girls!

**Shiori & Kasumi：**  
......  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...There's just one problem...  
  
**Shiori：**  
...We don't know how.  
  
**Mora：**  
...Huh?  
The transformation phrase is supposed to just come to you...  
  
**Shiori & Kasumi：**  
...?  
  
**Mora：**  
Argh! Maybe it's because I gave both of you my power at the same time,  
so there's not enough magical energy for two!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
What?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh no...!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Shiori：**  
The Antibeast is coming this way!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
What a troubling turn of events....!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  You've got my support.  
`Tag 6`  
**Kasumi：**  
My dear assistant...!  
...What's this sensation...?  
My body feels warm...! This is more than just  
my assistant's power...  
  
**Shiori：**  
I can feel something overflowing from within me...!  
His power, and this other... strange energy...!  
  
**Mora：**  
Your magic level is rising...!  
Amazing! Is this... the power of your knight friend...?!  
  
**Mora：**  
You two! That's the light of love!  
Now is when you declare your contract...  
  
**Mora：**  
...and transform into magical girls!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Misty, Theory, Truly!  
Magical Ribbon: Spiral!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Pure Heart Lock-On!  
Magical Arrow: Critical!
