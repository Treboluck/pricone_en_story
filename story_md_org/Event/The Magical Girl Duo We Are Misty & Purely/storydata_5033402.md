**Misty★Kasumi：**  
*pant*... pant*...  
Th-that was quite the challenging fight...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
W-we won...!  
We did it, Kasumi... I mean, Misty★Kasumi.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Indeed.  
It's all thanks to you, Purely★Shiori.  
There's no way I would have gotten this far fighting alone.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
I don't believe that one bit!  
In fact, it was because of my partner, Misty★Kasumi,  
that I was able to fight on without losing heart...!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Heheh.  
...Maybe being a magical girl isn't so bad after all.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
I agree!  
I hope we can be magical girls forever...!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...Th-that's pushing it a bit...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Huh...? You want to give it up...?  
I knew it, being with me is—  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
No, no, no, no, that's not what I'm saying!  
It's just that the idea of wearing the same frilly outfit forever doesn't sit  
well with me...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
No, it's fine... I know that you're kind,  
and you were forcing yourself to accommodate me...!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
That's not true!  
All right, all right already!  
I don't want it to end—I hope I can be a magical girl forever!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...Heheh.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...Honestly.  
  
She's quite the schemer, that Shiori.
