## Subtitle: Special Training—Signature Pose!
  
**Narration：**  
Kasumi and Shiori have been chosen to fight as magical girls.  
Together with {player}, they patrol the city in order to  
defend it from baleful Antibeasts.  
  
**Shiori：**  
For the time being, we've come to a less public place...  
So, what do we do now?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
If the Antibeasts had a clear modus operandi,  
we could take appropriate countermeasures...  
They go after love, right, Mora?  
  
**Mora：**  
Yeah. They're the exact opposite of us who create magical girls  
using the power of love.  
In my country, they're treated like a natural disaster.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...I deduce that since it came to Landosol,  
it had some kind of goal to achieve, or a special purpose.  
Either way, we don't have enough information.  
  
**Shiori：**  
In the meantime, why don't we conduct interviews?  
Probing witnesses is the basis of an investigation,  
right?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Indeed, Shiori, that is a logical proposition.  
...But I wanted to say it...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh! I-I'm so sorry, Kasumi!  
I overstepped the mark!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
No, it's fine.  
It's just that when I'm not transformed into a magical girl,  
my petty pride as a would-be detective shows...  
  
**Shiori：**  
But I think you also make a great magical girl...!  
Your dress is really cute.  
...You think so too, don't you, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Nod.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kasumi：**  
Shiori, my dear assistant...!  
Y-you both think so?  
Eheheh. Then I suppose I can endure it...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...  
Hm? But honestly?  
I can't help feeling as though I'm being deceived...  
  
**Mora：**  
Uhhh, is she embarrassed...?  
That could be a problem.  
Huh?  
Ahhh! This sensation...!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Oh no, a monster!  
There's a monster that I've never seen before!  
  
**Man 2：**  
What?!  
It managed to get into the city?!  
  
**Man 3：**  
What the fudge?! I can't hit it with my sword!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Shiori：**  
There's no doubt about it!  
Kasumi, it's an Antibeast!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...So it's time for round two...  
Argh, a detective is true to her word!  
Let's go, my dear Shiori!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes!  
{player}, please lend us your strength!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Transform!  
`Tag 2`  
**Shiori：**  
Pure Heart Lock-On!  
Magical Arrow: Critical!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Magical Huntress Purely★Shiori.  
My arrows of love won't miss your heart!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
............  
  
**Choice: (3)**  ...Why aren't you transforming?  
`Tag 3`  
**Kasumi：**  
I just wanted to inspect Shiori's transformation a little more closely.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
So it's like that?  
When I transform, my clothes fly away, my skin turns luminous, and I  
spin around and around, moaning in apparent pleasure as well?  
  
**Mora：**  
All magical girls transform like that.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I see. Unfathomable.  
This is a cold case if ever there was one.  
  
**Mora：**  
Kasumi?!  
What are you trying to say?  
Have you forgotten the pact you made that day?!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I don't remember making such a long-term pact!  
...There, you see? Look at that!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Wh-what's that?!  
Someone's coming!  
  
**Man 2：**  
What's with the getup?  
It's strangely eye-catching...!  
  
**Man 3：**  
Magical Huntress...?  
N-never heard of such a thing...!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
She's clearly the center of attention!  
What if someone we know sees us...?  
  
**Mora：**  
That's fine! Nothing to worry about!  
It doesn't even matter if a magical girl is seen by her own cat—no one  
will ever know it's her!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh, is that so...?  
But still, nothing can be done about the insecurity that comes from being  
seen...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Hyah! Purely Arrow!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Mora：**  
Look, look! Shiori's really going for it!  
All right, Sir Knight! Do your thing!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Power up Kasumi.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kasumi：**  
Ah! My dear assistant!  
Cease! Ah! I-I won't yield!  
I won't give in to these words that suddenly spring to mind...!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Mi-Mi—...Miiii—  
Misty, Theory, Truly!  
Magical Ribbon: Spiral!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi.  
With a wave of my wand, I'm on the case!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
You're supposed to be my *faithful* assistant, so why would you do that?!  
Argh... And why do I go as far as to mindlessly repeat that  
catchphrase...?!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Kasumi!  
It's going your way!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Gahhh, fine! Misty Bullet!  
  
**Mora：**  
Great! Thanks to you two, that's another Antibeast gone from this world!  
  
We're one step closer to peace!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Those girls are amazing!  
Just like that, they beat a monster that was resistant to attacks!  
  
**Man 2：**  
They may dress like weird knockoffs of popular characters,  
but they sure are strong!  
  
**Man 3：**  
I heard them call themselves Magical Huntress  
and Magical Detective...!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Urghhh... They're all looking at us...  
I can feel their eyes boring into me...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
But I'm glad that our true identities will remain hidden.  
I think I'd be embarrassed as well if somebody I know saw me like this...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh? Why?  
You look so cute like that, Shiorin.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Stop it, Hatsune, you're making me blush.  
  
**Kasumi & Mora：**  
?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...Huh?  
Hatsune?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Mornin', Shiorin!  
I was woken up by all the racket.  
And to my surprise, it was you beating up a bad guy.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Huh! Whaaaa...?  
Oh, Hatsune, did you fall asleep outside again...?  
Hold on a minute... You knew it was me?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
?  
Of course. ♪  
There's no way that I wouldn't recognize my precious little sister. ☆  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Mora.  
I think I might need to take you in for questioning.  
Let me remind you what happens to criminals convicted of perjury.  
  
**Mora：**  
Wait, wait! Leave my ears out of this!  
I-I didn't lie to you!  
I know! The way she's dressed—yeah, that's it! She's a magical girl too!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Hatsune, is that right...?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Magical girl?  
Nope! I just have superpowe—...  
Ahem!  
I'm just Hatsune, a super-normal girl, yeah?  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Mora.  
It was nice knowing you.  
I'll remember to visit you in prison.  
  
**Mora：**  
Eek! The look in her eyes is serious!  
Save me, Sir Knight!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  It's some kind of mistake.  
**Choice: (6)**  Let me know what to bring you.  
`Tag 5`  
**Mora：**  
Yes, that's right!  
It has to be some kind of mistake! It's never happened before, I promise!  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Mora：**  
Before you come and see me in prison, I would appreciate your help!  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Mora：**  
Er, Shiori and Hatsune are related, right?  
It's probably because that connection... that bond is so strong that  
even when she's transformed, Hatsune can tell!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Our bond...  
Do you think so, Hatsune?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I have no idea what all this \"magical girl\" talk is about,  
but no matter your outward appearance...  
I'll definitely see through it.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Hatsune...!  
  
**Mora：**  
You see?  
It's fine—normal people absolutely won't be able to tell!  
I'm certain! I'm positive! I think...  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...I wish you could say that more confidently.  
Urgh... It's questionable, but I suppose I have no choice but to trust you.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
So...  
Care to enlighten me about what you guys were up to?  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Ah! Um...  
I guess we should explain, now that the cat's out of the bag.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wow, that's so cool!  
Shiorin, you're a magical girl!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Protector of Landosol and ally of justice!  
I'm so proud of you! You're the best, sis!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Y-you'll shorten my life span if you keep hugging me so tightly...  
Also, please lower your voice when you talk about that, okay...?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Gosh, my bad. It's a secret, right?  
I really wanna go around town bragging about my awesome little sister,  
but I'll do my best to keep the beans in the can!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Is this going to be all right...? I can't say I have a good feeling about it.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
So basically,  
you're both embarrassed about your transformations, huh?  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Er... Yes.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
I wonder if you can help us, Hatsune.  
You're always dressed a lot like a magical girl...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Shiorin,  
I hope you're not telling me that you're always embarrassed by my  
appearance...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Huh? No!  
Not at all.  
Rather, right now I'm happy that we're almost dressed the same...!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Shiorin...  
Eheheh. ♪ All righty!  
For my precious little sister and her friends,  
I'm gonna show you how it's done! ☆  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...Maybe it's just my imagination,  
but I have a feeling this won't end well...

They really do look kinda weird...

Hmm.
