## Subtitle: City of Love and Hope
  
**Narration：**  
With the support of the townspeople, Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi  
and Magical Huntress Purely★Shiori came back from the brink of certain  
doom. Through their efforts, peace once again returned to Landosol.  
  
**Narration：**  
A little time has passed since then...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Good. No signs of anything unusual in town today.  
It's only been a few days, but it appears the crisis really is over.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I can't believe the Antibeasts that were showing up  
nearly every day disappeared so suddenly.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Well, that's what happens when you eradicate the source of an  
infestation.  
It's when it doesn't happen that you should be worried.  
  
**Shiori：**  
...Shizuru has no recollection  
of the events, does she?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
She doesn't. I was meaning to ask her about  
when she first met the Antibeast...  
My dear assistant, how is she?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Same as always.  
`Tag 1`  
**Shiori：**  
I can't stop thinking of how she looked  
when she rushed to hug you...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh dear.  
It's been an uneventful few days.  
I suppose it's official—we're out of a job.  
  
**Shiori：**  
...I wonder what happened to Mora.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Nothing happened.  
We defeated the Antibeasts.  
I imagine Mora's purpose has been fulfilled.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Nevertheless... it doesn't warrant leaving without a word.  
We haven't even said goodbye properly yet...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I don't think anything of it.  
Or rather, I'm glad I don't have to do the whole frilly outfit thing  
anymore. Relieved, in fact.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It's kinda sad, huh?  
`Tag 2`  
**Kasumi：**  
Are you even listening?!  
I said absolutely nothing of the sort!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Eheh. Despite being a great detective,  
you're no good at telling lies.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Come, you two!  
Cease with the mockery!  
  
**Shiori：**  
But I... feel sad.  
Sad that Mora's no longer around...  
And sad that we can't transform into magical girls anymore.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...I-I'm...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'm not too happy either, but it's not like I can admit it or anything.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh. It was around here, wasn't it?  
Where we first met Mora...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Indeed it was.  
Around here we heard someone calling out for help...  
  
**???：**  
Hello...! Anyone...?!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Yes, quite like that. And then I said,  
\"Hm? Did you hear that, my dear Shiori?\"  
  
**???：**  
Somebody, please help me!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Exactly. Just how I remember. Then I think I said,  
\"Yes, it sounds like someone's calling us...\"  
Right? Something like...  
that...?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  It's as if I can really hear Mora's voice.  
`Tag 3`  
**Mora：**  
Hey, Kasumi, Shiori, Sir Knight!  
I need you to stop talking, and start helping!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Mora!?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Mora!  
  
**Mora：**  
Yo, what's up?! Long time, no see!  
How've you been?  
  
**Shiori：**  
How've we been?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
How've we been?  
Selfish rodent!  
What's the big idea, suddenly disappearing without a trace like that after  
putting us through so much embarrassment?! I don't want any excuses!  
  
**Mora：**  
Whoaaa?! Kasumi, you seem kinda upset!  
I-I'm sorry! But I had a perfectly good reason for up and leaving!  
  
**Shiori：**  
...A good reason, you say?  
For leaving without so much as a whisper?  
  
**Mora：**  
Ah, so you're the calmly angry type, Shiori.  
I'm so, so sorry...!  
  
**Mora：**  
But we have a situation!  
We're not out of the woods just yet—Landosol's still in danger!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
What now...?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Is something coming...?!  
  
**Mora：**  
After you defeated the final Antibeast,  
in its residue I could faintly sense the power of something else.  
  
**Mora：**  
But not the same as Shizuru—something entirely different...  
Something evil.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Do you suppose... there's still someone pulling the strings?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Which means...  
  
**Mora：**  
Yup!  
The magical girls' duty has yet to be fulfilled!  
  
**Mora：**  
I'm counting on you,  
Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi,  
Magical Huntress Purely★Shiori!  
  
**Both：**  
Whaaaat?!  
  
**Mora：**  
And you, Sir Knight! We depend on your assistance!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Leave it to me!  
**Choice: (5)**  Can I transform too this time?  
`Tag 4`  
**Kasumi：**  
Still making promises without due consideration?!  
Why are you such a soft touch, my faithful assistant?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Heheh.  
That's actually his best trait.  
You do realize that, don't you, Kasumi?  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Kasumi：**  
You still want to transform?!  
Just where does all that tenacity come from...?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
...I support your decision...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Shiori...?!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Kasumi：**  
Argh, please! I was actually happy that Mora disappeared,  
and that we wouldn't have to look like manga characters ever again!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yet despite that, you're still smiling.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
No I am not!  
  
**Mora：**  
Hohohoh.  
Kasumi, Shiori.  
You don't need me to help you transform anymore.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Pardon?  
  
**Shiori：**  
...Come again?  
  
**Mora：**  
You've already grown into wonderful magical girls!  
Even when I'm not around, there's enough power in your love and hope  
to transform on your own!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I-I didn't ask for such an ability!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Th-that's right.  
...Heheh.  
  
**Mora：**  
All right!  
Then *it* needs to be said,  
to lighten the mood!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
What?! Absolutely not.  
I resolutely refuse!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ready when you are!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Transform!  
`Tag 7`  
**Kasumi：**  
Good grief!  
I suppose I'll have to just go with it!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Misty, Theory, Truly!  
Magical Ribbon: Spiral!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Pure Heart Lock-On!  
Magical Arrow: Critical!

**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi.  
With a wave of my wand, I'm on the case!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Magical Huntress Purely★Shiori.  
My arrows of love won't miss your heart!  
  
**Narration：**  
Thus, the magical girl duo protected the peace of the city, all the while  
spreading love and hope! However, their battle had only just begun! Go  
forth, Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi, Magical Huntress Purely★Shiori!

**Mora：**  
I'm certain the battles ahead will be even more grueling.  
In order to continue protecting the city, we need much more power.  
  
**Mora：**  
Fortunately, this fair city of Landosol is brimming with love and hope.  
There are bound to be like-minded people out there...!  
  
**Mora：**  
New friends who are willing to help us  
achieve world peace!
