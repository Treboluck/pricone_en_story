There. ♪ With a wave of my wand, we solved the case!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Heheheh.  
Kasumi, you're a magical girl through and through.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Eh?!  
N-no, you're wrong!  
My body acted of its own accord...  
I'm a detective to my core!  
This magical girl act is just my secret identity!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
So you transform into your secret identity...?  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Argh, you know what I'm trying to say...  
Please cease with the teasing, my dear Shiori!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Sorry. You're just so adorable, I had to.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Honestly.  
...Anyway, I can still sense the Antibeast.  
Let's hurry up and return peace to the city!
