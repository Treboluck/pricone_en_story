**Mitsuki：**  
However many times you try, you're not going to defeat us.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Yes, Mitsuki is quite correct...  
We'll reduce your worthless body to a giant pile of scrap.  
 Teehee.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
No amount of power will sway us from our path!  
All who attempt to stand in our way are doomed to fail!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Woohoooo! You're the coolest, Annie-girl!  
Your burning spirit's almost setting me on fire!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Well said, Anna. Your words ring true!  
Come at us, foe... and fall by my blade!
