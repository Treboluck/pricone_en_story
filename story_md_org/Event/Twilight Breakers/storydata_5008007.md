# The Journey Never Ends
With the villains defeated, the group leaves the village behind and sets out on the journey home. When Eriko asks {player} to join her for some private bathing therapy, Ruka suggests that they all go to a hot spring resort together. And so their wild journey continues...
  
## Subtitle: The Journey Never Ends
  
**Royal Knight A：**  
Sir! This is indeed the correct village.  
  
**Royal Knight B：**  
Understood. But I must say, it doesn't seem  
to match the petition we received.  
  
**Royal Knight B：**  
I see plenty of young men around, and the place seems full of life.  
What could have happened here?  
  
**Old Man：**  
Ah! Could you be knights from Landosol?  
  
**Royal Knight B：**  
Indeed we are. On behalf of Nightmare,  
we are here in response to a petition for aid.  
  
**Royal Knight B：**  
May I ask you, good sir, what happened in this village?  
  
**Old Man：**  
Hohohoh. I'm afraid you missed our glorious saviors...  
A band of travelers delivered us from our woes.  
  
**Old Man：**  
Young man, bring the prisoners from their cell.  
  
**Old Man：**  
These are our village's once-tormentors.  
Please bring them to justice...  
  
**Noble：**  
Ohhhh... Aaahhh...!  
My... my ultimate weapooon... U... uwaaahhhh!  
  
**Foreman：**  
W-we have to escape! If they come back... we'll be done for...!  
I-I'm so scared! Mommyyyyy!  
  
**Royal Knight B：**  
Wh-what in the world...?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Ahhhhh... After setting out to find honest work,  
I can't believe I'm returning to Landosol still penniless...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
You're not the only one, believe me, Annie-girl...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Thanks to all the damage that weapon caused,  
the tomes are buried deep under a cavernful of rubble...  
I need a new source of cash, or I'm in deep doodoo...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Don't get so down, you two.  
  
**Ruka：**  
If you live your best life, success will find you soon enough.  
That's just the way this world works.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Shall I introduce you to a job testing experimental drugs, Anna?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
T-testing drugs?! I'd rather not...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
What a pity. I thought you might finally  
have a new coworker, {player}...  
Wait,  
 huh? I could have sworn he was right next to me...  
  
**Eriko：**  
{player}, my love...  
Are your wounds healing nicely?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Actually... I came up with an idea of my own  
to help you recover more quickly.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee... To be specific...  
 it's bathing therapy!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Soaking in the therapeutic waters of a hot spring  
can do wonders for your body and soul.  
  
**Eriko：**  
As it happens, just beyond that mountain  
lies a little-known hot spring resort.  
Only seasoned travelers are aware of it.  
  
**Eriko：**  
It's really the perfect spot for us to relax and recuperate.  
  
**Eriko：**  
The main open-air baths are mixed bathing only...  
But for you, my love, I can face any embarrassment.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's \"mixed bathing\"?  
**Choice: (2)**  A hot bath does sound pretty good...  
`Tag 1`  
**Eriko：**  
Huh?  
 W-well, ah... Do I really have to explain in detail?  
You can be so cruel, my love...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Eriko：**  
Y-you're not even fazed by the mixed bathing?  
How very bold...  
 I'd expect no less from my soulmate.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Eriko：**  
Anyway, we should leave the others and head there at once!  
An open-air bath with my love...  
 Ahh, I can hardly wait! Teehee...

**Mitsuki：**  
Now, now!  
 My dearest Eriko, we really can't allow you two  
to sneak off to a place like that all on your lonesome!  
  
**Eriko：**  
And whyever not?  
I'm only trying to ensure that {player}  
makes a full recovery from his wounds.  
  
**Ruka：**  
What a marvelous idea! A hot spring, eh?  
We should all head over there together! Isn't it more fun that way?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Wha... Why, Ruka, how utterly shameless...!  
I knew you were one to watch out for...  
  
**Ruka：**  
The water's therapeutic, isn't it?  
I'm sure we all have our share of scratches.  
Let's have a nice soak together!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Wowie!  
 That's our Ruka—never one to read the room!  
I hope you're not counting on any strategically placed steam!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Maybe I'll join the fun, too!  
 Mixed bathing sounds like a riot!  
Did we just trip the flag for the harem route?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
A m-mixed bath?!  
S-surely you can't mean Sigurd and I  sharing the same bathing area...?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Of course! You're game, aren't you, Annie-girl?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I, ah, I don't think...  
Well, but if it will really help soothe Sigurd's wounds...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Woohoo! Did I just hear that right,  
 Annie-girl?!  
Hey, guys! Listen to this! Anna's ready to bare it all!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
What in the world are you saying, Nanaka?!  
I just want to help Sigurd in any way I can!  
  
**Eriko：**  
So much for our perfect bathtime together... Ah well, no matter.  
I'll just have to spike the water with some hypnotic herbs...  
 Teeheehee...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Haha... Honestly, there's never a dull moment with you guys.  
  
**Narration：**  
And so the six travelers continued their lively journey,  
wandering off in high spirits to who knows where...
