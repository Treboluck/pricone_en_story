**Nanaka：**  
Stricken by the curse of poverty, Anna seeks work in a distant cavern.  
She walks off into the sunset, never to be seen again... The End.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Nanaka! Don't foretell my impending doom!  
It's true that I have financial troubles, but...  
  
**Ruka：**  
You two certainly seem lively as usual.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Sigurd, accompany me!  
I will surely need your strength to face this challenge!
