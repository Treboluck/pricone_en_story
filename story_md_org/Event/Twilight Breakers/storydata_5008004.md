# Den of Villainy
Overhearing her superiors talk in secret, Anna becomes enraged at their villainy and starts a fight. In the heat of battle, {player} is injured leaping in front of Anna to protect her. Anna hauls him out of the cavern to safety, and they head for the village with Ruka and Nanaka.

**Narration：**  
Though Anna and {player} are making good progress  
with their excavation work, laboring hard for hours on end  
is pushing them to their limits.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
*pant*... *pant*... *pant*...  
Is it not time for our lunch break yet...?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Rather than digging through this rock by hand,  
could we not blast through it with magic instead?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That could bring the whole cavern down on us!  
**Choice: (2)**  Yeah... Let's do that.  
`Tag 1`  
**Stechpalm：**  
True enough. My dark magicks could wreak untold destruction.  
Wielding near-limitless power comes with its own problems, heheheh!  
*sigh*  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Stechpalm：**  
You think so too, Sigurd?  
 Then let us unleash—  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...No, wait.  
 If I wreak too much destruction here,  
I may harm the other workers around us. Perhaps not, then...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Noble：**  
How is the excavation progressing?  
  
**Foreman：**  
Well enough. Though we suffered some brief setbacks,  
these past few days have gone smoothly.  
  
**Noble：**  
Very good. I've secured the reference material.  
We can finally proceed with the deciphering.  
  
**Foreman：**  
Oh, how wonderful!  
 Please, come this way.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Sigurd... Did you see that? Some fancy-looking noble  
is heading off with the foreman to speak in private.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
We should follow them. It's the perfect chance to investigate!  
  
**Noble：**  
I was concerned when we ran out of new laborers from that village,  
but the flyers we distributed in Landosol  
seem to have worked exactly as we hoped.  
  
**Foreman：**  
Oh, yes! Our carefully worded advertisement  
has brought rubes like moths to the flame!  
  
**Noble：**  
\"Three meals a day, residence provided, with a friendly  
on-the-job training program to make you feel right at home!\"  
  
**Noble：**  
Haha! Truly hilarious, if I do say so myself!  
Trudging all the way out to the mountains for these empty promises...  
I'll never understand how commoners' minds work!  
  
**Foreman：**  
Many are wanted criminals,  
or otherwise suffering from unfortunate circumstances.  
  
**Noble：**  
Hmm. I suppose even the lowliest of ne'er-do-wells  
needs to make a living somehow.  
  
**Foreman：**  
True enough, true enough.  
Nobody can survive for long without a penny to their name.  
  
**Foreman：**  
Besides, it's not as if we wrote anything that's strictly untrue.  
We do provide them all with food and a place to sleep, don't we?  
  
**Noble：**  
Hahaha!  
 Provisions stolen from the nearby village,  
and beds of straw for them to sleep on like cattle, you mean!  
  
**Foreman：**  
That's another way of putting it! Hahaha...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Wh-what was that?! The food we ate earlier  
was cruelly looted from unwilling villagers?  
Those villains... How dare they!  
  
**Noble：**  
Well then... Now that the work is back on track,  
it's time to begin the final stage of my plan.  
  
**Noble：**  
As soon as I am able to decipher the ancient tomes, my power will rival...  
No, it will surpass the very gods themselves!  
  
**Noble：**  
And then, overthrowing the royals of Landosol will be all too easy.  
Soon, I will be this land's new king!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Overthrowing royalty? Becoming king?!  
Just how hungry for power are these villains?  
  
**Foreman：**  
When the world is yours, I only hope you will remember me...  
  
**Noble：**  
But of course.  
 Your talent for manipulation  
will be most helpful in managing my lowly subjects.  
  
**Foreman：**  
My liege!  
 'Tis an honor to serve you!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Tell me, Sigurd, did you hear all that?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I have little interest in politics.  
But even I would hate to be ruled by a king like him!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
My body still aches from all that work, but we cannot back down here!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Let's go! It falls to us to crush their ambitions!  
In the name of the Order of Gehenna Immortals!  
  
**Noble：**  
Now then... I'll get down to deciphering these tomes.  
You hurry the excavation along.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Hold it right there, villains!  
  
**Foreman：**  
You're the new recruits...?  
We have intruders! Guards!  
  
**Noble：**  
Alas... Did you overhear our little chat,  
my dear young miss? Young man?  
  
**Noble：**  
Honestly... Youth can be such a troublesome thing.  
Your curiosity has led you to your own doom.  
  
**Noble：**  
You. Kill them.  
They're in your hands now.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Get back here, villain!  
Move it! I don't have time for cronies!  
Hiyaaahhh!  
  
**Foreman：**  
What's wrong? There's no oomph to your attacks!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Urgh...  
 If only I could use my magic freely,  
I could make short work of these miserable scoundrels!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Sigurd! Let's break through their lines! Follow my lead!  
  
**Foreman：**  
Now, men! Take out the girl!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Oh no! Projectiles?!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Anna!!!  
`Tag 4`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Huh?  
 Aahhh...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Sigurd?!  
Sigurd, answer me! Hey! Sigurd!  
  
**Foreman：**  
That takes care of the guy!  
 Just the girl to go!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
You protected me... How foolish can you be?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Please, answer me! Ugh, is he unconscious...?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
At this rate, we'll be caught!  
For now, I have to get Sigurd to safety!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Take this! Banishing Flash!  
  
**Foreman：**  
Ugh...! Just a flashbang? How irritating!  
Move! Go after them! Don't let them escape!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Sigurd... Hang on a little longer! We're almost out!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I'm exhausted to the core... But I can't afford to fail!  
Move! Move, my aching limbs! Please...!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
It's my turn now to protect Sigurd...!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
*pant*... *pant*... Damn... it... I can't... go any farth...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Anna! {player}!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Annie-girl?!  
 What's gotten you all beat-up?  
Ahh! {player}! Are you OK?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Nanaka... Ruka...!  
  
**Ruka：**  
{player}...?! Hey! Hang in there!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I'm sorry... He took an attack to protect me...  
We have to get him... to safe... ty...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Anna?!  
R-R-Ruka, what should we do?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
We'd best retreat for now. Let's carry them to the village!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Nanaka, can you collapse the cavern entrance?  
It'll buy us some time, at least.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Roger that, boss!  
Hiyaaahh!  
  
**Ruka：**  
...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ruka! The cavern's blocked!  
  
**Ruka：**  
...Good. Then let's move!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Harming our precious friends like this... They've done it now.  
This is one crime I can't possibly let slide!
