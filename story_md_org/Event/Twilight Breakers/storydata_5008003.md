# Ignoble Intentions
At the merchant's store, Nanaka runs into a strange noble who has bought up the whole trove of tomes. As she heads back empty-handed and forlorn, she finds herself under attack by bandits. Ruka arrives to save her in the nick of time, and the two of them decide to head for the Canyon Cavern.
  
## Subtitle: Ignoble Intentions
  
**Narration：**  
Nanaka makes her way alone to the shop of a merchant she frequents.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Meow-llo~!  
 'Sup, merch!  
  
**Merchant：**  
Well, if it isn't the Collector! Rare to see you all the way out here.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Is it ever!  
 But with a rare trove for the taking,  
not going after it would be a betrayal of my identity!  
  
**Merchant：**  
Haha, true enough.  
I'm guessing you're after the tomes that were  
excavated in that cavern, then?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
You betcha!  
 You've got them here, right?  
  
**Merchant：**  
How you find these things out so quickly, I'll never know.  
However... This time, I'm afraid you're out of luck.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Whaaaa?!  
 B-but why?! You're kidding me!  
Deets! I need deets pronto!  
  
**Merchant：**  
Those tomes are already spoken for. Every last one.  
  
**Merchant：**  
Some fancy noble from the capital snatched 'em all up.  
At a price folk like us couldn't hope to match.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
They bought the whole trove?!  
  
**???：**  
Excuse me.  
  
**Merchant：**  
Speak of the devil—that's him right there.  
Please, come in!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
This guy?!  
 Wahey! This is my chance to strike!  
Greetings, fair traveler.  
  
**Noble：**  
Do you need something from me?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Weeell... Thing is, I'm trying to become a magical girl,  
and I heard about these tomes from the Canyon Cavern...  
If you could spare even one, I'd be sooo grateful~! ♪  
  
**Noble：**  
...  
  
**Noble：**  
If that is truly your aim, shouldn't you train your magic  
instead of hunting after old books? Goodbye.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Wh-what an elegant evasion!  
Is this the power of born-and-bred nobility?!  
  
**Noble：**  
Merchant, did you procure the item I requested?  
  
**Merchant：**  
Yep, right here! It's all yours!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hmm? That looks like...  
 a guide to deciphering ancient runes?  
Why would a noble be buying a book like that in person?  
  
**Noble：**  
...Hmm. Very good. Thank you, sir.  
Take your payment, and a little extra on top.  
 You've earned it.  
  
**Merchant：**  
Well, I'll be!  
 I really do appreciate it!  
Come back anytime!  
  
**Noble：**  
Well then, good day.  
...  
To you as well, young miss.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hmm? I could swear I just sensed something  
raaather nasty in his gaze.  
 How weird.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Well, whatever!  
 Aww, man. All this way for nothing.  
Maybe I oughtta sign up for that job with Anna...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
But I did promise I'd meet up with Ruka, so I guess that's next.  
And Anna said she'd head that way after work, too!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
The village should be just down this road, right?  
Well then, let's get going!  
  
**Villain：**  
Hey, girlie.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Aww, man. How long a walk's this gonna be?  
 I hope it's not far...  
  
**Villain：**  
Hey, you deaf or somethin'?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Still, I gotta wonder, how'm I gonna get my waifus back now?  
I'm no Annie-girl, but a bounty to hunt wouldn't hurt right now...  
  
**Villain：**  
Hey, you! I know you can hear me!  
I'm tellin' you to stop right there!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Can't hear you with these bananas in my ears~!  
Neener neener! Catch me if you can!  
  
**Villain：**  
After her, boys! Arrows at the ready!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
As if an arrow or two could stop the great Nanaka...  
Wait, who brought the whole circus?!  
So many clowns! And they're all firing arrows!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Awawah! And what kinda psycho aims for the head?!  
Eek! Wa-wawahhhh!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Aieeeeee!  
 Somebody heeeeeeelp!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Helping's what I'm here for.  
...What's this? I did think that scream sounded familiar.  
So it was you, Nanaka.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
R-R-Rukaaaa!  
 Help, help, heeeelp!  
  
**Villain：**  
Look, there's two of 'em now! Everyone open fire!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Nanaka! Lend me your magic!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Copy that!  
 Enchant!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Wind magic? Well, that's perfect!  
Haaahhh!  
  
**Villain：**  
She blew them all off course?! You're kiddin' me!  
  
**Ruka：**  
What's wrong? That all you've got?  
If so, you'll be the next ones flying through the air.  
Hope that works for you.  
  
**Villain：**  
Wh-why, you...!  
R-retreat! We need to regroup!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
See ya, suckers!  
 Run back home to mommy!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Whew, that was a close one.  
You saved my hide, Ruka! I could kiss ya!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
When they surrounded me, I thought I was in for  
a guerilla Magical Girl Nanaka photoshoot!  
Then it started raining spiky arrows!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Sounds like quite the ordeal.  
What about those tomes? Did you get them?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ahhh... That's the other thing.  
This funny old noble fella snatched up the whole bunch!  
  
**Ruka：**  
A noble?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Yep. A real snooty, look-down-the-nose-atcha type, too.  
I ran into him at the merchant's store.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
And then, not long after I left, those thugs came after me...  
Wait, huh? Why *did* they attack me, anyway?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Did you speak with that noble?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Um, lessee. I asked if he could spare any of the  
tomes from the Canyon Cavern,  
 but he just ignored me.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Oh, come to think of it, he was making shifty eyes at me...  
Wait, d'you think he sent them?! For reals?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
The Canyon Cavern... As I thought, that place is the root of all this.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Nanaka. This is a bigger deal than we thought.  
Use your magic to get in touch with Mitsuki and Eriko, would you?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Once that's done, let's head for the cavern.  
I'm worried about the others.
