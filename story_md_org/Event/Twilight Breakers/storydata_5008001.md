# Village of Despair
Ruka makes short work of a thug in the village, but the villagers become angry with her, fearing that the villains will take their revenge.

## Subtitle: Village of Despair
  
**Narration：**  
After parting with {player} and the others, Ruka arrives  
at the entrance to the village. The area is bathed in an eerie,  
unnerving silence, but she nonetheless makes her way inside.  
  
**Ruka：**  
This must be the village that man was talking about.  
But I have to say...  
  
**Old Man：**  
...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...  
  
**Ruka：**  
While they do look interested in an outsider like me,  
nobody's saying a word. What's wrong with them?  
  
**Ruka：**  
All the shops are shuttered tight. And what's more...  
  
**Ruka：**  
I don't see a single young man. Are they all busy somewhere?  
  
**Villain：**  
Hey! I know you're in there, dumbasses!  
Time to cough up all the food you've got!  
  
**Woman：**  
O-of course. This is all we have. Take it...  
  
**Villain：**  
A likely story! Got some stashed away, don'tcha?  
See? What's this loaf of bread?!  
  
**Woman：**  
P-please, I beg you! I need this bread!  
My child is starving half to death!  
  
**Villain：**  
Who asked what your dumb kid wants?  
Did I say \"all the food you've got,\" or didn't I?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
I think that's quite enough.  
  
**Villain：**  
Ehhh?! Who the hell? Get lost, woman!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Well now.  
  
**Villain：**  
The heck?!  
 Tch... Take this!  
  
**Ruka：**  
What's wrong? You don't seem to be hitting me.  
  
**Villain：**  
Damn you...!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Very amateurish. Try harder next time!  
  
**Villain：**  
Gebuaagghh?!  
  
**Villain：**  
Wh-what's the big idea?!  
Don't you know what defying me means around these parts?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
No, and I don't care.  
If it's food you're after, you can have the rocks on the ground.  
Now take them and leave!  
  
**Villain：**  
Why, you little...! You're gonna regret this!  
  
**Ruka：**  
I rather doubt that.  
Now then. Are you all right?  
  
**Woman：**  
O-oh no! What have you done?!  
Ahhh... What will become of us now?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
...Well, that's an odd reaction.  
Did you *want* him to take your last loaf of bread?  
  
**Woman：**  
You don't know the first thing about our struggles here!  
Aaahhhh...  
  
**Old Man：**  
Young miss. Please try to forgive this mother's ingratitude.  
Our situation is not so simple.  
  
**Old Man：**  
All the residents of this village  
have had family members taken hostage by that man's companions.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hostages?  
  
**Woman：**  
He's from a firm conducting excavation work at the Canyon Cavern.  
Many men from our village went there in search of jobs...  
  
**Woman：**  
But not one of them has returned from that place.  
  
**Ruka：**  
The Canyon Cavern?  
 Isn't that...  
  
**Old Man：**  
Everyone who went to investigate vanished, too.  
We tried petitioning the capital for aid, but there's been no reply.  
  
**Old Man：**  
With our young men gone, this is a village of women and the elderly.  
There's nothing we can do but struggle to meet their demands.  
  
**Ruka：**  
...  
  
**Ruka：**  
These villains sound more rotten than I imagined.  
So that thug was just one of their grunts...  
  
**Ruka：**  
I'm worried about Anna and {player},  
so I'd better head to that canyon right away.  
  
**Old Man：**  
Young lady, you should leave this village at once.  
They will surely return to take revenge.  
  
**Ruka：**  
I'll leave the village, but not to run from danger.  
Some friends of mine were heading for that cavern.  
  
**Ruka：**  
While I'm there, perhaps I can help your fellow villagers.  
For starters, I'll scout the place out—  
  
**???：**  
Aieeeeee! Somebody heeeeeeelp!  
  
**Ruka：**  
...?! What now?
