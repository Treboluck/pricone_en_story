**Stechpalm：**  
A fearsome boss battle awaits! Come, let us spend our tickets well!  
If at first we do not prevail, we can use more boss tickets  
to continue the fight!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
And yet, even when it falls, the beast returns without delay...  
Heheheh. Then I will send it to oblivion a thousand times!  
Follow me, Sigurd!
