Ruka, Anna and Nanaka head out on a journey in the same direction, but with quite different goals. Little do they know that a grand battle with evil awaits!
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Heh heh heh...  
I am the one called Annerose von Stechpalm!  
Better known as Hecate of the Gale!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Stricken by the curse of poverty, Anna seeks work in a distant cavern.  
She walks off into the sunset, never to be seen again... The End.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Nanaka! Don't foretell my impending doom!  
It's true that I have financial troubles...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
However, behold this message!  
By the will of this call for aid, my woes will surely be vanquished!  
Heh heh heh... My fortunes are blessed by fate.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
In other words,  
 you found a flyer for a sweet part-time job!  
So it's all good!  
  
**Ruka：**  
You two certainly seem lively as usual.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Oho! The boss lady is here!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Please don't call me that... Still, what a coincidence.  
To think we all have business in the same direction.
