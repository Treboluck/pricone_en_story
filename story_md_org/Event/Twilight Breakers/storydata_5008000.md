# A Stormy Outing
The members of Twilight Caravan set out for the same canyon—Anna to find work, Nanaka to obtain a rare book, and Ruka just for a walk. On the way, they run into a young man who begs them for help, so Ruka takes a detour to save his village, and the three agree to meet up afterwards.

**Narration：**  
Today, {player} is accompanying Anna on a long hike  
that will take them quite some way from Landosol.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Urgh... We've walked a long way,  
but I don't see anything that looks like a canyon...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
They say you can't fight on an empty stomach,  
and it's true that I don't feel capable of much right now. Urghhh...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Still, it can't be much farther.  
When we reach the Canyon Cavern, all our woes will be solved!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
This may be an arduous quest, but let us endure, Sigurd!  
We must have faith that this flyer will be our salvation!

**Narration：**  
A few hours earlier...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Curses! The mighty Hecate of the Gale,  
reduced to hunting for odd jobs for cash?!  
Never have I felt such shame!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
To think the criminal activity near Landosol  
would die down like this all of a sudden.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
With no bounties to hunt, I am stripped of my source of income...  
Surely not all the evildoers could have reformed so easily!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Hmm? What's that, Sigurd? Some kind of flyer?  
You want me to read it? Let's see now...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
\"Three meals a day! Residence provided!  
With our friendly on-the-job training program,  
you'll feel right at home in this workplace!\"  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Wh-what is this heavenly-sounding job offer?!  
Can such a part-time job really exist?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Where is it located?!  
The \"Canyon Cavern\"? Not a place I've heard of...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Sigurd. I've decided to apply for this position.  
With such good work conditions, I may have to hurry to beat the rush!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I want to work there too.  
**Choice: (2)**  Sounds suspicious. I'll go with you.  
`Tag 1`  
**Stechpalm：**  
I see!  
 In that case, I may even be able to claim  
the \"Refer-a-Friend Bonus\" mentioned here!  
An extra 5,000 rupies per day? It's like a dream!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Stechpalm：**  
There's no such thing as a free lunch, you say?  
Hahahah! What a worrywart you are, Sigurd!  
Very well—then let us go forth together!  
  
`Tag 3`

**Stechpalm：**  
Urgh... Really, though, are we still not there yet?  
This is wearing me out...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
What's this I see? Annie-girl?  
And if it isn't {player}, too!  
 My bro!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Oh! That voice can only belong to my comrade-in-arms, Nanaka!  
Could it be... you too came to apply for this job?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Job?  
 No, no, I'm on the hunt for old tomes.  
A trove of them was unearthed in the Canyon Cavern!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
And what's more, they're supposed to have a bunch of SSR info inside!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Which means, people may buy 'em at a high price!  
Gueheheh! Smell that? That's the scent of riches for the taking!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Do you have the money to buy them?  
`Tag 4`  
**Nanaka：**  
You better believe I do!  
Urgh... I had to pawn my whole figure collection for the occasion...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
But I'll make big bank on this investment,  
and then my waifus will be mine again!  
Hang in there, my pretties!  
  
**Ruka：**  
I thought I heard a commotion... So it was you two.  
And even {player}'s here? What's the big occasion?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Oho? Ruka?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Why, it really is Ruka! What brings you here?  
  
**Ruka：**  
I was taking a break from my walk for a nap.  
I like to go for strolls  
here and there across the continent.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Someone's got too much free time...  
Wait, does that mean you're hunting for leads on the Twilight City?  
Wowzers! You're an inspiration, Boss Lady!  
  
**Ruka：**  
I've told you to stop calling me that...  
And you could try searching a bit harder yourselves.  
So? What are you three up to?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Well, actually...  
This might be a bit of a long story, but...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Let's hear it within 140 characters! ♪  
  
**Villain：**  
Hold it! You're not gettin' away!  
  
**Man：**  
Urgh...!  
  
**Ruka：**  
What's this?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Did we just trigger a special event?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
They seem to be heading this way...  
  
**Man：**  
Arghhh... Is this the end of the line?!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I think we should help that man.  
`Tag 5`  
**Ruka：**  
Good grief. Well, I can't argue with you, {player}.  
Hey, fella! Get yourself behind me!  
  
**Man：**  
Th... thank you so much!  
  
**Villain：**  
Who're you punks? Friends of this guy?! Then you're in for it too!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Friends? Hardly. We don't even know what this is about.  
If this man is a villain, we'll hand him over. How's that sound?  
  
**Villain：**  
Shut your trap or I'll shut it for you! Take this!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh, do be quiet.  
  
**Villain：**  
Guahhh!  
  
**Ruka：**  
That won't leave a mark. So be thankful.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Wowee! As magnificent a trouncing as ever!  
Like an IRL heroine!  
  
**Villain：**  
Dammitall! You'll pay for this!  
  
**Man：**  
Ahhh... Thank you so much for your help!  
  
**Ruka：**  
You're not hurt, are you?  
  
**Man：**  
No, I'm absolutely fine.  
 But the village is another story...!  
  
**Man：**  
I'm begging you! Please come and help our village!  
It's just a few miles down this road!  
  
**Man：**  
I'm on my way to deliver a petition for aid to the capital!  
Until help arrives, please lend them your strength!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Wait, I never signed up for—!  
...And he's gone.

**Ruka：**  
Well, I guess I've been roped in.  
But this does sound like quite a serious situation. Care to come along?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Umm... I'm guessing they need help right away?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hmmm... It *is* a magical girl's duty to vanquish evil,  
but can't I get my hands on those tomes first...?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I too have a job to do, and I cannot afford to keep them waiting.  
Besides which, my abilities are impaired until I can fill my stomach...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I'm sorry, Ruka. Sigurd and I will join you as soon as our work is done,  
so please head to the village ahead of us.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Mega sorry, Ruka!  
 I'll finish up my work at the speed of light too!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Understood. You two take care of what you have to do.  
  
**Ruka：**  
And {player}, do what you can to support them.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Good luck at the village, Ruka.  
`Tag 6`  
**Ruka：**  
Thank you. And with that, I'll see you later!

`image display end`  
**Ruka：**  
Well, I'm sure I can handle this on my own.  
  
**Narration：**  
And so Ruka set out alone to save the village in peril,  
while Nanaka rushed off to see a merchant about some rare tomes,  
and Anna and {player} headed for the Canyon Cavern.
