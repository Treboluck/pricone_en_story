When the villains find themselves outmatched, their noble mastermind appears, declaring himself king and activating the ancient weapon they excavated. But with a little help from {player}'s power, the members of Twilight Caravan face it down fearlessly and seize their victory.
  
## Subtitle: A Superweapon Awakens
  
**Narration：**  
Their hearts burning with the spirit of righteous vengeance,  
the Twilight Caravan members make their way to the Canyon Cavern.  
  
**Foreman：**  
Huh...?! It's them!  
Hey! The mage girl and her wimpy meat shield are back!  
  
**Eriko：**  
\"Wimpy meat shield\"?  
I will not stand for such flagrant disrespect for my love...!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
So they're the ones who hurt Anna and {player}?!  
You're in for a world of hurt, maggots!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Eriko, Nanaka, try to restrain yourselves a little longer.  
We should get all these lowlifes out of the cavern first.  
Where's the fun in crushing only a few of them?  
  
**Wanted Criminal：**  
These are the ones we get a bonus for defeating?  
Ooh, I think I see the Living Storm! This'll be fun!  
  
**Villain：**  
Heheheh... Time to make a quick buck!  
  
**Foreman：**  
Deserters! You've got some nerve crawling back here!  
Did you see the error of your ways and return to grovel in apology?  
  
**Foreman：**  
Hmph! Your crimes warrant the harshest of punishments!  
However, we're no heartless villains.  
  
**Foreman：**  
If you all swear to repent and make amends  
by working harder than ever before,  
we're willing to let you live!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Spare us your lies, fiend!  
You will pay for your atrocities at the hands of Hecate of the Gale!  
  
**Foreman：**  
What did you say...?!  
Big words for a brat, but you'll live to regret 'em!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Well, well. The weakest dogs do bark loudest.  
You're so busy yipping, you don't see your own demise approaching.  
  
**Ruka：**  
I'll only say this once, so listen well! With this blade I hold,  
I'll see that none of you villains see the light of day again!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Anna! Eriko! Mitsuki! Nanaka!  
Move out! Give these crooks hell!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee...  
 Tell me, why are you trying to retreat?  
Running from your fate will only prolong your hellish suffering.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Could it be that you are trying to assist me  
by working to maximize your own agony?  
  
**Eriko：**  
As if such kindness could begin to make up for what you've done.  
Disgusting maggots. Die, die, die, die, die, die, die...!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Eriko, dear. Can you try to leave a few scraps of flesh behind?  
I need them for my experiments.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Yahaaaah!  
 Let's take out the trash!  
Ora ora ora ora ora oraaaaaaa!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
You may have the honor of being extinguished by my  
Ultimate Magick of Infinite Annihilation!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Reflect upon your sins as the flames of purgatory consume you!  
Haaaahhhh!  
  
**Wanted Criminal：**  
Guahh! D-dammit,  
 what are these people?!  
They're too strong!  
  
**Villain：**  
W-w-we're no match for them!  
 Guaaaaghhh!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Now now, you guys. I appreciate the enthusiasm,  
but leave some for me, won't you?  
  
**Noble：**  
My, what a ruckus.  
 What are you all playing at out here?  
  
**Foreman：**  
M-my liege!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
There you are, snake!  
Guys! That man's their leader!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ah! From the merchant's store...  
I knew it. He *was* the one who attacked me!  
  
**Noble：**  
Show some respect, commoners.  
You are standing before this world's new king.  
  
**Eriko：**  
King?  
 This worm is more entertaining than the others.  
All the better for stomping on.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Hmph. Your fancy machinations end here! Give it up!  
  
**Noble：**  
My friends, I'm sure I instructed you to eliminate the deserters.  
Why do they still seem to be alive?  
  
**Foreman：**  
I'm sorry... Their strength's just out of this world!  
  
**Noble：**  
\"Out of this world,\" hmm?  
 Then I suppose you must not be  
familiar with the kind of strength this world holds.  
  
**Noble：**  
Worry not, however!  
 As king of the new world,  
I will grant you a glimpse of what real power looks like!  
  
**Noble：**  
'Tis only right that I fulfill my duty as a noble.  
 Hahahah!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Wh-what a creepo!  
I know his type. This guy's rotten to the core!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Ruka. Judging from his attitude,  
he likely still has some trick up his sleeve.  
  
**Ruka：**  
So it would seem.  
For the moment, let's watch and see what he's planning.  
  
**Noble：**  
Have you heard of the creatures known as Starbeasts?  
Monstrous beings that dominated this continent in a bygone age?  
  
**Noble：**  
Their power far exceeded that of humanity,  
and many warriors fell powerless before their might.  
However, humans are tenacious beings.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
What's this? The ground is shaking...  
  
**Noble：**  
Over many months and years, humans constructed a certain weapon  
to slay the Starbeasts! It's an old fairy tale, you see.  
  
**Noble：**  
However! This tale has roots in reality!  
  
**Noble：**  
After years of slumber, that weapon has been reawakened! By me!  
Just now, I finished deciphering the ancient tomes!

**Nanaka：**  
Gueeeehhhh?! Wh-what *is* that thing?!  
I think... it's alive!  
  
**Noble：**  
Behold! A beauty, isn't it?!  
And with me as its registered master,  
it will move exactly as I command!  
  
**Noble：**  
After I've eliminated you, we'll pay a visit to Landosol.  
  
**Noble：**  
When I defeat the royals, the people will demand a new ruler!  
Commoners can only live under a higher power's protection!  
  
**Noble：**  
And their glorious new sovereign  
 will be me!  
A new nation, one that exists for my sake alone, will be born!  
  
**Noble：**  
And thus, from that moment,  
the curtains will rise upon a magnificent new world!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Urghhhh!  
Did you see that blast?! One clean hit and we'd be mincemeat!  
  
**Foreman：**  
M-m-my liege?!  
 Your faithful servants are still here!  
  
**Noble：**  
And? What use are pawns that cannot fulfill orders?!  
You can be target practice for my first test drive! Hahahahah!  
  
`image display end`  
**Choice: (1)**  Come over here, guys!  
**Choice: (2)**  We should run, guys!  
`Tag 1`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Sigurd?!  
 Ah... I see!  
You wish to lend us your power! How marvelous!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Get hype!  
 The OP buffmeister is in da house!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Stechpalm：**  
No, my Zweiritter, we must stand our ground!  
I will protect you, no matter the cost! So let us fight together as one!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
That's right!  
 You should power us up!  
A buff or two from your ability, and we'll be OHKOing this loser!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mitsuki：**  
A fine idea. Please do go ahead!  
  
**Eriko：**  
How I've longed for this moment, my love!  
  
**Ruka：**  
You're always here right when we need you.  
  
**Ruka：**  
With such a large enemy, there's no need to hold back.  
Give us all the power you can spare!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Whoaaaa...!  
 Thank you, Sigurd! I will not waste it!  
The countdown to oblivion is upon us!  
Evil Eye, Open! Metamorphosis: Annihilation Forme!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Yeahhh! Go go go!  
Crush! Smash!  
 Booty bash!  
 Wahahahahah!  
  
**Noble：**  
Wh-what are you people?! You're coming this way?!  
Does my colossal minion not terrify you?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh, this precious idiot. So foolish it makes me sick...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
As if it makes any difference how scary that monster might be.  
  
**Noble：**  
Shut uuuuup! Shut up, shut up, shut up!  
My new weapon is unstoppable!  
Your ragtag band will be crushed to smithereens!

**Ruka：**  
Hey, Mr. Noble. As a little gift before you die,  
let me give you a word of advice.  
  
**Ruka：**  
You should never have laid a dirty finger on our friend.  
It's too late now to grovel and repent.  
  
`image display end`  
![500800601.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/500800601.webp)  
**Ruka：**  
Everyone! Let's give this wretch a little demonstration!  
Show him just how angry we all are right now!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Scoping out weak points isn't exactly our style, is it?  
Let's crush the enemy with sheer force!  
  
**Noble：**  
Bahahahah! You would attack my colossus without a plan?!  
Now! Crush these insolent rebels underfoot!  
  
`image display end`  
![500800601.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/500800601.webp)  
**Mitsuki：**  
Oh? Was that supposed to be an attack?  
How disappointing.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Let me show you what a *real* attack looks like!  
  
`image display end`  
**Noble：**  
Wh-whaaagghh?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Not bad work at all, Mitsuki.  
All thanks to the power my love granted you, of course...  
  
**Eriko：**  
And now, with his love coursing through my own veins,  
there is nothing I can't destroy!  
Haaaahhhhh!  
  
**Noble：**  
Ng... Nguaaaahhhh!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
This one's... for {player}!  
Haiyaaaaaaaahhhhh!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Now, the time has come to restore my lost pride!  
Awaken, Lord of Hades to whom the dead bow!  
Rain unending destruction upon those who would defy thee!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Take this! Dragonic Demolition Burst!  
  
**Noble：**  
W-waaaaaghhhhh?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
I think it's time we finished this.  
  
**Ruka：**  
After the pain you've inflicted, you have no right to dream.  
To the flames of hell with you!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Haaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!  
  
![500800602.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/500800602.webp)  
![500800603.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/500800603.webp)  
**Noble：**  
Yeeaarghh?! Uwaaaghhh... Aaaarghhhh?!  
M-m-m-my...  my ultimate weapooooon?!  
  
`image display end`  
**Nanaka：**  
Awww yissss! That's all, folks!  
This is what we in the business call divine punishment!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Now you see the truth! This is the power of Twilight Caravan!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ruka, you were quite wonderful.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I agree. I got chills just watching you!  
But I think there's someone else who deserves proper credit.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Yes, he does.  
You were a real stunner out there,  
{player}.  
  
**Eriko：**  
I'm not sure I approve of that brazen compliment...  
But just this once, I'll let it slide.  
  
**Eriko：**  
After all, as you say, it's all thanks to {player}  
that we secured this victory!  
 Thank you, my love!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Yep yep, that's our {player} all right!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I'm always happy to vanquish evil with Sigurd by my side!  
This victory is all of ours to share!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Yes, that's right.  
Everyone, {player}, great work out there.  
  
**Ruka：**  
I'm very proud of you all.  
This concludes today's operation!
