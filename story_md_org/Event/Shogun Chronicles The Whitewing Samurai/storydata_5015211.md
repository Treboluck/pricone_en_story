**Evil Magistrate：**  
You could not lay a scratch on me before,  
yet you have come so far. I am impressed!  
  
**Monika：**  
This is the strength my comrades gave me...  
No, the strength we of Weissflügel: Landosol Branch all share!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Now, Evil Magistrate!  
It's time for you to pay the piper!  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Hah... The power of comrades, eh? I see.  
Then let me show you how fragile that strength really is!  
To arms, men!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-is that... me?!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Me and Monika are both there too!  
  
**Evil Magistrate：**  
Those comrades will be your doom!  
Now, my minions! Take the lives of these rebels!  
  
**Monika：**  
A useless ploy.  
As if true comrades would be defeated by mere impost—  
  
**Kuka：**  
Wh-which one is the real Monika?!  
Ohhh, if only I'd bought that candy just now,  
maybe I'd have been able to tell...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Maybe if I just attack both Kukas...  
...Ahhh! That would only make them both happy!  
  
**Monika：**  
D-don't start fighting among yourselves!  
So be it, then. I, on my honor as a soldier,  
will prove which of us is genuine!
