# Whitewings in Bloom
The members of Weissflügel are thrilled by the exotic atmosphere of Oedo Town. Ninon, who has visited the town before, feels that something is not quite right, but they all nonetheless find plenty to enjoy.
  
## Subtitle: Whitewings in Bloom
  
**Narration：**  
Quite some way from the city of Landosol,  
near a rushing river and a forest rich in sturdy timber,  
lies Oedo, a town heavily influenced by the far eastern nation of Togoku.  
  
**Narration：**  
As they stroll through its friendly and welcoming streets,  
{player} and the members of Weissflügel  
are taken aback by the town's exotic beauty.  
  
**Monika：**  
I-incredible...!  
 All these beautiful designs  
are unlike anything I've seen in Landosol!  
  
**Ninon：**  
This town was established as an import station for foreign resources,  
and apparently its architect  
 was a lover of Togoku culture,  
so it features a fusion of Landosol's culture and Togoku's!  
  
**Monika：**  
Togoku?  
 That's... a nation that lies far east of Landosol, correct?  
I believe the clothes you wear and strange words you sometimes use  
also come from there?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Yes!  
Togoku culture is my favorite in the whole world!  
  
**Yuki：**  
What a marvelous place.  
This scenery will surely carry my beauty to new heights! ♪  
  
**Kuka：**  
S-since it's away from the capital, it's so much quieter than Landosol.  
M-Mr. Sadist might say,  
 \"I bet I can get away with anything here,\"  
  
and drag me off into some deserted back alley... Gueheheh... *drool*...  
  
**Monika：**  
...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Of course,  
 there are sweet and delicious treats to try too! ♪  
  
**Monika：**  
R-really?!  
 Oh, ah... I-I mean...  
Sweet treats are hardly my style,  
 but I am interested in foreign cuisine!  
S-so perhaps I should try just a few!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
It's all so beautiful! Even the buildings themselves...  
It's like I've stepped into a whole different world  
full of romance!  
 ...Wait, huh?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
The men are wearing exotic clothes like Ninon's,  
but all the women are in ordinary Landosol styles.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Oh... That is strange.  
I've been to this town a few times before, and I remember  
almost all the residents wore traditional eastern clothing.  
  
**Ninon：**  
And that's not all...  
  
**Townsperson 1：**  
Look, tourists! There's a group of new tourists!  
  
**Townsperson 2：**  
Hey... Send word to District Three, pronto!  
  
**Ninon：**  
The town's atmosphere feels different from usual somehow.  
  
**Yuki：**  
With a gorgeous visitor like me, of course the atmosphere would shift!  
Now, isn't it time we got down to some leisure activities?  
  
**Monika：**  
Good point. We came here to relax, after all.  
We'd better make the most of this opportunity.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Oh, absolutely, yes!  
 Well then, allow me  
to act as your navigator and show you around town!  
Onward we go!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
This looks like...  
 a sort of curiosity shop.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ah yes, the heart of Togoku!  
You can find all sorts of amazing toys and accessories here!  
  
**Monika：**  
It's all so very strange. Thick playing cards with pictures,  
discs upon sticks, intricate wooden dolls......Ahh?!  
Th-this doll just moved!  
  
**Ninon：**  
That is a mechanical doll!  
Rather than magic, it moves by clockwork!  
Advanced models can even bring tea to customers, I hear!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
That really does sound impressive!  
 Togoku must be home to  
some amazing engineers.  
 Oh, look at this tube!  
I thought it was a telescope, but it's full of colorful patterns!  
  
**Monika：**  
The patterns shift as the tube rotates... A clever trick using  
mirrors, I presume!  
 By the way, where's our self-absorbed friend?  
I thought mirrors would be Yuki's area of interest...  
  
**Kuka：**  
That's a good question...  
Oh, over there! Looks like Yuki's inspecting those Togoku mirrors.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Ahhh... This is a day for celebration.  
Never have I witnessed such a wondrous sight...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Yes!  
 Mirrors from Togoku, called \"wa-kagami,\" are very popular!  
  
**Yuki：**  
My visage in this exotic glass...  
This...  
 this beauty is simply magical...  
  
**Monika：**  
Um... I think it's the reflection in the mirror  
that's gotten Yuki excited.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Y-Yuki really never does change, huh?  
  
**Ninon：**  
This is a place to experience the ninja arts!  
It might be  
 my favorite spot in all of Oedo!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
N-ninja arts?  
Those are the strange techniques you use when fighting, right?  
  
**Ninon：**  
That is correct!  
 The arts of the eastern ninja, when fully mastered,  
can even tame the fabled Frog King that leaps over mountains!  
  
**Kuka：**  
D-does that mean if I mastered the ninja arts,  
I could summon my own ferocious plant monster  
to entrap me with its vines all day long...?!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Training bores me,  
but if I could teach a light-attuned monster  
to highlight my best side at all times...  
  
**Monika：**  
My knowledge may be limited, but I feel sure I can say...  
No ninja has ever come up with techniques like those!  
Ayumi, what ninja arts would you be interested in?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I-I'm not very good with battles,  
so special techniques aren't really my thing...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Today's ninja workshop includes  
techniques for walking on water, shuriken darts,  
 and...  
the elemental arts  
 used by ninja to conceal themselves.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Ninja arts for hiding from people?!  
Tell me more about those!  
  
**Monika：**  
Th-that was a sudden change of heart!  
  
**Ninon：**  
B-but they're just for distracting people's attention  
or trailing a target... They're not  
 really much fun.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Th-that's exactly what I'm looking for!  
I'll master those arts no matter how many years it takes!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
If I could hide like a real ninja,  
I might be able to watch over him  
from all angles, not just from behind!  
  
**Monika：**  
I... I sense some traces of ill intent,  
but perhaps I shouldn't pry too deeply.  
  
**Ninon：**  
This shop sells all kinds of books!  
Books from Togoku are intricately designed,  
 both inside and out!  
  
**Kuka：**  
W-wow, these Oedo bookshops  
stock some positively indecent content...  
I think I'll buy this in secret to read when no one's around...  
 Gueheheh...  
  
**Monika：**  
What's this Samurai Road book? Ah, an introduction to Togoku culture.  
\"Samurai are proud and refined Togoku warriors. To unify the nations  
and bring peace, they serve their kings, the shogun...\"  
 Wait, \"shogun\"?!  
  
**All：**  
Whaaaaaaa?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I-isn't \"shogun\" the title that Ninon  
always uses to address {player}?!  
  
**Yuki：**  
B-but that means...  
You were a king from Togoku all along?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  No, she just calls me that.  
`Tag 1`  
**Ninon：**  
My shogun is the one true shogun!  
His conquest is not complete,  
 but even now his noble character  
brings peace and smiles to us all!  
  
**Monika：**  
Haha...  
 I see, I see.  
I suppose that would make you a fine shogun indeed.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Oh, if you're interested in Togoku culture,  
why not start with the clothing?!  
This town has many clothing rental shops!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-is that true...?!  
As a dancer, I was quite intrigued by all those lovely fabrics.  
I wonder what they'd feel like to wear...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Then come on, Kuka!  
 Let's get changed together!  
I always wanted to try a real ninja costume!  
  
**Kuka：**  
N-no, ah...  
I was only a little curious, really...  
I'd be fine just holding them up in a mirror or something...  
  
**Ninon：**  
In Togoku, there is an ancient saying: \"Hurry up and do it!\"  
Hesitation only leads to regret!  
Come on, let's all go to the clothing rental shop!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-I'm sure that's a very wise saying,  
but I don't think I feel ready to wear such beautiful robes...  
O-oh, spare me!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Heheheh. I brought an outfit that will suit you well!  
Come on, try it on right here and now!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Urgh... I've come too far to turn back...  
Still, though, this belt is quite difficult to tie...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Haha. They seem to be having fun in the fitting room.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Don't you guys want to try anything on?  
`Tag 2`  
**Monika：**  
I'm fine with my usual attire.  
Practicality is my goal, after all.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
W-wearing such bright and conspicuous clothes  
would be a sort of issue for my hobbies...  
  
**Yuki：**  
I never fail to coordinate my outfit  
to complete my beauty on that particular day.  
And alas, eastern clothes are not what call me today! ♪  
  
**Ninon：**  
Everyone, sorry for the wait!

**Ninon：**  
Heheheh. How do I look, Shogun?!  
Behold the new Ninja Ninon and...  
  
**Kuka：**  
K-Kimono Kuka...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You look great in that ninja outfit, Ninon.  
**Choice: (4)**  It's a bit revealing, but it suits you, Kuka.  
`Tag 3`  
**Ninon：**  
Oh! Thank you very much!  
Wh-why is it, I wonder? When you come out  
and say those things to my face,  
 it's a little embarrassing!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Kuka：**  
Ahhh... The honest compliment and the criticism together  
mean double the embarrassment...  
 Ahh?! So that was your aim all along!  
Y-you sadist! Depraved degenerate!  
  
`Tag 5`

`image display end`  
**Monika：**  
Hm? Kuka, are you sure that belt is properly tied?  
It looks concerningly loose to me...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ahhh... I tried my very best,  
but I wasn't able to tie it very well...  
  
**Ninon：**  
A kimono belt like this is no problem for the great Ninon!  
Just slip this bit in here...  
 Then pull nice and tight!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Umm, I do appreciate the crushing constriction,  
but we're only renting this, so maybe you shouldn't pull so hard...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Kimonos need to be tied very tight or they come undone!  
Hmm, this isn't going very well...  
Shogun! Can you pull with me from the other side?  
  
**Ninon：**  
All right then!  
 On one, two, three!  
  
**Ninon：**  
...we'll pull as hard as we can, OK?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Oops...  
`Tag 6`  
**Kuka：**  
Eek!  
M-Mr. Sadist gave my belt a hefty tug on his own!

![501500102.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/501500102.webp)  
**Monika：**  
C-could this be...?! I read about this deed in that \"Samurai Road\" book!  
A famed technique of nefarious evil magistrates!  
The spinning belt maneuver!  
  
**Kuka：**  
O... Ohhhhh myyyyyyy!  
  
**Monika：**  
Wh-what overwhelming torque!  
  
![501500103.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/501500103.webp)  
**Kuka：**  
I-if you spin me this fast...  
I think... I think...  
  
**Monika：**  
K-Kuka!  
You're spinning all the way outside!

**Kuka：**  
I think... I'm going to leave the ground!  
  
`image display end`  
`image display end`  
**Kuka：**  
Mr. Sadist sent me whirling through a gauntlet of agony...  
Ohhh, I've never felt better! ♪  
  
**Monika：**  
W-well...  
If she enjoyed it so much,  
 I suppose that's fine!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so, the group continued their thrilling tour  
of Oedo's shopping district.
