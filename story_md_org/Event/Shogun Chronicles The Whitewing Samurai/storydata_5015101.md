When a cry for help rings out in the old town, the wings of white must rise up to deliver justice! If the shogun can't vanquish evil, who will?!
  
**Ninon：**  
The ninja outfit I always wanted!  
The shuriken I throw today  
 will be extra sharp!  
Shwip-shwip-shwip-shwip!  
  
**Monika：**  
D-don't throw shuriken around civilians!  
  
**Kuka：**  
These clothes are beautiful, but not so easy to walk in...  
 Ahh?!  
O-  
of course... Mr. Sadist will drag me away, saying...  
 \"Can't run from me  
in that, can you?\"  
 Powerless before him,  
 I'll be... I'll be...!  
  
**Monika：**  
Kuka, that's quite enough!  
...  
Dear me,we came to this tourist town to enjoy ourselves,  
so why must everything be such a struggle?

**All Three：**  
Coming soon—

**Monika：**  
I must say, it's strange that no one's commented  
on the commotion we're causing.  
Is there something amiss in this town?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hmm?! That sounds like a lurking threat terrorizing the peace!  
I can't allow such villainy to go unpunished!  
You're under ninja arrest!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Wh-why are you trying to grab me—?  
 Ohhhhh myyyy!
