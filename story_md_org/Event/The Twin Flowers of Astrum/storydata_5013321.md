GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Lou：**  
Eeeeeek! Stop it!  
Don't chase me around!  
  
**Grea：**  
Get down, Lou!  
Haaahhh!  
  
**Gigas：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Grea：**

What's with this Gigas?!

**Anne：**  
You're right!  
We probably shouldn't attack while it's defending itself!  
It might use that opportunity to launch a counter!  
  
**Grea：**  
Okay, got it!  
Let's find the right timing and strike it all at once!
