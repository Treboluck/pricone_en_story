The party discovers the rift responsible for the distortions at the peak of the mountain. After jumping in, they defeat a Gigas which holds the magic crystal's core, allowing Anne and co. to finally return to Rivenbrandt.
  
## Subtitle: An Unstoppable Alliance
  
**Narration：**  
The party finally arrives at the peak of the mountain.  
  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whoa!  
It's so bright out here... ☆  
I can barely keep my eyes open!  
  
**Grea：**  
...!  
Anne! The rift is right at the center of that light!  
  
**Anne：**  
You're right!  
The core fragment has to be in there!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let's have {player} power us up, then jump in!  
It's just low enough that we should be able to make it!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Right. Here we go!  
  
**Lou：**  
Oof...  
This place is weird...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Is it safe for us to proceed any further?  
  
**Anne：**  
I can't say for sure, but...  
We need to do something about this rift, or else the world will be in danger!  
  
**Lou：**  
That, and we wanna get back to Rivenbrandt.  
  
**Grea：**  
We've ventured pretty far in,  
but the scenery hasn't changed a bit...  
  
**Anne：**  
There's no doubt we're getting close to the core, at least.  
  
**Lou：**  
Um...  
We're done here once we find the core, right?  
  
**Anne：**  
Not quite.  
It's likely the core itself has become a powerful Gigas.  
So we'll have to defeat it first.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We'll fight alongside you, no matter the opponent!  
After all, we've got {player}'s power to help us!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It's as she says.  
We're relying on you, my lord.  
  
**Anne：**  
Thanks!  
That said... It's kind of sad that we'll have to part ways here.  
  
**Lou：**  
Yeah.  
But who knows! Maybe the magic crystal will go wild again sometime!  
We might just meet again!  
  
**Anne：**  
Hehe. Yeah!  
It'd be great if you guys came to Rivenbrandt next time.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That is quite the exciting thought,  
indeed.  
  
**Anne：**  
Right?!  
You could all enroll in Mysteria Academy!  
Then we'd go on trips, take part in festivals...  
No way it wouldn't be fun!  
  
**Anne：**  
And knowing how adept Karyl is at magic, she'd be a great student!  
You can learn loads of magic there, so you'd get even stronger!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm...  
That doesn't sound too bad, in all honesty.  
I wouldn't mind going someday.  
Provided there's a safe way to do so.  
  
**Grea：**  
Yeah.  
Hopefully it'll be possible at some point.  
  
**Lou：**  
We'll give you a big tour when you come!  
I'll teach you where all the best food is!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm in!  
Let's explore the food in Rivenbrandt to our hearts' content!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
How about you, my lord?  
Is there anything you would like to do in Rivenbrandt?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'd love to try the monster cuisine there.  
**Choice: (2)**  Becoming a student sounds nice.  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Same here!  
A gourmet trip to another world...  
How crazy is that?! ☆  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
It does indeed.  
We could eat together, do homework together...  
Just the thought gives me pangs of excitement.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Anne：**  
Guess it's decided, then.  
I'll look into safe ways to travel to another world once we get back!  
  
**Grea：**  
This really does sound exciting,  
I hope we get to show you around someday.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whoa?! Wh-why's the ground shaking out of nowhere?!  
Is it an earthquake?!  
  
**Anne：**  
The magic is gathering into one spot!  
Be careful, everyone!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Haaahhh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Take this!  
Yaaahhh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Kokkoro! Karyl!  
I'll be right there!  
Hi-yaaahhh!  
  
**Gigas：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Now's our chance, everyone!  
Pile on!  
  
**Anne：**  
Right. Leave it to us, Pecorine!  
Grea, Lou! Let's take it down swiftly with one simultaneous attack!  
  
**Lou：**  
Okay! I'm good to go!  
  
**Grea：**  
Anne, Lou. This is it.  
Let's help protect this world and everyone in it!  
  
**Anne：**  
And once we have, we're going back to Rivenbrandt!  
Give it all you've goooooot!  
  
**Anne & Grea & Lou：**  
HAAAAAAHHH!  
  
**Gigas：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Lou：**  
W-we did it!  
Especially me!  
  
**Grea：**  
Yup. That was good work, Lou.  
  
**Grea：**  
Oh. This stone here's overflowing with magic...  
Is this what we were looking for?  
  
**Anne：**  
Yup, no doubt about it.  
That's the core fragment!  
  
**Lou：**  
S-so that's it?  
We can go back to Rivenbrandt now?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Good stuff, everyone!  
Teamwork's what helped us pull that off!  
  
**Anne：**  
Yeah!  
We're the unstoppable alliance!  
  
**Grea：**  
Yeah, it felt great.  
I'm so glad we were able to help protect this world.  
  
**Grea：**  
Having to part ways doesn't feel so great, though...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I know what you mean...  
Especially after we've gotten so close.  
It really is a shame.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But hey! You've got the core,  
so you can finally go back home!  
  
**Anne：**  
Yeah... And it's all because of you guys.  
Thank you so, so much!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Bit too early for the soppy goodbyes, you two!  
This place is about to crumble!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's not good!  
Let's get out of here!  
  
**Lou：**  
Waugh!  
But where's the exit?!  
  
**Narration：**  
After much panicking,  
the crew managed to escape from the rift.
