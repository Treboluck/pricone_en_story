## Subtitle: The Mount Gastros Hike Begins!
  
**Narration：**  
{player} and the Gourmet Guild crew find themselves  
at a certain mountain after hearing rumors of  
a rare ingredient that can be found there.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Apparently you can find all sorts of special ingredients here.  
Sure is exciting, isn't it, Karyl? ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Even better,  
there's rumors of an ultra rare ingredient, too.  
Hee hee. I can't wait to find it. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah, you've told us a thousand times.  
So chill out and wipe that drool off your face!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ah, sorry. It just kind of happens when I think of delicious food!  
And now I'm faced with the prospect of us  
finding something ultra delish at the peak of the mountain. ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please wipe your mouth with this tissue, Miss Pecorine.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh! Thanks so much, Kokkoro!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This handkerchief is for you, my lord.  
I noticed you've worked up something of a sweat, so please make use of it.  
  
**Karyl：**  
*sigh* This is more of a picnic than actual guild work, isn't it?  
The monsters around here are supposed to be  
pretty strong, so try to be a bit more carefu—  
  
**???：**  
Waaaaaaahhhhh!  
Heeeeeelp!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-what the?!  
That was someone screaming, wasn't it?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Seems like something's going on farther up the mountain.  
Let's go check it out!  
  
**Anne：**  
Don't panic, Lou!  
Use a multi-layered incantation to cast a compound light and wind spell!  
  
**Lou：**  
C-compound?  
Multi-layered?!  
  
**Grea：**  
...  
Anne.  
You're just making her panic even more.  
  
**Anne：**  
R-really?  
Then, uh...  
This should work!  
O Spirits! Heed my call!  
  
**Gigas：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hey there! You okay?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-what the heck was that magic? I've never seen anything like it!  
Her magic reserves are off the charts, too...  
Just who in the world is she?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let's help them out, Karyl!  
Hit me up with the usual stuff, {player}. ☆  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Leave it to me!  
**Choice: (2)**  The usual stuff?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please do the same for myself and Miss Karyl too, my lord.  
Let us take this foe on together.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, you! I know you're just playing.  
But now's the time for action, so please power me up!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhh! I can feel the power surging through me!  
Time to kick some monster butt!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Listen up, Pecorine.  
Me and Koro'll keep it busy, so you take that opportunity to finish it off!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Okay-dokie!  
Don't you two worry. We're here to save the day!  
  
**Grea：**  
Huh? Who are you?  
  
**Karyl：**  
We'll save the introductions for later!  
First we gotta take care of this thing! Haaaaahhh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Allow me to follow your lead. Miss Karyl.  
Yaaahhh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine!  
Now!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Got it! Thanks!  
Down you go!  
  
**Gigas：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Anne：**  
Phew!  
...  
Huh? Looks like it dropped something.  
  
**Anne：**  
A fragment of a magical crystal?  
Then maybe...  
  
**Lou：**  
*pant, pant* *huff, puff*  
I... I was this close to becoming dinner...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Now *that's* a crazy prospect! ☆  
  
**Lou：**  
It is.  
Super crazy.  
  
**Grea：**  
...  
Do you know these people, Anne?  
  
**Anne：**  
Not at all.  
But... I might have an idea of who they are.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, the monster's taken care of, so how about we  
have some grub together?  
It'll be a good way to introduce  
ourselves, plus I'm just plain hungry. ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
This isn't the time or the place.  
That might not be the only monster lurking nearby.  
Plus, you're the only one here looking for some grub—  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hm.  
I do believe that came from your vicinity, Miss Karyl.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Q-quiet, Koro!  
I don't want any cheek from you!  
  
**Anne：**  
Hehe.  
Um, I'm actually pretty famished myself,  
so I'd love it if we could eat together!  
  
**Grea：**  
A-Anne?!  
  
**Anne：**  
Don't worry! They seem like good people!  
That, plus we might get some good leads  
on our current situation by talking to them!  
  
**Grea：**  
I mean, sure, but...  
  
**Lou：**  
I ran about a bunch, so I'm starving!  
Grub! Grub! I can't wait!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well then. Guess we can get started with introductions.  
I'm Karyl.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That's Pecorine cooking over there.  
This squirt over here is Koro...  
Err, sorry.  
Kokkoro.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It's a pleasure to meet you.  
My name is Kokkoro, a humble attendant to my lord.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Speaking of. This is {player}.  
When she says \"my lord,\" she means him.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord possesses a most mysterious power.  
It allows him to power us up at his will.  
  
**Anne：**  
Hey, that sounds cool!  
Good to meet you, Karyl and Kokkoro!  
You too, {player}.  
  
**Anne：**  
I'm Anne,  
and this is Grea!  
And this here is Lou!  
The three of us are students at Mysteria Academy...  
  
**Anne：**  
Do you... mind if I ask whether you've heard of that before?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Mysteria Academy?  
That's not ringing a bell.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I believe this is the first I've heard of it, too.  
It's certainly not a location near Astraea.  
  
**Anne：**  
I knew it.  
  
**Grea：**  
Can we get an explanation, Anne?  
  
**Anne：**  
I'll get right to the point.  
This... probably isn't Rivenbrandt.  
We might be in an entirely different world.  
  
**Grea：**  
...?!  
  
**Lou：**  
But... but Mr. Gigas was here!  
Shouldn't that mean we're on Mount Gigas?  
  
**Anne：**  
That was an entirely different magical creature.  
It turned into a magic crystal fragment, right? That should be proof enough.  
  
**Anne：**  
What's more, the fragment is from a magic crystal used for summoning.  
One that calls on a magical creature based on the user's image.  
  
**Grea：**  
I see.  
So it was a catalyst for summoning magic.  
  
**Anne：**  
Let me guess. Lou, you had Gigas on your mind while using it, didn't you?  
Probably while thinking about how fun our last trip was,  
I'd assume.  
  
**Lou：**  
Oh.  
You might be right!  
I was thinking about our trip while touching it!  
Mainly about how much more fun it was than doing that assignment!  
  
**Grea：**  
So the magic crystal picked up on that,  
resulting in it turning into Gigas...  
  
**Grea：**  
But if that's the case, then why did it attack Lou?  
  
**Karyl：**  
H-hold up!  
You're trying to tell me you came from an entirely different world?!  
No way that can be true...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Quite the unfathomable situation, indeed.  
Can travel between other worlds truly be possible?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hm...  
Think about it this way, you two.  
We've run into all sorts of mysterious things so far, haven't we?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It wouldn't be that weird if another world or two existed, would it?  
  
**Karyl：**  
You might want to apply *some* logic to your thought process, girl...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Okay.  
Let's assume,  
just for a second, that this is all true. If anything's  
going to affect the structure of someone's magic, it's coming to a whole  
new world.  
That probably led to the creature going out of control.  
  
**Grea：**  
Oh. That actually makes a lot of sense.  
Anything could happen if we're genuinely in a different world.  
  
**Karyl：**  
The big question for me, though, is how you ended up here in the first place.  
  
**Anne：**  
W-well...  
Ahaha...  
  
**Grea：**  
...  
Anne went a bit overboard.  
She poured too much magic into the crystal,  
and that seems to have led us here.  
  
**Karyl：**  
WHAT?! You can't be for real!  
Just how much magic are you packing?  
This situation just gets crazier by the second.  
  
**Anne：**  
Ehehe...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Please don't take that as a compliment.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Okay, folks!  
Sorry for the wait! Here's a special meal from a special girl!  
Dig in!  
  
**Grea：**  
...  
I...  
haven't seen a dish like this before.  
Is it even edible?  
  
**Lou：**  
*munch* *munch, munch*  
W-wow!  
It looks weird, but it's delicious!  
  
**Anne：**  
Hey, it really is!  
The crispy texture makes it fun to eat,  
and the flavor spreads all through your mouth!  
  
**Grea：**  
...  
...Oh. You're right.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heh!  
A fresh and tender monster dish, just for you all!  
  
**Grea：**  
...M-monster?  
  
**Lou：**  
Monster food, huh?  
Guess you guys eat weird things in a weird way.  
  
**Karyl：**  
As if!  
We eat normal things normally!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We, the Gourmet Guild,  
are no strangers to feasting on monsters.  
  
**Anne：**  
Creating edible meals out of monsters isn't exactly easy.  
You must be super good at cooking, Pecorine!  
  
**Grea：**  
Yeah. I'm surprised at how good it is.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Uh...  
You guys might be a bit too open to this whole eating monsters deal.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed.  
The speed at which they've adapted is rather surprising.  
  
**Anne：**  
Monster dishes are part of Rivenbrandt's culture, after all.  
That said, they're apparently super hard to cook properly.  
That makes you an amazing cook!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You sure are singing my praises. ♪  
How crazy is that? ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Anyway! There's plenty left, so feel free to dig in!  
As for dessert,  
let's make something out of that monster Lou brought along!  
  
**Grea：**  
Y-you mean Mr. Gawker?  
Mr. Gawker is Lou's friend, you know, so I'm not sure she'd appreciate that...  
  
**Lou：**  
*drool*  
I'm really curious how it would turn out.  
  
**Grea：**  
Lou?!  
Y-you're sure about that?!  
*Really* sure?!  
  
**Lou：**  
Yup!  
...  
Huh? Why're you shivering, Mr. Gawker?  
Are you that happy about being eaten? That's great! ♪  
  
**Grea：**  
Wait! You've probably got the wrong idea!  
D-don't worry, Mr. Gawker. We won't eat you!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahh. Now that hit the spot. ☆  
  
**Anne：**  
You said it. Thanks a bunch!  
That meal filled me right up.  
  
**Grea：**  
Likewise.  
Now that we've got plenty of energy,  
it's about time we start thinking about how to get back home.  
  
**Anne：**  
What if I reproduce the situation that brought us here? Think that'd work?  
I remember how I did it, so we just need the materials.  
  
**Grea：**  
By which you mean a magic crystal, right? All we've  
got is a fragment dropped by that Gigas,  
so maybe we just  
need to defeat a bunch of them and collect more fragments?  
  
**Anne：**  
Yup. I'm sensing a number of magic sources further up the mountain,  
so we can probably find more Gigases if we follow that trail!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh! You're aiming for the peak as well, are you?  
Truth is, we're looking for the ultra rare ingredient that can be  
found there!  
What a cool coincidence! ☆  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Then let's go together.  
`Tag 4`  
**Anne：**  
Really?!  
Thanks so much!  
We barely know anything about this world, so that's a big help.  
What say we get going, then?  
  
**Narration：**  
Having formed a new party together,  
they set out towards the peak of the mountain.
