# What Makes a Princess
Anne points out that Pecorine could possibly be a princess. Pecorine, however, switches the topic back to Mysteria Academy, leaving Anne and co. feeling nostalgic. A Gigas appears soon after, which the party swiftly defeats with clever teamwork.
  
## Subtitle: What Makes a Princess
  
**Narration：**  
{player} and co. have made their way to the cave Lou discovered.  
  
**Lou：**  
Look, look!  
That's the cave! And I found it!  
  
**Anne：**  
Wow,  
you're right!  
Good going, Lou!  
  
**Lou：**  
Ehehe.  
I gotta say, I'm pretty proud.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohh!  
This is the one!  
It'll lead us right to the peak, so let's get going!  
  
**Lou：**  
Wooow.  
It's really big, isn't it?  
  
**Grea：**  
...Watch out.  
There's something here that isn't too happy about our presence.  
  
**Gigas：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Another Gigas, it would seem.  
My lord! Be careful!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Protect Kokkoro.  
**Choice: (2)**  Protect Lou.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh! My lord!  
Thank you very much.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I could think of no greater happiness than being protected by my lord.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Lou：**  
Eeeeeek!  
Stay away! I'm the least tasty girl in the world!  
  
**Lou：**  
Huh?! You protected me?!  
Thanks so much!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Let me take care of this!  
Hi-yah! Haaah! Yaaahhh!  
  
**Gigas：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Grea：**  
...This isn't the first time I've thought this,  
but Pecorine really is amazing.  
  
**Anne：**  
I know, right?  
How should I put it... She's got this sort of grace to her?  
Almost like my etiquette instructors.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You think?  
I'm nothing special!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You've even got etiquette classes at Mysteria? That's wild.  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh, sorry. Those happen at the castle, not the academy.  
It's compulsory, considering my upbringing and stuff.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Castle? Upbringing?  
I assume you're of quite the high social standing, then?  
  
**Lou：**  
Of course!  
She's Mysteria's very own princess!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, I'll be. Not that it changes anything, though.  
Bit too late to do a 180 on our attitude towards you.  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh, don't sweat it!  
I'm happy continuing as is!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Cool with me. I can't say the news didn't come as a surprise,  
but I guess you do have something of a royal air about you.

**Anne：**  
Hm...  
I'd say that applies to Pecorine more than me,  
to be honest.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, Anne! Don't be silly!  
The only thing I have is an everlasting love for food!  
  
**Anne：**  
Really?  
You say that,  
but you're actually a princess yourself, aren't you?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Not at all. I'm just a regular girl.  
The perpetually peckish Pecorine!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh!  
So what kind of a life does a princess live, anyway?  
I bet the royal guard's following you around the clock!  
  
**Anne：**  
Well, around the clock is a bit of an exaggeration.  
I do have a bodyguard, though. His name's Owen.  
  
**Anne：**  
He's generally reliable, but, uh...  
He kind of overreacts and gets ahead of himself sometimes.  
Like when he made those weird sweets for our trip.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A bodyguard that also makes sweets?  
Now you've got me jealous!  
Wish I had one. ☆  
  
**Anne：**  
Ahaha!  
I bet he'd cook up any monsters you defeated and  
serve them up to you right then and there!

**Karyl：**  
Having a bodyguard seems like a pain, though.  
Doesn't it feel suffocating?  
  
**Anne：**  
Hm... I mean, I get why it's necessary, considering my position.  
But there is a part of me that doesn't  
want to just sit around and be protected,  
yeah.  
  
**Grea：**  
That's why you fled the castle and came to Mysteria Academy.  
  
**Anne：**  
Ehehe...  
Pretty much.  
I don't want to be coddled and spoiled. I want to  
stand my ground and fight. To protect those dear to me.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, well.  
That's super admirable!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Maybe things would be different for this country if I followed her example...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine?  
Is something wrong?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, uh...  
I was just thinking about how interesting Mysteria is.  
I'd love to learn more about it!  
  
**Anne：**  
Really?!  
That makes me super happy!  
Man,  
it'd be so fun if you could all come there one day.  
  
**Grea：**  
It can be a bit of a dangerous place at times, but I agree.  
  
**Anne：**  
Dangerous?  
Oh! You mean like that one time a portal to  
another world opened up and let loose a bunch of monsters?  
That fight almost wrecked the whole academy.  
  
**Grea：**  
And don't forget the time that fallen angel broke free from its seal,  
then activated a forbidden spell across the land.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yikes!  
That's more than just a bit dangerous!  
  
**Lou：**  
Well, it's totally normal for us.  
And hey! It all got resolved in the end, so no big deal!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm pretty sure it's a big deal regardless of it being solved or not...  
  
**Anne：**  
What else is there... Oh!  
There's this ancient magic library at the academy, too.  
  
**Grea：**  
It's got all sorts of spellbooks, but also forbidden tomes.  
We've run into a few issues now and then thanks to that.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Though I am somewhat afraid to hear the particulars,  
I do find myself curious at the same time.  
  
**Anne：**  
To cut a long story short, the lord of the library caused  
a big commotion and then got sealed away.  
I remember Hanna feeling responsible for all of that.  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh. Hanna's the class president at the academy.  
She's super capable and responsible. A great person all around.  
  
**Anne：**  
She and Owen must be worried sick about us right now...  
  
**Grea：**  
Yeah, I bet you're right...  
  
**Lou：**  
Hm...  
My chest feels tight all of a sudden.  
I wonder why...?  
  
**Anne：**  
Lou...  
We'd hate to be separated from them forever,  
so let's continue the Gigas hunt and get ourselves back to Rivenbrandt!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Rivenbrandt, huh...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, considering how crazy things are right now what with  
that rift and the world being in peril and stuff,  
I guess it'd only make sense if it actually exists.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, Karyl! You should learn to trust people more!  
We've got no reason to doubt them here!  
  
**Karyl：**  
They're talking about a whole different world, you know.  
That's about as farfetched as you can get.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That said... This sort of crazy stuff is starting to feel normal  
the longer I hang around with the Gourmet Guild.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Most of all, this guy right here!  
How do you manage to get through life so easily with amnesia?!  
And you're always helping other people out, too!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl.  
My lord is beyond kind.  
He will always help those in need.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That's just the sort of person he is.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hm?  
Did anyone else hear that?  
  
**Gigas：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh!  
That Gigas looks familiar!  
  
**Lou：**  
It's the one we couldn't defeat before!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Lou!  
The two of us'll distract it this time!  
Pecorine, Anne! We'll give you an opening to attack, so use it wisely!  
  
**Lou：**  
Karyl!  
O-okay! I'll give it a try!  
  
**Grea：**  
Kokkoro and I will stop it in its tracks, then.  
Let's go, Kokkoro!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Very well!  
Please assist us, my lord!  
  
**Lou：**  
Oooooohhh!  
I'm feeling good! I can do this!  
Chaaarge!  
  
**Gigas：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Good stuff, Lou! Keep it up!  
I'll hit it from the opposite direction!  
Eat this!  
  
**Grea：**  
Follow my lead, Kokkoro!  
Haaahhh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Very impressive, Miss Grea!  
Allow me to assist you! Yah!  
  
**Gigas：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Anne：**  
Leave the rest to us, everyone!  
O Spirits! Heed my call!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm joining in too! Hi-yah!  
  
**Gigas：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Lou：**  
W-we did it!  
We kicked its derriere!  
  
**Grea：**  
That was incredible teamwork.  
We're perfectly in sync at this point!  
  
**Anne：**  
Yeah! We all worked together as one!  
Okay, let's use this momentum and make a beeline for the peak!  
  
**Narration：**  
Having defeated a powerful Gigas,  
the party continued to make their way towards the peak.
