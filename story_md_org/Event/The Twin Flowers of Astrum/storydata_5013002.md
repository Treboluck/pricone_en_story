# The Dragoness and the Loyal Guide
Anne and co. work together with the Gourmet Guild crew to reach the peak of the mountain and find a way back home. They gradually learn how to work together in battle, which helps them bond further. Grea and Kokkoro particularly so, as Kokkoro understands Grea's position and feelings.
  
## Subtitle: The Dragoness and the Loyal Guide
  
**Narration：**  
Using Anne's tracing magic as a guide,  
{player} and the crew make their way  
to the peak of the mountain in search of more Gigases.  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh! Look over there!  
Another Gigas!  
  
**Grea：**  
It's a bit different from the last one, isn't it?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Probably just looks different. Let's hurry and take it down.  
Come on, {player}!  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh wow, this is amazing!  
I can feel my magic surging!  
  
**Grea：**  
Same here... That really is a strange power.  
But it's exactly what we need!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Now then, folks.  
Let's get started!  
  
**Gigas：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Anne：**  
Urgh...! It's fast!  
But if that's the case, then I'll slow it down with earth magic!  
  
**Anne：**  
Wh-whoa! Pecorine?!  
Charging in like that's way too dangerous!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't worry, this is how I always fight!  
Plus, you'd be surprised at just how sturdy I am!  
  
**Anne：**  
R-really?!  
...Hmm, what do I do now?  
I don't want her to become collateral damage from my magic...  
  
**Gigas：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Grea：**  
Urgh...!  
It's approaching us!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Is fighting not your forte, Miss Grea?  
  
**Grea：**  
Oh...  
N-no, it's just...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If so, then there's no need to worry.  
We can handle direct combat,  
so please step back.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A friend of my lord is a person I must protect.  
  
**Grea：**  
Kokkoro...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Just leave it to me.  
You ready, big boy? 'Cause I'm about to knock you down a notch—  
  
**Gigas：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, I'm still in the middle of my incantation!  
Hold up, hold up! Stay back!  
  
**Lou：**  
Waugh?!  
It's coming right at us! What should we do?  
Oh, a rock!  
I'll throw it! Take this!  
  
**Gigas：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Lou：**  
Eeek!  
I just made it even angrier!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, Lou!  
Calm down a little bit!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Argh! This thing would be tough under normal circumstances—  
there's no way we can take it down like this!  
Everyone! Let's bail for now!  
  
**Anne：**  
*huff, huff*  
Is everyone all right?  
  
**Grea：**  
Y-yeah, somehow...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That Gigas sure was strong, wasn't it?  
How should we go about defeating it?  
  
**Karyl：**  
How? No need to ask questions with an obvious answer.  
{player}. You know why that went so poorly, don't you?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  We were all over the place.  
**Choice: (2)**  We were rushing to defeat it.  
`Tag 1`  
**Anne：**  
That's... fair enough.  
We weren't working together properly, were we?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed. There's no denying our actions were hasty.  
You never fail to pick up on all the minute details, my lord.  
That's what makes you so impressive.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Hm...  
So basically, we're in bad shape if we want to take on it and its friends.  
  
**Anne：**  
In that case, how about we cook up a plan for next time?  
We can discuss who'll take on what role and stuff!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Leave the vanguard and initial charge to me, then. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
I think Anne should kick things off, actually.  
It'll be easier to fight if we open with a powerful bang from her magic.  
  
**Anne：**  
Ehehe...  
Your magic's really strong too, though!  
I've never seen anything like it, so I'm super curious!  
  
**Anne：**  
From what I can tell, the fundamentals of magic  
are completely different between Rivenbrandt and Astraea.  
Ahh, man! I hope we have time to discuss this at length!  
  
**Grea：**  
Let's... leave that aside for now.  
Okay?  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh.  
Sorry, sorry.  
I got a bit carried away. Ehehe.  
  
**Karyl：**  
So anyway...  
First Anne hits it with a big ol' spell, then Pecorine charges in...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, oh! I'm up next! ☆  
I'll make sure to act as a proper diversion!  
  
**Anne：**  
That'd be great, actually!  
You'll give me enough time to prepare the next spell.  
We'd be at a pretty big advantage if that goes well!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Good stuff!  
Then let's give it some good old-fashioned teamwork!  
  
**Lou：**  
Hey, hey!  
What about me?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I know exactly what I want you to do when we engage it.  
First off, you turn around.  
  
**Lou：**  
Oh ho?  
I turn around. Like this?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Once you've done that, find a safe spot and sprint over to it.  
  
**Lou：**  
Ah. You want me to run, right?  
Got it!  
No one's better than me at running from life's problems,  
so I won't let you down!  
  
**Karyl：**  
O-oof...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Excuse me. If we plan on having Miss Lou evacuate,  
then what say we have Miss Grea accompany her?  
  
**Grea：**  
Wait, Kokkoro. You're misunderstanding.  
Sorry, but I can actually—  
  
**Gigas：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Anne：**  
Huh?! Another Gigas?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's probably the one we just ran from...  
Wait, no it isn't!  
It looks a bit different!  
  
**Anne：**  
I think it's the same type as the first one we defeated!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Then let's go ahead as planned!  
Anne, you're up first!  
  
**Anne：**  
Leave it to me!  
Haaaaaah!  
  
**Gigas：**  
GRUUOOOOGGHH!  
  
**Lou：**  
The time has come! To run!  
  
**Anne：**  
Pecorine, you're up next!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Got it!  
In I go!  
Hyahhh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Good stuff!  
That thing's wide open while it's focused on you two!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Which means it's time for the finishing blow.  
Eat this! Hiyaaahhh!  
  
**Gigas：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Anne! Karyl! We did it!  
We defeated it! All through the power of good teamwork!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That was exceptional, you three.  
I believe we'll be safe from here on out—  
  
**Gigas：**  
GRUUOOOOGGHH!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
?!  
Another Gigas! This could spell trouble!  
  
**Anne：**  
Huh?!  
Grea! Kokkoro! Watch out!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Not good!  
Koro's in trouble!  
  
**Gigas：**  
GRUOOAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Guh...!  
  
**Grea：**  
Kokkoro! Get down!  
Haaaaaahhh!  
  
**Gigas：**  
GGRRRRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wha... What the heck was THAT?!  
You took that thing out in one shot!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhh!  
Those flames sure were dragon-like!  
Now that I take a closer look at you, though...

**Grea：**  
*sigh*  
Are you okay, Kokkoro?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I'm unscathed, thankfully.  
I had no idea you wielded such power, Miss Grea.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Why are you only revealing it now, though?  
  
**Grea：**  
Sorry. I know I should have helped out before.  
It's just... I was too scared to use my power in front of you all...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Too scared, you say?  
But why would that be?  
  
**Grea：**  
Um... I'm sure you've figured it out already, given my appearance.  
I'm a half-breed, you see. Born of both human and dragon.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Dragons would be akin to our dragonfolk, I assume.  
Though rare, there are others in this world with  
an appearance similar to yours.  
  
**Grea：**  
I see.  
But... My power isn't normal. It brings on wanton destruction.  
All I want to do is protect my friends,  
but I'm much more adept at just destroying things.  
  
**Grea：**  
That's why I'm scared. Scared of being hated, instilling fear...  
I was always alone thanks to that. Until I met Anne, that is.  
  
**Grea：**  
In all honesty, I was terrified of letting you see this side of me.  
But my body kind of acted on its own just now.  
I'm really sorry...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well then.  
If one thing is clear, it's that you're a very kind person.  
  
**Grea：**  
Me? Kind?  
N-no way.  
I'm the one that selfishly left the fighting to you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And yet, you sprung into action when we found ourselves in peril.  
You cast aside your own fears, all in order to save us.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That, to me, is a clear sign of kindness.  
There's nothing frightening about you. Nothing whatsoever.  
  
**Grea：**  
Kokkoro...  
  
**Grea：**  
Thank you.  
You're incredibly kind, yourself.

**Anne：**  
Grea! You okay?!  
You're not hurt, are you?!  
  
**Grea：**  
Oh, Anne!  
Don't worry, I'm fine.  
Really.  
  
**Anne：**  
You mean it?! Like, *really* really?!  
How about here? No bodily harm, right?!  
  
**Grea：**  
Waaahhh!  
Qu-quit it, Anne! That tickles!  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh, thank goodness!  
Wait. Um... Err... Kokkoro!  
I know those flames must've been surprising, but Grea's—  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe. Fear not, Miss Anne.  
I'm already aware.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Pardon the assumption,  
Miss Grea,  
but the relationship between yourself and Miss Anne  
feels similar to mine and my lord's.  
  
**Grea：**  
Huh?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I, too, had a fated encounter with him.  
It was through said encounter that many of my worries fizzled away.  
Many, many of my worries.  
  
**Grea：**  
Oh...  
  
**Grea：**  
...Yeah, that makes sense.  
The same goes for when I met Anne.  
Everything just felt... like it'd be all right in the end.  
  
**Grea：**  
Hmm...  
I guess we are similar. Just a little bit.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed.  
We're just a little bit similar.  
  
**Grea & Kokkoro：**  
Hee hee...  
  
**Anne：**  
H-huh?  
What're you two talking about?  
  
**Grea：**  
Sorry.  
It's our little secret.  
  
**Anne：**  
No way!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Woooooow! This is a treasure trove of ingredients!  
Take a look, everyone!  
There's so many that I haven't even seen, yet alone eaten! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hold up, Pecorine!  
We've still got another Gigas to deal with, so...  
Wh-whoa?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
What the heck is that?! It's disgusting!  
Get it out of my face!  
  
**Lou：**  
Karyl, Karyl!  
The stuff over here is wild as well!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Et tu,  
Lou?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't set them on fire, Karyl! That's such a waste!  
Let's hunt and collect as many as we can!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Argh! I can't deal with these all on my own!  
Anne, Grea, Kokkoro! Get over here and help me out!  
  
**Grea：**  
Oh, okay!  
Let's get going, Kokkoro.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Of course.  
Please join us, my lord.  
  
**Narration：**  
With the second Gigas defeated, the crew progressed further into  
the mountain, collecting all sorts of rare ingredients along the way.  
  
**Anne：**  
Hey, hold up! Grea!  
You're keeping a secret? From me?  
Tell! Me! What! It! Is!
