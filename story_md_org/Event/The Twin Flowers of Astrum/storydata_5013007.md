**Narration：**  
The crew are able to escape the rift by the skin of their teeth.  
  
**Karyl：**  
*huff, huff*  
Sure wish someone had told us that the entire place  
was gonna collapse after we defeated that thing.  
  
**Grea：**  
That was a close one.  
If we were even a second slower, we might not have made it out.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Is this... the peak of the mountain?  
  
**Lou：**  
It's so pretty!  
Look at all the petals!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
These petals...  
No doubt about it! ♪  
Karyl! Kokkoro! We did it! We finally made it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This cherry blossom tree is what I wanted to show you!  
It's exactly as I remember it, too... How crazy is that? ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
You wanted to show us this?  
Which means you really have been here before!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha.  
Sorry.  
I wanted it to be a nice surprise for you all.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I wanted us to taste some super rare cuisine alongside this scenery.  
That's what gourmet food is all about. For me, at least.  
Hence why I invited you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see.  
I must say, the cherry blossoms truly do make for a beautiful sight.  
Thank you very much for your consideration, Miss Pecorine.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Not at all.  
You're gonna get me all embarrassed.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And with that said...  
What say we feast, everyone?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Did you miss the part where they want to go home?  
That one-track mind never changes.  
  
**Anne：**  
I'm in!  
A picnic alongside scenery like this is bound  
to make for some amazing final memories of Astraea!  
  
**Karyl：**  
If you're okay with it, then why not.  
That said, we don't exactly have any food... to eat...  
Oh no. I've got a bad feeling about this.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hee hee! Right on the money, Karyl!  
We came here in search of super rare ingredients, right?  
Gimme just a sec!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Look, you're not gonna find anything super rare that easily!  
And off she goes...  
You better come back!  
Sheesh. Always working at her own tempo.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl.  
I'm sure Miss Pecorine wishes to treat them to  
something delicious before we part ways.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm back!  
And with the goods, too!  
  
**Karyl：**  
That was quick!  
How'd you manage to—  
  
**Karyl：**  
You gotta be kidding me...  
That's the most disgusting looking stuff you've brought us yet.  
I can't even begin to imagine how it tastes...  
  
**Anne：**  
Hehe. Don't worry.  
Pecorine handpicked it, so it's bound to be delicious!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Leave it to me!

**Pecorine：**  
Aaand here we go! Ta-da!  
A succulent dish made from the rarest of ingredients!  
  
**Grea：**  
It looks delicious...  
You'd have a hard time convincing me it's made from what you just brought back.  
  
**Anne：**  
This'll be our last meal here...  
So I'll enjoy it to its fullest!  
*munch* *nom, nom*  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh, wow!  
It's delicious! Amazingly so!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Mm!  
The succulent taste! The way it melts in your mouth!  
Delicious all around! Truly lives up to expectations!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I expected it to just be us Gourmet Guild members,  
but I'm glad  
I got to share this taste and experience with the three of you as well! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Great scenery! Great food! Great friends!  
Yup! It doesn't get any crazier than that! ☆  
  
**Lou：**  
I'll never, ever forget this taste!  
  
**Anne：**  
And this'll be our final memories of this world, huh.  
  
**Anne：**  
I was real worried at first,  
but time kind of flew by in the end.  
  
**Grea：**  
Yeah.  
I'm glad you're the first people we met here.  
  
**Lou：**  
It was super duper fun!  
Thanks a lot, everyone!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-whatever. Not like I care or anything!  
  
**Karyl：**  
We just stumbled across you three when you were in danger.  
That's all there is to it, okay?!  
...Nothing but a coincidence.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Her words betray her true feelings.  
She's simply sad that we'll be parting ways.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wha—?!  
I'm just telling it like it is!  
  
**Anne：**  
Hehe.  
Thanks, Karyl.  
  
**Anne：**  
Like Pecorine said, we're eating delicious food alongside comrades.  
All with this beautiful scenery before us. That's something  
we wouldn't have experienced if we hadn't come here.  
  
**Grea：**  
Yeah.  
Part of me kind of wants to stay.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I wish you would.  
**Choice: (2)**  Staying a little bit more won't hurt.  
`Tag 1`  
**Lou：**  
Oh, don't say that...  
You'll make me all sad.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Grea：**  
Thanks. We really appreciate it.  
There's no telling what effect our presence  
could have on this world, though.

**Anne：**  
Pecorine. Kokkoro. Karyl.  
You as well, {player}.  
Sad as it is, it's about time we go home.  
  
**Anne：**  
But! This isn't goodbye!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yup.  
We're all looking forward to the day we meet again, too!  
  
**Anne：**  
All right then. Let's put the core together with the other fragments.  
Once it's recombined, I'll pour magic into it again. Here we go.  
  
**Grea：**  
That's the same light as before!  
Thank goodness. This should get us back to Rivenbrandt!  
  
**Lou：**  
Well... It really is goodbye now...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
May we meet again, my friends.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Treat Pecorine to some of Rivenbrandt's monster dishes next time, okay?  
Don't mind me, though.  
I'm good.  
  
**Lou：**  
I will! I promise!  
  
**Grea：**  
Okay then.  
Thanks so much, everyone!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Anne! Grea! Lou!  
Take care!  
  
**Anne：**  
Thanks! We will!  
I can't wait until we meet again!

The Gourmet Guild members waved goodbye as their new friends were enveloped in light, safely returning them to Rivenbrandt.
