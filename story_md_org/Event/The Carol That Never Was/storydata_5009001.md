## Subtitle: The Sleeping Diva
  
**Narration：**  
Chika faints following her strange outburst,  
after which she is carried back to the Sarendia Orphanage.  
  
**Narration：**  
Though {player} and the girls devote themselves to taking care of her,  
she shows no signs of recovering.  
  
**Chika：**  
...  
  
**Ayane：**  
She just won't wake up, will she?  
I-I hope she's okay...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
S-same here...  
She was covered in wounds,  
so maybe a monster got her?  
  
**Ayane：**  
In the middle of town?  
Then again, they've been appearing from time to time.  
It's been a real big issue.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Anyway,  
her clothes are all in tatters,  
so let's get her changed into something nicer.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Our stuff won't fit her, though.  
What about Mama Saren's?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Yeah. Mama Saren's out at work right now,  
but I'm sure she'll understand if we explain everything to her.  
  
**Ayane：**  
No doubt. We'd better wipe her down first, though.  
She's all covered in dirt.  
I'll get some water ready.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wait. The water'll be really cold right now,  
so we should warm it up a bit first.  
You're not allowed to handle fire, though, so I'll do it.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Boo. How come you're allowed and I'm not?  
Is it 'cause I'm clumsy?  
  
**Ayane：**  
I wanna help out, too.  
Santa'll give me loads of presents if I'm a good girl.  
  
**Ayane：**  
But I'm no pro at this sort of stuff.  
Should I just wait for Suzume to come back with the doctor?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
It's been a little while since Suzume left, hasn't it?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Looks like it's snowing outside now, too.  
I hope she hasn't slipped and fallen or something.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I can totally see that happening.  
Though the doctors are pretty busy at this time of the year,  
so she might just be waiting in line.  
  
**Ayane：**  
There's been a bunch of accidents and stuff lately,  
so that makes it even worse.  
Hey. Can you hear footsteps?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh. I can.  
Did Suzume finally come back?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Excuse me!  
Is Chika all right?!  
Please tell me she is!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Waugh?!  
Y-you scared the life out of me!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh!  
Sorry about that.  
Um... I assume you two live here?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I'm Nozomi. That girl's name is Chika. She's my friend!  
We're both members of a group named Carmina.  
An idol group, to be specific.  
Have you ever heard of it?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Err, uhh...  
Sorry! I haven't!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hm... Guess we've still got a long way to go.  
We're really popular with the adult crowd nowadays, but maybe  
we should start catering more to kids as well.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Anyway! {player} got in touch with me earlier,  
so I cleared my scheduled and came as fast as I could.  
How's Chika looking?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
W-we're not really sure...  
Suzume healed up her wounds with some healing magic,  
but she's just not waking up for some reason.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh. Sounds like you've been taking great care of her.  
Let me express my gratitude in her stead!  
Big, big thanks!  
I love you all! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Waugh?  
P-please don't hug me out of the blue!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ahaha.  
A simple handshake's enough to make a fan's day,  
so I'm not used to this sort of reaction.  
But enough about that. We've got more pressing issues at hand.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I must be pretty flustered myself.  
Time for a deep breath.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Honestly, I swear.  
Chika's got that prim, proper image about her,  
but she sure likes to jump the gun now and then.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
This is why I told her not to get involved in dangerous business.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um...?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, sorry. Lemme explain. She's a Song Summoner, you see.  
It's a pretty rare talent. Basically, she makes  
pacts with spirits and can do all sorts of miracle-like stuff.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
One particular spirit called Foggy, the Great Evoker Spirit,pops up in legends here and there.  
Chika had time off recently, so she went out in search of it.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
We lost sight and sound of her almost immediately after that,  
though. We had no idea where she was until now,  
so me and Tsumugi, the third member Carmina, were so worried.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It's a relief to finally know her whereabouts at least,  
but now I'm worried about her still being unconscious.  
What even happened to her?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Considering the info we have at hand,  
it feels like a safe bet that Foggy's responsible for this.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But I'm hardly an expert on spirits,  
let along Song Summoning.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um. That reminds me, actually. She mentioned that  
name before passing out. She said Foggy  
is coming, and seemed awfully terrified about it.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh...  
Which means Foggy's actually some type of monster,  
and Chika fled after being attacked by it...  
I guess?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Either way, no point in deliberating right now.  
Sorry, but do you mind looking after her a bit longer?  
I wanna head back to the office and fill them in on the situation.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Tell her to just focus on recovering once she's awake, if you could.  
I'll be sure to repay you for this, I swear.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I'm more than aware of how cold-hearted this sounds,  
but we have fans waiting for us. We can't let them down.  
Especially for personal reasons.  
  
**Chika：**  
Mmm...  
U-urgh...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Chika!  
Thank goodness!  
You little troublemaker! You had me worried sick!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehe. She went right in for the hug.  
Work's important to her,  
but she must love her friends just as much. ♪  
  
**Chika：**  
Urgh...?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Chika? What's wrong? Does it still hurt?  
I-is there a doctor in the audience?!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
C-calm down!  
She'll pass out again if you shake her that much!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
*sob*  
But she never tells us anything!  
Even when she's struggling or in pain!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It's my job to see through her bravado,  
but I can be pretty oblivious when it comes to that stuff!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I'm so sorry, Chika! I should have tried harder to stop you!  
In fact, I should have just offered to help!  
I'm the one that forced you to be an idol, after all!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It's my turn to repay the favor, yet I...  
I keep going on about how idols shouldn't meddle in each other's  
personal lives! I'm so dumb! Waaahhh!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
P-please calm down!  
You're going to suffocate her if you keep at it!
