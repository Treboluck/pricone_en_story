{player} and co. begin cleaning up the mess made by Chika. Though upset by the turn of events, Nozomi gives a speech about what it means to be an idol, bringing a smile back to their faces. But their brief respite is quickly interrupted by a screaming Ayane.
  
## Subtitle: Why We Sing
  
**Narration：**  
Following Chika's feral frenzy,  
everyone present at the orphanage sets to work  
cleaning up the mess she had left.  
  
**Narration：**  
With her unconscious once more,  
they find themselves perplexed at the reasoning behind her actions.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Kurumi! We'll need two of us to move that cupboard,  
so can you grab one side of it?  
One, two, heave-ho! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
H-huh?  
Waaahhh!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ahhh! My bad!  
I put a little too much force into it.  
Sorry for scaring you.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
D-don't worry about it.  
I'm sorry for being such a scaredy-cat...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
More importantly...  
Are you sure you don't need to head back to work, Nozomi?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It's fine. I got in touch with the office through communication magic.  
They had little to complain about,  
given how serious the situation is.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I told them nothing but the truth,  
but well...  
I still feel pretty bad.  
We had fans waiting for us, and now we're letting them down.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Tsumugi's doing her best to cover for us  
and keep them happy, at least.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I can guarantee she'll give me an earful later, though.  
She can be real touchy.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
What am I even saying?  
If she's going to give me an earful, it'll be about how  
she couldn't be by Chika's side at a time like this.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
*sigh* Why'd all this have to happen?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh! Sorry for sighing.  
An idol should be all smiles, right?  
Stay strong, me! Turn that frown upside down! ☆  
  
**Kurumi：**  
E-ehe... You're so bright and positive.  
I'm the exact opposite,  
so I really admire that. ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Heh! That's the best compliment you could give me!  
Idols always strive to be an inspiration to the kids. ☆  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You really are an idol though, huh?  
I never thought I'd talk to one face to face,  
so it's a bit of a weird feeling.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Idols always seemed so... distant?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Not at all. In fact, it's plenty normal to be able to meet idols these days.  
I'm more of an old-school idol fan myself, so that part's a bit  
hard to get used to. But keeping up with the times is important.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
And the closer we are to our fans, the easier it is to  
read their expressions. If they seem down, we encourage them and  
cheer them up. We can give them exactly what they need.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
There's nothing quite like being able to make someone smile  
in person. It's a special feeling. Even the praise of  
countless people from afar might not be able to match it.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wow!  
You're so dazzling! ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ahaha. Feels kind of embarrassing to go off on a spiel like that.  
I shouldn't make myself out to be a big shot, though.  
Carmina's still just a fledgling group with a long way to go.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But that's why I don't want some weird, out-of-the-blue  
situation to stop us in our tracks.  
I'll get Chika back to normal  
and make sure we return to the stage we belong on.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Yeah. And we'll be right there to help.  
Right? ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'll do anything and everything I can.  
`Tag 1`  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh ho? *Anything*, you say?  
What a fascinating proposal. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wow! You look so sinister!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oopsie-daisy.  
Just forget about that for me, will you?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ehehe. Not sure why, but I can kind of see you as a little sister. Makes sense considering I'm an only child, I guess.  
You must feel the same, {player}.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Family sure is great, huh? Even better when you've  
got a proper home to return to. All the holiday decorations  
in here make it clear what a happy space it is.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Yet we went and made a mess of it all.  
I can't apologize enough.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Waugh. It's not your fault.  
And it's not Chika's fault, either.  
It's all because of that Foggy monster, right?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
That's my guess, at least.  
And by the way, you'd probably be better off calling it a great spirit.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Is that... any different from a monster?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I dunno.  
I'd lump them together personally,  
but Chika's always adamant about me being wrong.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
She always says that spirits are much kinder.  
They watch over and protect both the world and us.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But I'm just an idol. I'd rather consult an expert on the matter.  
Chika's teacher is going to be on the case soon, right?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Yeah. She and Kokkoro both pray at the same temple,  
so they got to know each other there apparently.  
Kokkoro went off in a hurry to bring her here.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
They both pray often, huh?  
Well, I guess we don't have much of a choice but to wait.  
Same goes for the doctor that, uh, Suzume went to see.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Not being able to do anything in the meantime really sucks, though.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Eeeeeek!  
Quit it! Don't eat my Pukichi!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh?!  
Th-that was Ayane!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wh-what's going on? She was taking care of Chika, right?  
Don't tell me Chika woke up and went crazy again!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
L-let's hurry over!  
I hope Ayane's okay!
