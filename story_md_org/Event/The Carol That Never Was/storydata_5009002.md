# Beastly Banquet
Chika finally awakens, but something isn't right. Her actions are that of a feral beast, and she rushes to the kitchen to devour everything in sight. At the same time, Ayane begins to panic over a certain oddity: the fact that Pukichi has stopped talking.

**Chika：**  
...Waaaaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Whoa?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh...? Did you just shove me, Chika?  
You normally can't even bring yourself to harm a bug, let alone a person.  
  
**Chika：**  
GAAAHHH! WRAAAHHH!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Eeek! She's so loud!  
Even the walls are shaking!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
She's got lung capacity for days thanks to how much  
she loves singing! Geez, my ears hurt.  
Feels like my eardrums are gonna burst!  
  
**Chika：**  
GAAAHHH! WAAAAAAHHHHHH!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Err.  
She kind of just... ran off?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
What in the world is wrong with her?  
That voice almost felt like it came from some wild beast.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I-I dunno, but I gotta chase after her!  
I can't let the fans see her like that!  
Otherwise her idol career's all over!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eeeeeek!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
A-a shriek?!  
That was Kokkoro, wasn't it?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
She's in charge of cooking today, so she should be in the kitchen!  
Eep! Something awful must be going on there!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I-I think Chika's going wild?  
What's the deal here? What's going on?!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I'm not sure myself!  
Let's go check!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Mama Saren and Suzume aren't here,  
so it's my job to protect the orphanage!  
  
**Ayane：**  
...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh? Ayane?  
Wh-what's wrong? You've been quiet this whole time.  
  
**Ayane：**  
...won't speak.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
U-uhh...?  
It's weird for you to be this quiet when  
you're normally so talkative... ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
It's Pukichi. He won't say anything to me.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh! Please stop!  
We may not be acquainted, but this is far too much!  
That food is for my lord and those of the orphanage!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Th-this is sounding *real* bad!  
I'll go on ahead!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Chika! I dunno what your deal is, but hold the phone for me!  
You can't go causing trouble for others like this!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Urgh...? I don't get what's going on anymore.  
Ayane's being all weird, too.  
Things are just spiraling out of control!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Why?  
It's almost time for the holidays...  
Happy times were supposed to be coming...  
  
**Chika：**  
...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Chika! What're you doing?!  
Whoa! Your clothes are covered in food!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Um, excuse me...  
Who might you be?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Kokkoro...  
U-um... These two are {player}'s friends, I think.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah. Friends of my lord, are they?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This one caused quite the disturbance, but perhaps I can  
overlook it.  
Though I am rather miffed at the food going to waste.  
  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wow, all the pots and stuff have been knocked over.  
Is Chika responsible for all this?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed. She came right out of nowhere,  
then thrust her face into that pot.  
I was so taken aback that I had no idea how to react.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
She went on to gobble up the rest of the food, too.  
Miss Chika, was it? All she had to do was ask.  
I would have happily provided her with some.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
S-sorry about that.  
Why'd you go and do that, Chika?  
Were you that hungry?  
  
**Chika：**  
...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Chika? Hey. Don't give me the silent treatment!  
Come on. I really don't get what's going on with you!  
  
**Chika：**  
...♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
E-errr...  
Is there a reason you're getting up close and personal?  
It's kind of freaking me out...  
  
**Chika：**  
*whine...* ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Uh? Wh-what's with the snuggling?!  
That tickles! Cut it out!  
  
**Chika：**  
*lick* ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Whoa!  
Licking's off-limits!  
Carmina isn't about that sort of fanservice!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Sure, some of our fans *are* into that,  
but I want us to be pure, old-fashioned idols!  
  
**Chika：**  
*chomp* ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Yeowch!  
Biting's even worse than licking!  
People'll start spreading weird rumors  
if you leave bite marks on me!  
  
**Chika：**  
...♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
And now she's just... passed out?  
She looked all satisfied, too.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I, uhh...?  
What's gotten into you, Chika?  
I can't wrap my head around this!
