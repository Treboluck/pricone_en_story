You're such a scaredy-cat, Kurumi. ♪

**Ayane：**  
Wha—?!  
Appearing out of nowhere is just cheating!  
Huh? There's nothing there...  
  
**Kurumi：**

Looks like you're as much of a scaredy-cat as me, Ayane. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
N-no I'm not!  
You just, uh, took me by surprise!  
  
**Chika：**

Let's bring this to an end once and for all!
