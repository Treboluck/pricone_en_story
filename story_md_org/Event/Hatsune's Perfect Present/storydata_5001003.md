# My Dear Sister
Shiori writes a letter to Hatsune to thank her for the present, the contents of which cause Hatsune to break down in tears. A few days later, Shiori is about to put the picture book away for the day when, suddenly, a monster springs forth from inside it.
  
## Subtitle: My Dear Sister
  
**Narration：**  
Shiori, having finished her work for the day,  
finds herself reading through the picture book she received from Hatsune.  
  
**Shiori：**  
This book really is amazing...  
I don't think I'll ever get bored of it.

**Shiori：**  
The bookmark is so pretty, too.  
And it would be a great fit for other books, too.  
 Especially novels  
and the like. If anything, I should just carry it around with me. ♪  
  
`image display end`  
**Shiori：**  
It's amazing just how much time and effort Hatsune  
put into finding something for me.  
But that's also  
the sort of person she is, so it makes sense.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh! I still haven't gave her a proper thanks.  
Let's write a letter, then.  
Where did I put my pen and paper...  
  
**Shiori：**  
I hope a letter's good enough.  
Hm? I'm positive I closed the book...  
Maybe Rin had a look at it?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Not that I blame her, considering how good it is.  
I should mention that in the letter, too.  
Ehehe. I'm not even sure where to start.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hm...? Is it... is it sitting in a different position now?  
I was sure I felt fine today,  
but I might be more tired than I thought.  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day, {player} arrives at Elizabeth Park for work,  
where Shiori asks him to deliver the letter to Hatsune.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Would you be able to deliver this for me, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Is this your way of thanking Hatsune?  
`Tag 1`  
**Shiori：**  
Yes. I just hope it's good enough.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  She'll love it.  
`Tag 2`  
**Shiori：**  
Hehe.  
I'll take your word for it, then.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Thank you, {player}.  
I know the letter's in safe hands if it's with you.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Zzz... Zzz...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Mmm...!  
Now *that* was a good nap! ♪  
Energy reserves are officially maxed out!  
Wait! How come the sun's setting already?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Aww, man. I went and slept the whole day awa—  
Actually. Isn't that a good thing?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
You betcha it is! I barely had time to nap recently thanks to  
all the worrying over Shiorin' present, so it's cool!  
Hm? When'd you get here, {player}?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I really owe you one for your help with Shiorin's present!  
Speaking of. Here's the money you lent me! Thanks a lot for that!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
So what brings you here today?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I've got a letter for you.  
`Tag 3`  
**Hatsune：**  
A letter? For me? I wonder who it's from...  
Oh! It's from Shiorin!  
Thanks, {player}!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Let's see here... ♪  
  

---  
  
**Shiori：**  
Dear Hatsune. Thank you very much for your present. Hearing  
about how much time you spent looking for something I would  
like made me realize just how lucky I am to have a sister like you.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Nothing makes me happier than being praised by you,  
so getting both that and a present makes  
the effort feel more than worth it.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I wish I could do more to thank you than just write a simple letter,  
but this was the best I could come up with in the end.  
Let's find the time to go somewhere together again. Love, Shiori.

**Hatsune：**  
*sniff, sniff* Waaahhh! Shiorin!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  What's wrong?!  
**Choice: (5)**  Tell me where it hurts!  
`Tag 4`  
**Hatsune：**  
I'm just... I'm so glad she liked it! I really am!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Hatsune：**  
I'm fine, I'm fine!  
It's just... Shiorin, she... She really liked my present!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Hatsune：**  
*sob* *sniff* ...  
Ehehe. S-sorry for crying out of nowhere! ♪  
Oh, dear sister of mine!  
Your letters are ever so potent!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, right! I gotta write back to her!  
Can't let a good letter like this go to waste!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I'll deliver it for you when you're done.  
`Tag 7`  
**Hatsune：**  
For realsies?!  
Ehehe. You're like some sorta mailman  
that only delivers happiness, you know that? ♪  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Cool, though. I'll get in touch when I'm done!  
And thanks for delivering Shiorin's letter!  
  
**Narration：**  
With a promise made and his deliveries finished for the day,  
{player} makes his way back home.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Now then! Time to get-a writing!  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day, {player} is back at Elizabeth Park for another delivery.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hello, {player}.  
This is your last delivery for today, I assume?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, me?  
I've just been reading the book Hatsune gave me.  
The illustrations move in different ways each time,  
so I keep finding myself reading over it.  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's certainly going to last me  
much longer than most other books. ♪  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's starting to get a bit late, isn't it?  
How about you stay the night here, {player}?  
Going back to Landosol at this time seems a bit dangerous.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Everyone else is out today, too, so I was feeling a bit lonely.  
So if anything, I'd much rather have someone else around.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Sounds good.  
`Tag 8`  
**Shiori：**  
Feel free to make use of the guest lounge, then.  
I'll join you once I put this book back.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Phew.  
It's starting to get a bit chilly, isn't it?  
I should hurry on—  
  
**Shiori：**  
Huh? Wh-what's going on?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Why is the picture book opening itself up?!  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRRAAAAAGGHHHH!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Monsters?! But where did they—  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRRAAAAAGGHHHH!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hatsune...!
