## Subtitle: The Power of Three
  
**Narration：**  
The Ziz, in a state of agitation,  
chases after the trio as they flee the village.  
  
**Ziz：**  
KKKKRRRSSSKKKRR!  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's generating *this* much wind pressure  
just from flapping its wings...  
Hah!  
  
**Ziz：**  
KKKKRRRSSSKKKRR!  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's just going to keep blowing my arrows away...!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Haha... Sure seems like it's ticked off.  
  
**Shiori：**  
We won't stand a chance unless we have a proper plan.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
*huff, huff*  
You two okay?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Y-yeah... I'm... fi—  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Shiorin!  
Should we take a break?  
You haven't gotten any rest this whole time...  
  
**Shiori：**  
No, I'm fine. We're almost there...  
But this is going to be our toughest foe yet...  
  
**Shiori：**  
My arrows are useless so long as it's stirring up this much wind....  
We can't approach it like we did the other monsters.  
  
**Ziz：**  
KKKKRRRSSSKKKRR!  
  
**Hatsune & Shiori：**  
Eeek!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Sh-Shiorin! We can bypass the wind if I amplify  
your attacks with my magic, right?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
We can, but I still won't be able to aim properly!  
And we're bound to get hit if I miss even a single shot!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
No way! What're supposed to do—  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'll use the book to draw its attention to me.  
`Tag 1`  
**Hatsune：**  
W-we can't let you do that!  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's far too dangerous!  
If anything, I'll—  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Don't worry.  
**Choice: (3)**  Trust in me.  
`Tag 2`  
**Shiori：**  
{player}...  
Okay.  
Just... promise us you won't do anything reckless.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Hatsune：**  
{player}...  
Okay. You got it!  
J-just don't be afraid to run if it comes to it!  
We absolutely don't want you dying on us!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Shiori：**  
This is bad...!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Take this!  
`Tag 5`  
**Hatsune：**  
Whoa! Th-there's super duper power swelling up in me!  
Is {player} responsible?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Thank goodness he's all right...  
Thank you!  
This should be more than enough!

**Shiori：**  
Hatsune!

**Hatsune：**  
Ready when you are, Shiorin!  
  
**Shiori：**  
It all come to an end... Right here, right now!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Let's show this feathery foe what happens when we go all out!  
  
**Hatsune & Shiori：**  
Taaake thiiis!

**Ziz：**  
KKKSSSHRRRHH!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Bull's-eye!  
  
**Shiori：**  
No gust, no gale is strong enough to stop the three of us!  
  
**Ziz：**  
KKKSSSHRRRKKK...!

**Shiori：**  
Now then...  
  
**Shiori：**  
The Ziz... has officially be re-sealed.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
We did it... We really did it!  
Shiorin! That was *so* cool!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Your arrow and my magic went all pew pew pew!  
It was super duper coolio!  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's all thanks to you and {player}...  
Thank you so much. The book itself should be back to norma—  
Huh?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
What's up?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh no. That arrow went flying off into the distance...  
And the bookmark was attached to it...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ahhhhhhhh!  
  
**Shiori：**  
N-now what? Those monsters will  
break free again if we don't get the bookmark back!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
L-leave it to me!  
I'll go fetch it for you!  
  

---  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hatsune, wait!  
Off she goes...  
  
**Shiori：**  
I, uh... I hope she knows where it is...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Waaahhh!  
Why'd I teleport when I don't even know where it is?!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus Hatsune was tasked with searching for a needle in a haystack.
