**Shiori：**  
Hatsune...!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh no! Shiorin's in danger!  
  

---  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Shiorin! H-huh?! I'm sure I heard her calling for me...  
Shiorin! Where are you?!  
Hm? Isn't this the picture book I gave her?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hatsune?  
**Choice: (2)**  What're you doing here?  
`Tag 1`  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, {player}!  
You haven't seen Shiorin, have you?!  
I'm pretty sure she's in danger!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, {player}!  
I heard Shiorin calling for help, so I teleported myself over!  
You haven't seen her anywhere, have you?!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Hatsune：**  
Argh! Why didn't I get here faster?!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  She has to be nearby.  
`Tag 4`  
**Hatsune：**  
Yeah, you're right. I should focus on finding her for now.  
Shiorin... Shiorin! Where are you?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yahhh! Hah!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
That's her!  
She's over there!  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRUOOAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hah!  
  
**Monster 1：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Shiori：**  
I did it! Now to—  
  
**Monster 1：**  
GRRAAAAAGGHHHH!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Wha—?! I-I was sure I defeated it!  
How did it recover?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
...rin! Shiorin!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hatsun—  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, Shiorin! I'm so glad you're safe!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Mmghh... I-I don't think now's the time for hugs...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh! Right, monsters!  
Don't worry, I'll blast them all away!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Sha-shing! ☆ Bow to the queen!  
Taaake that!  
  
**Monster 1：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
What the—?! Wh-why's it all fine and dandy?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
My arrows couldn't defeat it, either...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Since when were there monsters like this?!  
Wh-where did it even come from?  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's hard to believe, but it spawned from inside that picture book...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
For realsies?! What's the deal here?!  
  
**Shiori：**  
There has to be a clue within the book itself,  
but I was so focused on escaping that I left it behind...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Okay! Then we'll head back and ge—  
Actually, no! I can't leave you behind!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'll stay with her.  
`Tag 5`  
**Hatsune：**  
{player}! Thanks!  
Don't worry, I'll be back in a flash!  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm sorry for getting you involved in this, {player}.  
  
**Shiori：**  
We need to hold the fort until she gets back!  
  
**Monsters：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
*huff, puff* I'm pretty sure it was around here...  
There it is!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Urgh, I let it get away...  
B-but there should be some hints in this book!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wait, these are ancient runes! I can't read those!  
I'm surprised Shi—  
Oh, yeah! Shiorin'll be able to read them!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I gotta hurry back! Let's see, is there anything else...  
Oh! The bookmark's here, too!  
Now let's get going!  
  

---  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Shiorin! {player}!  
Sorry for the wait!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hatsune! Did you find any clues?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I wish I could say yes, but I can't read what's written in it...  
  
**Shiori：**  
No, that's fine. Just bringing it back is a big help.  
There *has* to be some hint about  
how to seal them away in here...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Did you ever notice anything  
along those lines when reading it beforehand?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Not that I remember, at the very lea—  
Wait.  
I only ever got partway through it, so maybe it's towards the end...

**Shiori：**  
Here it is! \"The seal on this book is maintained through the  
power of its bookmark.  
Do not allow them to be separated, lest  
the dreadful monsters sealed within roam the land anew.\"  
  
**Hatsune：**  
So the bookmark itself is the key?  
  
`image display end`  
**Shiori：**  
So it seems... I liked the design a lot,  
so I've been using it for other books as well.  
That must have weakened the seal.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Never expected it to be that important...  
Does it mention how to re-seal them?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Let me see...  
Oh, I think this is it?  
\"Should the seal be lifted and any monsters escape,  
they must come into contact with the bookmark to be re-sealed.\"  
  
**Shiori：**  
Now I get it.  
The bookmark itself initiates the sealing process!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
So we just gotta hit 'em with it!  
  
**Shiori：**  
That should re-seal them, yes!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Woo! You're the best, Shiorin!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I-I'm kind of dying over here...  
`Tag 6`  
**Hatsune：**  
Whoa! Sh-Shiorin!  
{player}'s in trouble!  
  
**Shiori：**  
{player}, get down!  
I'll fire an arrow with the bookmark attached to it!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hahhh!  
  
**Monster 1：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Shiori：**  
It worked!  
 Now to seal the other one!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Leave the bookmark to me!  
Hey, Shiorin! Magical Pass!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Thanks, Hatsune!  
In... Out... Yah!  
  
**Monster 2：**  
GRRRUOOOOGGGHHH!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Phew...  
That's the worst of it over, I think.  
Three of them spawned in total,  
so we still need to find the last one.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh. You saw that bird monster as well?  
  
**Shiori：**  
A bird monster?  
I didn't see anything like that...  
Where did you see it?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
It popped out when I went to go grab the book,  
but I ended up letting it esca—  
  
**Shiori：**  
H-Hatsune?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Mmm... Sorry, troops...  
Tiredness came knocking after using my superpowers so much...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Keep Shiorin... safe for me, {player}... Zzz...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Rest well,  
Hatsune.  
As for us, we should chase after the remaining monster.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Look here, {player}.  
Two blank pages means two monsters that need to be re-sealed.  
The one that I saw, plus the Ziz. That's the one Hatsune saw.  
  
**Shiori：**  
The Ziz seems incredibly strong on its own,  
but the one I let escape is a vicious carnivore.  
We need to seal them before anything terrible happens.  
  
**Narration：**  
With a passed out Hatsune on his back,  
{player} followed Shiori in her search for the remaining monsters.
