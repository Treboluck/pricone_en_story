Weird. It just kind of fizzled away in a burst of light? No blood or anything, either.  
You think it was a monster, maybe?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, what's this?  
Hmm... A Memory Shard, I believe.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Allow me to explain. Memory Shards are rare items of sorts.  
Gather enough of them, and the sealed memories of whomever they  
belong to will be unleashed, allowing said character to join you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
For characters not in your party already,  
Memory Shards will allow you to recruit them.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
For characters currently in your party,  
Memory Shards will allow you to ascend them.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ascension, as the name implies,  
provides many benefits that make characters much stronger.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A mere handful of Memory Shards will provide no benefit  
on their own,  
but if we defeat more enemies like the ones  
we just encountered, we will surely be able to collect more.  
  
**Karyl：**  
So they're the key to getting stronger, basically.  
Good to know. Now we can focus on collecting a bunch of them.
