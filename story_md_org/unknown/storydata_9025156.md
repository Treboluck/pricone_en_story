There, there! Are you all OK?  
You're safe now that we've arrived! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see no signs of illness or injury.  
One, two, three...  
 Yes, they are all accounted for.  
  
**Girl：**  
Waaahhh! I'm sorryyyy!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Thank goodness you're safe!  
The monsters didn't hurt you too badly, did they?  
  
**Girl：**  
Hurt us?  
 No, we had loads of fun!  
We were just playing in the forest when we heard those drums...  
We went to investigate, but we couldn't find our way back!  
  
**Boy：**  
It was scary when we met the monsters,  
but they were so good at dancing, we weren't scared for long!  
After we danced together, we ended up being friends!  
  
**Karyl：**  
H-huh... That's nice, I guess.  
Friends with monsters...? Who knew?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Even so, listen up. Not all monsters are friendly.  
Most of them are scary and dangerous!  
 There's still too much  
we don't know about this island, so don't wander off again, got that?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Now, now, Karyl.  
I'm sure they've learned their lesson,  
 so let's just get them back home!  
Hey, kids, who wants some dried meat~?! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, and you shouldn't trust this lady.  
There's no telling what she'll feed you.  
Go on, shoo now!
