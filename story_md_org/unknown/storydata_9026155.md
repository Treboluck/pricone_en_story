**Karyl：**  
Even if it's a request from Karin,  
should we really be investigating wild rumors?  
Of course there isn't gonna be a dragon out here.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But Miss Karyl, dragons are exceptionally rare.  
If the rumors are true, it will be an incredible discovery.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Kokkoro's right on the mark there, Karyl!  
Finding a dragon would be amazing!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Let me guess.  
 \"Mmm, dragon meat!\"  
That's all you're thinking, isn't it?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, how could you tell?  
I can't hide a thing from you, Karyl!  
  
**Karyl：**  
At the last camp, weren't you gleefully polishing your knife and fork?  
How could anyone *not* notice?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Quiet now, both of you.  
It would appear our target lies just ahead.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oohhh! The mystery flavor of dragon meat!  
Hmm? Were dragons always so sticky and slimy?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Are your eyes even working?!  
Of course that sticky, slimy, creepy thing isn't a real dragon!  
Ughhh, I knew this was bogus! You can never trust a stupid rumor!
