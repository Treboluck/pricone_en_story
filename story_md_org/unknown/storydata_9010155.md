**Pecorine：**  
Guys, have a look!  
The view of the ocean from here is so gorgeous!  
I can see the open seas! It's so big! Bigger than me! ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Now is not the time to let our guard down, Miss Pecorine.  
It seems as though a monster has appeared.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That's a sea monster, a Wereorca.  
It can apparently summon endless streams of seawater with its powers,  
so take care not to drown!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Drown...?  
Hang on, can't you swim, Karyl?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I-I never said that!  
I'm gonna smack this thing down in a flash!
