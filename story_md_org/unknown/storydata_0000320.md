**Karin：**  
Members of the Gourmet Guild, the wait is over!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Does this mean...?!  
It's here?! It's finally happening?!  
Is it really time, Karin?!  
  
**Karin：**  
It certainly is!  
It took us a while to get everything prepared,  
but we're finally ready to begin!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hold it, Pecorine!  
\"Finally\"?  
 Finally what?!  
What haven't you been telling me about *this* time?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh... I guess I didn't mention it, did I?  
On behalf of the Gourmet Guild, I went ahead and accepted  
a special long-term dispatch mission from the Guild Association!  
  
**Karyl：**  
A... long-term mission?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yep! ♪ So Karin has been organizing a ship, supplies,  
preparing maps of known monster activity,  
and even getting us insured against accidents!  
  
**Karin：**  
The thing is, we at the Guild Association  
have been laying the groundwork for a major operation  
to colonize a distant region quite some way from Landosol.  
  
**Karin：**  
Your job out there will be to support the advance party in their work,  
while also venturing out to explore yet-uncharted areas.  
  
**Karin：**  
This region, you see, is entirely uninhabited,  
so we're having more than a little trouble  
dealing with the local monsters.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Uncharted lands? Infested with monsters?  
Why the heck would I leave civilization behind for a place like that?!  
  
**Karin：**  
We're all so thrilled to have a capable guild like yours  
supporting us in this exciting new project!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't just pretend you didn't hear me!  
And did you say \"long-term\"?  
We haven't prepared anything for a long trip!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No need to worry about that! I already sorted things out with Karin,  
and got all your luggage packed onto that ship right over there!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Adventure is just around the corner!  
Karyl, Kokkoro, {player}!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Why are you so well prepared?!  
You're always so... Ugh, ugh, ugh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine... You say this region is uncharted,  
but would that not make it rather dangerous for my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What do you think, my lord?  
 Exploring new lands  
with Miss Pecorine and Miss Karyl does sound like fun,  
so I would not object, but if it seems excessively perilous...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  We'll be fine as long as we're together.  
**Choice: (2)**  It sounds like these people need our help.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes... yes, of course.  
Besides, no matter what monsters we encounter,  
I will not allow them to leave a scratch upon you.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Karyl：**  
Aren't you usually a laid-back sort of guy?!  
Why are you suddenly raring for adventure?!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Karyl：**  
*sigh*... All right, fine!  
If that's how it's gonna be, I'm in too!  
But you'd better make sure the rewards are worth it!
