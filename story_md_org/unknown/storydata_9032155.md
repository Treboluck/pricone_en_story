**Karyl：**  
We came to investigate people's vanishing luggage,  
but nobody said there'd be all these bugs!  
Ugh, too creepy! I should burn them all to a crisp!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Now, now. Try to calm down.  
 Let's sit down and have a nice meal!  
Once your tummy's full, you won't feel quite so...  
 Huh?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The rice balls we brought... They've all disappeared?  
Huh? Huh? Huh?  
  
**Karyl：**  
What have you done now? If I know you,  
you probably ate them all in your sleep.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huhhh?!  
 I don't think I could've done that...  
Oh well! Time to break out my special emergency...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wahhh! Th-the emergency rice ball vanished out of my hand!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Is this related to the vanishing luggage, then?  
But I didn't sense any magical spells...  
What's going on here?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine, Miss Karyl, I see a trail of rice grains over there.  
It appears to lead farther into this forest's depths.  
We should follow it at—  
 Aaahhh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Koro?!  
 I think something dropped down from that tree...  
Wait, what the...? A huge eye's floating in midair!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That distinctive shape of eye... I have read of this in books.  
We may be dealing with a chameleon.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Did you say a \"mealy one\"?!  
 Sounds like I need to throw it in a hotpot!  
Let's defeat it and...  
 Wahhhh! S-something just leapt out at me!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Not a \"mealy one,\" Miss Pecorine—a \"chameleon.\"  
Though I could not make it out,  
I suspect what you just sensed was its lashing tongue.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh! If it can disappear and stretch out its tongue,  
it could totally steal people's things without being noticed!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed. That monster is surely the culprit of this incident.  
To ensure this expedition's safety, we must eliminate it at once!
