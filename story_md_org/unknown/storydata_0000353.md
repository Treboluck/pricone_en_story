**Mio：**  
We're in... outer space?!  
Looks like Mio's finally become a star! Literally!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yet we can breathe as easily as ever.  
Perhaps this is another of Ueki-chan's strange powers.  
  
**Rin：**  
After all that's happened, nothing feels strange anymore.  
But... I think Ueki-chan may have finally finished growing, right?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Looks like it.  
I can't wait to see what the view is like at the top! ♪  
Everyone, let's keep going till the end!
