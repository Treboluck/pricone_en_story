**Karyl：**  
There it is! The monster from before!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Last time we came to investigate a rumor,  
but today, our goal is to eliminate it.  
Let us hunt with precision and care.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Finally, we meet again, you big fake dragon!  
I've got a score to settle with you!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Wow, you're fired up.  
Still, I agree it's got to go.  
With this thing around, the whole area's gonna be a mess of toxic goop.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes.  
 It would be a terrible shame if we could not  
find any fresh fish to feed to my lord.  
I will be sure to give this battle my all!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You're going down! Sticky Slimy Phony Dragon!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Here we come, Sticky Slimy...  
 Wait, that's not a real name!  
Don't just come up with these things on the spot!
