**Karyl：**  
*huff* *puff* It's finally down for good.  
Hmph, that'll learn ya!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, please show me your wound.  
Ah, it is not as deep as I feared. That is quite the relief.  
Try to relax, I shall boil up some medicinal herbs and apply them at once.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's because you always go too hard!  
You scared me half to death.  
But, I mean, you were pretty cool back there.  
You're so dreamy!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes. What a sight it was, my lord protecting Miss Karyl.  
It was a most fearless deed.  
You are truly magnificent,  
my lord.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmph. You realize that I could've dodged that attack no problem, right?  
Yet you went ahead and leaped out, and got yourself hurt  like the  
idiot you are. You shouldn't make us all worry like that!  
  
**Karyl：**  
But...  
Thanks.  
I-I guess I should at least give you that much.
