**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. I see that this monster here is a Greater Golem.  
It appears to be quite the formidable foe.  
Miss Pecorine, Miss Karyl, let us focus ourselves on this battle!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
... *sigh*  
  
**Karyl：**  
Why are you so deflated today?!  
We can't complete our request from the Guild Association  
unless we defeat this thing!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aww...  
But, this monster's just a pile of rocks!  
I know I'm usually a bottomless pit, but I can't eat rocks!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hello?! It's not about whether or not you can eat it!  
 If we don't defeat this thing, we won't get our reward. People will get  
real mad at us and they might even disband the whole Gourmet Guild!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What?!  
They... They can't disband us!  
You, Kokkoro, {player},  
and I made this guild! It's our baby!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
All right! I'm ready to rock 'n' roll now! I'll show you what I'm made of!  
I'm gonna smash that golem up with the power of  
my love and passion for the Gourmet Guild!
