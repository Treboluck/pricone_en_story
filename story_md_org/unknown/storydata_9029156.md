We did it! We beat that thing, Pecorine!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yep! ♪  
 On my honor as the perpetually peckish Pecorine,  
I can't afford to lose in a battle of appetites!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
With this, Miss Pecorine, you have proven your hunger  
exceeds that of even the most ravenous Crocagon!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aww, don't make me blush! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Are you really sure that's a compliment?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Now then, let's see...  
This seaweed-y stuff on its head looks nibble-worthy! ♪  
Lemme take a chomp!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? W-wait...  
You're *actually* eating this thing?  
 And raw, no less?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hm, I see... *munch munch*...  
It's not like normal seaweed!  
Mm, it tastes a bit croccy, with a chewy texture... It's really good! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah... Your appetite really is beyond croc level.
