Great! I think that's a wrap.  
Still, that monster sure was persistent.  
I never realized how terrifying it would be to be eaten alive.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You're right! Just think, the food we eat every day  
comes from the same cycle of life that threatened ours!  
We'd better be nice and thankful for each tasty morsel!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
By the by, as I mentioned last time,  
I feel that monster's body seemed unusual somehow.  
Could this island  
 have some effect on the monsters that live here?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm... I can't say anything for sure,  
 but it seems like evolution.  
Over many generations, animals can adapt to their environment.  
So that monster must have found a new niche in this rocky region.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It is true  
 that monsters go through generations quite rapidly.  
With no humans to disturb natural selection,  
is this how monster species naturally develop?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hard to say from just one example.  
But if there's a creator behind all the world's beasts,  
he sure went overboard tailoring that one to this specific terrain.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Guess we'd better keep investigating.
