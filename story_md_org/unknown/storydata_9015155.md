**Kokkoro：**  
That is the Hellhound, the monster that the Guild Association  
sent us here to defeat.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What an amazing creature!  
Half its body is just bones,  
so I can't tell if it's supposed to be dead or alive!  
  
**Karyl：**  
They said this thing's been causing chaos in a hot spring resort,  
but why does the Guild Association keep giving us these missions?  
  
**Karyl：**  
What do they think we are, some kind of  
hardcore guild of battle freaks?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Whatever the reason, my lord seems stricken by the heat,  
so let us defeat the beast quickly.  
 Now, to battle!
