It fled into the depths of the river.  
And alas, it seems this rumor  
was once more unrelated to genuine dragon activity.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Still, it seems a little bit closer than the last one!  
If we carry on like this,  
 sooner or later...! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Dragon, my butt!  
As if a legend like that is gonna randomly pop up so easily!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It's true that all of these rumors have been extremely vague.  
So much is still unclear about this island.  
The fear of the unknown may be causing wild exaggerations...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's why we're going on these missions  
to find out more about it!  
The more we learn,  
 the sooner everyone can feel safe!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Pecorine, you...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I always thought you only cared about food...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Besides, exploring is the key to a gourmet life!  
The treats we discover  
 will someday be on tables around the world!  
So first, let's hunt down the taste of real dragon meat!
