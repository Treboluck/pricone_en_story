**Karyl：**  
There you are, you big fat pig!  
This time, we're taking back the kids you abducted!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm very serious today, too!  
This time, I'll slice up that dancing pork belly for sure!  
  
**Boy：**  
Ahh! It's the adventurers from the settlers' village!  
Hey, over here!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, those must be the children.  
They all appear safe, so let us save them swiftly.
