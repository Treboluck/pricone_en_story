**Karyl：**  
Oh, shut up! Shut uuuup!  
What is this noise?!  
 My ears are ringing like crazy!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh!  
 That pig's got some really huge drums!  
And look at its funny dancing!  
For a big monster, it's so cute!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, this is no time to be dancing to the beat.  
Amusing though its antics may be, that monster is our foe.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Given the rumors of kidnappings that brought us to these mountains,  
and these monsters' advanced settlement...  
It seems likely this is where we will find the children.
