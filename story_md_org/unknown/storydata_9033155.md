**Pecorine：**  
Now—we've got you cornered, rice-ball-thieving mealy one!  
I'll pay you back for all the tummy rumbles you caused!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I don't care about the rice balls,  
but scouring this bug-infested forest hasn't left me in the best mood!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I wanna kick that googly-eyed lizard's butt  
and go on a vacation with the rewards...!  
Wait, wh-where'd it go?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Its level of caution has evidently grown since last we saw it.  
It is no easy task to locate a chameleon who does not wish to be found.  
We must be patient and await an opportunity.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm... Guess we've got no choice.  
Let's sit down and eat while we wait for—  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh! There goes yet another rice ball!  
That's the last straw! Let's chase the lizard right now!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...No, you stay there and keep eating! See, it's going in for another!  
Like a moth to the flame or a lizard to the rice ball!  
I'll take this chance to blast the forest all around us! Yah-yah-yahhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ah! Looks like we've smoked out the mealy one!  
Kokkoro, let's take it down before it runs!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I-  
indeed!
