**Karyl：**  
*pant* *pant* We've got all the items we need now, right?  
I can't believe how many ordeals we had to get through...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So many powerful enemies,  
but we showed them what we're made of!  
  
**Karyl：**  
So tell us, Koro, what do we do now?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
From what I gather, in the final trial,  
one must face a shadow of one's own self imbued with great power.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
By defeating this shadow in battle,  
the victor can make the great power it wields their own.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, I see!  
Sounds like a fun challenge to me! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Seriously, what a pain...  
But after what we've been through, what's one more battle?  
I'll take that shadow out in no time!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Most bravely spoken, Miss Pecorine, Miss Karyl.  
Still, we should steel ourselves for an arduous fight.
