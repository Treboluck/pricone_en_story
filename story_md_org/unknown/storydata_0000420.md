**Saren：**  
Guys, are you all still alive?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Saren!  
Thank goodness you are safe!  
  
**Saren：**  
Yes, for now!  
But according to Akino, there are powerful monsters  
on their way to Landosol as we—  
  
**Akino：**  
Aarghhh! What is this utter madness?!  
I thought we'd destroyed that colossal golem,  
so why did a new monster burst out of it?!  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh, Akino, can you quiet down a bit?  
You're disruptin' my communication channel with Kasumi.  
Right now, we're tryin' to find anyone who might be able to help.  
  
**Monika：**  
This is Monika Weisswind of Weissflügel: Landosol Branch!  
We've sighted a similar monster on the outskirts of the capital!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If you can take out those monsters,  
they'll stop sending magic to the Kaiser and the barrier should weaken!  
  
**Illya：**  
We have a bone to pick with that villainous vixen as well.  
If this will teach her a lesson, nothing could make me happier!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
...Hmph. A futile struggle.  
Those are constructs of pure magical energy.  
Even if you defeat them, they'll just form anew!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Then we'll keep beating 'em up till they stop coming back!  
Let's take 'em down!  
  
**Lima：**  
I'll fluff them into oblivion! ♪  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I won't allow any more harm to come to Landosol!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Together, we'll stop them in their tracks!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please do all you can, everyone!  
  
**Saren：**  
Indeed!  
That city is the home we have to return to!  
  
**Akino：**  
Ohoho! You can count on us! ♪  
To battle, my friends!
