Eek... What's that?!  
No one said anything about having to deal with something that gross!  
No way am I touching that thing! Count me out!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Now, now, Miss Karyl.  
 Despite what you may say, have  
a look at the enormous flower adorning its head, or perhaps its  
gaping mouth. You might even say it's cute upon closer inspection.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Let us lend our assistance to my lord and fight alongside him.  
This will be for the world, for the people, and for my lord.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Kokkoro's right.  
You can't be picky now, Karyl!  
Are those thick, juicy petals on it like steaks, maybe? *drool*  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ugh! This is why I'm so sick and tired of being around these guys!  
Guess I just gotta suck it up and beat the living snot outta it!  
{player}, let's go!
