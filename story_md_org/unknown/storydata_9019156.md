Whew, we got him good this time!  
Him and his whole gang of thieves!  
I've gotta say, you're even cuter when you get aggressive, Kokkoro! ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, my apologies... I did not mean to become so agitated.  
These past few days, we have witnessed first-hand how hard everyone  
at the village is working, so the beast's actions angered me a little.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ah well, that should all be over now.  
So, about this villain! What're we gonna do with him?  
After all the trouble he's caused, he deserves a thorough roasting!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh! Karyl, have you finally learned to love monster cuisine?!  
It's been a long journey, but the gourmet spirit in our hearts won at last!  
Come on, let's get to work while the meat is fresh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? That's not what I...  
Hell no! If it sounded like I wanted to eat this thing, I take it all back!  
...Wait, stop that! Listen to meeee!
