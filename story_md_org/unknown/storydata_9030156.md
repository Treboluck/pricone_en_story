**Pecorine：**  
Um, Karyl? Kokkoro?  
Is it just me, or are you a little bit electrified?  
Did the shark-ray get you with its zappy attacks?  
  
**Karyl：**  
W-w-well, d-duh!  
D-do you really need to a-a-ask...?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well then, we can chase that shark-ray...  
 no,  
that delicious fin bonanza, once you're feeling better!  
No time to lose!  
  
**Kokkoro：**

Y-your ap-p-petite is out of h-hand...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I-I-I'll k-kill you d-deaddd...!
