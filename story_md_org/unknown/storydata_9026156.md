**Kokkoro：**  
It seems we have outmatched the creature.  
Still, this whole area is drenched in its poison.  
My lord, are you quite all right?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Aw, man. So much for that fresh spring.  
I hope it won't wipe out the other animals.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm guessing someone saw those huge footprints  
and started crying \"dragon,\" huh?  
What a load of nonsense!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
With all that poison, I guess its meat isn't edible, huh...? *sniffle*  
With a meal snatched away, I feel hungrier than ever...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine. Though it pains me to say this,  
with this area now covered in poison,  
there may be no edible food to find at all.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No waaay!  
Mr. Dragon, where are yoooou?!  
My meat! My juicy dragon meat!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, stop that! You'll attract other monsters!  
Quit shouting like a complete moron!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Urghh... But I can't stop my tummy from rumbling...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well then, let us return for the moment.  
Before the growling of Miss Pecorine's stomach  
is mistaken for yet another dragon.
