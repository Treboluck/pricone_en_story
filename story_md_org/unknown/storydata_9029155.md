Ah, it is the Crogacon!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't you start calling it that too, Koro!  
I won't be able to take it seriously!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aww, what's wrong with it, Karyl?  
It's a lovely name! Crocagon!  
Croc, Croc, Crocagon~! ♪

That song is the problem! Don't remind me!  
Honestly... It sure is a persistent thing, attacking us again.  
Maybe it doesn't like to let a target escape.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, please stay back.  
It would not do for you to be caught in its jaws.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, I don't like to let a meal get away either!  
Let's see whose appetite is the biggest, shall we?! ☆
