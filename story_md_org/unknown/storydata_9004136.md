Phew.  
That was a tough one.  
You sure know your stuff when it comes to monsters, huh, Karyl.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well... I mean, it's just stuff I've heard. That was the first time  
I ever actually saw one.  
 I didn't think that was something you'd  
usually see around here. I wonder if something weird happened?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Who cares? We've got a huge catch for tonight!  
 *giggle*  
I'm really looking forward to dinner! I wonder what I should eat first?  
The belly? Or the collar? Or maybe the fins?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Will you cut that out already? Your tastes are so weird! I'm never  
eating a single bite of any monster!  
 I gotta keep a close eye on you.  
Who knows what kind of weird meat you'll try to feed me... *grumble*
