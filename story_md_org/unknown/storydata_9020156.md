**Karyl：**  
Aaaghhhh! Rocks... And wooden logs...!  
Pecorine, Koro, and you, too...  
Look out... This is bad...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh dear... I think Karyl's been completely bamboozled  
by all the monster's nasty illusions...  
She's trying to save us from phantom threats.  
 That's soooo cute!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It seems cruel to leave her like this, so let us awaken her.  
Forgive me, Miss Karyl. Yahh! Yahh! Yahh! Yahh!  
Still not... enough...?  
 Yahhh! Yahhh! Yahhh...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Mnhh...  
Huh...? Ummm...  
I'm... already... awake...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, thank goodness. Your senses have been cleared.  
My lord and I could not bear it if anything happened to you, Miss Karyl.  
Now, let us return to the village with the bounty we have gathered.  
  
**Karyl：**  
R-right. Thanks a bunch, Koro.  
Sorry to make you worry.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I know it was for my sake, but those slaps really hurt!  
Does that girl have some kind of secret grudge against me...?
