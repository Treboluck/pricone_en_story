**Kokkoro：**  
So this is the edge of the settlers' village.  
Even the village itself had its share of monsters... Hmm, I see.  
A simple fence like this would not be able to keep small monsters out.  
  
**Woman：**  
Aaaghhh! A huge monster!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Uh-oh! There's the big boss beastie we heard about!  
Apparently it's been stealing tons of supplies,  
from weapons to construction materials!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I wouldn't have thought big monsters could get inside very easily...  
But this one seems more nimble than most.  
See, it leaped right over the fence!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It appears to be armed with stolen weapons from the village.  
However, we are far from inexperienced adventurers ourselves!  
My lord, let us fell the beast!
