**Kokkoro：**  
Everyone, are you safe and uninjured?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
*pant*... *pant*... *pant*...  
Y-yeah, just about. But...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes... The bean monster seems to have gotten away...  
  
**Karyl：**  
What \"bean monster\"?! It was a flower monster we were fighting!  
Is your appetite affecting your vision now?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, Karyl, you get too uptight about little details! ☆  
Come on, let's eat some of the beans the monster dropped!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Th-this mad girl... After everything it put her through...  
Still, there sure are weird monsters out there.  
Never expected one to try luring us in with flowers.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine was ensnared by beans rather than flowers,  
but as you say, it was a new and unusual species.  
This island is home to a great many unknown dangers.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Point is, who knows what else is lurking out there?  
Let's all stay on our guard!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Right! Let's mix those beans with rice for dinner!  
We'll beat up the monster and harvest a ton of them! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Beans with rice...  
 I feel certain that my lord will love it!  
Please allow me to contribute a bean-based recipe of my own.  
Well then, let us chase after the bean monster.  
  
**Karyl：**  
N-not you too, Koro...  
Did you guys hear what I said about being careful?!
