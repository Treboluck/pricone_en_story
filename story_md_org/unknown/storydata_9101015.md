**Karyl：**  
K-Koro?!  
Hey, wait a minute.  
Weren't you by {player}'s side all this time?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I was.  
And I always will be, may I add.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whoa! What?! How the...?  
There's two Kokkoros! What's the deal here?!  
Oh, I've got it. Twins, right?  
  
**???：**  
\"I happen to live here, as a matter of fact.\"  
\"This is quite common for me, I'm afraid.\"  
\"It's a pleasure. I hope that we can get along.\"  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm... Do be careful, my lord.  
Whatever this is, its actions are cause for concern.  
I'm not quite sure what it's saying, either.  
  
**???：**  
\"GRRRAAARGHHH!\"  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It's coming!  
I won't let it anywhere near my lord, though! Have at you!
