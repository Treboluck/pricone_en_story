**Pecorine：**  
Phew... That chicken was tougher than I thought it'd be!  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's not a chicken.  
And more importantly!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You and your superhuman strength! These precious tail feathers are all tattered now!  
We never should've come here...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Argh! Not only did we schlep all this way for no reason, but now it's suddenly gotten chilly!  
Gah! It's freezing!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Chowing down on some chicken hot pot in a cold place is pretty tasty, you know!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I said, it's not a chicken!  
I'm not eating any of that!
