**Saren：**  
Guys, do you read me?!  
It looks like we've defeated one of the monsters!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And yet... A mighty torrent of magic  
still flows toward the Kaiser!  
  
**Omniscient Kaiser：**  
Hahah...!  
What did I tell you? Those monsters are magical constructs!  
They'll regenerate in no time!  
  
**Saren：**  
Still, we're definitely depleting them.  
It's a battle of endurance!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Guys, we're counting on you!  
  
**Suzume：**  
W-we'll do our best to clean them up!
