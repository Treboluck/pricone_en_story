**Kokkoro：**  
The levels of your characters are limited by your own level, my lord.  
By completing missions, you will gain Player EXP,

This concludes all of the lessons that I have to teach you, my lord.  
From here on out, you may gather companions for yourself  
and adventure forth with them as you see fit.
