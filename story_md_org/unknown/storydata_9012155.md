That looks like the monster behind the raids on the village's  
food supplies.  
 It looks like it won't go down easily.  
I can see why the villagers can't take care of it themselves.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm... It appears to have its burning gaze  
directed straight towards Miss Percorine's bag filled to the brim with food.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It must have committed many an offense  
to have warranted an official request from the Guild Association.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The act of attacking food storehouses is an evil that cannot be forgiven!  
I'll personally teach this monster a lesson! Gourmet food is meant to be shared, not stolen!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And to top it all off... It's eyeing my food as well!  
  
**Karyl：**  
It feels like you might be taking this a bit too personally but... Oh, well.  
Come on! Let's take this thing out!
