# Rei Episode 3
Rei makes her way to the beach for some fishing, where she meets {player}. A surprisingly big catch leads the two of them to cooperate in reeling it in, deepening their bonds even more over a shared hobby.
  
## Subtitle: Our Promise
  
**Narration：**  
Rei, on a rare day off, has come along to the beach for some fishing.  
  
**Rei：**  
This spot turned out to be quite the find.  
It's nice and quiet, plus the fish are more than willing to bite.  
I can't think of a better way to spend a day off.  
  
**Rei：**  
I really do love fishing. Nothing helps me relax quite like this.  
  
**Rei：**  
Hmm?  
That's surprising. I never expected to see anyone else here.  
And what do you know. It's a certain Mr. Knight.  
  
**Rei：**  
Hey there. I didn't you know you fished as well.  
You chose a good spot. The fish are biting well today.  
  
**Rei：**  
Wait, you've already got one hooked!  
Quick, reel it in!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Try and reel it in.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rei：**  
That's good! Keep at it!  
  
**Rei：**  
Wait. This is bad!  
It's going to pull you in at this rate!  
Just how big is it?  
  
**Rei：**  
Wha—?! I only caught a glimpse of it,  
but it's huge! I've never seen one that big before...  
  
**Rei：**  
This calls for desperate measures.  
A beast like that is just going to pull you into the ocean.  
Let me handle it!  
  
**Giant Fish：**  
GRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH!  
  
**Rei：**  
Looks like it's noticed us, too!  
Perfect! I'll slice it to bits!  
Mistral Blast!  
  
**Rei：**  
Phew... That was close.  
I have to admit, though. Catching something this big is an achievement.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Offer it to Rei.  
`Tag 2`  
**Rei：**  
You want me to have it?  
I appreciate the thought, but you're the one that caught it...  
  
**Rei：**  
Think of it as thanks for helping?  
Well... If you put it like that, I see no reason to refuse.  
  
**Rei：**  
That's what I'd like to say,  
but I can see that glint of desire in your eyes.  
Don't make me feel bad for taking something you offered.  
  
**Rei：**  
Now that I think about, what brought you here in the first place?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Food.  
`Tag 3`  
**Rei：**  
Hmm... You came all this way, but never caught anything until now?  
  
**Rei：**  
Well, that sure tells me the whole story. Haha.  
I was thinking of  
cooking that fish we just caught there, so how about you join me?  
I doubt I'll be able to eat that much on my own.  
  
**Rei：**  
I know you're hungry,  
so no need to hold back.  
  
**Rei：**  
I told you not to hold back, but wow.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You're a great cook.  
**Choice: (5)**  I owe you my life.  
`Tag 4`  
**Rei：**  
Does this even count as cooking?  
I'm generally useless at dishes that require actual skill.  
That said, I appreciate the compliment.  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Rei：**  
Hehe. Quit exaggerating.  
I'm glad you're enjoying it, though. Makes the effort worth it.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Rei：**  
What're your plans after this?  
I'll be sticking around a little bit longer, myself.  
Would you like to join me?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I'll fish up enough to make up for this.  
`Tag 7`  
**Rei：**  
There's no need to worry about that.  
But well, sure. I'll keep my expectations in check.  
Let's get started, shall we?  
  
**Rei：**  
Hmm?  
I just noticed, but the hook on your rod is barely hanging on.  
You should pay more attention to that.  
  
**Rei：**  
Okay, let's tie it back up...  
Wait a minute. That's... not quite how you do it.  
  
**Rei：**  
Correct me if I'm wrong, but are you entirely new to this?  
There's no way you'd be able to catch anything with your rod in that state.  
  
**Rei：**  
Sheesh... You're helpless, you know that?  
I guess I'll show you the ropes.  
  
**Rei：**  
First and foremost, your hook and line for the day  
need to treated with the utmost care.  
A beat-up rod won't be  
catching anything, that much I can assure you.  
  
**Rei：**  
As for your hook, this is how you fasten it... There we go!  
Did you follow that?  
  
**Rei：**  
Next up, we have the location itself.  
The last thing you want is to waste time in a spot with no fish.  
We're in a good spot for today though, so there's no need switch.  
  
**Rei：**  
Lastly, you need to judge how far to cast,  
how deep to let it sink.  
All that sort of stuff.  
Though to be fair, you'll pick that up more through experience.

**Rei：**  
Color me surprised. You caught a lot more than expected.  
Good to see things went well for the both of us.  
  
**Rei：**  
Looks like you have the knack for fishing, too.  
Most people wouldn't be able to catch this much  
after a rudimentary rundown.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Master! Impart your wisdom on me!  
`Tag 8`  
**Rei：**  
Master?!  
If there's one way to make me feel embarrassed, it's by calling me that.  
  
**Rei：**  
Besides, I haven't done anything special.  
I just wanted to help out. As your friend.  
  
**Rei：**  
And, well... I should be the one thanking you.  
I had a lot of fun today.  
  
**Rei：**  
Today's the first time in a long while that I've fished with someone else.  
Usually I'm all on my own, so yeah... I enjoyed it.  
  
**Rei：**  
Say. Would you mind joining me again sometime?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  I'd love to.  
`Tag 9`  
**Rei：**  
That's good to hear. Let's call it a promise, then.  
  
**Narration：**  
Though friends already,  
{player} and Rei shared a new bond through their enjoyment of fishing.
