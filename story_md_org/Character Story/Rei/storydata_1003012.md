## Subtitle: To Have Faith
  
**Narration：**  
Rei and {player} are out on an inspection tour away  
from Landosol. After completing their investigation and negotiations  
with a canyon village, they are interacting with the villagers.  
  
**Rei：**  
...Phew.  
I guess that's about it for the woodchopping.  
  
**Middle-Aged Woman：**  
Sorry about that! You came all the way from the capital just for us to  
have you help out with this!  
You've been so helpful.  
  
**Rei：**  
I'll just finish off the rest...  
Oh?  
  
**Middle-Aged Woman：**  
There's no more wood left. You've chopped it all. Thank you!  
But wow, I can't believe how quickly you were able to finish all  
that lumber... You're incredible.  
  
**Rei：**  
...I've chopped it all?  
Well, I was using an axe... I know by feel alonehow to cut solid objects,  
so I guess I just got into a rhythm without noticing.  
  
**Rei：**  
Yet despite all that work, I don't feel an ounce of fatigue...  
How strange... It's like it's not my own body at all...  
  
**Middle-Aged Woman：**  
Compared to you, these men are kind of useless...  
Can't you all learn from this lady just a little?  
  
**Middle-Aged Man：**  
No, no, it's just that she's too good!  
It makes no difference that she's a swordswoman, even a lifelong  
lumberjack can't do that.  
Hey, lad, who is this girl?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  My amazing master.  
**Choice: (2)**  My amazing girlfriend.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rei：**  
Heheh. I'm glad you think of me that way.  
It makes me even more determined to help these villagers  
so that I can live up to the faith you have in me.

`Tag 2`  
**Rei：**  
G-g-girlfriend?!  
Wh-what do you...?  
Ahhh, you're being literal—a friend who's a girl...  
Come on, stop messing around.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Middle-Aged Woman：**  
All right, let's take a little break.  
I'll go and fix lunch. I hope you two will join us.  
  
**Village Mayor：**  
Oh, ohhh, Lady Rei!  
Thank goodness, you're still here!  
  
**Rei：**  
Mr. Mayor?  
Don't tell me there's something missing from the documentation  
I supplied you with at the meeting earlier?  
  
**Village Mayor：**  
No, it's not about that.  
There's an urgent matter we need to discuss!  
  
**Rei：**  
And what would that be?  
  
**Village Mayor：**  
A short while ago, monsters from a nearby cave attacked the village!  
Not only did they lay waste to our farms, but our livestock also! Please!  
I need you to dispatch an extermination request to the royal knights!  
  
**Rei：**  
I don't mind doing that for you...  
  
But even if I relay that request right now, it'll take days for them to get  
here. And that's a best-case scenario.  
  
**Village Mayor：**  
N-no way!  
If it takes them that long to arrive, there won't be a village to save!  
  
**Rei：**  
...Sorry, but I have a favor to ask...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Let's go exterminate those pests!  
`Tag 4`  
**Rei：**  
...Thank you.  
It seems like we no longer need words to communicate.  
  
**Rei：**  
Mr. Mayor, we'll take care of those cave dwellers for you.  
Please inform the villagers not to leave their homes until the danger  
subsides.  
  
**Village Mayor：**  
Oh my!  
But we can't let an emissary from the capital do something so  
dangerous!  
  
**Rei：**  
I can't leave be that which jeopardizes the safety of this village.  
Before being an emissary, I am a person,and as a person, this is my will.  
So please. Let me do this.  
  
**Village Mayor：**  
Lady Rei...  
I understand.  
Then please, let me guide you to the cave!  
  
**Rei：**  
I would appreciate that.  
And you, put your fighting boots on!  
  
**Village Mayor：**  
...That's the cave where the monsters have settled.  
Please don't do anything reckless.  
And if things take a turn for the worse, just run away.  
  
**Rei：**  
Understood. And you, Mr. Mayor, please take care.  
  
**Rei：**  
...Now then, I'd love to rush right in there...  
But before I do, there's something I need to talk to you about.  
  
**Rei：**  
Recently...  
maybe since we started out on this trip...  
my body's  
been feeling rather unusual.  
  
**Rei：**  
But not in a bad way. In fact, I'm in peak condition.  
Take that woodchopping earlier, for example.  
  
**Rei：**  
Before leaving the capital, I'd never been able to chop that much  
wood in such a short time.  
  
**Rei：**  
I haven't done any special training, and I haven't seen drastic growth in  
my strength and skill.  
In fact, I don't think pure strength and skill could  
achieve that.  
But if that's the case, how was I suddenly so capable?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  'Cause your heart's getting bigger?  
**Choice: (6)**  'Cause you tried with all your might?  
`Tag 5`  
**Rei：**  
My heart's getting bigger...  
You might be right.  
Heart, technique, strength—the three qualities of a martial artist.  
Perhaps it's because I've cultivated them all. That makes sense.  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Rei：**  
With all my might...  
  
Until now, I've been trying to do my best while keeping in mind  
all the things I really want to do and all the things I have to do...  
  
**Rei：**  
...Could it be the changes in my heart affecting my body?  
Or perhaps it's not the changes, but the growth of my heart...  
This may be the manifestation of the completion of my martial artistry.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Rei：**  
So that's what's happening...  
Heheh. Assuming that's true, it's surely  
thanks to you. As long you're by my side, I feel like I can't lose to even  
the strongest of enemies.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Then I'll get closer.  
`Tag 8`  
**Rei：**  
What?! Wait! When I said \"by my side,\" I didn't mean like that!  
You're too close! Your face is too close! Can you just step back a bit...?!  
  
**Rei：**  
Goodness...  
You can't do that right now...  
I mean, don't ever do that!  
Argh, calm down, Rei...!  
  
**Rei：**  
Breathe in... Breathe out... Phew.  
A-anyway, I think I've calmed down...  
  
**Rei：**  
...Sorry for making a fuss, but the chatter ends here.  
The cave is beckoning us.  
  
**Rei：**  
...That's odd.  
We're well inside the cave, but there's no reaction to our presence.  
  
**Rei：**  
If this is monster territory, then where are all the monsters...?  
  
Eh?  
  
**Rei：**  
This is... a monster corpse?  
  
**Rei：**  
...A long time has passed since it drew its last breath.  
  
But why did it die here?  
  
**Rei：**  
...Moreover, it's covered in numerous blade wounds.  
Wait, maybe the ones who attacked the village weren't monsters...  
  
Hey! Look out!  
  
**Rei：**  
That was close...  
Stop hiding and show yourselves!  
We know it was you who attacked the village!  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
...Aw hell.  
I thought I heard a mouse, so we came to investigate...  
You two, whaddaya want?  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Oh, li'l lady, what a cutie you are!  
Did ya come lookin' fer some fun?  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Ohhh! I'm up fer that!  
  
**Rei：**  
...And who might you all be?  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
...Well, now that we've been found out, I guess there's no more hidin'.  
We're bandits who've made this place our turf.  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
We took a likin' to this cave, so we killed all the monsters here an' made  
it our hideout...  
But it irks us to no end that we got no reward fer clearin'  
'em out. To make up fer it, we're takin' what we're owed from the village.  
  
**Rei：**  
...  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
But seriously, how stupid can they be?  
We're the ones stealin' their cattle, but they're blamin' a bunch o' damn  
monsters!  
  
**Rei：**  
...Surrender.  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
...Huh?  
What did ya just say, little lady?  
  
**Rei：**  
I told you to surrender.  
It's true that you somehow exterminated the monsters, so if you  
surrender now, the charges laid against you should be light.  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
Chaaarges?  
Hah! Charges, huh?!  
First of all, we don't care too much fer any o' that!  
We've the freedom to do whatever we want, whenever we wanna do it!  
  
**Rei：**  
...Freedom?  
Don't make me laugh.  
All you scoundrels are doing is running roughshod over the hopes and  
endeavors of others. That's just cruel.  
  
**Rei：**  
If that's what you dastards call freedom—the act of wielding power  
haphazardly and heartlessly—then I too shall indulge in such freedom...  
And I'll destroy *your* freedom once and for all!  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
Hah! You've got a way with words!  
Now we wanna see some action too!  
  
Hey, use the thing!  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Gotcha! Heave-ho!  
  
**Rei：**  
Falling rocks?! Not good! Hey, look out!  
  
**Rei：**  
They're trying to split us up...!  
We'll see about that!  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
Ya got no chance!  
Ya ain't breakin' nothin'!  
  
**Rei：**  
Ugh...! They lured us into a trap...  
So you were trying to get us in here all along...!  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
Bingo! As if we wouldn't be prepared!  
Now, I'd like to politely ask ya both to die!  
  
**Rei：**  
{player}, are you all right?!  
If you can hear me, say something!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Ya got some nerve lookin' away!  
  
**Rei：**  
Tch! Out of my way!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Whoa, that was close!  
Hahah! Still wanna have some fun?  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
I saw her first! She's mine!  
  
**Rei：**  
Urk! You sneaky little...! Haaah!  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Where're ya even aiming?  
Boss! I think she can only take two at a time!  
  
**Rei：**  
What the...?!  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
Did ya think just the two of ya could march on in here an' do somethin'  
about the problem?  
You royally messed up thinkin' we were nothin' but  
a horde o' piddly li'l monsters, didn't ya!  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
I dunno if that kid's stronger than ya or not,  
but either way, my buddies'll take him out in no time!  
  
**Rei：**  
Not only did they pincer us, but they're also trying to pick us off  
separately...  
We're totally out of luck...  
  
**Rei：**  
They're more skilled than I thought.  
If we're not careful, we'll both get more than a little banged up...  
  
**Rei：**  
If I rush to help him, I'll leave myself open,  
but if I take too long, it'll put him in jeopardy...!  
  
**Rei：**  
Just when I thought I'd finally managed to grow a little, this happens...  
But there's no way I'm giving up! Haaah!  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
Whoa!  
Listen, guys! We don't have ta rush!  
How 'bout we kill her nice and slow?! Haaah!  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Hahhh!  
Yahhh!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Hiyahh!  
  
**Rei：**  
Ngh! You—!  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
Hrraaagh!  
  
**Rei：**  
Ngaaahh...!  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
What's this? Yer done already? Can't ya entertain us just a li'l more?  
Ya fight by the book, don't ya?!  
  
**Rei：**  
*pant* *pant*...  
I'm only getting started...!  
  
**Rei：**  
...No doubt about it. Their leader is highly trained in swordsmanship.  
As a noble child, I was trained by the royal knights. But the fact that he  
sees right through that means he has knowledge of their fighting style...  
  
**Rei：**  
And the way he commands during battle suggests he's a former  
member of Nightmare, perhaps even a platoon commander or higher...  
  
A formidable opponent!  
  
**Rei：**  
Just who are you people...?  
Why would such skilled fighters be hiding away in a place like this?  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
Well, the capital's been in a bit of state lately, hasn't it?  
We're just layin' low here till things cool down.  
When it's all back to normal, we'll start workin' fer the fat cats again.  
  
**Rei：**  
...So you're abusing the skills you learned from Nightmare?  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
Oh...? You figured that out pretty quickly, huh?  
As a reward,  
we'll take yer head right off yer shoulders!  
  
**Rei：**  
At this rate, I won't be able to save myself, let alone {player}...!  
Please be safe...!  
  
**Rei：**  
{player}! If you can hear me, please respond!  
We must come together!  
We need to combine our powers and break this deadlock!  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
What a pity.  
Ya can scream till yer lungs explode, but he won't hear a  
thing!  
Yer dead meat!  
  
**Rei：**  
Nguahhh!  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
Where's yer fightin' spirit now, huh?  
Looks like ya can barely even move...  
  
It's 'bout time I finished the job!  
  
**Rei：**  
...Why? Why am I down on my knees...?  
I'm using Princess Knight power, so why...?  
  
**Rei：**  
...Oh, that's why. I'm too comfortable borrowing his power.  
I've become spoiled and now rely on him too much...  
  
**Rei：**  
Thinking I've grown stronger on my own was simply a delusion...  
I'm stricter on myself than anyone else so I can become stronger,  
and yet...!  
  
**Rei：**  
I don't want to lose to likes of them in a miserable place like this...!  
What should I do...?! What can I do...?!  
  
**Bandit 3：**  
Hahahah! Gettin' physical with someone who can't fight back  
is kinda borin', right guys?  
  
**Bandit 4：**  
Hey! Ya won't get anywhere in life if ya never give a li'l back!  
Hahahahah!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  ...Rei! Believe in yourself!  
`Tag 9`  
**Rei：**  
Believe in myself...  
  
**Rei：**  
You still believe in me and continue to fight...  
  
I can't afford to doubt myself and be defeated!  
  
**Rei：**  
This time, I'll also believe in myself...  
In my past self... and my own strength!  
  
**Rei：**  
...I heard you. I heard your words.  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
Huh? Hey, are ya startin' to lose yer mind?  
  
**Rei：**  
No, I just know.  
I know exactly what he'd say to me in this situation...  
As long as he continues to believe in me, my strength knows no bounds!  
  

---  
  
**Rei：**  
Even if you're not by my side, no matter how far apart we may find  
ourselves, provided that I have your trust, I will never lose!  
  
**Rei：**  
And I'll prove it to you right here, right now! Here I go!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Whoah! She's suddenly movin' with much more skill!  
  
**Rei：**  
I can feel it... I can feel your power much stronger than ever!  
As it stands, I am invincible!  
  
**Rei：**  
Out of my way!  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
Don't get cocky!  
  
**Rei：**  
Take this! Tempest Slash!  
Haaaah!  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
I couldn't even see the attack...! Gahhhh!  
  
**Bandit 1 & Bandit 2：**  
Yaaaghhh!  
  
**Rei：**  
...I guess that's things taken care of on my end.  
But now I've got to get to him...!  
  
**Rei：**  
Don't think you can stop me with this!  
Haaaaah!  
  
**Bandit 3：**  
She broke the trap?!  
  
**Bandit 4：**  
What the hell?! Boss has been taken out?!  
  
**Rei：**  
Hey, are you okay?!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Just grand...  
`Tag 10`  
**Rei：**  
What are you taking about? You're covered in wounds!  
You must have fought hard...  
  
**Rei：**  
Hold on just a little longer. I've still got work to do.  
  
**Bandit 3：**  
Don't underestimate us! Hey, let's get her!  
  
**Bandit 4：**  
Yeah! Eat this!  
  
**Rei：**  
Too slow! I'll make you regret ever laying a finger on him!  
Haaaaah!  
  
**Bandit 3 & Bandit 4：**  
Aaaghhhhhhhh!  
  

---  
  
**Rei：**  
...It's over.  
Try not to move. It won't be world-class surgery, but I'll patch you up.  
  
**Rei：**  
I trusted that you'd be able to endure.  
It's a good thing I believed in myself and could fight on.  
  
**Rei：**  
...There we go.  
Let's drag these thugs back to the village.  
Give me a hand tying them up, will you?  
  
**Rei：**  
It was looking iffy, but we managed to make it back alive.  
Let's hurry up and hand over our prisoners to the mayor...  
  
**Village Mayor：**  
Lady Rei, you're back in one piece!  
My word, who are these fellows?  
  
**Rei：**  
These are the real culprits who attacked the village.  
They laid waste to your fields and livestock,  
then passed it off as the deeds of monsters. It was all their doing.  
  
**Village Mayor：**  
Seriously? It was these guys...?  
Thanks for putting a stop to them!  
Peace can now return to the village!  
  
**Rei：**  
Well then, we've got more towns to inspect—  
  
**Village Mayor：**  
Please wait!  
We absolutely cannot let you go without properly thanking you for all  
that you've done for us.  
Please, at least stay for dinner!  
  
**Rei：**  
Well, if you insist...  
  
Are you okay with that?  
  
**Choice: (11)**  Of course.  
**Choice: (12)**  I could eat a dragon!  
`Tag 11`  
**Rei：**  
Great.  
Then let's accept the mayor's kindness.

`Tag 12`  
**Rei：**  
Heheh.  
You're still like a child in that regard.  
  
`Tag 13`  
**Rei：**  
Mr. Mayor, we would be honored to stay for dinner.  
Also, we'd be grateful if you could have his wounds treated as well.  
  
**Village Mayor：**  
Most certainly!  
Ah, I see you're also covered in wounds...!  
Hey, everyone! We're going to have a village feast!  
But first, let's get those injuries seen to.  
  
**Rei：**  
Eh? Uh, that won't be necessary.  
A normal meal is more than enough for us.  
  
**Middle-Aged Woman：**  
We also need to thank you for the woodchopping.  
I'll bring out my reserve cheese!  
  
**Middle-Aged Man：**  
In that case, I'll bring out my best cured meat!  
It's the perfect time to eat it!  
  
**Rei：**  
Ah... So it's turning into a village affair after all...  
But I suppose we've come all this way, so we might as well enjoy ourselves.  
  
**Village Mayor：**  
Thanks to Lady Rei, our way of life has been protected!  
We'll never forget this debt of gratitude! For a lifetime... no, for  
generations to come, we will continue to worship Lady Rei!  
  
**Rei：**  
Ah, well...  
You don't have to go that far...  
  
**Village Mayor：**  
All right, everyone!  
Our feast today is to show our gratitude to Lady Rei.  
So have yourselves a splendid time!  
  
**Viallger 1：**  
Lady Rei!  
How about some of this here meat?  
  
**Rei：**  
Wow... That's a lot of meat...  
  
**Viallger 2：**  
Ah, perhaps fruits are more to your liking?  
We've got plenty over here!  
  
**Rei：**  
I, um...  
  
**Viallger 1：**  
Lady Rei!  
  
**Viallger 2：**  
Lady Rei!  
  
**Rei：**  
Er...  
Oh yeah!  
There was something I needed to discuss with my companion regarding  
today's report!  
...Right?  
  
**Choice: (14)**  Yeah, there was something.  
**Choice: (15)**  ...What now?  
`Tag 14`  
**Rei：**  
S-see!  
I'm not fibbing!  
  
Jump to tag 16  
`Tag 15`  
**Rei：**  
What's with that look?!  
Just nod your head and agree!  
  
`Tag 16`  
**Rei：**  
Therefore, I'm sorry to say, we must excuse ourselves for a short while.  
Please enjoy the feast, everyone.  
  
**Rei：**  
Phew... Finally a chance to breathe.  
Thanks for playing along. You're a lifesaver.  
  
**Rei：**  
The villagers are so overjoyed that, on the contrary, I cooled off instead.  
I just couldn't keep up with their excitement.  
  
**Rei：**  
Anyway... What happened today's really got me thinking.  
The quest for freedom on occasion produces fools like those bandits.  
  
**Rei：**  
...I imagine my father might see me the same way as them,  
taking advantage of others' actions and kindness.  
...  
If that's the case, I think I might understand his perspective a little.  
  
**Rei：**  
And I was able to save these villagers today because I was here in his  
name.  
If I'd said no when he first asked and prioritized freedom over  
his request,  
then this village might've been in deep trouble right now.  
  
**Rei：**  
...I knew my father's actions and words had some validity to them,  
but experiencing it like this gives me mixed feelings.  
  
**Rei：**  
Once the inspections are done, if I continue to go against my father for  
the sake of my own freedom, I'll likely never notice troubled people like  
these villagers, nor will I be able to rescue them.  
  
**Rei：**  
But even so, I...  
  
**Choice: (17)**  Why don't you try talking to your father?  
`Tag 17`  
**Rei：**  
But that...  
No, you're right. After we return to Landosol, I'll talk to my  
father. Not just about freedom, but to reach a compromise regarding  
my own path in life.  
  
**Rei：**  
...I'm going to stay here and enjoy the fresh air.  
You can head back first.  
  
**Choice: (18)**  Righto.  
`Tag 18`  
**Rei：**  
...Perhaps it's not only freedom I yearn for, but also the power to save
