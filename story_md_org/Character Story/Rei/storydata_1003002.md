# Rei Episode 2
{player}, having begun training under Rei, spends the better part of the day sparring with her. Rei regrets pushing him too far at first, but feels better after they talk about how they want to protect one another.
  
## Subtitle: Together, As One
  
**Narration：**  
{player}, under Rei's instruction,  
follows her to a nearby mountain range.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What are we doing here?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rei：**  
You really followed me without knowing?  
Sheesh... Honestly,  
I can't tell if you're brave or just foolish.  
  
**Rei：**  
I thought you'd figured it out considering the circumstances,  
but I guess not.  
  
**Rei：**  
You remember my promise to train you, don't you?  
That's why we're here.  
  
**Rei：**  
Facing monsters all the time can be a bit dangerous,  
so your opponent this time is yours truly.  
  
**Rei：**  
People rarely come here,  
so it's an ideal spot. We won't be causing any issues for anyone.  
  
**Rei：**  
Now then. Draw your sword!  
I want a good feel for your skill, so come at me with all you have.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Attack her.  
`Tag 2`  
**Rei：**  
Wait a minute.  
You can't be serious, can you?  
  
**Rei：**  
That was pathetic. You had no intent to attack me for real, did you?  
  
**Rei：**  
Don't play dumb with me, either.  
I'm skilled enough to know how my opponents approach me.  
There wasn't any weight behind your strike whatsoever.  
  
**Rei：**  
Did you hold back because it was me?  
Because you were afraid of hurting someone?  
I get that, but don't do it ever again against me.  
  
**Rei：**  
Don't worry. It might sound harsh,  
but you won't be able to land a hit on me. Not at your current level.  
  
**Rei：**  
There's no point in this if you're holding back.  
If you want to get stronger, then trust in my strength.  
Give me everything you've got!  
  
**Rei：**  
Yup, that's more like it!  
Keep it up!  
  
**Rei：**  
Now it's my turn!  
  
**Rei：**  
Don't worry. You should be able to just block it!  
It's simple. Just pay attention to my movements!  
From the side!  Above! Lastly, from below!  
  
**Rei：**  
I knew you had it in you!  
Okay. Now I'll up the pace a bit!  
  
**Rei：**  
Phew... Good job. You blocked them all.  
Proof that your eyes are starting to keep up.  
  
**Rei：**  
You're picking this up surprisingly quick.  
That just makes teaching you all the more worthwhile.  
  
**Rei：**  
Enough chat, though. Back to it!  
  
**Narration：**  
A few hours later.  
  
**Rei：**  
We're just getting started!  
Keep the attacks coming!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Please... Let me rest...  
**Choice: (4)**  R-right!  
`Tag 3`  
**Rei：**  
Don't sound so pathetic!  
We've still—  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Rei：**  
That's what I like to hear!  
...  
Hmm? What's wrong?  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Rei：**  
Wait. When did it get this late?!  
  
**Rei：**  
I'm so sorry. You've been making strides,  
so I got ahead of myself...  
We should take a break.  
  
**Rei：**  
What in the world is wrong with me?  
I should never have made you fight this long,  
let alone without a break.  
  
**Rei：**  
Umm...  
Do you still want to keep training with me? I won't blame you if you don't.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Of course.  
`Tag 6`  
**Rei：**  
That's... surprising.  
I thought I had broken you already.  
  
**Rei：**  
What makes you want to go through with this?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I want to be able to protect you.  
`Tag 7`  
**Rei：**  
Well then...  
Hehe. Quite the bold claim.  
But I'm happy to hear it.  
  
**Rei：**  
I'll be honest. I've always fought for myself.  
The idea of letting someone protect me was almost foreign.  
  
**Rei：**  
But the moment you said that,  
I felt a sense of relief pour over me.  
  
**Rei：**  
So... If you want to get stronger and protect me,  
it only makes sense that I do the same for you.  
How does that sound?  
  
**Rei：**  
Two people who strive to protect one another.  
Rather lovely, isn't it?  
  
**Rei：**  
Of course, I'll have to put in the work myself as well.  
So let's become stronger. Together.  
  
**Rei：**  
And with that said, it's time to get back to training!  
Come on, no time for dilly-dallying!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus the sound of their clashing swords  
rang into the night.
