**Narration：**  
Called out by Rei, {player} has made his way to the beach.  
  
**Rei：**  
Thanks for coming.  
Let's get started, shall we?  
  
**Rei：**  
...?  
What's with the sword?  
  
**Rei：**  
Here. I brought you a rod as well.  
Get yourself ready, sharp.  
  
**Rei：**  
Of course we're fishing. What else would we be doing?  
Wait, don't tell me you thought this was a training session?  
  
**Rei：**  
Come on. Even I need a break now and then.  
I'm sure the same goes for you, too.  
  
**Rei：**  
We can train any other day, so let's forget about it for now.  
A nice break now and then is good for the body and the soul.  
  
**Rei：**  
Looks like you're done.  
Now, we wait.  
  
**Rei：**  
...  
  
**Rei：**  
You know. I'm generally okay with being silent at this point,  
but that's when I'm alone. We're both together today,  
so let's talk about something.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Long, long ago. In a kingdom far away...  
**Choice: (2)**  Lovely weather, isn't it?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rei：**  
Oh, you little tease.  
You know that's not what I meant.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Rei：**  
You're right. It's perfect.  
  
**Rei：**  
Is that it?  
There has to be more you can talk about.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rei：**  
Oh, I know. Tell me about yourself.  
What you do when you're not with me, that sort of stuff.  
  
**Rei：**  
You crossed that mountain?!  
On your own, no less?!  
  
**Rei：**  
I mean. It makes sense if it was for work,  
but that's still amazing.  
There's plenty of monsters lurking around there.  
Were you okay with them?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Our training got me by somehow.  
`Tag 4`  
**Rei：**  
Well then.  
It's a relief to know all that time wasn't for naught, at least.  
  
**Rei：**  
If you can pull that off,  
then chances are you can handle monster extermination jobs on your own.  
  
**Rei：**  
You really are making strides.  
I can't imagine anything more rewarding as your teacher.  
  
**Rei：**  
Hmm... Maybe it's time for me step down?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Please don't.  
`Tag 5`  
**Rei：**  
Wha—?!  
U-umm... You didn't need to take me so seriously.  
  
**Rei：**  
S-sorry. I was just joking.  
Don't worry, I won't be leaving your side anytime soon.  
So—  
  
**Rei：**  
Hey, wait!  
You've got a bite!  
And a big one at that, based on the way it's pulling!  
  
**Rei：**  
This'll be a struggle on your own, so let's pull it in together!  
Stay calm, pick your timing right...  
Now!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH!  
  
**Rei：**  
Wha—?! It was a monster all along?!  
  
**Rei：**  
Well, that's not how I expected this to go.  
Either way, let's take it down!  
  
**Rei：**  
I'll draw its attention!  
You take it down when the opportunity comes!  
Hah! Yah!  
  
**Rei：**  
Now's your chance!  
Finish it!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Attack from its blind spot.  
`Tag 6`  
**Monster：**  
Rrrrghhhhh!  
  
**Rei：**  
Now that was teamwork.  
You just keep improving, don't you?  
  
**Rei：**  
Alas, though. That's all the fishing we can do for today.  
We won't be seeing any more fish around here  
for a while thanks to that monster.  
  
**Rei：**  
Which is a shame, considering we caught a grand total of none.  
  
**Rei：**  
Oh well. It happens.  
 Just part of the fishing experience.  
  
**Rei：**  
Let's make our way back to town.  
Oh, how about we get food as well?  
  
**Rei：**  
A-also. Following on from what I said earlier.  
You know. About stepping down as your teacher.  
  
**Rei：**  
I won't lie.  
I never realized just how happy it would make me  
to know that someone needed me so much.  
  
**Rei：**  
So yeah. Thank you.  
  
**Rei：**  
Erm... Uh...  
I need you just as much, just so you know.  
  
**Rei：**  
Th-that's all I wanted to say!  
Come on, let's hurry back!  
  
**Narration：**  
Rei, in an attempt to hide her flushed face,  
walked behind {player} the entire way home.
