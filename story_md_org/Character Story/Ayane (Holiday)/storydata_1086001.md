**Narration：**  
Two weeks before the holidays, Ayane and {player} are out shopping for cake in Landosol.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hey, look!  
I stacked a whole bunch of cakes up!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Come on, Ayane. How many times do I gotta tell you to  
think ahead? There's no way you'll eat that  
much with that tiny stomach of yours.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
I think you should zip it, Pukichi. Also, my stomach's not tiny!  
I've always got room for cake!  
And it's a buffet, so I can take as many as I want.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Any leftovers can go straight  
into {player}'s mouth. ♪  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Let's not be a nuisance to others.  
Sorry, {player}.  
Our little princess here can be a real handful, can't she?\"  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Doesn't bother me in the slightest.  
**Choice: (2)**  What kind of cakes did you get?  
`Tag 1`  
**Ayane：**  
Heh heh! ♪  
See?  
He's super fine with it!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Don't spoil her too much, {player}.  
You gotta be stern with her from time to time.\"  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Ayane：**  
Uhhh, pretty much everything that looked tasty!  
I even grabbed some old-fashioned sweets.  
And ice cream. And pudding!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Whoa there.  
What happened to picking out a cake for the party?\"  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Ayane：**  
Sheesh. You sure have a stick up your butt today.  
I don't wanna be on Santa's naughty list,  
so I've been a real good girl lately. Gimme a break.  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"You sure about that? You haven't been a little terror at least,  
but if I was Santa, you'd still make the naughty list, if barely.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Awww. Pukichi's being mean,  
so lemme hear your opinion.  
Have I been a good girl?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Wah?  
Ehehe. He gave me a headpat!  
Which means he thinks I've been a good girl!  
See? I was right!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"You're way too soft on her. Forget that, though.  
Ayane. You're blocking everyone's way there.  
Hurry up and sit down.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Okay!  
Can I sit on your lap, {player}?  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"There's a perfectly good chair across from him, you know.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Booo! I'd rather sit nice and close.  
I've got him all to myself today,  
so I wanna be super duper spoiled! ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
I always let Kokkoro and Kurumi spend time with him,  
but that's only 'cause I'm older than them.  
If I had it my way, he'd spoil me everyday. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Enough talk. It's time for cake!  
That plate's yours, and this one's mine.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I got one of each and split them between us,  
so give me a little bite if there's one you like!  
  
**Ayane：**  
There are still lots of other kinds, though.  
So let's eat these up first,  
then go get some more if we've still got room left. ♪  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"I can't speak for {player},  
but you won't even get through half of that.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yeah I will.  
Don't doubt a girl that's still growing.  
Now, without further ado...! ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
*munch, munch* ♪  
Delish! Especially this one with the strawberry on top!  
Want a bite, Pukichi?  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Whoa there. You know how hard cream is to wash off!  
Get that outta my face!\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Heehee. ♪  
Sorry, I forgot.  
Bears don't eat cake, do they?  
Oh, what a shame!  
Imagine not being able to taste this sweet delight!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Come on, {player}.  
Less staring and more eating!  
Open wide! ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
How is it? Tasty? Hehe.  
Let's eat a whole bunch and see which is best!  
  
**Ayane：**  
The whole reason we're here is to pick out a cake  
for the party at the orphanage, so we might as well.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Buffets like this make it easy to try out all types of stuff, right?  
That makes it a perfect fit for our goal.  
And I'm a genius for coming up with it. ☆  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh. You've even forgotten what a buffet is?  
Well, it basically means everything's all-you-can-eat!  
You see all the food lined up?  
You can take as much as you want!  
  
**Ayane：**  
My mom and dad used to take me here when I was little.  
Ehehe. That brings back memories.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh. I ended up picking out your share as well,  
but feel free to go grab anything else you want to eat.  
  
**Ayane：**  
W-waugh?  
What's wrong?  
Why'd you touch my lips?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh. 'Cause I got cake all over them?  
Guess that's what happens when you talk while eating.  
Thanks for wiping it off. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ehehe.  
You're always super kind.  
No doubt you'll get a present from Santa. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
...?  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Hm?  
Something up, Ayane?\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Pukichi! Look!  
L-look outside the window!  
  
**Ayane?：**  
Hmm, hmm, hmm... ♪  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"What the?  
That's you walking around out there!\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
No! I'm right here! That has to be a fake.  
It's one of those Shadows!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"O-oh. Its eyes are a real weird color, now that you mention it.  
How come no one's paying any attention to it, though?\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
More importantly! It's holding hands with someone, isn't it?  
But who...  
Ahhh! That's my mom and dad!  
  
**Ayane：**  
No! Don't take my mom and dad away from me!  
I know I'm a weirdo! I know I ran away from home! I'm a bad girl!  
  
**Ayane：**  
But that doesn't make it okay to bully me!  
Take my presents and cakes, I don't care!  
But don't take my mom and dad!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"A-Ayane? Settle down!  
You're gonna hurt yourself if you keep that up!\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"{player}! Calm her down, will you?!\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Noooooo! Mom! Dad!  
I'll be a good girl! I promise!  
So don't take them away from me!
