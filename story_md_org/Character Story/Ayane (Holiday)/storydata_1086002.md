# Ayane (Holiday) Episode 2
Ayane finally cheers up following the shock of seeing a Shadow walking with her parents. She goes into town with {player}, only to see said Shadow again, but something about its behavior seems odd.
  
## Subtitle: Mutual Feelings
  
**Narration：**  
A few days pass following Ayane witnessing a Shadow  
walking through town with her own parents.  
  
**Narration：**  
With her feeling dejected due to that turn of events, everyone else at  
the Sarendia Orphanage can't help but worry about her.  
  
**Saren：**  
{player}?  
Mind if I come in?  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm? What're you sitting on the floor for?  
Do you have a stomachache or something?  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh. You're making holiday decorations, aren't you?  
I can tell by the paper cutouts and such.  
Thanks. I really appreciate all the help.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm? You'll be on Santa's list if you're a good boy?  
Who got that idea into your head?  
  
**Saren：**  
Don't worry, though.  
I've already got your present figured out.  
  
**Saren：**  
More importantly, do you mind going shopping with  
Ayane for me? Once you're done, of course.  
I'd prefer it if we had plenty of supplies on hand before things get too busy.  
  
**Saren：**  
And, well, she won't tell me why, but you know how she's locked herself up  
in her room, right? Staying in there isn't good for her mental  
health, so help her get outside for some fresh air.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'd take her myself, but I'm tied down with other business.  
Namely Princess Knight's final meeting of the year. I hate to  
add more to your plate, but you're the only one I can rely on.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm more than happy to help.  
`Tag 1`  
**Saren：**  
Really? That's a relief.  
She seems to have opened herself up to you,  
so hear her out if she's got something on her mind, will you?  
  
**Saren：**  
Venting can work wonders, believe it or not.  
So yeah. Show me your big bro spirit. ♪  
  
**Saren：**  
...Whoa-oa-oa!

**Ayane：**  
{player}!  
Take a look at this! Ta-da!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Isn't it cute?!  
Mama Saren gave it to me!  
She said it's for the party!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Super duper cute!  
**Choice: (3)**  Where's mine?!  
`Tag 2`  
**Ayane：**  
Right?  
Keep the compliments coming!  
  
**Ayane：**  
And look! It's not just me!  
Pukichi's all dressed up too!  
Tell him he's cute!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Ayane：**  
Huh?! D-don't worry!  
I'm sure you've got one as well!  
  
**Saren：**  
He does. Suzume stayed up all night making one for everyone.  
Technically I could've just bought them,  
but it was cheaper this way.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Awww, come on.  
This is the one time of the year you're allowed to splurge.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm... We've got other expenses to worry about as well, alas.  
But anyway.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Saren：**  
It really suits you, Ayane.  
Gives you that real proper lady vibe. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yeah!  
Thanks, Mama Saren! I love you! ♪

**Saren：**  
Ahaha...  
She cheered up faster than I expected.  
Maybe I didn't need to ask for {player}'s help after all.  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Haha. She's just faking it.  
She doesn't wanna make everyone worry about her.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
You're going shopping, right?  
Then let's go together!  
I wanna show this outfit off to everyone!  
  
**Saren：**  
Sure. Have fun.  
Just don't stay out too late, you hear?  
  
**Ayane：**  
I know, I know!  
I'm not a kid!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Let's go!  
Ehehe. Another day of having you all to myself. ☆  
  
**Narration：**  
A few hours later,  
Ayane and {player} finish off the last of their shopping.  
  
**Ayane：**  
That should be the last of it, right?  
That sure went by quick!  
  
**Ayane：**  
It used to take me ages back in the day because I  
didn't know how to shop efficiently,  
but now I'm just a big old shopping pro! Heh heh! ♪  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Not really something worth bragging about.  
But oh well. I'm just glad to see you're enjoying herself.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
I am. Sorry, you two.  
I had you all worried, didn't I?  
  
**Ayane：**  
But it's okay. I'm better now.  
How could I not be?  
You've all be super, super kind to me.  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Really?  
You don't need to force a smile, you know.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Hm...?\"  
  
**Staff：**  
Excuse me, miss.  
I'd prefer it if you didn't just stand in front of the store all day.  
Is there something you're looking for?  
  
**Ayane?：**  
...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh! It's that Shadow again!  
What's it doing just standing there?  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Hmmm.  
Looks like it's staring into the store.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
L-let's get a bit closer.  
I dunno what that Shadow's deal is,  
but I'm curious when it looks so much like me.  
  
**Ayane?：**  
...  
  
**Staff：**  
Hey, wait! What're you doing?!  
You tried to take one of our goods there, didn't you?  
  
**Staff：**  
You need to pay first!  
Say, where are you from? Where are your parents?  
  
**Ayane?：**  
My... parents?  
Mom and dad?  
  
**Ayane?：**  
Ehehe.  
They always give me nice presents,  
so I wanna get them something this year!  
It's my way of thanking them and saying \"I love you!\"  
  
**Staff：**  
That's a beautiful thing to do, of course.  
But I can't just let you take it for free, I'm afraid.  
Do you have any money on you?  
  
**Ayane?：**  
I love my mom and dad!  
  
**Staff：**  
Hm...? You sure are an odd one...  
Wait a minute... Those eyes of yours! No way!  
  
**Ayane：**  
...Um, excuse me!  
Sorry about that. My sister can be a bit awkward sometimes!  
I'll pay for her, so please let her off!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"H-hey, Ayane?  
What's gotten into you?\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
I-I can't bring myself to leave her alone.  
Okay, here's the money! Is it enough?  
  
**Staff：**  
Huh? I mean, yeah. It is.  
Be careful, though!  
This has to be one of those Shadows people are talking about!  
  
**Ayane：**  
N-no she's not!  
She's not some weird monster!  
  
**Ayane：**  
I paid up, so I'll take that.  
Bye-bye!  
  
**Staff：**  
Errr, okay?  
Thanks for your patronage, I think?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Okay, sister of mine. Let's go!  
You come with us, {player}.  
We gotta find a place where there's no one else around!  
  
**Ayane?：**  
Sister? I'm an only child, so I always wanted one.  
I even asked mom and dad for one!  
\"Give me a sister as a present,\" I said!  
  
**Ayane?：**  
They looked so troubled! It was funny!  
Ahaha, ahahaha... ☆  
  
**Ayane：**  
Quit laughing and start moving!  
Seriously, what's with this Shadow?
