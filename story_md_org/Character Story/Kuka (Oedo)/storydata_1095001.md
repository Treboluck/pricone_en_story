# Kuka (Oedo) Episode 1
When Kuka shows interest in a kimono hanging in the window of a clothing rental shop, the owner asks her to wear it around town as a form of advertisement. Almost as soon as she tries the kimono on, she trips, and inadvertently finds herself experiencing the famous kimono belt spin she's always dreamed of.

**Narration：**  
As {player} walks through the business district,  
he spots Kuka staring at something in a shop window.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Gueheh... The kimonos in this clothing rental shop are all so lovely...  
Ah, kimonos... Famous for being easy to remove...  
  
**Kuka：**  
If I wore one, I could be subjected to some of this, or that...  
A-aaaahhh, o-or even *that*...!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Aaaahhhh! If that really happened, then I... then I'd be...!  
Oh, please, please...!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Mr. Sadist, please forgive meeeee!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What are you doing?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kuka：**  
...Ahh?! M-Mr. Sadist, how long have you been there?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-I was just, ah, looking at this kimono here...  
Certainly not thinking anything terribly indecent!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You want to try wearing a kimono?  
`Tag 2`  
**Kuka：**  
Huh? A kimono? Me?  
N-no, no, no! Wh-why would I want to do that?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
To think you'd suggest such a thing...  
 Could this mean...?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
You want to get me in a kimono  
so you can do all kinds of new naughty things?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ahh, Mr. Sadist, gazing at me draped in unfamiliar garb...  
He examines every inch of my body, and then...  
\"Now show me what's underneath.\"  
 Aaahhhhh!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Consumed by the throes of desire, he moves hungrily in...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Eheh... Gueheheh... I can't wait!  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Hello, miss. You seem interested in this kimono.  
Would you like to try it on?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Huh? M-me? Try on this kimono?!  
B-but, ah... I don't have the money on me...  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
No worries there. I don't want payment.  
But in exchange, there's a favor I'd like to ask...  
  
**Kuka：**  
A-a request for me...?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Oh no! What are you trying to make me do in that kimono?!  
I mustn't! I'm not ready to go down that path...!  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Please! I need your help!  
  
**Kuka：**  
N-no, I can't! My heart... My heart belongs to Mr. Sadist...!  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
I just need you to walk around town in this kimono!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Eeek! To expose myself to hundreds of passersby?!  
...  
Wait, huh? Walk around town... Is that really all?  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
This kimono gets a lot of curious gazes,  
but not many prospective buyers.  
I thought if you modeled it around the city, it might raise interest.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Oh, I see... That's what you meant...  
But wearing this in public might still be a lot for me to handle...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'd love to see you in it.  
**Choice: (4)**  I think it would really suit you.  
`Tag 3`  
**Kuka：**  
Ehh?  
 M-Mr. Sadist, you really want to see it?  
I always knew you were after my body!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Kuka：**  
S-such open praise!  
You're trying to seduce me with honeyed words, aren't you?!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Kuka：**  
A-all right.  
Mr. Sadist, if you want to watch me squirm in shame so badly...  
 I'll do it!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Gueheh... This is even better than I imagined... I love it!  
  
**Kuka：**  
The suffocating pressure of the belt as it digs into my helpless flesh...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ahh, I'm getting more excited than ever...  
 *drool*  
  
**Kuka：**  
B-but, ah... Walking in this is tricky...  
If I'm not careful, I might trip right—  
waaghh!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Uergh... H-huh? I fell over, but it doesn't hurt...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Wait, whueeehh?! C-could it be...?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
A-am I resting in the embrace  
of Mr. Sadist's strong and unyielding arms?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-I'm so sorry! I'll get up right—  
huh?  
What's this tugging on my belt?

**Kuka：**  
It's coming undone! Waaaaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I can't stop spinning around!  
C-c-could this be that famous routine...?!

**Kuka：**  
Ohhhhh myyyyyyyyyy!  
  
**Kuka：**  
M-Mr. Sadist... You're incredible...  
 Seizing my belt  
just when I expected it the least... Ohhh... *drool*...  
  
**Narration：**  
Though her belt had sent her into the dizziest of whirls,  
Kuka's face looked positively ecstatic.
