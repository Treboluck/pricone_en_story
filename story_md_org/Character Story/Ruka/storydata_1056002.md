**Narration：**  
Ruka and {player}, who's helping with  
Ruka's part-time work, make their way to a town along  
the coast to procure some fish.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Phew. Finally here.  
I'm counting on you today, partner.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Though we're just picking up the fish and bringing it back,  
so there's no need to stress out about it.  
  
**Fisherman 1：**  
Hey there, Ruka.  
I... take it the news hasn't made it back to Landosol yet.  
  
**Ruka：**  
You seem pretty dejected.  
What's up? Did something happen?  
  
**Fisherman 1：**  
I'll give it to you straight.  
I've got absolutely no fish to sell you today.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Not a single one?  
  
**Fisherman 1：**  
Yup. Not a single one.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Fill me in.  
  
**Fisherman 1：**  
Well... A monster's been rampaging across the coast lately.  
None of us can go out to fish.  
And it's not just here—it's popping up at the next town over, too.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Which means we'd be wasting our time if we went there, huh...  
  
**Fisherman 2：**  
Aye. It's been pretty grim for us back home.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh. You're from there, aren't you?  
  
**Fisherman 2：**  
It's not just us, either.  
Even customers like you are suffering thanks to that thing!  
  
**Fisherman 3：**  
Dammit! We're done for at this rate!  
You sure there's no way for us to deal with it?!  
  
**Fisherman 1：**  
We tried everything we could! Hell, even you guys gave up hope!  
We'd have gotten rid of it already if we could,  
so quit it with the stupid questions!  
  
**Fisherman 3：**  
What'd you just say?!  
I don't need some dumbass going off at me!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Would you two quit whining?! It's pathetic!  
Adults shouldn't be bickering at times like this!  
If you want to complain, then go do it elsewhere!  
  
**Fisherman 2：**  
Sorry... We really did everything we could, though.  
It just wasn't enough!  
Arrows and magic won't work on that thing!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Wait, magic too? That's not good.  
  
**Ruka：**  
In that case, I'm the only one that  
can do anything about it. Good grief.  
Guess I don't have much of a choice.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Leave it to me. I'll deal with that thing.  
  
**Fisherman 3：**  
W-wait, for real?!  
I know you've got a nice sword there,  
but aren't you just a fishmonger?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Doesn't matter. As long as that thing goes down, it's fine, right?  
One condition, though. Give me a little discount after it's gone, okay?  
  
**Fisherman 1：**  
G-got it.  
It'll be more than a little, at that.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Perfect. Just leave this to me.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hm...?  
Is this an earthquake? That's pretty rare.  
  
**Fisherman 3：**  
That's no earthquake. It's—!  
  
**Monster：**  
Rrrrrrraaaaargghhh!  
  
**Fisherman 2：**  
It's back! Run!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Well that's convenient.  
Now we don't need to track it down.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Will you be okay?  
**Choice: (2)**  I-I'm kind of worried.  
`Tag 1`  
**Ruka：**  
Haha. Figures that you'd be worried about me.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Ruka：**  
It's all right,  
I'm here with you. Don't forget that.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Ruka：**  
I've taken down plenty of monsters like this before.  
You just stay back!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  No. I'll help.  
`Tag 4`  
**Ruka：**  
Hey!  
...  
You're serious, aren't you?  
Got it!  
Then do me a favor and get its attention! Just for a little bit!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH!  
  
**Fisherman 1：**  
Whoa?!  
Didn't think that kid had the guts!  
  
**Fisherman 2：**  
He's buying time, but what's Ruka up to?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
...  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Fisherman 1：**  
Get outta there, kid!  
Ahhh!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Now!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hah! First Strike: Reticence!  
  
**Monster：**  
GREEOOOUGHHHH!  
  
**Fisherman 3：**  
Oh my god! That was amazing!  
  
**Ruka：**  
It's not over yet, though!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Fisherman 1：**  
How's it still moving?!  
Ruka! Get out of there!  
  
**Ruka：**  
I wasn't expecting it to survive that!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Did I not imbue enough chi into that strike?!  
Either way, I can't back down now!  
It's up to me to protect them! To protect *him!*  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Ruka!  
`Tag 5`  
**Ruka：**  
W-what the?! What's going on?!  
I can feel my power overflowing!  
  
**Ruka：**  
The flow of my chi feels a lot smoother, too!  
I can do this!  
  
**Ruka：**  
If it's a fight you want, I'm happy to oblige!  
Second Strike: Autumn Deluge!  
  
**Monster：**  
GREEOOOUGHHHH!  
  
**Fisherman 1：**  
Whoa! Incredible! She actually pulled it off!  
  
**Fisherman 2：**  
The ocean's safe again now! Thank you so much!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Phew...  
I was a bit worried for a minute there, but it all worked out.  
  
**Ruka：**  
You put in some good work, yourself.  
You've got an impressive pair of legs on you.  
But I have to know...  
Were you responsible for what happened just then?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Yup.  
**Choice: (7)**  I didn't do anything of note.  
`Tag 6`  
**Ruka：**  
I knew it.  
Now that's an incredible technique you've got there!  
  
Jump to tag 8  
`Tag 7`  
**Ruka：**  
No need to be humble.  
You sure caught me off guard with it!  
  
`Tag 8`  
**Ruka：**  
I'd be in a pretty bad state if it weren't for you, you know.  
And for that, you get some praise! Attaboy!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oops.  
Sorry about that.  
Seeing you put that much effort in made me want to hug you.  
Really, though—thanks. You saved me big time.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Mind lending me a hand again if I need it? I'd really appreciate it.  
For now, though, let's go catch ourselves some fish!  
We can stock up after that!  
  
**Narration：**  
Following the day's events, Ruka came to see  
{player} as a reliable partner.
