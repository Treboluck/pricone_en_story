**Narration：**  
Having finally reclaimed her peaceful lifestyle,  
Ruka is about to take a nap just outside of town.  
  
**Ruka：**  
*yawn*  
No better time for a nap than now, I'd say.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are naps really that nice?  
`Tag 1`  
**Ruka：**  
Hey there.  
You bet they are. Especially after all that nonsense  
with the bewitched blade and what followed.  
This is the first time I've been able to relax in a good while.  
  
**Ruka：**  
How about joining me?  
Not everyone gets to occupy this premium spot beside me.  
Haha. Just kidding.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Huh. What's with that look?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  There's something I've been meaning to ask.  
`Tag 2`  
**Ruka：**  
Oh? I'm all ears.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Am I dear to you?  
`Tag 3`  
**Ruka：**  
Bwuh?!  
Y-you can't just ask that out of nowhere!  
I mean, I *did* say that back then, but well...  
  
**Ruka：**  
I got caught up in the moment and let it slip back then...  
He's a lot sharper than he lets on, isn't he?  
  
**Ruka：**  
It's not like I was lying or anything, but...  
Wait, hold on! Why am I panicking over this?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
L-let's put that aside for now, okay?  
The sun's nice and bright today,  
so it's about time I get my nap!  
  
**Ruka：**  
This is weird... It's way too bright to sleep,  
but I'm just... so tired...  
  

---  
  
**Ruka：**  
Sheesh. How do I even go about this?  
It's not like I can just turn down the chairman...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh, hey there. I take it you're out shopping?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Me?  
I'm just...  
Out on a walk. Yeah. See you around.  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day...  
  
**Follower：**  
Hey! You're the guy that's always with Boss Lady Ruka, ain't ya?  
I'm one of her followers!  
  
**Follower：**  
I bet you're worried about her too, huh?  
No wonder she trusts you so much!  
She talks about you a lot, ya know.  
  
**Follower：**  
Man, though. She really is too nice, ain't she? I know it's the  
chairman of the shopping district and all, but just 'cause he wants  
to set her up with someone doesn't mean she needs to go.  
  
**Follower：**  
Hey, what's up?  
Wait. Don't tell me you didn't know?!  
Come on, Boss Lady! You gotta fill a brother in!  
  
**Follower：**  
Lemme get you up to speed. That dude she's being set up with?  
He's as wild as they come!  
  
**Follower：**  
He plays the part of a nice, chill dude,  
but behind the scenes?  
He's the sorta guy that even us hoodlums don't wanna go near.  
  
**Follower：**  
Ain't got a doubt that Boss Lady'll be fine and all.  
But it's hard not to worry when that sorta person's involved.  
  
**Follower：**  
Me and my buds planned on crashing the whole thing,  
but she found out. Now I'm stuck here all miserable.  
  
**Follower：**  
But you're special! She respects you!  
If anyone can do anything about this, it's you!  
So here. It's a map to where they're meeting!  
  
**Follower：**  
It's all in your hands, brother! Help her out!  
  
**Narration：**  
Map in hand,  
{player} rushes to the meeting spot.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Would you... mind repeating that for me?  
  
**Prospective Husband：**  
I'm telling you to get rid of those foul rats that hang around you.  
You're wasting your time with vermin like that.  
  
**Prospective Husband：**  
They'll never become proper, refined citizens.  
Once a scumbag, always a scumbag.

**Ruka：**  
You sure like to talk the talk, don't you? You're way more of  
a scumbag than they ever were! And you know what?  
I'm just in the mood to rip you a new one!  
  
**Prospective Husband：**  
Eeeeeek!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Everyone makes mistakes, you know.  
That's why they also have the right to start over!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Don't judge those guys by their appearance.  
They're trying their best to make things right.  
To live a proper life.  
  
**Prospective Husband：**  
C-calm down, geez!  
Why are you flipping out over a bunch of dirty delinquents?!  
  
**Prospective Husband：**  
Besides, you know what'll happen if you piss me off!  
That person I just spoke to you about'll have his  
way with your store and the whole shopping district!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh, right. Him. It's funny you say that, really,  
considering I spoke to him on the phone yesterday.  
He gave me the go ahead to make your head roll.  
  
**Prospective Husband：**  
What?  
Y-you're bluffing!  
There's no way you'd know who he is!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Let's just say we've had a run-in in the past.  
He seemed pretty confident that this whole thing with  
you and me wouldn't work out, too.  
  
**Ruka：**  
In fact, he had a good laugh knowing that I wouldn't be  
able to resist cutting down a rotten scoundrel like you.  
I hope you're ready. Because I'm going to make this painful!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Ruka! Calm down!  
`Tag 4`  
**Ruka：**  
Huh?! Why are you here?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
I'm calm as can be. Don't worry, this isn't a real sword.  
He won't get hurt that much. So long as I hold back, at least.  
  
**Prospective Husband：**  
H-hold up! Who the hell are you?!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Ruka's dear to me, you know.  
**Choice: (6)**  You can call me Ruka's boyfriend.  
`Tag 5`  
**Ruka：**  
H-hey...!  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Ruka：**  
W-wait, what?! When did that happen?!  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Prospective Husband：**  
S-say what?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
I... I didn't know you felt that way about me...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Grab her hand and run.  
`Tag 8`  
**Ruka：**  
Hey! Hold on a minute, will you?!  
Did you really mean what you said back there?!  
Come on! Tell me!

**Ameth：**  
And that's that. Welcome back. Did you enjoy that little dream?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Color me surprised, though. I never thought anyone would  
try and pull a stunt like that while being set up with someone.  
Ruka's as tough over there as she is here, isn't she?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Not only can she fend for herself,  
she also cares for the people that look up to her.  
That makes her the ideal adult in my eyes.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Seems like her one weakness is you, though.  
Gotta admit, her getting all flustered was really cute. ♪  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway,  
I had my fun, so that's enough for today.  
Catch you later.  
  

---  
  
**Ruka：**  
Mmm... H-huh?  
When'd I fall asleep...?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh. Guess I wasn't the only one.  
Didn't something similar happen before, actually?  
  
**Ruka：**  
You said I was dear to you. Then you took my hand...  
Or at least, I think that's how it went...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Wait. I'm just talking about a dream I had!  
Don't take it to heart!  
  
**Ruka：**  
A-anyway!  
Might as well go grab a bite together!  
Come on, get yourself up! We're heading back to town!  
No time to waste!  
  
**Ruka：**  
I don't know why, but something about you feels different now.  
Like you've become someone I can really rely on.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Also, it might have been just a dream,  
but I was really happy when you took my hand.  
  
**Ruka：**  
I couldn't bring myself to say it out loud,  
but you *are* dear to me.  
You have been for a while now.  
  
**Ruka：**  
But what about you?  
Do you feel the same way about me?  
  
**Ruka：**  
J-just ignore me, okay?  
Quit looking back and get going!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus Ruka spent many a day unable to  
make eye contact with {player}.
