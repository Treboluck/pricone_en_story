**Narration：**  
{player} finds Ruka surrounded by townsfolk,  
a troubles expression on her face.  
  
**Ruka：**  
This isn't something I can sort out on my own...  
But I'll ask around for someone with more expertise.  
How does that sound?  
  
**Citizen：**  
There's no telling how long that'll take, right?  
The royal knights aren't doing anything about it,  
so we kind of want this solved as quickly as possible.  
  
**Citizen's Daughter：**  
Hey, Ruka... Are you just gonna leave the ghost alone?  
  
**Ruka：**  
I never said that...  
This sure got complicated.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's up?  
`Tag 1`  
**Ruka：**  
Oh, hey there.  
Wait. How could I forget about you?!  
You've just saved the day!  
  
**Citizen：**  
He a friend of yours?  
  
**Ruka：**  
That he is. He's more reliable than he looks, too.  
I'm sure he can do something about that ghost.  
  
**Citizen：**  
Truth is, there've been rumors of a ghost showing up in the city's  
graveyard. That's got everyone on edge, so...  
we'd really appreciate your help.  
  
**Citizen's Daughter：**  
Please help us, Mister.  
  
**Ruka：**  
There you have it. I'll be relying on you as always.  
Tonight, we go ghost hunting.  
  
**Narration：**  
That night, Ruka and {player}  
arrange to meet up before making their way to the graveyard.  
  
**Ruka：**  
You sure took your time, didn't you?  
What were you even doing?  
I'd appreciate it if you didn't keep me waiting.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Was I that late?  
**Choice: (3)**  Pretty sure I'm right on time.  
`Tag 2`  
**Ruka：**  
Well, uh, just a bit...  
But it doesn't change the fact that I was waiting!

`Tag 3`  
**Ruka：**  
You're thirty seconds late, I'll have you know.  
Normally I'd be okay with it,  
but I need you to be in top form tonight.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Ruka：**  
Besides, it's dangerous at this time, regardless of the fact that  
we're still in town. So yeah, just... Actually. Forget it.  
Let's get going.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Really though. Everyone's overreacting about this ghost nonsense.  
Even if there is one, it's no different from a monster in the end.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Convincing yourself that there's something there is  
the real issue, honestly. If you can't see it, then it's not there!  
That's all there is to it.  
  
**Ruka：**  
But people go on about hearing or seeing stuff. It's crazy.  
Most of the time it's just the wind. That or a bug flying by.  
  
**Ruka：**  
In other words, people just jumping to conclusion.  
You agree, right?  
  
**Ruka：**  
I get that kids can be scared, but full-grown adults?  
That's just tragic.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  What's gotten into you?  
`Tag 5`  
**Ruka：**  
N-nothing. What makes you ask?  
I'm acting the same as I always do.  
Just good old Ruka. Hahaha...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh. The graveyard's just up ahead.  
You take the lead from here on.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Me? I'll be right behind you, keeping you safe.  
  
**Ruka：**  
What's wrong? You don't need me to push you forward, do you?  
Come on, don't worry. I'm right here with you.  
So go ahead. Get going!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Everything seems okay for now... Thank goodness for that.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hey! W-wait up a second!  
Don't go speeding off like that!  
Let's take it a bit slower, okay?  
  
**Ruka：**  
I mean, uh...  
It'll be hard to keep you safe otherwise, right?  
Things could go south quickly if we're not in perfect sync.  
Yeah, that's it.  
  
**Ruka：**  
All right, let's get going...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Come on out, ghost. I'll take you down in one strike!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Where are you?  
Quit hiding...  
Show yourself already!  
  
**Ruka：**  
*pant* *pant*  *pant*  
  
**Ruka：**  
Don't worry. It's fine.  
I'm not... I'm not scared!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  You didn't want to come here, did you?  
`Tag 6`  
**Ruka：**  
O-oh please! What do you take me for?  
You don't actually think I'm scared, do you?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Don't be silly. Sure, it's a paranormal phenomenon.  
But that fact alone isn't going to scare me. Haha. Hahaha...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Fine, I give in. I can't hold up this act much longer.  
You want the truth, right? Then I'll tell you.  
  
**Ruka：**  
You were right on the mark. I really,  
really don't want to be here. I'm no good with ghosts.  
Just the idea has me terrified.  
  
**Ruka：**  
I'd have run off already if you weren't with me...  
It's pathetic, I know, but I just can't help it.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Take her hand.  
**Choice: (8)**  Hug her.  
`Tag 7`  
**Ruka：**  
Is this your way of cheering me up?  
Thanks. I appreciate it.

`Tag 8`  
**Ruka：**  
W-whoa there!  
Talk about reversing the roles.  
...I'll be honest, though. This isn't a bad feeling.  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Ruka：**  
This whole situation doesn't scare you one bit though, huh?  
Meanwhile I'm here shivering away...  
  
**Ruka：**  
It'd be a shame to let it end like this.  
Just watch. The second that ghost turns up, I'll—  
  
**???：**  
...one's...ere...  
  
**???：**  
...ood...usted...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Did you hear that?  
That was definitely a voice, wasn't it?  
Don't tell me... the ghost actually appeared?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
C-calm down, Ruka.  
Don't jump to conclusions before we determine the source.  
  
**Ruka：**  
It came from... over there, right?  
Let's take the initiative!  
I'll scare it first!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hey, ghost!  
Let's get a look at that ugly face of yours!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Shut the hell up!  
Who're you clowns supposed to be?!  
  
**Man 2：**  
They're armed, too.  
How'd you find out about us?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Huh? Wait, so we're just dealing with regular people here?  
No ghosts in sight?  
  
**Man 1：**  
Yeah. Ain't no ghosts here.  
But you can bet your ass that you're about to become one!  
We ain't handing this over, no matter what!  
  
**Ruka：**  
What? Hmm...  
I assume you're talking that jewel you've got there?  
  
**Man 2：**  
Quit the act! It's obvious one of our rivals sent you here!  
This is where we deal in stolen goods.  
You wouldn't come here if you didn't know that!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Stolen goods?  
That better not mean what I think it means!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Sure does, lady!  
Too bad, though. We were sure people would stay away  
from here if we spread those rumors about a ghost sighting!  
  
**Man 2：**  
You seem pretty clueless,  
but who cares!  
Fact of the matter is you found us,  
so we've got some cleanup duty to do!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Sheesh. Talk about a disappointing punchline.  
I might have preferred dealing with a ghost over these crooks.  
Oh well, though. We can't just ignore them now.  
  
**Thief 1：**  
Right back atcha!  
The both of you are goin' down!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Sorry, but that's not happening. No need for me to hold back  
when I know I'm dealing with common crooks.  
I'll end this quick! Third Strike: Twilight Sky!  
  
**Thief 2：**  
Aaaaaaghhh!  
  
**Thief 1：**  
Gyeeearghh!  
  
**Narration：**  
Having taken both men down in one strike,  
Ruka and {player} hand them over to the authorities.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Thanks for the help, as always.  
Good to know we got that all sorted out.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Also, uh... About what happened back there.  
Me being afraid of ghosts and all that.  
Would you mind keeping that just between the two of us?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Things would get very... complicated if Mitsuki and co. found out.  
So yeah. Please.  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Now that's a tough one...  
**Choice: (11)**  Say it in a cuter tone and I'll think about it.  
`Tag 10`  
**Ruka：**  
Hey now... No need to be such a bully.  
I'd really, really appreciate it.  
  
Jump to tag 12  
`Tag 11`  
**Ruka：**  
A-a cuter tone?  
I'd rather not...  
Come on. I'm not asking for much here.  
  
`Tag 12`  
**Ruka：**  
Please? I'm begging you...  
  
**Narration：**  
Feeling some satisfaction over having learned about a hidden side  
to the usually cool and confident Ruka, {player}  
agreed to keep her secret between the two of them.
