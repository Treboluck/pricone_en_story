**Narration：**  
The incident with the bewitched blade has raised Ruka's popularity  
to an all-time high. But dealing with all the people that try  
to approach her has left her somewhat exhausted.  
  
**Ruka：**  
*sigh*  
  
**Boy：**  
Hey, it's Ruka!  
Do your cool sword stuff for me!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Don't be silly. That's not something I do for show.  
Maybe next time, okay?  
  
**Old Man：**  
Ruka. Are you sure you can't help with my situation?  
  
**Ruka：**  
You really need to ask someone else.  
I can even introduce you if need be.  
As for today, though, I'm about to go fishing.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Ruka! I finally found you!  
Can we talk about setting you up with my son?  
  
**Ruka：**  
I already told you that's not happening!  
Oh, hey! You certainly took your time!  
Let's get going. Quick!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Sorry about that. I kind of had to use you to get away from there.  
Sure feels like a long time since I last saw you.  
  
**Ruka：**  
You remember our run-in with that bewitched blade?  
Turns out stories about that have spread pretty far.  
At this point, I'm kind of the talk of the town.  
  
**Ruka：**  
I've got all sorts of people approaching me now thanks to that.  
Most of them who I don't even know,  
including the people back there.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You okay?  
`Tag 1`  
**Ruka：**  
Yeah. I'm fine.  
Thanks for the concern.  
I'd rather not make you worry any more, though.  
  
**Ruka：**  
More importantly, why am I getting all the credit in the end?  
You're the one that put your life on the line.  
It's only fair that people recognize that.  
  
**Challenger：**  
Greetings! I trust you're the very same Lady Ruka who disposed  
of that slasher? If so, I would like to request a duel with you!  
  
**Ruka：**  
No thanks! Quick, let's get out of here!  
  
**Challenger：**  
W-wait! You can't flee after it took me so long to find you!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Argh, come on! I'm sick of this already!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Okay, back on topic.  
This newfound fame's led a bunch of people to try  
and boost their own reputation by challenging and defeating me.  
  
**Ruka：**  
But honestly? I just want to live a nice, relaxed life.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Helping people in need is all well and good.  
But why should I indulge others in pointless conflict?  
  
**Ruka：**  
If they want to prove their strength,  
they should just go fight some monsters.  
Right?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I get where you're coming from.  
**Choice: (3)**  Try not to think about it too much.  
`Tag 2`  
**Ruka：**  
Phew... Hearing that from you's a big relief.  
I honestly just don't want to fight unless it's  
for someone else's sake.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Ruka：**  
Thanks.  
I'm trying not to, but it's kind of hard...  
Ideally I'd just not have to worry about it in the first place.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Ruka：**  
You know what's even more frustrating about all this?  
I can't even sit back and fish in peace anymore.  
No opportunities to nap, either. Sheesh.  
  
**Ruka：**  
It's nice being able to get that off my chest, though.  
Funny how you're always here to help at the end of the day.  
  
**Ruka：**  
My guildmates have all been pretty busy recently, too,  
so this is the first time I've had a real chance to talk about it.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Say,  
how does going for some lunch sound?  
There's still plenty I want to talk about.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Ahhh... It's nice being able to finally relax.  
  
**Ruka：**  
I was kind of hoping we'd have the opportunity to  
unwind together like this sometime, too.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh yeah. I still haven't tried the fish set here,  
now that I think about it.  
Want to try it with me?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Excuse me! We're ready to or—  
  
**Woman：**  
You're Ruka, aren't you?  
  
**Ruka：**  
I am. And who are you, exactly?  
  
**Woman：**  
Prepare yourself!  
I'm here to take revenge on you for my brother!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Well that doesn't sound pleasant.  
Scuttle on home before you get hurt, will you?  
  
**Woman：**  
Shut up! It's your fault that he got caught!  
Now he's rotting away in a cell for producing illegal magical equipment!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh. That definitely rings a bell.  
Sorry, but your brother was a villain through and through.  
He had it coming.  
  
**Woman：**  
What he did was wrong, sure.  
But he was always kind to me and our parents!  
  
**Ruka：**  
That doesn't change anything.  
To you, he was a kind brother.  
To me, he was just a villain. Plain and simple.  
  
**Woman：**  
Fine. Then the same applies to you. There's plenty of  
people who hold a grudge against you. That makes you  
a villain to us. And we have every right to take you down!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Are there now? Then how about you round them up for me?  
I wouldn't mind taking out all this frustration on them.  
  
**Woman：**  
Be careful what you wish for!  
  
**Man 1：**  
So that's her, huh?!  
  
**Man 2：**  
You're gonna pay for what you did to my bud!  
  
**Man 3：**  
Hope you're ready for a one-way trip to hell!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Well, would you look at that. She really did round them up.  
  
**Woman：**  
It's not just people with a grudge against you, either.  
You've avoided plenty of duels, so I brought them as well.  
There's dozens of us here!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Good grief. There really is no upside to being strong, is there?  
The more I fight, the harder it is to escape the fallout from it.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Offer to fight by her side.  
`Tag 5`  
**Ruka：**  
Thanks, but I'd rather you sit this one out.  
This isn't a matter you should get yourself involved in.  
  
**Ruka：**  
You reap what you sow. And I've sown a lot.  
There is one thing you can do, though.  
Mind taking care of my fishing equipment for me?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Anyone that's got an issue with me, step up or shut up!  
Let's settle this outside!  
  
**Ruka：**  
We won't bother anyone else here.  
Dealing with you one by one is too much of a pain,  
so just come at me.  
  
**Man 1：**  
Let's party, troops!  
  
**Man 2：**  
You ain't the boss here!  
Go get her!  
  
**Man 3：**  
I'mma slice you up nice and good!  
  
**Woman：**  
Be careful if you're using magic!  
Make sure she's the only one you hit!  
  
**Ruka：**  
This will go south real quick if I don't focus.  
Get ready! I'm going all out! Hah!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Nngh!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hah!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Gragh!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hup!  
  
**Man 3：**  
Argh!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Dammit! They weren't lying about how strong she is!  
  
**Man 1：**  
That kid over there... he was with Ruka, wasn't he?  
Think you can just sit back and watch, eh?! Raaagh!  
  
**Ruka：**  
What the?!  
Quit it!  
He's got nothing to do with this! Don't get him involved!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Shut it! I'll take any shortcut I need to put you down for good!  
  
**Ruka：**  
You think I'll let you?!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Gurgh!  
  
**Ruka：**  
You okay?!  
The wound doesn't seem that deep...  
Thank goodness.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hey. I hope you're ready for what's about to happen to you.  
  
**Man 3：**  
Eeek!  
  
**Man 2：**  
You're the one that brought him here! It's all on you!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Sorry. Really, I am.  
I never meant to get you involved in my business.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  No worries. I've got your back.  
`Tag 6`  
**Ruka：**  
Thanks. Just hearing that is enough to make me happy.  
Don't worry, though. I've got my own back.  
For now, at least.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Do me a favor and open up the bag with my fishing equipment,  
will you? There it is. Time for you to shine.

**Ruka：**  
Come on, Haromaru!  
Let's give these rogues a little taste of what you're capable of!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Wh-what the?!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Did she seriously just pull out another katana?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Never expected to use this so soon.  
  
**Man 3：**  
She's dual wielding?! That can't be right!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Why were you under the impression that I can't dual wield?  
You put your hands on someone dear to me.  
And the price for that is steep. You'd best be prepared!  
  
**Woman：**  
Right back at you! Hah!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Pathetic!  
You really hope to defeat me like that?  
  
**Woman：**  
N-no way...!  
  
**Ruka：**  
If you want a piece of me, then come get it.  
Just don't expect your little revenge story to work out!  
Twentieth Strike: Heaven and Earth!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Eeeeeek!  
  
**Man 3：**  
Sh-she's a monster!  
  
**Man 1：**  
We picked the wrong person to mess with!  
Waaahhh!  
  

---  
  
**Ruka：**  
Phew... Do you want to keep this little dance going?  
  
**Man 1：**  
No, no! Not at all!  
Your strength is more than apparent at this point!  
  
**Man 3：**  
Boss Lady! I am so, thoroughly moved!  
Please make me your disciple!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Us too!  
  
**Woman：**  
I was curious why my brother seemed to have straightened  
up when I visited him in prison, but now I know. Please  
forgive me, Ruka! No, Lady Ruka! I was wrong all along!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Th-this again?  
Sheesh. I swear...  
  
**Man 3：**  
Boss Lady! We're begging you!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Give us a chance!  
  
**Woman：**  
Lady Ruka!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Argh! Give me a break!  
First and foremost, get this mess cleaned up,  
and throw yourselves in a cell!  
  
**Man 3：**  
Wow! She's giving us an opportunity to start over!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Nah. This is definitely her method of  
getting us ready to become her disciples!  
  
**Woman：**  
There's no better way to see my brother again than being confined myself!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Yeah, yeah. Get going already.  
...*sigh*  
They're finally gone. I am *so* exhausted.  
  
**Ruka：**  
You sit yourself down, too. There we go.  
  
**Ruka：**  
You said you've got my back, right? Then bear with me for a bit...  
Sorry for getting you involved.  
But it was a relief knowing you were there with me.  
  
**Ruka：**  
I really, really don't want to move another inch today.  
So much for fishing...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Anyway, yeah... Thank... you...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Zzz... Zzz...  
  
**Narration：**  
It wasn't long before rumors of Ruka's battle spread  
all through Landosol. Largely due to a certain ninja,  
who just so happened to witness it.
