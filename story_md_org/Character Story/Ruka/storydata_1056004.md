## Subtitle: A Cat and Its Fish
  
**Narration：**  
Ruka, on a day off from work, is taking a stroll around  
Landosol's outskirts when she bumps  
into {player}.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh, hey there.  
You're looking pretty busy. Work, I take it?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm helping out with the road construction here.  
`Tag 1`  
**Ruka：**  
Now that's some hard labor.  
Would explain why you're covered in dirt.  
How about I treat you to a meal? I bet you're starving.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Also, wow. The sun sure is bright today.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hey. Is it really the sun that's making things so bright...?

**Woman 1：**  
Aaahhh! Someone help! There's a thief on the loose!  
  
**Ruka：**  
A thief? Which way did they go?  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Ruka! The fish you just sold me got stolen!  
  
**Cat：**  
Meow!  
  
**Ruka：**  
A feline felon, huh?  
Now that's trouble.  
I'll go after it!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll help.  
`Tag 2`  
**Ruka：**  
You will?  
Oh, I recognize that face. You're one of our regulars.  
  
**Ruka：**  
I'm Ruka Tachiarai.  
Let's get that fish back!  
  
**Cat：**  
Meow!  
  
**Ruka：**  
If it's running this way, it's going to try and escape along the fence.  
You follow it up there! I'll circle around and catch it off guard!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Flanking it's our best bet here! I'm counting on you!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Now, where's it most likely to go?  
Over there, I'd say. I better hurry.  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Eeek! A peeping Tom!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
There's a pervert up on that fence!  
  
**Man：**  
Whoa?! You a thief or something?!  
  
**Cat：**  
Meow!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh, there it is!  
Gotcha!  
  
**Cat：**  
Meow!  
  
**Ruka：**  
...Or not.  
Oh well.  
I know where that cat's turf is, so it's just a matter of  
working together with him to corner it.  
  
**Ruka：**  
There you are.  
Thanks for the help.  
I'm afraid I let it get away, though.  
But it shot off that way, so let's follow suit!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh yeah. Did something happen?  
Things seemed pretty hectic over where you came from.  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Stop right there, you pervert!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Pervo! Weirdo! You're a danger to all women!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Uh-oh. Didn't expect this turn of events.  
Sorry, this is all my fault.  
We should probably get this cleared up first, shouldn't we?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  We've got more important things to deal with.  
**Choice: (4)**  Getting that fish back takes priority.  
`Tag 3`  
**Ruka：**  
Thanks, I appreciate it.  
I swear I'll get this sorted out for you later!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Ruka：**  
True enough.  
I'll back you up later, then. Trust me!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Ruka：**  
I have a good idea of where it went.  
Let's make our way over to the riverbank!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Now then. It should be around here somewhere.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh, there we go.  
The gig's up, my little feline felon.  
You sure had us on a wild chase...  
  
**Cat：**  
Meow!  
  
**Ruka：**  
So that's what's going on.  
You stole it for them, didn't you?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Sheesh. You could've said something, you know?  
Just kidding. Only a crazy person would expect a cat to explain itself.  
  
**Woman 1：**  
You won't get away!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Quit running!  
  
**Man：**  
It's not too late to set things right! Just turn yourself in!  
  
**Ruka：**  
The cast is all assembled.  
Let's get your name cleared, shall we?  
Then we can go search for the owner of these cats.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Folks! There's something you need to know!  
  
**Man：**  
Huh? Aren't you the Tachiarais' daughter?  
  
**Woman 1：**  
She's from the fishmonger's place in the shopping district!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Huh? What's going on here?  
  
**Ruka：**  
This guy isn't a thief, or anything of the sort!  
He was helping me catch a cat!  
  
**Ruka：**  
And as you can see, we did it.  
So please, don't hold it against him.  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Well... If she says it, it has to be true.  
  
**Woman 2：**  
So he wasn't a pervert? Thank goodness.  
  
**Ruka：**  
And with that, your name's all cleared.  
Now we just need to deal with these cats...  
Except I'm not really sure how to go about this.  
  
**Delinquent：**  
Huh, Boss Lady?  
Wassup! Didn't expect to bump into you.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh, it's you.  
Also, quit calling me that.  
  
**Delinquent：**  
Sorry. I'm just too used to it. Hehehe.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Curious about him, are we?  
He was getting up to  
no good a while back, so I gave him a good scolding.  
Now he's pretty much all over me.  
  
**Delinquent：**  
You in a bind, Boss Lady?  
  
**Ruka：**  
How many times do I need to tell you...  
Whatever.  
More importantly,  
could you try and search for the owner of these cats?  
  
**Ruka：**  
You know my family runs a fishmonger's shop.  
And cats love fish, so I can't exactly take them in.  
That's why I want you to do it, just until you find their owner.  
  
**Delinquent：**  
Anything for you, Boss Lady!  
  
**Ruka：**  
You're doing that on purpose, aren't you?  
Anyway, the best case scenario would be for someone to take them all in.  
  
**Delinquent：**  
I'll ask my buds if any of them can manage it!  
And I'll have them ask their buds as well, so no need to worry!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Thanks. Knowing him, he'll get the job done quick.  
Which means we're pretty much done here. Thanks for all the help.  
  
**Ruka：**  
I have to admit, you really took me by surprise.  
Helping me out is one thing, but you didn't even flinch  
when people started calling you all sorts of names.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I just wanted to help someone in need.  
`Tag 6`  
**Ruka：**  
Huh. Now that's not a line you hear often nowadays.  
You really are a man's man, aren't you?  
  
**Ruka：**  
You should pop by our store next time  
you're in the shopping district. I'll give you a super  
special discount. And thanks again.  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
And that's that. Welcome back.  
Did you enjoy that little dream?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ruka really is kind and caring, isn't she?  
And she's even strong to boot.  
It's no wonder so many people look up to her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I just wish she wouldn't take it so far sometimes.  
I had a pretty terrible experience thanks to that in the past.  
Though I guess it's a fond memory at this point.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Don't forget, though. She's no superhero. There'll come a time  
when she faces something she can't overcome on her own.  
It's your job to support her when that time comes.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, I'll see you around!  
  

---  
  
**Ruka：**  
Mmm... Hm?  
Guess I dozed off at some point.  
*yawn*  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh. Good morning. Guess we both fell asleep, huh?  
  
I even had a pretty vivid dream.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  So did I.  
`Tag 7`  
**Ruka：**  
You dreamed about chasing after a cat, huh?  
Same as me, then.  
There was even a boy in it  
just like you, determined to help others out.  
  
**Ruka：**  
That was just a dream, but I know for a fact  
that you'd do the same even in real life.  
  
**Man：**  
THIEF! Someone catch them!  
  
**Ruka：**  
A thief, is it?  
I'd ask what we should do,  
but that'd be a waste of time, wouldn't it?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Let's get going!  
We'll catch that thief in no time if we work together!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus the two of them sprung into action,  
ready to deliver justice together once more.
