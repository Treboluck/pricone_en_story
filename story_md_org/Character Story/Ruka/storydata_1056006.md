**Narration：**  
{player} bumps into Ruka after  
finishing up a particularly late shift.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hey there.  
Where are you off to this late at night?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Oh, you're on your way home? Then don't let me hold you up.  
I assume you've heard about the slasher that's been  
stirring up trouble recently, right?  
  
**Ruka：**  
That's got pretty much everyone scared stuff.  
Only people I've seen out at night these past few days  
are people confident in their skills and royal knights.  
  
**Ruka：**  
The stores around here are still open,  
but you sure won't find any customers in them.  
  
**Ruka：**  
What about me, then?  
You know the answer to that already, don't you?  
I've been asked to help deal with our little slasher friend.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That's one way to get me worried...  
`Tag 1`  
**Ruka：**  
I appreciate the concern,  
but this is too dangerous for you. You'll be safe if you stay home,  
so get going already.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  There's no place safer than by your side.  
`Tag 2`  
**Ruka：**  
By my side, huh?  
Haha! Fair enough!  
Fine, fine.  
You got me good.  
Just make sure you stick by me, no matter wha—  
  
**Man：**  
Waaaaaahhhhh!  
  
**Ruka：**  
That was quick! Let's get going!  
  
**Man：**  
...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hey! You okay?!  
  
**Man：**  
Y-yeah...  
  
**Ruka：**  
Thank goodness. He's still breathing.  
  
**Man：**  
Y-you're...  
  
**Ruka：**  
What happened here?  
  
**Man：**  
We... we wanted to get rid of that slasher.  
But we didn't stand a chance.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Did you manage to catch a glimpse of what they looked like?  
  
**Man：**  
They...?  
Th-that thing wasn't human!  
Are you gonna go after it? Be careful if you do!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Same to you. You should get going if you can move.  
Or do you need me to call for help first?  
  
**Man：**  
No, I can move.  
But wait... My partner's gone!  
He was right here a minute ago. Did you guys see him?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Afraid not. He must have run off to get help.  
I'll fill him in if I see him though. Stay safe!  
  
**Ruka：**  
He said it wasn't human. Does that mean a monster  
got into town?  
Either way, we need to track it down  
before there are any more victims!  
  
**Knight 1：**  
Haaah!  
  
**Youth：**  
Gragh!  
  
**Ruka：**  
What's going on over there?  
  
**Knight 2：**  
...Phew. Finally settled down.  
  
**Knight 3：**  
That took me by surprise.  
Never expected him to go wild out of nowhere.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Guess our help wasn't needed.  
Hey, what's his deal?  
Is he the slasher everyone's been talking about?  
  
**Knight 1：**  
We're not sure. He just attacked us out of nowhere.  
Either way, we're going to restrain him and take him away.  
We'll need his weapon, too.  
  
**Ruka：**  
A katana, huh?  
That's rare to see around here.  
Well, that settles that.  
Let's leave the rest to the knights and get going.  
  
**Knight 1：**  
GUAAAARGH!  
  
**Ruka：**  
What's wrong?!  
  
**Knight 1 (Katana)：**  
Grrrrrr...! More! I need more!  
What a fantastic vessel, though!  
Much better than the previous one!  
  
**Knight 2：**  
Wh-what in the world?!  
What's happening?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
A monster?!  
No, that's no regular monster!  
  
**Knight 1 (Katana)：**  
Mwahahaha! The time has come for my full strength to be unleashed!  
Woman. I sense incredible power within you!  
  
**Knight 3：**  
What's wrong?! Snap out of it!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Now I get it. It's that katana!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  What about it?  
`Tag 3`  
**Ruka：**  
There's a certain story I heard back home when I was still a kid.  
About bewitched blades that hold their own will.  
That katana has to be one of them!  
  
**Knight 2：**  
Hey! What's going on here?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Listen up! Your comrade's been possessed by that katana!  
And he'll stay that way, so long as the blade's in his hand!  
  
**Knight 1 (Katana)：**  
Mwahaha!  
Rejoice, humans. For your lives end here!  
  
**Knight 2：**  
Graaagh!  
  
**Ruka：**  
It's going to overwhelm them!  
Quick, let's help!  
  
**Knight 3：**  
No! You should run!  
A knight should never put a citizen in harm's way!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Quit fronting! You've got no chance of beating that thing!  
  
**Knight 2：**  
Even still! We're proud knights of our country!  
Fleeing isn't an option!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Forget your ridiculous pride!  
Is that really worth dying over?!  
  
**Knight 1 (Katana)：**  
Right she is!  
You know not your own limits!  
And for that, you must perish!  
  
**Knight 3：**  
A-aaaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hey! Back me up!  
Not a single person is going to die tonight.  
Not so long as I'm here!  
  
**Knight 1 (Katana)：**  
Ungh! Mwahaha!  
You're as impressive as I thought, woman!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Can't say I care about your compliments!  
Hah!  
  
**Knight 1 (Katana)：**  
Ungh! Hah hah hah!  
Quite the close call, that was!  
  
**Knight 2：**  
Amazing! She's on equal footing with it!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Don't just stand there!  
Hurry up and go get help!  
  
**Knight 3：**  
G-got it!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Equal footing? Not good enough. But that thing's using its host as a shield.  
My only options are to knock the blade out of his hand, or just cut  
him down. Either way, we're at a stalemate as things stand!  
  
**Ruka：**  
You just had to go and make things difficult, didn't you?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Ruka! Let's flank it!  
**Choice: (5)**  Ruka! Let's corner it together!  
`Tag 4`  
**Ruka：**  
We can throw it off guard like that, huh?  
Good call!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Ruka：**  
You want to flank it, right?  
Roger that!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Knight 1 (Katana)：**  
A pincer attack, is it?  
Don't waste your time!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Now's your chance!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Strike the blade.  
`Tag 7`  
**Knight 1 (Katana)：**  
Hmph! You fool!  
Such a feeble strike will never do away with me!  
  
**Ruka：**  
You're wide open, my friend!  
  
**Knight 1 (Katana)：**  
Impossible! Graaagh!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Perfect! I knocked it clean out of his hands!  
  
**Katana：**  
Curses! I require a new host!  
  
**Ruka：**  
It can move on its own?! Watch out! It'll get away!  
Don't let it slip by you!  
  
**Katana：**  
Oh? You dare to touch me, do you?  
Very well. Then your body shall be mine!  
  
**Ruka：**  
What're you doing?!  
Let go of it! Quick!  
  
**Katana：**  
Hm. Quite the frail vessel, but alas.  
All I need to do is flee!  
  
**Katana：**  
...What is the meaning of this? I can't move!  
Is he rejecting my influence?! Impossible!  
How can one so frail possess such a strong will?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Did you manage to stop it from moving?!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Cut through the both of us!  
`Tag 8`  
**Ruka：**  
Wait. Was that your plan all along?!  
Okay, leave it to me. I'll do just that!  
  
**Ruka：**  
My greatest technique will be your final reckoning.  
Origin Strike: Severing Moon!  
  
**Katana：**  
...Incredible. To think one could cut clean through my spirit.  
Very well. I can think of no one more ideal than you.  
  
**Ruka：**  
Hey, you okay? Tell me you're okay.  
Thank goodness...  
I haven't used that technique in a while,  
so I'm glad it went well.  
  
**Ruka：**  
I'd actually planned on using it when we went on that ghost hunt.  
But anyway, the sword should be fine to hold it now  
that I've weakened it this much.  
  
**Katana：**  
H-heh... I can feel it. My spirit is fading.  
Tell me. What is your name?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Huh? I'm Ruka.  
What's your deal? Trying to score yourself a parting gift?  
  
**Katana：**  
My name is Haromaru.  
You have proven yourself more than worthy of wielding me.  
Finally... Finally, I can return to being a simple blade.  
  

---  
  
**Ruka：**  
Good grief. *That's* why you stirred up all this trouble?  
You sure are blunt for a katana, aren't you?  
But oh well.  
  
**Ruka：**  
As for you, mister. You know what's coming.  
You big, dumb idiot! What was even going through your head?!  
  
**Ruka：**  
Don't you dare pull something like that again, you hear?  
You're the last person I ever want to cross blades with!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Sorry for making you worry.  
**Choice: (10)**  It won't happen again.  
`Tag 9`  
**Ruka：**  
Worry? You almost gave me a heart attack!  
  
Jump to tag 11  
`Tag 10`  
**Ruka：**  
It better not.  
Promise me, okay?  
  
`Tag 11`  
**Ruka：**  
It's weird, though. I don't think I've ever felt this relieved before.  
Is this how you feel whenever I'm up against danger?  
  
**Ruka：**  
Now I know what it's like to be in your shoes after that little stunt.  
So I'll tone it down myself.  
Fair's fair, right?  
  
**Narration：**  
Having noticed a tinge of shyness behind Ruka's smile,  
{player} couldn't help but feel incredibly glad that he was  
able to protect her.
