**Narration：**  
Outside a local restaurant,  
Ayumi stands fidgeting and hesitating to enter.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Will this be OK...? Will I be able to do a good job...?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
*sigh*... Why'd my mom have to say  
 \"You're old enough now,  
so try earning your own allowance!\"  
 out of the blue...?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Ohhh, I'm so nervous...  
But they were kind enough to hire me, so I have to work hard!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I just hope there aren't any scary people...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
E-excuse me...?  
Wow, they're all busy preparing for lunchtime...  
I probably shouldn't interrupt...  
  
**Manager：**  
Oh! Ayumi, I didn't see you'd arrived!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
H-hello!  
Um... Manager!  
I-I'm sorry! I didn't want to get in the way...  
  
**Manager：**  
Oh, sorry about that. Things get so busy at this time.  
Let me introduce you to everyone!  
  
**Manager：**  
Guys! Can you come over here for a moment?  
  
**Manager：**  
This is Ayumi. She's starting here today.  
Ayumi, can you quickly introduce yourself?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
O-okay! Um, I'm Amyu... A... Ayumi's my name!  
I-it's nice to eat you all!  
  
**Manager：**  
A big hand for Ayumi, everyone!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Th-thank goodness... None of them look scary...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Nice to meet you.  
`Tag 1`  
**Ayumi：**  
R-right! Um, it,  
 it's a pleasure to work with you!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Y-y-your meal is ready!  
O-one whole roasted monster!  
  
**Woman 1：**  
I didn't order anything that weird!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh?! I-I'm very sorry!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
I'd like to pay, please!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Right, of course!  
That will be 70,000 rupies...  
 Huh?  
That's too many zeroes?  
 Wh-wh-wh-what should I do?!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Um, I'm kind of in a hurry...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I-I'm very sorry! Umm... ummmm...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Urgh... I-I keep messing everything up so bad...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Calm down and take deep breaths.  
**Choice: (3)**  Everyone makes mistakes.  
`Tag 2`  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh? O-okay... *huff*... *puff*...  
Th-that did help a little bit.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I-I really am sorry! I just get so nervous...  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Ayumi：**  
B-but I think I mess up worse than most... Urgh...  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Ayumi：**  
...Huh? If I'm struggling, I should rely on my colleagues?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Y-yes, you're right.  
I guess I was trying too hard to do everything myself.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I didn't want to bother anyone, but that just made me panic more...  
That's no good, is it? We're all supposed to be a team...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Um, thank you very much! I think I feel better now!  
  
**Drunk：**  
Hey, over here!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Um—yes! I'll be right with you!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
S-sorry for the wait!  
  
**Drunk：**  
Talk about slow...  
 Ooh! You're pretty cute, girlie!  
All right, I think I'll order you for lunch! Ahahaha!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Uweh?! Um, but I...  
  
**Drunk：**  
C'mon, sit down and let's have us a meal! Don't be shy!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Th-that's not, um...  
 P-please don't... do that... Oohhhh...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Step in to save her.  
`Tag 5`  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh? U-um...  
  
**Drunk：**  
Who the hell? Scram, dumbass!  
Or what, are you lookin' for a fight?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Aahhh... Please stop... It's dangerous...  
  
**Drunk：**  
You think you're so cool!  
Guys like you really piss me off, y'know?!  
  
**Manager：**  
That's quite enough!  
Any more trouble in my establishment, and I'll call Nightmare!  
  
**Drunk：**  
Tch! What a drag!  
Fine, fine! I'll leave, I'll leave already! Hey, gimme the bill!  
  
**Manager：**  
Honestly, what a worthless lout.  
 Are you okay, Ayumi?  
I'm sorry you had to deal with that on your first day.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
*sniff* I-I'm all... right...  
  
**Manager：**  
And thank you as well.  
You were quite the hero.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I... made it through the day... Whew...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I screwed up so much, though.  
I must have been holding the whole team back...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
But that guy who saved me was so cool...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  See you around!  
`Tag 6`  
**Ayumi：**  
Wahhh! G-good evening!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
U-um, I just wanted to say, um...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I'm very sorry for all the problems I caused today!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Just keep up the good effort!  
`Tag 7`  
**Ayumi：**  
Oh... Um, yes!  
 I'll do my best! Thank you!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
And he's gone...  
 Oh, I... never caught his name.  
After everything he did to help me...  
  
**Manager：**  
Oh, Ayumi! You did well today.  
I'm sorry for all the trouble.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Oh, no, I'm all right. It's me who should be sorry...  
M-Manager... Do you know that boy's name?  
  
**Manager：**  
That boy?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Um, th-the one who... saved me...  
  
**Manager：**  
...Oh! Right, him!  
Come to think of it, I don't know his name either.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh?!  
  
**Manager：**  
Thing is, he was an emergency recruit just helping out for the day.  
Work was so busy, I completely forgot to ask.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
O-oh, I had no idea...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Then next time I come, he won't be here...  
Will I ever see him again?  
  
**Narration：**  
As she thought back on her very short-term colleague,  
Ayumi was filled with an emotion she couldn't describe.
