What you just saw was basically a dream.  
When you wake up, you'll forget it all.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It looks like at the time, you thought this was your first meeting,  
but you'd actually met her once before.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, we can go over that another time...  
  
**Ameth：**  
You're certainly not strangers over here,  
so be nice to her when you wake up, OK?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, I'll be seeing you around.

**Ayumi：**  
Uwaaaah?! Huh? What the?! But why?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I can't believe a boy—and {player}, no less!—  
just murmured my name out of nowhere!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Ahhh! I-I need to snap out of it  
 and say something back!  
You can do it, Ayumi! Have a little courage!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Y... Yesh! Wh-what did you want, {player}?!

**Ayumi：**  
Huh? What is this, what's going on?! Is it a dream?!  
Am I still half asleep?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I must be! All I did today was follow behind him  
and watch from a totally safe distance!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
How would that lead to him whispering my name  
and... inviting me on a shopping trip...?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Um, l-listen, I, I, I, um...!  
Waaaahhh! It's no use! I'm so sorryyyyy!

Seeing Ayumi burst into tears and run away  
from a simple invitation to a shopping trip,  
{player} couldn't help but feel a little shocked.
