In a dream of Ameth's creation, Ayumi is running late for her high school entrance exam, and manages to injure her foot on the way there. Just then, {player} shows up and takes her safely to her destination.
  
## Subtitle: Where It All Began
  
**Narration：**  
As usual, Ayumi is watching {player} stroll  
through the city's commercial district.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
What's he shopping for today, I wonder?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
We're definitely closer now than when we first met,  
but I still don't quite have the courage to approach him...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
...Hm? What's that light coming from him?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Wait, didn't something like this happen before—?  
  

---  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Oh no, oh no! It's going to start! I have to hurry!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Waaahh!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Owww... Ahh, my shoelace broke...  
N-no, forget that! I have to hurry, or—  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Urghh! M-my foot... D-did I sprain it somehow?  
Ahhh... I'll never make it in time now...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Maybe I'm just doomed to fail no matter what...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You okay?  
**Choice: (2)**  What's wrong?  
`Tag 1`  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh? Well, n-not really... My foot  
 really hurts, and...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Ayumi：**  
Uweh? U-um,  
 I, um, kind of tripped up and...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh? Oh... That's my exam entry pass...  
Thank you for picking it up for me.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
But... I might not actually need it.  
There's no way I'm making it to the exam now...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I even sprained my foot, so I guess some greater force  
is telling me it wasn't meant to be...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Is this a high school entrance exam?  
`Tag 4`  
**Ayumi：**  
Y-yes...  
 I really wanted to get in, so I studied hard  
until even my teacher agreed that I should be at the right level.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
But yesterday I was so nervous, I forgot to set my alarm.  
Why am I always such a screw-up...?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh...? U-um... where are you going?  
Ah... He just left...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
...Of course he did.  
Who wants to listen to some loser whining about—  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh? He came back... Huh? Wh-where did you get that bike?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I borrowed it from a friend.  
`Tag 5`  
**Ayumi：**  
Uweh? W-well, that's nice.  
 But why...?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
G-get on the back...? B-but I, um...  
Huh? Waahhh!O-okay! All right, all right! I'll get on...!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Wait, w-  
waaaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
No way... I actually made it on time...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Um... um...!  
 Thank you so much!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I promise I won't let this chance go to waste!  
I-I'll do my very best in the exam!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
R-really, I can't thank you enough!

**Ayumi：**  
I can't believe he borrowed that bike just for me,  
and brought me all this way...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
What a wonderful guy he was...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Oh! H-his name... I never got to ask it...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I wonder what school he's from...  
 Will I see him again...?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Oh—I should hurry! The exam's about to start!

**Ameth：**  
And... welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Right, right.  
So that was why Ayumi first started watching you from a distance...  
  
**Ameth：**  
She thought she'd never see you again,  
but you turned out to be a student at the same school, after all!  
  
**Ameth：**  
And being shy, she couldn't actually approach you...  
She does want to be closer to you. I hope you understand that.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's trying to approach you as best she can manage.  
So it'd be nice if you could help her along the way.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, I'll leave it at that for today. See you later!

**Ayumi：**  
Mnnhhh... Thank you so muchhh... {player}...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Ahh! Wh-when did I fall asleep?  
Th-that's so weird... I can't remember at all...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I have this weird feeling  
 that in my dreams,  
{player} came to my rescue... Eheheh.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Wait, {player}?! Why are you here?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
W-wasn't I just watchi—  
 Ah! I-I mean, I wasn't following you!  
I... I just saw you and wondered if I should say hi!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
So, um... ahh... I really wasn't... being, uh...  
Um, I mean... that dream... ahhh...!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I... I'm so sorryyyyy!  
  
**Narration：**  
Even as Ayumi fled the scene in a panic,  
there was still a definite hint of a smile on her face  
from her happy half-remembered dream.
