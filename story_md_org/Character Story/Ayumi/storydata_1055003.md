**Narration：**  
As {player} walks through the city to do some shopping,  
Ayumi follows behind, fixing him with an earnest gaze.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
*staaaare*...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
T-today's the day I'll thank him...!  
 Urgh...  
B-but I still don't have the courage to even greet him!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I-I mean, he wouldn't want to talk to me anyway...  
A-and just watching is enough for me...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
But if I...  
If I could really get closer to him...  
Stand by his side, talk with him,  
 and...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Oh no, {player}! It's far too soon for us to... Ah...  
Y-you took my hand in yours?! No way!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
...Ahh! I got lost in fantasy for a moment.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh? Wait, now I can't see {player} anywhere!  
O-oh no, which way did he go?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Urgh... Where are you, {player}?  
 Wait, huh?  
Huh? Huh?! Huhhh~?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Where...  
 even am I?  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Th-this is bad!  
I was so focused on {player},  
I completely lost sight of my surroundings!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I never come to this part of town, and it all looks the same...  
Ohhh, I hope someone walks by...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What're you doing?  
**Choice: (2)**  Hi there.  
`Tag 1`  
**Ayumi：**  
Oh, just kind of looking for someone...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Ayumi：**  
Oh, hello.  
 Nice day we're having...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Ayumi：**  
...Waahhh?! {player}?! B-but how?! And why?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
U-um, um, don't get me wrong!  
I definitely didn't get lost out here  
because I was following you or anything!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You're lost too, huh?  
`Tag 4`  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh?  
Oh. I-  
I sure am!  
Guess we're in the same boat, huh?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
E... eheheh... Me and {player}, together...  
Wait! This isn't the time!  
What should we do? This area seems deserted...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
It's wonderful to spend time with {player},  
but that doesn't make us any less lost...  
...Wh-what if we run into hooligans or bandits...?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Urghhh...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Take her hand and reassure her.  
`Tag 5`

**Ayumi：**  
Uwehhh?! {player}?!  
Um, you, y-your, your h-hand! It's h-holding mine...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
N-no, no! Of course I don't mind!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I guess he saw I was feeling worried...  
He's such a kind guy...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh? Let's walk around until we find somewhere we know?  
G-good idea! That sounds like a great plan!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Aaahhh... We're actually walking hand in hand...!  
A-and right now, we're all alone together...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
C-could this possibly be some kind of date?!  
My fantasies turned into reality?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Dear Mother, your daughter has finally become a woman...  
Huh? N-n-no, I didn't say anything! L-l-l-let's keep moving!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
...His hand feels so big and warm...  
I never knew holding hands was such a wonderful feeling...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
I thought I was happy just watching...  
But after feeling this warmth...  
I can't help wanting to get closer...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
But he's always surrounded  
by lots of girls who are much cuter than me.  
I'm so plain and boring, he'd never...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
*sigh*... If only we'd never find our way out of here...  
I wish this moment could go on forever...

**Ayumi：**  
Ahh... I know this place...  
You recognize it too, do you? That's great...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Of course, the truth is it feels kind of lonely.  
This is the end of our happy moment together...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Huh? What am I doing after this?  
Well, I don't have any plans...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Wha—?! Sh-shopping together?!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Wh-why would you ask me...?  
 O-oh, I see.  
There's a sale with a one-item-per-customer limit...  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Y-yeah, that makes sense.  
If we go together, we can buy twice as much!  
O-of course I'll go with you! I'd love to!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
Eheh... Eheheh...  
  
**Narration：**  
Still holding the smiling Ayumi's hand in his own,  
{player} led the way to the shop he had come to visit.
