# Rin (Ranger) Episode 1
At the request of Caon, Rin reluctantly goes in search of a pair of stranded foragers. She finds the missing people, but is attacked by a monster. However, the armor she is wearing happens to be highly effective against it, and just like that, she is able to fight it off. As a result, the witnesses begin to regard her as a fighting master.

**Narration：**  
Peace has returned to Elizabeth Park. While the other guild members  
are hard at work, Rin is living the lazy life to the best of her ability.  
  
**Rin：**  
*sigh*  
It sure is peaceful.  
Nothing tastes better than acorns eaten while  
reveling in tranquility.  
  
**Rin：**  
I know the armor my mom gave me helped us grasp an unexpected  
victory,  
but as it turns out, I'm not a fan of conflict.  
  
**Rin：**  
Not needing to wear armor is evidence of peaceful times.  
So for the rest of my days, it'll just be an ornament in my room.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hello there.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rin：**  
Hey! What the heck, man?  
Like, I know we're friends and whatnot, but you could still at least knock.  
  
**Rin：**  
I'm a squirrel, you know? A tiny little animal.  
I'm really sensitive, so treat me with a little more delicacy, okay?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I've got a letter for you.  
`Tag 2`  
**Rin：**  
Hey, are you listening? Show some consideration, geez.  
Well anyway, let's see where the letter's from...  
Uh-oh, it's from Caon.  
  
**Rin：**  
Wahhh, I don't wanna read it...  
There can't be anything good written inside.  
What could it be...?  
Huh? A job request?! Why me?!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  'Cause you've had a lot of success recently?  
`Tag 3`  
**Rin：**  
Urgh, you've gotta be kidding me.  
That was all thanks to Mahy and the  
others. I basically did nothing.  
  
**Rin：**  
Argh, come on! Things have *just* started to go back to normal.  
Leave me alone.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You're a can-do girl.  
**Choice: (5)**  They'll be angry if you don't go.  
`Tag 4`  
**Rin：**  
Right, if you actually believe that, then there's clearly  
something wrong with you. Go stuff yourself full of acorns.  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Rin：**  
Y-yeah, you don't have to tell me...  
But *sob*... I don't wanna do any work!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Rin：**  
Urgh, hell if I go, hell if I don't. I'm screwed either way.  
Man, what did I do to deserve this?!  
  
**Rin：**  
...By the way, you've been staring at my armor for a while now.  
What gives?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  You're already prepared, huh?  
`Tag 7`  
**Rin：**  
N-no, it's nothing more than a decoration now...  
  
**Rin：**  
Argh, man, I can't be bothered explaining!  
If I don't do it, they'll force me back into training,  
  
so let's just get it over with.  
  
**Rin：**  
I know, I can use the situation to my advantage.  
Even if the mission fails, they might still appreciate my motivation.  
  
**Rin：**  
But *this time* is definitely the last time I wear this armor.  
  
**Rin：**  
Lemme see, the job is to rescue a couple of stranded people, right?  
I'm just glad it wasn't an extermination request.  
  
**Rin：**  
It looks like they've chosen a mission that plays to my strengths,  
but their consideration is misplaced.  
  
**Rin：**  
Either way, there are people in need, so I'll be there in a flash.  
{player}, stay close now.  
  
**Rin：**  
*whew*  
It's dark, and the ground isn't well-traversed. What a nasty forest.  
Well, it's nothing for a squirrel beastgirl like me.  
  
**Rin：**  
Be careful. Don't go straying off or falling into any ditches, okay?  
I don't want you to double my workload or anything troublesome  
like that.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  You're really dependable, aren't you?  
`Tag 8`  
**Rin：**  
This much, any beastfolk could handle.  
Instead of words of praise, I'd much rather have a sweet bun, you know.  
  
**Rin：**  
...Hm? I sense something.  
It's not an animal or a monster...  
Over there!  
  
**Rin：**  
Ah! There they are.  
Heeey! Are you all right?!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Finally, someone's here to rescue us!  
Thank goodness.  
  
**Man 2：**  
Apologies, we got lost while we were foraging for mushrooms...  
  
**Rin：**  
No problem. Let's hurry up and get outta here.  
Better not dawdle, otherwise a monster might—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Rin：**  
Ahhh! Speak of the devil!  
This wasn't supposed to be an extermination job!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Rin：**  
Whoa! Th-that was close!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Rin：**  
Ahhh! I'm gonna die!  
  
**Man 1：**  
A-amazing...  She's dodging each and every one of its attacks!  
  
**Rin：**  
No, that's not exactly something that I can do.  
The monster's just not good at hitting me...  
  
**Rin：**  
Maybe my movements and the fact that this armor's far too big for me  
make me look really skillful.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey,  
give me a break! Ahhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRUOOOOGGGHHH!  
  
**Rin：**  
Uh, what? I landed every attack...?  
  
**Man 1：**  
S-such amazing spearmanship...!  
Her attacks were so fast and varied that I couldn't guess their  
trajectories...!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Yeah, it's impossible to tell how strong she is from her tiny appearance.  
Who knew there was such a superior master in Landosol?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Huuuh? It's just these loose gauntlets throwing the trajectories  
all over the place.  
I'm by no means a master.  
  
**Rin：**  
Well, whatever.  
What's done is done, so let's get outta—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Rin：**  
No way! It's still alive?!  
G-go away!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Oh! Her spear flew off with her gauntlets!  
  
**Man 1：**  
W-we're done for!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Rin：**  
...Huh? I knocked it out...?  
  
**Man 1：**  
Sh-she feigned helplessness in order to launch the spear in the air  
at a dead angle...?  
  
**Man 2：**  
To do something that calmly under these circumstances...  
is nothing short of masterful!  
  
**Rin：**  
No way am I that good! It's just a series of coincidences!  
But they're all hyped up, so I can't exactly tell them that...  
  
**Rin：**  
*sigh*... What have I gotten myself into this time? Geez.  
  
**Narration：**  
Little did Rin know, this little incidentwould have a huge impact on her daily life.
