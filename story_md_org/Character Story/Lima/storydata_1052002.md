**Lima：**  
Yoo-hoo, {player}!  
Hee hee. We've been running into each other a lot lately.  
  
**Lima：**  
Yup, I'm hauling lumber again today.  
There's been a lot  
of property damage due to monster attacks lately,  
so the demand for building materials is on the rise.  
  
**Lima：**  
I guess if monsters are wrecking buildings, it means that  
they're even making their way into the city nowadays.  
  
**Lima：**  
Scary thought. {player}, how are you doing?  
You haven't run into any monsters, have you?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  All the time.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm looking at one now.  
`Tag 1`  
**Lima：**  
Oh, gosh! Now I'm worried!  
You don't look like much of a fighter, so you have to  
flee whenever you see monsters, okay?  
  
**Lima：**  
Maybe you should scream for help as loud as you can.  
If I'm within earshot, I'll come to your aid.  
Believe it or not, I'm actually really tough!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Lima：**  
Huh? Where?!  
I'm scared!  
The outskirts of town sure are dangerous!  
  
**Lima：**  
Hmm?  
Wait, I don't see any monsters.  
  
**Lima：**  
Wait, were you talking about me?  
How rude!  
  
**Lima：**  
I know I don't look like other people,  
but that doesn't mean I'm a monster, got it?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Lima：**  
Ha ha ha. Anyways...  
Are you doing another mail delivery job today?  
  
**Lima：**  
No?  
Ooh. So you're investigating why so many monsters are  
appearing outside of town, and subduing whichever ones you can?  
Sounds like a tough job! I'm impressed. ♪  
  
**Lima：**  
You're such a hard worker, {player}.  
I feel like you're on the job every time we meet.  
You should make time to relax and have fun, too.  
  
**Lima：**  
So should I?  
That's fair... but just look at me.  
  
**Lima：**  
If I set foot into town, it'll cause a huge commotion.  
I can't just take an afternoon to go check out the newest  
stores and restaurants.  
  
**Lima：**  
I mean, I'd love to try on clothes, shop for accessories,  
and grab something sweet to nibble on while walking around.  
Those kind of regular-girl activities aren't quite open to me.  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh? Wh-why?  
Because I look like a monster, of course.  
If I go into the city, the guards will slaughter me!  
  
**Lima：**  
I wish that just once in my life, I could go on a date. Like  
the ones in those girls' manga that Shiori's always reading.  
Something romantic, with me as an ordinary girl on the town.  
  
**Lima：**  
Hmm?  
You want to help me carry the lumber?  
  
**Lima：**  
That's kind of you to offer. I appreciate it,  
but with your physique, I doubt you'd be able  
to lift one piece.  
  
**Lima：**  
Even I have to use ropes and pulleys to lift them.  
And trust me, they're still heavy!  
  
**Lima：**  
Besides... you have a job of your own.  
  
**Lima：**  
Investigating and eliminating monsters, right?  
Hey, if you don't have any luck, why don't you chase me off  
and count me as a monster?  
  
**Lima：**  
Heh heh heh. Just joking.  
I know you'd never do something so mean.  
  
**Lima：**  
You're not like that. You're a nice person who'd come up and  
chat with someone like me without a second thought.  
  
**Lima：**  
Honestly, you're like the hero in a girls' manga.  
But that's why... You should be nice to ordinary girls,  
not monsters like me.  
  
**Lima：**  
Oops. No more time for chitchat.  
I need to get moving.  
If I'm too late delivering the lumber, I'll end up bumping into  
the people who come to pick it up.  
  
**Lima：**  
And they'll... get scared of me...  
  
**Lima：**  
Bye, {player}.  
I had fun talking to you.  
Good luck with your job!  
See you soon!
