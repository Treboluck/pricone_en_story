## Subtitle: Like a Fairy Tale
  
**Lima：**  
Huh?  
Oh, {player}!  
Howdy!  
  
**Lima：**  
Hee hee.  
Welcome to Elizabeth Park!  
  
**Lima：**  
Delivering the mail again today?  
  
**Lima：**  
Of course.  
You're such a dedicated mailman.  
Way to go!  
  
**Lima：**  
I wish I could help, but with all the monster extermination  
squads roaming around the area...  
  
**Lima：**  
Everyone keeps telling me it's too dangerous to leave.  
  
**Lima：**  
But unlike Rin,  
I can't stand being stuck at home 24/7.  
  
**Lima：**  
So I try to monitor when the squads are active  
and go out for short walks when they're gone.  
  
**Lima：**  
I don't think they actually have much to do,  
so hopefully they'll go away sooner rather than later.  
  
**Lima：**  
Regardless, I'll be patient and stay here until they're gone.  
  
**Lima：**  
Good things come to those who wait, right?  
Ha ha ha.  
Everything will be back to normal before we know it.  
  
**Lima：**  
Hmm?  
What do you mean, sorry?  
Why are you apologizing?  
  
**Lima：**  
No matter how horrible your fellow humans are acting,  
you haven't done anything wrong.  
  
**Lima：**  
It's all right.  
I've gotten used to it.  
  
**Lima：**  
Things have been so peaceful since I started freeloading  
at the farm, I'd almost forgotten...  
  
**Lima：**  
It used to be that being treated like a monster  
and chased off was just a regular part of life.  
  
**Lima：**  
This is just a little trip back to the bad old days.  
As long as I believe my future is bright and peaceful,  
I'll be just fine.  
  
**Lima：**  
So don't look so glum, okay?  
  
**Lima：**  
Aah! Too bright!  
Wh-what's going on?  
{player}, you're glowing!

Llima, llima llima?  
(Wait, am I lost?)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima... Llima?  
(Where am I?)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima! Llima llima, llima?  
(Oh! That's {player}, isn't it?)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima!  
({player}!)  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Scream and run away.  
**Choice: (2)**  Say hello.

Llima, llima llima?  
(Hey, why are you running away?)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima llima?  
(Did he forget who I am?)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima,  
 llima llima. Llima, llima llima!  
  
(Yes, yes. I'm Lima, remember?  
Please don't forget about me!)

Llima, llima... Llima llima!

`Tag 3`  
**Lima：**  
Llima, llima llima? Llima?  
(What brings you out here today, {player}?  
Going on a walk?)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima llima, llima llima.  
(I was out for a stroll myself, but I think I'm lost.)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima llima, llima.  
(It's such a beautiful day out, I was really enjoying myself.)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima, llima llima!  
(But I guess I lost track of where I was going,  
and ended up in the middle of town!)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima llima, llima...  
(But I need to go home soon...)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima, llima...  
(...Or they'll think I've run away again,  
  
and they'll stop letting me out!)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima, llima llima.  
(So I really have to get back.)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima llima,  
llima?  
({player}, do you know the way back to my home?)  
  
**Lima：**  
...  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima. Llima llima...  
(Aww. I figured as much, but I can tell you're not  
understanding a word I'm saying.)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima llima, llima.  
(I don't know why I thought you would.  
We're different species, after all.)

**Ameth：**  
And that's that. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just saw was like a dream.  
You'll forget it as soon as you wake up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Of course, running into an animal while walking  
around town feels straight out of a dream to begin with.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You probably realized you were dreaming right away.  
Or did you?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Either way, you're going to be having a lot of dreams like this  
in the near future, so don't read too much into it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you should focus on is talking to Lima as often  
as you can.  
  
**Ameth：**  
As you just saw,  
the only thing she can say  
\"over there\" is \"llima llima!\"  
  
**Ameth：**  
Since she can't speak, any conversation with her  
is a is one-way street.  
But over \"here\", she can talk normally.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's a miracle right out of a fairy tale.  
Be appreciative, and be a good friend to her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Sometimes, being members of different races  
is a high hurdle to clear.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Sadly, countless tragedies have occurred over the course  
of history because of that.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's why I think you two  
have to overcome it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You've made countless miracles happen already,  
so I know you'll succeed.  
I'm rooting for you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
On that note, I'd say we're done here for now.  
Bye-bye! See you next time. ♪

**Lima：**  
{player}?  
  
**Lima：**  
What's the matter?  
You're staring off into space.  
  
**Lima：**  
You might just be exhausted from overwork.  
  
**Lima：**  
If you don't have anything urgent to do,  
maybe you should stay and rest here at Elizabeth Park.  
  
**Lima：**  
I'll give you a heaping helping of our hospitality!  
Let me bring you a big cup of tea and a plate of snacks!  
  
**Lima：**  
You know you're always welcome here.  
  
**Lima：**  
Sure the farm's up in the mountains,  
and it's a hike to get up here,  
but you should come by  
to play sometimes, instead of always working.  
  
**Lima：**  
I haven't seen your face in so long...  
I really missed you, {player}.  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh?  
Excuse me?  
\"Llima llima?\"  
  
**Lima：**  
Are you talking to me?  
Mahiru calls me Limalima.  
  
**Lima：**  
Q-quit it!  
Stop saying \"llima llima\" over and over again, please?  
  
**Lima：**  
I don't know why, but it's making me incredibly uneasy!  
  
**Lima：**  
That's better.  
Thank you for listening.  
  
**Lima：**  
What happened to you, {player}?  
It's almost like you're half asleep.  
  
**Lima：**  
Wait, did you doze off on your feet earlier?  
  
**Lima：**  
Hmm?  
You feel like you had a strange dream?  
What was it about?  
  
**Lima：**  
I-I was there?  
Wow...  
  
**Lima：**  
Do you think about me so much that  
I even show up in your dreams?  
  
**Lima：**  
Aww, that's kind of flattering.  
Hee hee hee! ♪  
  
**Lima：**  
I have a recurring dream sometimes, too.  
  
**Lima：**  
I wake up in the morning as a normal, everyday  
girl. The kind you see everywhere. Ordinary, but  
happy and celebrating the day-to-day joys of life.  
  
**Lima：**  
I know it's just a dream,  
but I always feel a bit sad  
when I wake up...  
  
**Lima：**  
Still, I have to live the life I was given  
here in the real world.  
  
**Lima：**  
But it's still lovely to dream, isn't it?
