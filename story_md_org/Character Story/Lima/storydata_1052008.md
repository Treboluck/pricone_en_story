# Lima Episode 8
Lima has a ball at the costume party in her temporary humanoid form. Suddenly, {player} is bathed in a strange light, and dreams about taking Lima to the zoo. Lima wanted it to be a date, but it turns into a mess.
  
## Subtitle: I'm Grateful We Met
  
**Lima：**  
Hee hee.  
I had a wonderful time tonight,  
{player}.  
  
**Lima：**  
We had a close call at the costume ball though, didn't we?  
When the beastman guard caught wind of my scent...  
  
**Lima：**  
He started shouting, \"I smell a monster! Get it!\"  
I thought I was finished.  
 What a commotion!  
  
**Lima：**  
You probably thought the night was a disaster after getting  
wrapped up in all that craziness.  
But in spite of it all, I still had a lot of fun!  
  
**Lima：**  
Fortunately, thanks to this \"metamorph apple\" that  
Neneka gave me, we managed to fool them.  
  
**Lima：**  
Yup.  
It's all thanks to this mystical apple Neneka made for me.  
  
**Lima：**  
One bite of this, and I can turn into my humanoid form  
whenever I want.  
  
**Lima：**  
But the effect only lasts for a couple of hours, and if my body  
experiences any kind of major shock or trauma,  
I'll turn back into my usual form.  
  
**Lima：**  
Unfortunately, that means combat is off the table  
when I'm in this state.  
  
**Lima：**  
The metamorphosis is very stressful on me.  
It sends jolts of intense pain through every inch of my body.  
  
**Lima：**  
It is still a prototype, after all.  
But despite the drawbacks, I'm grateful to be able to  
change whenever I want.  
  
**Lima：**  
Neneka said she'd continue doing research  
and try to extend the duration and improve on the effects.  
  
**Lima：**  
Hopefully before long, I'll be able to stay in this form  
from morning until night.  
  
**Lima：**  
Maybe then we can go on a day-long date, {player}!  
  
**Lima：**  
Hee hee.  
But more than anything, I'm so happy I was finally able  
to show you that I can transform now.  
  
**Lima：**  
It was breaking my heart that I couldn't find a way  
to convince you.  
  
**Lima：**  
But when I finally ate a metamorph apple and shapeshifted  
right in front of you...  
Well, you kind of had to believe me then.  
  
**Lima：**  
I'm just relieved everything's cleared up now.  
  
**Lima：**  
Now we can hold hands and walk around on a date  
like we're a normal, everyday human couple.  
  
**Lima：**  
I'll never be able to thank Neneka enough.  
  
**Lima：**  
My dreams have all come true.  
Ahh, I'm on cloud nine...  
  
**Lima：**  
If this all really does turn out to be a dream,  
I don't know what I'll do.  
I don't think my heart can take it.  
  
**Lima：**  
Just the thought that this might not be real  
makes my stomach twist up into knots.  
  
**Lima：**  
But never mind!  
I don't look like myself with a frown on my face!  
  
**Lima：**  
I've gotta stay positive and look on the bright side,  
like always!  
Llima llima!  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh?  
D-did I just say \"llima llima?\"  
  
**Lima：**  
I've been doing that a lot lately.  
Maybe it's a side effect of the metamorph apple?  
  
**Lima：**  
It's weird, but honestly, there's no side effect that would  
surprise me. The apples are still in the experimental phase,  
and they literally defy all logic and reason.  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh?  
I shouldn't feel like I have to transform?  
  
**Lima：**  
You're worried about the long-term side effects?  
You...  
you don't have any problem with the normal Lima?  
  
**Lima：**  
Thank you. I'm really, really touched to hear you say that.  
It makes me happy to be alive.  
  
**Lima：**  
{player}...  
I'm grateful we met. ♪  
  
**Lima：**  
But that's the problem.  
The idea that I'd never be able to go on a date with you...  
  
**Lima：**  
Or never be able to walk around holding hands...  
It was just too much for me to bear any longer.  
  
**Lima：**  
Eek!  
Wh-whoa!  
{player}, you're glowing again!  
  
**Lima：**  
What is that light?  
It's making me very, very stressed for some reason!

(Wow, my first trip to the zoo!)

Llima. Llima llima.  
(Right. In Astrum, I can communicate with people.)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima llima, llima.

on a date there.)

Llima llima, llima.  
(Sorry to make you go through so much trouble.)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima, llima llima...  
(At least at the zoo there are lots of other animals,  
so I won't stick out...)

a fuss!)

**Boy：**  
Hey, look at that funny animal!  
  
**Girl：**  
It's eating apples!  
How cute!  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima? Llima llima?  
(Huh? Where did all these people come from?)  
  
**Girl：**  
I wanna feed it.  
Here, have an apple!

Me too, me too!

**Zookeeper：**  
Ah, I was wondering what all the excitement was about.  
A llama, huh? What a rare sight.  
  
**Zookeeper：**  
We don't have any llamas here at our zoo.  
Where did it come from?  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima. Llima llima. Llima!  
(Hee hee. {player} brought me along.  
He paid for my ticket and everything!)  
  
**Zookeeper：**  
Hmm. So you brought her in, huh?  
  
**Zookeeper：**  
The guests sure did love her! She's a rare animal  
around here, plus she's cute, and clearly very  
smart.  
  
**Zookeeper：**  
Maybe I could make her into the new star of the zoo!  
  
**Zookeeper：**  
Any way I could convince you to give her to us?  
  
**Zookeeper：**  
I'd really love to add your pet to our exhibit.  
  
**Lima：**  
L-llima?  
(P-pet?)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima, llima llima!  
(Of course, it's only natural he'd view me like that!)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima, llima llima.  
({player} and I are completely different species, after all.)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima llima, llima!  
(I knew from the beginning that this love wasn't meant to be!)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima, llima llima?  
(But was it so wrong for me to dream it could happen?)  
  
**Zookeeper：**  
Oof!  
H-hey, settle down!  
  
**Zookeeper：**  
Everyone, get back!  
This animal is getting spooked!  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima! Llima! Llima!  
(Hey! Don't call me an animal!  
I mean, I am an animal, but still!)  
  
**Lima：**  
LLIMA LLIMA LLIMAAAA?!  
(Waaah! Why must the gods be so cruel?!)

**Ameth：**  
Oh, Lima!  
*sob* You poor thing.  
What a trouper!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Please don't give up! Keep fighting!  
Rage against your fate, and find a path to a happy  
relationship with {player}!  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'll be rooting for you the whole way!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oops.  
Sorry, I got a little carried away there.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm a total sucker for stories like this.  
Tragic tales of unrequited love. A heroine, toyed with by fate,  
only to see her chances for happiness doomed.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But maybe not. Maybe it's too soon to call her love  
unrequited and destined for failure.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The true battle has only just begun.  
Keep fighting, Lima!  
  
**Ameth：**  
With her new ability to shapeshift into a human  
\"here\", she still has a shot.  
  
**Ameth：**  
At the same time, I feel like her hopes have been  
built up, but she'll eventually be thrown into the  
depths of despair.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ultimately, her fate may turn out to be far more crushing  
and cruel now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The name \"Neneka\" intrigues me, too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's a unique enough name that I doubt it's a different person.  
It must be the same Neneka of the Seven Crowns, right?  
  
**Ameth：**  
And if it *is* her, I have no idea what she's plotting.  
Be vigilant, and make sure you've got Lima's back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I can't really influence anything directly yet.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Please, keep Lima safe.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Actually, no.  
Make Lima happy,  
{player}...  
  

---  
  
**Lima：**  
...{player}?  
Are you awake now?  
  
**Lima：**  
You passed out and fell into a deep sleep.  
It really gave me a scare, too!  
Everything okay? Do you feel sick or anything?  
  
**Lima：**  
Yes. I know where you're staying, so...  
  
**Lima：**  
I thought I'd just carry you back while you slept.  
  
**Lima：**  
But in my human form I was too weak  
and couldn't even lift you...  
So I changed back to normal.  
  
**Lima：**  
It's really late, and there aren't many people around.  
I doubt anyone will notice me and start a panic.  
  
**Lima：**  
Hee hee.  
I was really hoping for a goodnight kiss, too.  
  
**Lima：**  
But you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.  
We still went on a date, and that's more than enough  
for me.  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh?  
You could still kiss me, even in this form?  
  
**Lima：**  
I guess.  
But {player}, if you were going to kiss a girl,  
you'd rather she be human, wouldn't you?  
  
**Lima：**  
I'm sure  
I'll have lots more chances in the future.  
  
**Lima：**  
I'll... wait.  
I'll wait for that moment where it's exactly like  
the happy ending in a fairy tale.  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh, {player}, look at the moon.  
Isn't it beautiful?  
Such a romantic sight...
