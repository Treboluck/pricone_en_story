**Lima：**  
Hrrragh!  
  
**Lima：**  
Oww, oww, oww.  
I swung way too hard that time. My hooves are numb!  
But it looks like I've chopped enough wood now.  
  
**Lima：**  
Now I need to take it back to the farm so they can mill it,  
and I can haul the latest order down to town!  
  
**Lima：**  
Hee hee.  
Knowing that I'll probably see {player}  
on the way there  
is great motivation to get my work done.  
  
**Lima：**  
He doesn't show the slightest bit of prejudice.  
He just talks to me like I'm anyone else.  
  
**Lima：**  
Ahh, I just love him!  
As a friend, of course.  
Hee hee!  
  
**Lima：**  
I can't wait to see you again, {player}.  
Which means I've gotta get back to work.  
  
**Lima：**  
Choppity chop!  
  
**Lima：**  
*sigh* Axes really are better at  
felling trees than swords.  
Too bad this sword is the only tool I can handle properly.  
  
**Lima：**  
Still, I'm really starting to enjoy carpentry.  
Yeah, that's the spirit. People who can find the fun in  
everything are the real winners!  
  
**Lima：**  
I'm kind of uncoordinated, so felling trees is about all  
I'm good for.  
But maybe I'll try and learn how to carve  
wooden dolls, just for the heck of it.  
  
**Lima：**  
Then if I get really good, I can open up a stand at the farm  
and sell them as souvenirs.  
  
**Lima：**  
Elizabeth Park's done so much for me. I need to do everything  
I can to repay them.  
  
**Lima：**  
I could probably ask Shiori if she could get me a book about  
woodworking.  
I'd much rather go shopping for one myself,  
but I can't go into town.  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh well.  
Gotta remember to always look on the bright side.  
  
**Lima：**  
I can't say my days are anything but fulfilling.  
Yeah, I'm happy.  
Asking for more than this  
would just be being greedy.  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh?  
Hey, that's {player}!  
  
**Lima：**  
What's he doing up here in the mountains?  
He looks really alarmed, too!  
  
**Lima：**  
Aieeee!  
Wh-what's wrong?!  
Not so rough!  
  
**Lima：**  
Where are you trying to drag me?!  
Explain yourself—I won't be forced into anything!  
It's not right if it's not a loving—  
  
**Lima：**  
*sniffle*  
Huh? There have been multiple reports of monster  
activity around here, so an extermination squad's coming  
up from the town?  
 {player}, are you part of it?  
  
**Lima：**  
Slow down. You're afraid if they find me, they'll think I'm  
one of the monsters and try to attack me. So you came to help?  
  
**Lima：**  
O-okay. So I should hide in these bushes, huh?  
I understand.  
  
**Lima：**  
Th-thank you.  
You might have saved my life. I wasn't paying a  
bit of attention to my surroundings. If they'd found me first,  
they would've killed me before I even realized what happened.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Be quiet.  
**Choice: (2)**  Don't be scared. I'll protect you.  
`Tag 1`  
**Lima：**  
R-right.  
I'll breathe quietly and I won't move a muscle.  
  
**Lima：**  
Eeek! Why are you dumping leaves all over me?!  
Oh, right. Camouflage.  
Of course. We don't want anyone to notice I'm here.  
  
**Lima：**  
Ugh, not now!  
The leaves are tickling my nose.  
I'm gonna sneeze!  
  
**Lima：**  
G-gotta stifle it. Mmm...  
Mmph! I'm gonna go insane!  
I'm a girl. I'm not meant to sit like a statue and stay silent!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Lima：**  
*squee*  
You're... so cool.  
  
**Lima：**  
But {player}, why are you so frantic about protecting me?  
  
**Lima：**  
I'm really happy, but I don't get it.  
Usually, people just get scared at the sight of me  
and try to stay as far away as possible.  
  
**Lima：**  
You really are a funny boy, you know?  
But thank you all the same.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Lima：**  
...  
  
**Lima：**  
I-is it safe?  
Are the monster exterminators gone?  
  
**Lima：**  
Whew. That's a relief.  
Thank you again for keeping me safe, {player}.  
  
**Lima：**  
That was such a thrill.  
You were my knight in shining armor,  
like in a fairy tale!  
  
**Lima：**  
Right. The exterminators are probably still lurking around.  
I'll go back to the safety of the farm for now.  
\"Slaughtered by monster exterminators\" isn't how I want to go.  
  
**Lima：**  
*sigh* I can't take it anymore. If I looked like  
a normal human, I wouldn't have to deal with any of this.  
Why does this only have to happen to me?  
  
**Lima：**  
Just kidding! Whining won't change anything.  
I accept things for what they are and try to find  
the silver lining,  
no matter what the situation.  
  
**Lima：**  
I'm just sad I'll have to take a break from my job.  
I guess this means we won't see each other for a while.  
  
**Lima：**  
But it's not worth dying for.  
I'll try and stay out of sight until things settle down.  
  
**Lima：**  
Hmm? If I'm going to be lonely,  
you'll come visit me at the farm?  
  
**Lima：**  
Thank you!  
Okay, I'll look forward to it.  
  
**Lima：**  
Hee hee.  
{player} is such a nice guy.  
I really, really like him.  
  
**Lima：**  
But we're different species, in different positions,  
who live in different worlds. No matter how much I care  
for him, we can never be anything more than friends.  
  
**Lima：**  
That's what truly makes me sad.
