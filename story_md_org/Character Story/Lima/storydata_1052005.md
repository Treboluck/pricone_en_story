## Subtitle: A Curious Contact
  
**Lima：**  
All right, time for another day of lumberjill work!  
Out in the trees, la la la... ♪  
  
**Lima：**  
Ever since {player} explained things to them,  
the extermination squads that might have mistaken me  
for a monster stopped coming into the forest.  
  
**Lima：**  
Of course, the condition was that Elizabeth Park  
has to deal with any monster-related incidents in  
the forest now.  
  
**Lima：**  
But it's only fair that we take some responsibility  
for our own safety.  
 Besides, the monsters around here  
aren't even that dangerous.  
  
**Lima：**  
Plus, we've got Caon members like Rin and Shiori stationed at  
the farm.  
  
**Lima：**  
Whatever happens, we'll be fine.  
Right now, I'm just enjoying the peace again!  
  
**Lima：**  
I really need to thank {player}.  
He spent a lot of time explaining things to the  
extermination squads to make sure I'd be safe.  
  
**Lima：**  
I have to do something for him! Maybe send him a present?  
Oh, or I could get Mahiru to teach me how to bake  
some kind of tasty treat.  
  
**Lima：**  
But I'm such a klutz, I'll need lots and lots of practice  
to make decent baked goods.  
  
**Lima：**  
On the other hand,  
that's basically my only problem  
now. What a charmed life I lead!  
  
**Lima：**  
No more shouts of \"Monster!\"  
 and getting chased  
all over the place, moments away from doom.  
  
**Lima：**  
If only these uneventful days could go on forever.  
  
**Lima：**  
Well, I need to pull my weight and make enough money  
for Elizabeth Park  
to at least support myself,  
so they don't kick me out.  
  
**Lima：**  
Right!  
Time to blast through these trees and sell some timber!  
Let's chop!  
  
**???：**  
Stop.  
Forgive the interruption, but could you please not cut me down?  
  
**Lima：**  
Bwuh?  
Am I crazy, or did that tree just talk?!  
  
**???：**  
I am not a tree.  
Just a moment.  
I'll show my true form.  
  

---  
  
**Neneka：**  
Good day, and nice to meet you.  
You can call me Neneka.  
  
**Lima：**  
The tree just turned into a girl?!  
What is this, magic? An illusion?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Something like magic, yes.  
Although it's a bit of a higher-level phenomenon  
than everyday spells.  
  
**Lima：**  
Umm... I don't really understand what that means,  
but is there a way I could use that magic, too?  
  
**Lima：**  
Say, to transform myself into a person?  
I-I want to be human!  
  
**Neneka：**  
Hmm. I'm afraid this ability is unique to me, and me alone.  
For another to use it would be difficult, to say the least.  
  
**Neneka：**  
It would be challenging enough for a fellow member  
of the Seven Crowns...  
But for you? I would say impossible.  
  
**Lima：**  
I see.  
Well, that's disappointing, but it is what it is.  
  
**Lima：**  
I was born this way. No matter how human my heart is,  
the joys that only a normal girl can have are out of my reach.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Hmm.  
I might be able to use my own power  
to temporarily change your appearance.  
  
**Neneka：**  
But it would be short-lived, with numerous limits.  
  
**Lima：**  
R-really?  
That's incredible!  
You would do that for me?!  
  
**Lima：**  
I'll pay whatever you want. I'm basically a freeloader,  
and I don't have much savings, but I'll work my tail off  
to earn more money.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I don't need payment.  
The money in this world is worthless in reality.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I'll make you a deal.  
In exchange for altering your appearance,  
I'd like you to do a little work for me.  
  
**Neneka：**  
No, I should be frank. You'll be part of my experiment.  
You're a rather unique existence...  
I'm quite interested in you.  
  
**Lima：**  
Experiment?  
Sounds a little... shady.  
I'm kind of scared to ask more.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I won't force you.  
The choice is yours to make.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Whether in fairy tales or real life, miracles always have  
a price.  
It would be selfish to ask for all your desires to  
be granted without giving something in return, don't you think?  
  
**Lima：**  
That's true.  
Let me think about it.  
  
**Lima：**  
Can you tell me more about the experiment itself?  
I'd like to have all the info  
before making my decision. Do you live here in the forest?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Yes. Specifically, in the ruins deeper in the forest.  
That also happens to be the test site.  
  
**Neneka：**  
I erected a barrier around the area to protect myself from  
being discovered. So it won't do to have the surrounding  
trees being felled left and right.  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh, so that's why you stopped me before I could  
cut down that last tree. I understand. I'll come  
back here tomorrow.  
Will you wait for me, Neneka?  
  
**Neneka：**  
Sure...  
Assuming nothing extreme happens,  
I won't leave this spot.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Just to be safe, I'd like to ask that you not tell anyone else  
about me.  
  
**Lima：**  
Okay.  
I'm sure you have your reasons.  
  
**Lima：**  
We're a lot alike.  
I don't care to run into people I don't know, either.  
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.  
  
**Lima：**  
I promise, okay, Neneka?  
I don't know your situation, but if you ever feel like being  
alone is too much,  
 you can always cry on my shoulder.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Please don't speak to me like a child.  
I'm much older than I appear.  
  
**Neneka：**  
Back to the topic at hand. I'll trust you.  
 I find animals are  
much more loyal than humans. Let's both work to keep up  
our end of the bargain, so that we don't regret meeting.  
  
**Lima：**  
I'm back!  
Oh, hi, {player}!  
  
**Lima：**  
Delivering mail to the farm again?  
You're such a hard worker!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Likewise.  
**Choice: (2)**  You look pale. Are you okay?  
`Tag 1`  
**Lima：**  
Thanks.  
We're both no stranger to hard labor, are we?  
Life is so tough! ♪  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Lima：**  
Ha ha ha.  
Am I? I must be tired from a hard day's work, too.  
  
**Lima：**  
Actually, can you really tell I look pale?  
I'd think it would be a lot harder to tell the color  
of my face compared to normal human girls.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Lima：**  
Wh-whoa!  
What're you doing?  
Why are you hugging me all of a sudden?  
  
**Lima：**  
You're tired, and wanted someone soft and fluffy  
to help ease your weariness?  
  
Geez, I'm not a stress ball, you know!  
  
**Lima：**  
Oh, fine. I don't really mind!  
Good work today, {player}. There, there. ♪  
  
**Lima：**  
*sigh* Maybe {player} just thinks of me  
as some kind of bizarre animal.  
He wouldn't just go in for casual hugs with human girls.  
  
**Lima：**  
I guess...  
I'm a little sad he thinks like that.
