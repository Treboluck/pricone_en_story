# Lima Episode 11
After seeing off the stage director, who passionately compels Lima to perform in his new play, the pair are enveloped in light and whisked off into a dream where, despite not being able to communicate, they huddle together in a park to watch a film. Once Lima wakes up, she resolves to perform on stage.
  
## Subtitle: A Special Warmth
  
**Narration：**  
The stage director has completed his script  
and is ardently pressing Lima to perform.  
  
**Director：**  
As you see, I've finished the script!  
All I need now is for you to nod your head!  
Please!  
  
**Lima：**  
Even if you say that, impossible is impossible!  
I'm really sorry that you came all the way out here,  
but please go home!  
  
**Director：**  
All right! I'll give up for today, but I'll be back!  
And I'll keep coming back!  
See ya!  
  
**Lima：**  
Why won't he give up?  
You're wondering the same too, right?  
  
**Lima：**  
Why won't I take the stage, you ask?  
It's aaabsolutely not happening!  
There's no way I can get up in front of other people...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Even though you already played a noble's daughter...  
**Choice: (2)**  Of course you can.  
`Tag 1`  
**Lima：**  
That's not relevant here!  
And it's really embarrassing, so stop bringing it up!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Lima：**  
Huh?  
You think I can do it?  
You're right! It's not good to put myself down so much!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Lima：**  
I do have a lot of reservations,  
but becoming a princess is so enticing...  
precisely because I'm so far removed from that kind of thing,  
you know?  
  
**Lima：**  
What?!  
This again!  
I'm not in the mood right now!

**Lima：**  
Llima,  
llima llima.  
(Sorry for saying I wanted to go on a movie date.)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima llima.  
(In Astrum we can communicate our intentions,  
so I sometimes ask things I shouldn't.)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima, llima...  
(There's no way I could just walk into a cinema, right...?)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima,  
llima llima llima.  
 (But I'm glad you said we could watch a movie on your phone.  
It made me so happy.)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima, llima llima!  
(To think, we can just lay out a blanket like this, watch a movie,  
and enjoy a picnic together. What a deal!)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima,  
llima llima.  
(I brought some apples for snacks, so let's get watching!)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima, llima llima.  
(Wow... That was a really nice story... I was right,  
love stories really are great.)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima?  
Llima llima?  
(Hm, what's this? No response? I knew it. Boys think romance films are  
boring, huh?)  
  
**Choice: (4)**  ...It's getting cold.  
`Tag 4`  
**Lima：**  
Llima! Llima llima!  
(I'm so sorry! O-of course!  
Watching a whole movie outside, you're bound to get cold!)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima?!Lli-llima!  
(W-what should we do?! I've got it!  
Snuggle up to me to get warm!)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima,  
llima llima!  
(Even if I say that, he won't understand.  
It's embarrassing, but I'll have to... hrngh!)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima! Llima llima!  
(See! If I do this, hrngh! If I pull your body into mine,  
you're sure to warm right up!)  
  
**Little Girl：**  
Hey, look! That boy is getting picked on by that animal!  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima?! Llima llima!  
(What?! No no no!  
I'm just trying to warm him up!)  
  
**Young Man：**  
Hey, boy! Are you okay?! I'm coming to save you!  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima llima!  
(How did it end up like this?!  
All I'm trying to do is get him warmed up!)  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Hug Lima.  
`Tag 5`

**Lima：**  
Llima?!  
(Huh?!)  
  
**Choice: (6)**  There there.  
`Tag 6`  
**Lima：**  
Llima?!Llima llima?  
(Ah! You're petting me to show them that  
I'm not attacking you!)  
  
**Little Girl：**  
Ohhh, it's just playing with the boy!  
It's a really big animal, so I got confused.  
  
**Young Man：**  
Oh my, I jumped the gun...  
I'm glad he's not being attacked.  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima!  
Llima llima!  
(The process was a bit messy, but I'm glad I got my meaning across.  
I'll obviously be happy if he warms up...)  
  
**Lima：**  
Llima... Llima llima...  
(But somehow I feel much warmer myself...  
When I'm with him, I always get a cozy feeling...)

**Ameth：**  
...*sniff*.  
Lima looked so happy! How wonderful!  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's right, Lima can also be happy!  
I won't accept the idea that she can't be!  
  
**Ameth：**  
You don't have to do anything special for her.  
Just be yourself, and be there for her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I know you can do it.  
In fact, I believe you're the only one who can.

**Lima：**  
Llima... llima...  
  
**Lima：**  
*yawn* H-huh?  
Did I suddenly fall asleep?  
  
**Lima：**  
W-what?  
Oh no, {player} is asleep with his arms around me.  
  
**Lima：**  
Doing such things to a girl is a no go,  
so I should probably scold him for it...  
But his sleeping face is so cute, I can't bring myself to do it.  
  
**Lima：**  
I can't let him sleep forever though.  
Wake up! You'll catch a cold sleeping in a place like this.  
  
**Lima：**  
That's it, up you get. Good boy.  
  
**Lima：**  
Strange. I'm so glad we can communicate with words.  
But even though it's a totally normal thing, it somehow feels like a miracle.  
  
**Lima：**  
Earlier I said that going on stage was never going to happen...  
But it's not that I don't want to...  
  
**Lima：**  
And it's not often that  
someone needs me...  
  
**Lima：**  
It would be a waste to pass up on this opportunity when it's right in front of my eyes.  
I'm letting a good thing get away!  
  
**Lima：**  
All right, I've made up my mind!  
I'm gonna be a star!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  You have my support.  
`Tag 7`  
**Lima：**  
Thank you!  
I know I'll struggle from time to time, and I'll probably  
need your help a lot,  
so I'm counting on you!  
  
**Narration：**  
Firmly resolute, Lima's eyes flickered with the flames of determination.
