**Narration：**  
Lima is hard at work felling timber for the day.  
  
**Lima：**  
Heave-ho!  
It's so easy to chop down trees in my normal form.  
  
**Lima：**  
While I'm in human form, I can't do this kind of manual labor.  
Even if I'm attacked by ruffians, there's nothing I can do about it.  
  
**Lima：**  
Until now I've often been mistaken for a monster and attacked,  
but that was my first  dangerous encounter as a girl.  
  
**Lima：**  
It's so scary when I remember what happened.  
But  
{player} was  
sooo cool!  
Honestly, it was like a scene from a story...  
  
**Lima：**  
If it *was* a story, I'd be the delicate daughter of a noble,  
and he'd be, like, my butler or something...  
  
**Lima：**  
I'm forced into an unwanted marriage, from which {player} rescues me.  
But we're hunted down by a posse of goons unleashed by my  
tyrannical father, who corner us in a blind alley, and...!  
  
**Lima：**  
\"Stop! Don't hurt him!  
I'll do as Father wishes and get married, so please let him go!\"  
  
**Lima：**  
\"{player} is so precious to me…\"  
  
**Choice: (1)**  And you're precious to me.  
`Tag 1`  
**Lima：**  
Huh?!  
Y-youuu! How long have you been standing there?!  
  
**Lima：**  
Not long?  
W-well, then you only heard a little, right...?  
  
**Lima：**  
You were listening from the \"daughter of a noble\" part?  
That was the beginning!  
How embarrassing!  
  
**Lima：**  
...It's a pretty silly thought, right?  
That I, who can haul lumber around no problem at all,  
would be a delicate maiden.  
  
**Lima：**  
You don't think so?  
Thank you.  
I was right, you are kind.  
  
**Lima：**  
Because you're like that, I...  
  
**???：**  
Aguahhh!  
  
**Lima：**  
A scream?!  
It came from over there!  
Let's go!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**???：**  
H-help me!  
  
**Lima：**  
I've got this!  
Here I come!  
Hrrrgh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GREEOOOUGHHHH!  
  
**Lima：**  
Whew. That was a close one!  
Are you okay?  
  
**???：**  
…………  
  
**Lima：**  
Uh-oh, not good!  
Did my current form frighten him?!  
Wh-what should I do?!  
  
**???：**  
Oh... my...!  
You came to my rescue right when I needed you! Thanks a lot!  
  
**???：**  
You really saved my bacon! Since we're out here in the sticks,  
I thought I was about to meet my maker!  
And I must say, your costume is magnificent!  
  
**Lima：**  
Hey, h-hold on a sec!  
Don't touch me all over like that!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Protect Lima.  
`Tag 2`  
**Director：**  
Ah, apologies.  
It's just part of my job to notice such things.  
I'm the director and prop maker for a troupe...  
Hm?  
Did you by any chance come and see our play the other day?  
  
**Director：**  
Ah! It is you! Halfway through you stirred up quite a commotion,  
so I deeefinitely remember you!  
You had a real beauty with you, didn't ya?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  That beauty is right here.  
**Choice: (4)**  She's still with me.  
`Tag 3`  
**Lima：**  
B-beauty? Me...?!  
  
**Director：**  
Why are you so bashful?  
Eh? Don't tell me, under that costume...?  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Lima：**  
\"Still\"? Hearing you say that makes me so happy!  
How embarrassing!  
  
**Director：**  
\"Still\"?  
Don't tell me, under that costume...?  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Director：**  
What?! You're pulling my leg! You're a hell of a fighter,  
so I never would have thought such a pretty girl was inside!  
Sorry for putting my hands on ya like that!  
  
**Lima：**  
Don't worry about it. I'm used to people finding me unusual...  
More importantly, why did you come all the way out to  
the middle of the forest by yourself? It's dangerous, you know.  
  
**Director：**  
Er... yeah, I heard that I could find light, yet sturdy wood around here.  
I thought maybe I could use it to make props and such,  
so I came a-lookin'.  
  
**Lima：**  
If that's the case, I think it's that tree way over there.  
Come with me, I'll show you.  
  
**Director：**  
Ohhh! You're spot on!  
This is it, this is the tree!  
  
**Lima：**  
I'm glad we found it.  
Well then, I'll chop it down for you, so just hold tight a moment!  
  
**Director：**  
You'll cut it down for me? *You* will, little lady?  
  
**Lima：**  
Hrrragh!  
  
**Lima：**  
Just a little bit more!  
Hrrragh!  
  
**Director：**  
...No way.  
  
**Lima：**  
If you chop it, you've gotta gather it up.  
Hngh, phew.  
  
**Director：**  
............  
  
**Lima：**  
Ah! No, I...  
I usually use a pulley, but this tree is so light!  
I guess for normal girls this would be too heavy?  
  
**Director：**  
That's it!  
Thanks to you, I've just come up with a story about a princess  
who's transformed into a monster by a curse!  
  
**Lima：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Director：**  
When I've written the script, I want you to be the star!  
It won't work without your realness!  
Come on, I'm begging you! You totally fit the bill!  
  
**Lima：**  
Huh? Whaaat?!  
M-me, on stage?!  
There's absolutely no way, no way, no waaay!  
  
**Narration：**  
Lima's cries and the sounds of trees being chopped down  
continued to echo throughout the forest.
