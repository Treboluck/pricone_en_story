## Subtitle: Beyond Prejudice and Misunderstanding
  
**Narration：**  
After completing the self-defense course, Mahiru and  
{player} are on their way back to Elizabeth Park.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Well, I sure learned a lot today.  
Compared to random trainin',  
learnin' the right way to do it an' then puttin' it into practice  
makes a real difference.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Thanks to that, I already feel a little stronger.  
How 'bout you?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hard to know until I get into a fight.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mahiru：**  
Right?  
But I'd rather not have to use these new techniques.  
Above all else, I want my guild members to live happy lives.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Well, I reckon efficient strength trainin' an' correct body  
movement exercises can be real useful for dairy farmin' too.  
  
Everythin' depends on how ya use it.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, before I forget!  
Cousin, do ya mind if we take a detour on the way back to the ranch?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
There's a farmin' village down the road where I often stock up on seeds.  
We're in the neighborhood, so we might as well stop by.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Whew, we're finally here.  
It's always such a nice, peaceful village—  
  
**???：**  
Give me a break!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Eek! Wh-what in tarnation was that voice jus' now?  
In such a peaceful village where fighting's rare, this kinda yellin'...  
It ain't normal!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Looks like we might have to use the skills we jus' learned after all...  
Let's go, cousin!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ah, over there! The farmers are all gathered around.  
Why?! They're against violence!  
  
**Farmer 1：**  
Hm? If it isn't the girl from Elizabeth Park.  
What's going on with that getup? Is it a new gag?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Th-that can wait for now!  
What's goin' on over there?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
It sounds like things're gettin' real rowdy,  
so I dashed right on over.  
  
**Farmer 1：**  
Goodness... You've caught us in an embarrassing situation.  
It's all *his* fault.  
  
**Man：**  
...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Can't say I know that face. He a recent arrival?  
  
**Farmer 1：**  
He is. He used to be a ruffian, but he washed his hands of all that  
to give the farm life a go.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
So rather'n hurt people, he chose to make his daily bread.  
That's a wonderful thing.  
So what's the problem?  
  
**Farmer 1：**  
Well, you see, he's always running off when he should be working.  
He keeps slacking off and never gets anything done.  
  
**Farmer 2：**  
I saw him one night going to the outskirts of the village.  
He used to be a roughneck. I bet he's still dealing with  
bad guys in secret.  
  
**Farmer 3：**  
He's always covered in injuries. Isn't that suspicious?  
  
**Man：**  
...  
  
**Farmer 1：**  
No matter what we say, he keeps his lips tightly closed.  
I got sick of it and ended up raising my voice.  
  
**Farmer 2：**  
But he's not denying anything, so...  
  
**Farmer 3：**  
Isn't it dangerous to let him stay in the village?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Leave him alone! Aren't y'all neighbors in this village?  
Ya can't be talkin' like that!  
  
**Farmer 1：**  
But you see, miss.  
The reality is, little girls are afraid of him.  
If something happens, it'll already be too late.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...Tell ya what, me and my pal here'll sort out this mess.  
As a third party, we'll listen to what this fella has to say.  
It won't be too late to make a decision then, will it?  
  
**Farmer 1：**  
...Understood. We'll leave it up to you for now.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...Well, I should've thought a little more before assertin' myself.  
How should I do this?  
This fella ain't said a thing this whole time...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Open his heart with a joke.  
`Tag 2`  
**Mahiru：**  
Good thinkin'! That's somethin' only I can do!  
Ya gave me an idea for a top-tier agricultural gag!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Gosh, you an' all the village folks need to calm down.  
Y'all're growin'  
such tasty vegetables, ya oughtta gather 'round  
 a good meal and talk  
with open artichokes!  
  
**Man：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Ahahahah!  
**Choice: (4)**  She replaced \"hearts\" with \"artichokes\"...  
`Tag 3`  
**Mahiru：**  
Hey, there ain't no point in you laughin'...  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Mahiru：**  
Don't explain the joke to him!  
It loses its impact when ya do that!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Mahiru：**  
Lemme get straight to the point.  
Tell me, why're ya always ditchin' work?  
Don'tcha like agriculture?  
  
**Man：**  
...That ain't it.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, ya finally spoke!  
Listen, won't ya take us to the place ya always go when ya should be  
workin'?  
  
**Man：**  
...It's this way.  
  
**Man：**  
Here.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
This is the edge of the village.  
Well, ain't nobody here, so I see why it's a good place to avoid work.  
But it's kinda far from the fields. Ain't that a pain?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Take a look at this.  
`Tag 6`  
**Mahiru：**  
Hm? The wall here's broken, and someone's tried to repair it.  
It'd be dangerous if monsters showed up...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ah! Don't tell me, you've been comin' to check up on it?!  
  
**Man：**  
...Yeah. I'm used to fighting, so I've been patrolling  
and chasing off monsters.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
So that's why you've been coming' home with injuries.  
If that's the case, why ain't you told nobody 'bout it?  
  
**Man：**  
These villagers ain't got fighting experience.  
I don't wanna get any of them hurt.  
So I took on the burden alone.  
  
**Man：**  
Besides, they won't listen to a guy like me who's got a guilty conscience  
and a dark past.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
What're ya sayin'?  
Ya can't make assumptions like that before even talkin' to 'em.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
We'll be right behind ya, so go tell 'em all the truth.  
  
**Man：**  
...You really care about folks, don't you?  
I just met you a few minutes ago, but you're treating me real nice.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Heheh. My guild has a few unique members who can be quite a handful.  
I'm always try'na take care of 'em.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
One of 'em's physically weak, one's a pain in the butt, and one of 'em  
looks real unique. But they're all good at somethin', an' have their  
own positive traits.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You gotta let everyone know what you're good at, and the things  
you're tryin' hard to do.  
If ya do that, then everyone'll enjoy the  
farmin' life, for sure!  
  
**Man：**  
...Do you think I can too? Enjoy the farming life, I mean.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Of course ya can! Nobody who's willin' to put in the effort to deal with  
dirt and animals can be a bad guy—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wah! I-it's a monster intruder!  
Of course it attacks right when I'm bein' profound...  
  
Someone oughtta teach it some manners!  
  
**Man：**  
I already chased this one away!  
If we pull out of here, the village will be in trouble!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Cousin! Let's put into practice what we learned in trainin'!  
The rule of thumb for fightin' monsters is to do it as a team!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
All right, ready guys? Let's do it!  
Yaaaahhh!  
  
**Man：**  
You ain't getting any closer to the village!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
*pant* Phew...  
Wow, that trainin' made a real difference, huh, cousin?  
  
**Man：**  
Thanks a lot for your help.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Eheheh, no problem.  
  
**Farmer 1：**  
Hey, what's all the racket?!  
Ah! A monster?! Did you just take it down?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, the villagers are here. Perfect timin', right?  
Now's your chance to explain. Do ya think ya can do it?  
  
**Man：**  
...Yeah.  
Guys, the truth is...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
An' that's the story.  
So, even without the trust of the villagers,  
he took on the whole burden all alone.  
  
**Farmer 1：**  
...  
Well, now that we've seen this, we have to believe him. We let our  
preconceptions based on his ruffian past skew our image of him.  
Our mistrust of him must have made it hard to talk to us from the start.  
  
**Farmer 1：**  
Sorry about that. And thank you for protecting the village.  
  
**Man：**  
No, it's fine. It's my fault for making you all doubt me.  
  
**Farmer 1：**  
Would you consider continuing your lookout work for us?  
And if you can, we'd like you to teach us the basics of fighting.  
  
**Farmer 1：**  
Because we can't push all the dangerous work onto you alone.  
From now on, let's work together to make this a prosperous village.  
  
**Man：**  
...Sure thing.  
In exchange, I'd like you to teach me how to grow vegetables.  
There are dishes I wanna cook.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wonderful, you're in jus' the right place. You'll make great friends.  
Farmin' ain't a one-person job!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Great! Now that everything's settled,  
it's time for one of my special gags—  
  
**Man & Farmer 1：**  
There's no need for that.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
O-oh, y'all're already workin' together...  
  
**Man：**  
But truly, I'm grateful to you.  
Thank you.  
Just you wait, my vegetables will be great. So come visit again.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  How nice.  
`Tag 7`  
**Mahiru：**  
...Yeah! I'm lookin' forward to it!  
  
**Narration：**  
Having forged new bonds between the villagers,  
Mahiru leaves with a smile on her face.
