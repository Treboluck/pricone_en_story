**Narration：**  
Mahiru and {player} have returned to Elizabeth Park in one piece.  
But the sun has already set by the time they arrive.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
*sigh* Today didn't exactly go as planned,  
so it's gotten pretty late.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Gettin' home right now usin' those dark mountain roads is mighty  
dangerous.  
Ya know, you're more'n welcome to stay the night.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That would be great.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mahiru：**  
Then it's settled.  
I can't roll out the red carpet or nothin' like that,  
but there ain't no shortage of food at least. Make yourself at home.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
All right, I think it's time for supper. Tonight's menu's all 'bout our  
highest quality dairy produce,  
made from milk I squeezed from the  
udder myself.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wowee, you sure can pack a lot into that belly of yours.  
When ya eat that much, it makes it worth all the effort I  
put into makin' it.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Shioshio barely eats, and Rinrin's so picky,  
so I never really cook much.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I wonder what they're all doin' right now...  
Are they eatin' properly?  
I hope they ain't forgotten...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
We're always together, so now that they ain't here, I can't help but  
worry 'bout 'em.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Feeling lonely?  
`Tag 2`  
**Mahiru：**  
Hmmm, I guess it's a reaction to the fact that it's usually  
so lively 'round here.  
I got used to everyone jus' bein' around.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
It hurts my heart to imagine what it'd be like if they didn't come home.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But tonight, you're here with me, so I ain't lonely.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Do you want me to sleep with you?  
`Tag 3`  
**Mahiru：**  
...Cousin, I know your intentions are honest and you're jus' try'na be  
nice, but please, don't say such things to other girls.  
It's just invitin'  
a whole world of misunderstandings and trouble for ya.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
W-well, it's not like I *don't* want ya to sleep with me...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Huh? What's the matter? Why'd ya suddenly stand up...?  
Huh? Wh-why're ya gettin' so close?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
C-control yourself!  
There's a procedure ya gotta follow for this kinda thing...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Can you hear that?  
`Tag 4`  
**Mahiru：**  
Huh? Eh? Hear what...?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
O-oh yeah, I can hear somethin'.  
What could it be?  
D-don't tell me it's a monster.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hey, where're ya goin'...? To check on things outside?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...Wait, I'll go with ya.  
I can't jus' let my special guest go it alone.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Urgh, it's real scary out here at night...  
Shioshio and Limalima usually deal with stuff like this.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I may have the title of guildmaster, but without everyone's help,  
I wouldn't be where I am today.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Deep down, I know how thankful I am for everyone's existence.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But recently, they've all been workin' too dang hard.  
Even Rinrin's been workin' her butt off.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
It's at times like this, I gotta put in the extra effort.  
I'm a disgrace of a guildmaster.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Don't get too worked up about it.  
**Choice: (6)**  Moo!  
`Tag 5`  
**Mahiru：**  
Y-you're right.  
Puttin' on a brave front won't get results.  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Mahiru：**  
Bwahah! Wh-why're ya suddenly mooin' at me like that?!  
A-are ya try'na ease my nerves?  
Heheh, I was a little overenthusiastic 'bout havin' to do my best.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Mahiru：**  
Right, any comedian worth their salt will always make time to smile.  
Otherwise, it's impossible to make people laugh.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Even though I'm older'n ya,  
you're always teachin' me new things.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wahhh! W-was that the sound of a monster?  
The animals are over there...  
Hurry!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Th-there's the monster...! An' i-it's huge...  
Of course it shows up when everyone's away...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...But I-I gotta take it down.  
'Cause I'm a guildmaster...!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  I want you to rely on me more.  
`Tag 8`  
**Mahiru：**  
Thanks, cousin...  
But it's way too dangerous.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  I did that training, so I'll be fine.  
`Tag 9`  
**Mahiru：**  
Heheh, ahahah! When ya say it like that, ya sound cool.  
...Thanks. Let's protect the ranch and my family!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hey! You nasty devil!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Lay a finger on any member of my family, and I'll make mincemeat  
outta ya! Get the heck outta here!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
H-here it comes!  
But I'm ready for it.  
Let's do this, cousin!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Power up Mahiru.  
`Tag 10`  
**Mahiru：**  
Wow, I-I'm brimmin' with power...  
Much obliged!  
Havin' you here's like havin' a hundred men—  
no, a hundred cows behind me!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Come get some! I won't let ya anywhere near my family!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Whoa, you're pretty fierce. If that had landed, I'd be eatin' dirt.  
Nevertheless, your movements are slow.  
I can use that...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Yaaahhh! Attack, withdraw—in and out!  
It's the hit-and-run tactic we learned at trainin'!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ooh! This battle garb's easy to move in after all!  
I wasn't really feelin' it earlier, but now it's givin' me confidence!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh? It's movin' erratically out of anger.  
Dodge the big swing and go straight for an openin'!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Take this! Mad Cow Stampede!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
*pant* Whew... I-I did it...  
I got rid of the monster!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, by the way, that attack name was a pun on the common name for  
bovine spongiform encephalopathy, a terrible medical condition that  
affects...  
Wait, this ain't the time to explain! My darlings, are y'all okay?!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Yeah... Cows, sheep, chickens—not a scratch on any of 'em...  
...Thank goodness, I was so darn worried...  
  
**Choice: (11)**  What an admirable guildmaster.  
`Tag 11`  
**Mahiru：**  
...Nah, I was only able to stand up to such a frightenin' monster  
'cause you were supportin' me.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
So I still got a ways to go.  
But... but maybe it's okay to be just a li'l bit proud.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Waaahhh! I did it! I did iiit!  
It was scary! I was terrified, but I... I protected my family!  
  
**Narration：**  
Perhaps in response to Mahiru's tearful wails of joy,  
the animals also seemingly cried in happiness.
