**???：**  
Huh. Well, this is weird...  
  
**???：**  
I've been walking around for ages now,  
but Landosol's pretty much nowhere in sight.  
  
**???：**  
The map's fine, right?  
Which means I'm... just lost.  
Definitely not a thing I want to be.  
  
**???：**  
Oh no. It's getting pretty dark, too.  
S-sure hope I don't have a run-in with any monsters...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Call out to her.  
`Tag 1`  
**???：**  
Aaaaahhhhh!  
I-it's a monster!  
  
**???：**  
Or... not?  
  
**???：**  
I-I'm so sorry!  
I thought you were a monster...  
  
**Arisa：**  
Oh, right! I'm Arisa!  
Do you mind if I ask your name?  
  
**Arisa：**  
Hm? What's that's noi—  
Ah! It must be one of your friends!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Hello!  
My name's Arisa—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRRAAAAGGHHH!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Eeek?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Protect Arisa.  
**Choice: (3)**  Fight the monsters off.  
`Tag 2`  
**Arisa：**  
Th-thank you!  
I owe you one!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Arisa：**  
...!  
Are we taking them head on?  
Got it! I'll help you out!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Arisa：**  
I got caught off guard earlier,  
but that won't happen again! I'm strong enough to fight monsters!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Yah!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRRRUOOOOOOGGGHHH...!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Woo!  
I did it!  
Wait, what?!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRAAAAAGGHHHH!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Th-there's more?!  
Lots more, too!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Take this! And this!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Urgh, they just keep coming!  
But that won't stop me!  
  
**Arisa：**  
I won't give in!  
I can't! Not now!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Because I'm gonna save Losaria, no matter what!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRAAAAAGGHHHH!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Th-there we go!  
This is kinda weird, though.  
My body feels super light.  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRRRUOOOOOOGGGHHH...!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Yeah, I knew it!  
But how come?!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Tell her about your Princess Knight ability.  
`Tag 5`  
**Arisa：**  
Wait, really?!  
You've got the ability to  
power up anyone near you?  
  
**Arisa：**  
Th-that's incredible!  
Now I really have nothing to worry about!  
A swarm of monsters should be no problem if we work together!  
  
**Arisa：**  
I'll fire off a bunch of arrows,  
then we can run the second there's an opening!  
Right... ready when you are!  
  
**Arisa：**  
*huff, huff*  
W-we managed to get rid of them, right?  
Phew...  
  
**Arisa：**  
Thank you so much for your help.  
I can only imagine what would have  
happened if you weren't there to help.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Get a grip, Arisa. Now's not the time to feel sorry for yourself.  
Focus on getting to Landosol, first and foremost.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Umm. Thank you again for the help.  
I'm sort of in a hurry, though,  
so I need to get going!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Wait... Huh?  
Wh-where are we, even?  
  
**Arisa：**  
A-ahhhhhh! Not good!  
We sped off without even consulting the map,  
so now I'm even more lost than I was before!  
  
**Arisa：**  
I'm never gonna make it to Landosol at this rate...  
Argh! Why am I such a—  
  
**Arisa：**  
Huh?  
Y-you're from Landosol?!  
F-for real?!  
  
**Arisa：**  
U-umm!  
Sorry to ask for another favor when you've already helped me  
out a ton, but would you mind showing me the way to Landosol?  
  
**Arisa：**  
I *have* to get there, no matter what.  
So please! Help me out!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Landosol's just beyond this highway, then?  
Thank you again for the help!  
I honestly have no idea how to repay you...  
  
**Arisa：**  
But now I can finally see her again.  
I'll be there soon, Losaria.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Oh. Sorry about that.  
I'm actually here in search of someone.  
My best friend Losaria, to be precise.  
  
**Arisa：**  
The two of us lived together in the same village.  
We were super close, and even promised to  
become forest guardians together.  
  
**Arisa：**  
But then she just disappeared one day.  
All without a single word to anyone. Not even me.  
  
**Arisa：**  
That's why I'm here. I swore I'd find her, no matter what!  
It's been rough going, but I finally  
found something resembling a lead.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Nothing truly solid, but rumors say she's in Landosol.  
They could end up being false, but I don't have  
any other choice but to believe them.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Oh. That city in the distance is all lit up...  
Is that Landosol?  
It's really pretty...  
  
**Arisa：**  
But also a bit intimidating, too.  
My village never had lights like that.  
  
**Arisa：**  
U-umm...  
  
**Arisa：**  
I, uhh...  
I feel really bad asking this after  
how much you've already helped me, but...  
  
**Arisa：**  
You live there, right?  
To tell the truth, I've never been to a city that big.  
So... Would you mind showing me around?  
  
**Arisa：**  
R-really?!  
Yay! Thank you so much!  
You really are a nice guy.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Oh. That reminds me.  
I never did ask for your name, did I?  
Not calling you by it might get a little bit awkward.  
  
**Arisa：**  
{player}?  
Hehe. That has a nice ring to it.  
I'd say it fits you well.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Hm?  
I don't need to worry about formalities?  
R-really?  
  
**Arisa：**  
Ehehe.  
Truth is, I've never been that fond of them, myself.  
So... Thanks!  
I'll take you up on that.  
  
**Arisa：**  
{player}!  
We've basically just met, but let's get along!  
  
**ナレーション：**  
Arisa, whose naivety begets her new ambition.  
{player}, whose kindness knows no bounds.  
This was the story of how they first met.
