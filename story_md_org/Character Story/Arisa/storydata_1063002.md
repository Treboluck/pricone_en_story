## Subtitle: The Verdant Steward
  
**Narration：**  
Arisa and {player} find themselves  
in the Elven Forest on a delivery job.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Phew!  
We're about halfway done now!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Ehehe.  
Thanks again, {player}. Earning money was  
one of the last things on my mind when I came to Landosol.  
  
**Arisa：**  
I really owe you one!  
Helps that I enjoy being active,  
plus this is a handy way to search for Losaria!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Did you get any info about her in the end?  
`Tag 1`  
**Arisa：**  
Nope.  
Nothing yet.  
Landsol's real big, after all.  
  
**Arisa：**  
I tried asking all sorts of people at least,  
but no real luck so far.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Don't worry, though!  
It's only a matter of time.  
I'll find her for sure. I know it!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Until then, though,  
I can spend my time working with you  
and leading a regular life in Landosol!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Come find me if you ever need help.  
**Choice: (3)**  I wanna help you out as much as I can.  
`Tag 2`  
**Arisa：**  
Ehehe. Thanks.  
Knowing you're around to help is a big relief.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Arisa：**  
R-really?!  
You have no idea just how much I'd appreciate that!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Arisa：**  
Woo!  
I'm feeling extra good today thanks to you!  
Let's get the rest of these deliveries wrapped up!  
  
**Arisa：**  
And... we're done!  
Thanks, {player}!  
Pleasure to work with you!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Phew...  
There's something nice about getting hit with a breeze  
after working up a sweat. Feels nice and refreshing, somehow.  
  
**Arisa：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  What's up?  
`Tag 5`  
**Arisa：**  
Oh. Sorry about that.  
I was just... reminiscing about back home.  
  
**Arisa：**  
It's way, way smaller than Landosol.  
But even then, it's still a great place.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Lush greenery, fresh water, calm winds...  
Hehe. I guess it's kind of similar to the Elven Forest.  
  
**Arisa：**  
I really did love our village, you know.  
Pretty much everything about it.  
That's why...  
  
**Arisa：**  
That's why me and Losaria  
promised to become forest guardians together.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  What does that entail, anyway?  
`Tag 6`  
**Arisa：**  
Well. They protect the forest and its denizens from evil!  
It's a super important job.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Truth be told, I could have taken the trial to become  
a forest guardian on my own after Losaria disappeared.  
  
**Arisa：**  
I absolutely didn't want to, though.  
That promise to do it together means too much to me.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Ehehe.  
Sorry, that's a bit of a fib. I'm still pretty inexperienced,  
so chances are I'd be the only one to fail if we took it together.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I'm sure you'd pass with flying colors.  
`Tag 7`  
**Arisa：**  
Y-you think?  
That'd be nice!  
  
**Girl：**  
Eeek!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Wh-what was that?!  
It came from over there, right?  
Let's go!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Girl：**  
Waaahhh! Help!  
  
**Arisa：**  
A monster?!  
It's going after a child, too!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Hey! You're not hurt, are you?!  
  
**Girl：**  
*sniff* I'm... I'm okay... *sniff*  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Don't worry.  
I'll protect you!  
  
**Girl：**  
*sob, sob*  
  
**Arisa：**  
The Elven Forest is a beautiful place.  
Enough that it makes me feel like I'm back home.  
So I swear, here and now!  
  
**Arisa：**  
I won't let any tears be shed here!  
And I definitely won't forgive you!  
As a forest guardian, it's my duty to defeat you!  
  
**Arisa：**  
{player}! Get down!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Haaahhh!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Phew...  
Don't worry. It's okay now.  
I got rid of the scary monster for you!  
  
**Girl：**  
*sob, sob* Thank you...  
  
**Arisa：**  
Don't worry about it!  
I just did what's right!  
Now then. Let's get you back home!  
  
**Girl：**  
Thanks a lot! Bye-bye!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Bye-bye!  
Ehehe. Glad we managed to get her home safe and sound.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Now that's what I call a forest guardian.  
`Tag 8`  
**Arisa：**  
Huh?! Th-that was, uh, kind of a spur of the moment thing...  
J-just forget about it, okay?  
You're getting me all embarrassed here!  
  
**Narration：**  
Rumors regarding a nameless forest guardian  
appearing to save the Elven Forest in times  
of need began to spread not long after this.
