## Subtitle: Elven Archery
  
**Narration：**  
Arisa and {player} find themselves in  
the Prano Plains on a monster extermination job.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Our target was spotted  
somewhere around here, right?  
  
**Arisa：**  
Can't believe it went around eating all those  
freshly grown vegetables. We've gotta deal with it, quick!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Reports say that it's a winged, bird-like monster.  
But hey. That's no problem when I've got my trusty bow  
and {player} by my side!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I wouldn't mind firing some arrows, myself.  
`Tag 1`  
**Arisa：**  
Oh? Are you interested in archery?  
It's kinda tricky, but super handy once you get the hang of it!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Umm... I can teach you, if you'd like.  
Though I'm not nearly as good as Losaria.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'd love to have you as my teacher.  
**Choice: (3)**  Oh, master of the bow. Show me your ways.  
`Tag 2`  
**Arisa：**  
It'd be pretty encouraging if you could use a bow, that's for sure.  
I'm hardly fit to be a teacher,  
but I'm willing to try if you insist!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Arisa：**  
L-let's not exaggerate here...  
I'm willing to give it a go if you insist, though!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Arisa：**  
Might as well start with the basics,  
first and foremost!  
  
**Arisa：**  
It'll be tricky to hit your target right off the bat, but don't worry!  
You just gotta get used to it!  
Now then. Take your aim!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Hmm... Something feels a bit... off?  
You need to be more steady and composed when aiming.  
Plus, breathing technique is important.  
  
**Arisa：**  
This sure takes me back. I still remember what Losaria  
used to say when teaching me.  
Your pose should be as  
firm as the earth, your breathing as calm as the wind...  
  
**Arisa：**  
So it's kinda like, the earth and the wind...  
Sorry, ignore me. I'm struggling to put it into words...  
It's kinda like this, sort of...  
  
**Arisa：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  What's up?  
`Tag 5`  
**Arisa：**  
Oh. Nothing!  
I was just thinking about how  
big and wide your back is.  
  
**Arisa：**  
But you're a guy, so I guess that's normal!  
This is, uh, kinda the first time I've  
gotten so up close and personal with a guy, though.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Even your shoulders and your arms are built differently.  
Funny how that works, huh...  
  
**Arisa：**  
Huh. What's with me?  
My chest started feeling all weird the second I touched him....  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Where'd that monster come from?!  
Urgh! Take this!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Oh no! I missed!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Arisa：**  
This thing's fast!  
But still...!  
  
**Arisa：**  
I can't afford to look lame when he's right here!  
Calm down, Arisa. Get a grip!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Don't let it throw you off.  
`Tag 6`  
**Arisa：**  
Yeah, thanks!  
Firm as the earth, calm as the wind...  
  
**Arisa：**  
Hahhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGGRRRAAAOOGGGHHH!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Yes! It hit the mark!  
I did it, {player}!  
  
**Arisa：**  
That should be all of them.  
Just gotta report back now, then we're done!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Thanks, {player}.  
Teaching you helped me remember something important.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Something Losaria taught me, actually.  
That your pose should be as firm as the earth,  
and your breathing as calm as the wind.  
  
**Arisa：**  
I'm sorry.  
She would have done a much better job teaching you.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Don't apologize. If anything, I want you to teach me more.  
`Tag 7`  
**Arisa：**  
Really?  
Ehehe. If you say so, then sure!  
Let's do this again sometime!  
  
**Arisa：**  
I'm not nearly as good a teacher as Losaria,  
but I'm more than willing to go the extra  
length for your sake!  
  
**Narration：**  
The two of them were all smiles as they made their way back home.
