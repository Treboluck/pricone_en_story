**Narration：**  
Arisa and {player} are on their way to collect  
honey produced by a bee-type monster as per a request they received.  
  
**Arisa：**  
*sigh*  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's up?  
**Choice: (2)**  You okay?  
`Tag 1`  
**Arisa：**  
...I'm not too sure myself, to be honest.  
I'm just feeling kinda down.

`Tag 2`  
**Arisa：**  
Thanks for the concern.  
I dunno what's up with me either, to be honest.  
My chest just feels really... tight?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Arisa：**  
The person who gave us this request  
was super pretty, right?  
  
**Arisa：**  
And you got along with her well, too.  
I think that's when it started.  
  
**Arisa：**  
It's still going, too.  
I've never felt like this before,  
so I'm genuinely at a loss.  
  
**Arisa：**  
...Oh, sorry!  
I should be focusing on our request first and foremost.  
Can't let myself get distracted!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Don't push yourself.  
**Choice: (5)**  Let's get it over with nice and quick.  
`Tag 4`  
**Arisa：**  
Don't worry. I'm fine!  
I, uh, think.  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Arisa：**  
Yeah!  
It'll be a cinch with my archery!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Arisa：**  
She said it was spotted around here, right?  
Now we just need to find it.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRRAAAAGGHHH!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Whoa! Looks like it found us!  
But that makes things easier!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Urgh!  
It's not letting me get a proper aim on it!  
Now what...?  
  
**Arisa：**  
Eeek?!  
I-it got inside my clothes!  
G-get outta there, you little...! That tickles!  
  
**Arisa：**  
{player}!  
Help!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Reach in and grab it.  
**Choice: (8)**  Check inside your own clothes.  
`Tag 7`  
**Arisa：**  
You're gonna grab it?!  
N-no, don't you dare!  
K-keep your hands out of my clothes!

`Tag 8`  
**Arisa：**  
Oh, come on! It's obviously not in your—  
Wh-whoa! Quit that!  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Arisa：**  
*huff, huff* Phew...  
Finally got it out.  
That sure wasn't fu—  
  
**Arisa：**  
...?!  
O-oh no... It stung me on the arm!  
What should I do...?!  
  
**Arisa：**  
U-urgh... My vision's going... all spinny...  
  

---  
  
**Arisa：**  
Huh...  
Is this... a dream?  
  

---  
  
**Arisa：**  
U-umm!  
Sorry to ask for another favor when you've already helped me  
out a ton, but would you mind showing me the way to Landosol?  
  
**Arisa：**  
I *have* to get there, no matter what.  
So please! Help me out!  
  

---  
  
**Arisa：**  
Ehehe.  
Truth is, I've never been that fond of them, myself.  
So... Thanks!  
I'll take you up on that.  
  
**Arisa：**  
{player}!  
We've basically just met, but let's get along!  
  

---  
  
**Arisa：**  
Ehehe.  
Thanks again, {player}. Earning money was  
one of the last things on my mind when I came to Landosol.  
  
**Arisa：**  
I really owe you one!  
Helps that I enjoy being active,  
plus this is a handy way to search for Losaria!  
  

---  
  
**Arisa：**  
Woo!  
I'm feeling extra good today thanks to you!  
Let's get the rest of these deliveries wrapped up!  
  

---  
  
**Arisa：**  
It's all thanks to you.  
I never would have found the courage  
if I didn't know you were watching.  
  

---  
  
**Arisa：**  
I've forgotten most of it at this point,  
but I think the two of us  
were at the same school in it...  
  
**Arisa：**  
Hehe. Weird how a dream can feel so fun.  
Hopefully I'll have another one like it again.  
  

---  
  
**Arisa：**  
Thanks, {player}.  
Teaching you helped me remember something important.  
  

---  
  
**Arisa：**  
I never realized until now,  
but {player} really is all that's been on my mind  
ever since I came to Landosol.  
  
**Arisa：**  
How come, though?  
There has to be *something* about him...  
Is it because he reminds me of Losaria? No, that can't be it...  
  

---  
  
**Arisa：**  
Mmm... Where... Where am I?  
  
**Nurse：**  
Finally awake, are we?  
Don't worry. You're in a proper hospital.  
Doctor! She's come to!  
  
**Doctor：**  
Well, that's a relief.  
Take some time to rest and you'll be back in top condition in no time.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Who are you...?  
  
**Nurse：**  
We're members of a medical guild.  
You went through quite the ordeal, you know.  
Do you remember being stung by a bee-type monster?  
  
**Arisa：**  
A bee-type monster...?  
Oh. Yeah, now I re—  
  
**Arisa：**  
...?!  
What about {player}?!  
H-he was there with me at the time!  
  
**Nurse：**  
Settle down, now.  
He's sleeping over there.  
  
**Arisa：**  
H-he's so beat-up...  
What happened to him?!  
  
**Nurse：**  
Apparently he got attacked by a monster while carrying you here.  
Except he practically begged us to give you our full attention.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Oh...  
  
**Nurse：**  
Well. Looks like Prince Charming's awake now.  
  
**Arisa：**  
{player}...!  
Are you okay?! Does it still hurt?!  
  
**Nurse：**  
Have a look, {player}.  
She's safe and sound.  
  
**Arisa：**  
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!  
It's all my fault that you got hurt!  
  
**Arisa：**  
I'm so, so sorry...  
  
**Choice: (10)**  I'm more worried about you.  
`Tag 10`  
**Arisa：**  
I don't get it...  
How come you're so kind, no matter what happens?  
  
**Arisa：**  
I had a dream, you know.  
A dream about you.  
About everything you've done for me.  
  
**Arisa：**  
That kindness of yours has to be the reason.  
The reason why I...  
  
**Nurse：**  
Now now, lovebirds.  
Save the flirting for when you leave the hospital.  
  
**Arisa：**  
L-lovebirds?!  
  
**Nurse：**  
Hehe. Quiet down, now.  
  
**Arisa：**  
S-sorry about that.  
But also... Thank you.  
Not just for today, but for everything leading up to it.  
  
**Narration：**  
Arisa brushed away a tear,  
her cheeks as red as the sunset sky.
