**Narration：**  
Arisa is gathering information on Losaria's whereabouts  
at the plaza where she arranged to meet up with {player}.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Y-you're sure about that?!  
  
**Merchant：**  
Sure as can be.  
Heard it straight from the horse's mouth.  
  
**Merchant：**  
Losaria's troupe is coming back to Landosol tomorrow.  
Should be sometime in the afternoon.  
Look forward to it.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Woo!  
I'll finally be able to see Losaria again tomorrow!  
  
**Arisa：**  
I can't believe it... It's actually happening!  
We can finally go back home and...  
  
**Arisa：**  
Become forest guardians...  
  
**Arisa：**  
What's wrong with me?  
My chest's feeling all tight again.  
Same as last time... or maybe even worse, actually.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Arisa?  
**Choice: (2)**  Poke her cheek.

**Arisa：**  
Whoa!  
{player}?!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Arisa：**  
Whoa!  
What do you think you're doing, {player}?!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Arisa：**  
Hey...  
You remember when I told you about my chest being all tight?  
  
**Arisa：**  
It's happening again, and I don't know why.  
I should be super happy right now.  
  
**Arisa：**  
I finally found a lead on Losaria.  
She's coming back to Landosol tomorrow.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You don't sound thrilled about that.  
`Tag 4`  
**Arisa：**  
I dunno why, myself.  
I was sure that seeing her again  
was my biggest priority.  
  
**Arisa：**  
It's not like I *don't* want to see her again, you know.  
  
**Arisa：**  
I mean. That's why I came here in the first place.  
All on my own. Even in spite of all the fear.  
I really don't know what's wrong with...  
  
**Woman：**  
Come on, Losari... This way!  
  
**Merchant：**  
Hahaha. Cute as ever, you are.  
  
**Arisa：**  
...!  
They just said Losaria, didn't they?  
  
**Arisa：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  You're not gonna chase after them?  
**Choice: (6)**  This could be your chance, you know.  
`Tag 5`  
**Arisa：**  
...  
I'll be right back.

`Tag 6`  
**Arisa：**  
Yeah...  
You're right.  
  
**Arisa：**  
It's only getting worse.  
What's wrong with me...?  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Arisa：**  
Excuse me...  
  
**Woman：**  
Hm? Good day, young lady.  
  
**Merchant：**  
Can we help you?  
  
**Arisa：**  
Um...  
I happened to overhear you mention a \"Losaria.\"  
  
**Woman：**  
Hm?  
Ohh! Did you mean our little doggo?  
  
**Puppy：**  
Woof! Woof!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Huh?!  
A-a dog?!  
  
**Woman：**  
Her name's Losari.  
Adorable, isn't she?  
  
**Merchant：**  
She's been with us forever now.  
Our little pride and joy!  
  
**Puppy：**  
Woof!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Y-yeah!  
She's definitely a cutie, all right!  
  
**Arisa：**  
So it wasn't Losaria after all...  
Thank goo—  
  
**Arisa：**  
Thank goodness?  
Why is *that* the first thought that came to mind?  
  
**Puppy：**  
Woof?  
  
**Arisa：**  
Ahaha...  
Sorry. Don't mind me.  
Sorry for disturbing you!  
  
**Arisa：**  
*sigh*  
  
**Arisa：**  
This isn't good.  
The pain in my chest just won't go away...  
  
**Arisa：**  
Something's seriously wrong with me, {player}.  
  
**Arisa：**  
I wanna see Losaria again,  
but I felt relieved the second I learned it wasn't her.  
There was a part of me that was genuinely happy.  
  
**Arisa：**  
There's so much to look forward to if I find her.  
Becoming forest guardians, going back home...  
  
**Arisa：**  
I've come to love Landosol a lot.  
But I never once forgot about home during that time.  
  
**Arisa：**  
I mean, it's such a good place.  
Losaria's there. My friends are there.  
Clean air, incredible nature...  
  
**Arisa：**  
It really is wonderful.  
  
**Arisa：**  
And yet...  
  
**Arisa：**  
It wouldn't be enough for me now.  
I know I'd feel lonely, somehow.  
But I don't understand *why*...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Smile at her.  
**Choice: (9)**  Hold her hand.  
`Tag 8`  
**Arisa：**  
{player}...  
  
Jump to tag 10  
`Tag 9`  
**Arisa：**  
...Your hand's so warm.  
  
`Tag 10`  
**Arisa：**  
Oh.  
That's it, isn't it?  
It's all about him...  
  
**Arisa：**  
All the help he's given me.  
All the things he's taught me.  
All the time he's spent with me...  
  
**Arisa：**  
It all makes sense now.  
My heart wants to stay with him, first and foremost.  
  
**Arisa：**  
I was scared that he'd leave me when I saw him  
getting along with someone really pretty.  
That's why I felt the way I did...  
  
**Arisa：**  
Hey, {player}.  
I knew it.  
Something really is wrong with me.  
  
**Arisa：**  
I can't stop thinking about how I wanna stay with you.  
  
**Arisa：**  
But, well... It's actually not that surprising.  
You've always been so kind to me. Ever since we met...  
  
**Arisa：**  
But...  
  
**Arisa：**  
Even then, I...  
  
**Arisa：**  
I need to say goodbye.  
Otherwise I can't bring Losaria back home...  
  
**Choice: (11)**  Then I'll go visit you.  
`Tag 11`  
**Arisa：**  
I figured you'd say that.  
If anyone would, it's you.  
  
**Arisa：**  
It's really, really far from Landosol, though.  
You need to go through scary valleys and perilous mountains.  
  
**Arisa：**  
There's lot of monsters on the way, too.  
It's really dangerous.  
  
**Arisa：**  
But...  
If you still want to come,  
then I'll wait for you.  
  
**Arisa：**  
I'll decorate the whole place with flowers.  
I'll make lots and lots of sweets.  
And, most importantly...  
  
**Arisa：**  
I'll keep a smile on my face for as long as it takes!  
  
**Arisa：**  
So yeah. It's not goodbye after all.  
'Cause we'll definitely see each other again!  
  
**Arisa：**  
Losaria's coming back tomorrow, so...  
Would you let me be a bit selfish?  
  
**Arisa：**  
I know you've got plenty to do,  
and plenty of people to worry about.  
You're super popular, after all.  
  
**Arisa：**  
But today...  
Just today.  
I want you all to myself.  
  
**Arisa：**  
I want to talk about all sorts of things.  
Things I know about you already.  
Things I still don't know about you.  
  
**Arisa：**  
That should be enough for me.  
Enough to stop me from missing you, even once we're apart.  
  
**Arisa：**  
The more I know about you,  
the more I'll be able to reminisce about.  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day.  
  
**Arisa：**  
Wait, what?!  
Y-you're Losaria?!  
  
**Losaria?：**  
That's right.  
Do you need something from me, perhaps?  
  
**Arisa：**  
D-don't tell me I...  
I got the wrong person?!  
  
**Arisa：**  
No way...  
*This* is how things turn out  
after all that embarrassing stuff I said yesterday?!  
  
**Choice: (12)**  Here's to more time spent together.  
`Tag 12`  
**Arisa：**  
...Yeah.  
You're right, huh.  
We've got more time now.  
  
**Arisa：**  
I didn't get to see Losaria again in the end, but...  
  
**Arisa：**  
Well.  
I get to be with you for a while longer, at the very least.  
  
**Arisa：**  
...Here's to that, then.  
And to us working together to find Losaria!  
  
**Narration：**  
Their bonds stronger than ever now,  
the two of them promise to find Losaria no matter what.
