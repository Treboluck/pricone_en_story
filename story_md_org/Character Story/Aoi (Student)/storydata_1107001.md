## Subtitle: The BB Brigade's New Frontier
  
**Narration：**  
Today, {player} has come to the Elven Forest  
for his regular BB Brigade activities.  
  
**???：**  
H-hello! It's nice to meet you all...  
  
**???：**  
M-my name is A... Ao... Ao...  
  
**???：**  
Outrageous Outlander Ouchington Owl!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ahhh... I failed again... That makes eighteen times...  
How can just saying my name be such an insurmountable challenge...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Even My Little Buddy V3, who I brought as a practice audience,  
seems to be laughing at my incompetence...  
  
**Aoi：**  
At this rate, how will I ever pull it off...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
...I know! Maybe if I changed my name to something else,  
I'd be able to say it just fine!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's not do anything too hasty.  
`Tag 1`  
**Aoi：**  
Hyeaargh?!  
Wh-wh-wh-who just said that?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh... It's just you.  
  
**Aoi：**  
But of course.  
Now that I think about it, you're basically the only person  
who would talk to a loner like me...  
  
**Aoi：**  
My fellow BB Brigade member  
and one and only  
 c-c-c-comrade  
 in the whole world...!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  What were you doing just now?  
`Tag 2`  
**Aoi：**  
Ummm... I was practicing introducing myself...  
  
**Aoi：**  
You see,  
 quite soon, I'm going to be transferring to a school  
called St. Theresa's Academy for Girls, just temporarily...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh, you've heard of it?  
Huh? You go there?  
 Even though it's a girls' school?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
That's the BB Brigade leader for you...  
I guess to make friends, you need the courage and audacity  
to totally ignore gender boundaries!  
  
**Aoi：**  
But this might be just what I needed!  
It's like heaven sent me a whole gift pack of manna!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Please! You have to teach me all about St. Theresa's Academy!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Sure.  
`Tag 3`  
**Aoi：**  
Thank you so much!  
I knew I could count on my...  
 my c... comrade...!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Well then, let me ask a few questions!  
  
**Aoi：**  
What's the school really like?!  
What kind of people go there?!  
Is there anyone who might want to be friends with me?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
If I do make friends there, what should I do first?!  
Should I start by bonding with them over cat's cradle?!  
Oh, but... if I make lots of friends, we might run out of string!  
  
**Aoi：**  
So my first step should be to buy plenty of string...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? Calm down?  
Y-you're right...  
There's no way I'd make friends, is there...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? That's not true?  
There are lots of girls at the academy who aren't exactly normal?  
  
**Aoi：**  
In that case...  
 Just maybe, there might be someone  
who'd even make friends with a loner like me!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Thank you so much!  
You've shown me the light at the end of the tunnel!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh, I know!  
If it's not too much trouble, could you lend me a hand?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I want to practice introducing myself  
to all of my new classmates!  
  
**Aoi：**  
As I think you might have seen just now,  
I still can't even say my own name properly  
to my trusty My Little Buddy V3...  
  
**Aoi：**  
But maybe if you play the student role,  
I'll be able to break through my hesitation in a do-or-die attempt!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  We need to go further than that.  
`Tag 4`  
**Aoi：**  
Huh?! An even more realistic simulation?!  
I-I see... Desperate times call for desperate measures!  
  
**Aoi：**  
But what else can we do...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh! I've got it!  
I'll make lots of new My Little Buddies  
and simulate a whole class full of students!  
  
**Aoi：**  
That's not it?  
O-oh no... But then... Ummm...  
Do we need costumes or something?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Of course! I could wear my new uniform!  
Thank you for your help, {player}!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Well then, I'll go get changed right away!  
  
**Aoi：**  
H-how does it look...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Somehow... just knowing it's a school uniform  
makes me shiver with unease...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Is it really okay for me to wear an outfit like this?!  
Isn't there a law against friendless loners wearing these things?!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  It suits you.  
**Choice: (6)**  I don't think there are any laws like that.  
`Tag 5`  
**Aoi：**  
Y-you think so...?  
If you're so sure, I suppose...  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Aoi：**  
N-no, of course not...  
 That's reassuring.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Aoi：**  
Well then, let's get back to the main challenge!  
Ummm... First, I enter the classroom and write my name on the board...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Just writing it out shouldn't be too hard!  
A... o... i... There.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Your writing's so small, I can't see it.  
`Tag 8`  
**Aoi：**  
Huhhh?!  
L-l-let me try again!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Bigger... bigger...!  
A...! O...! I...! There!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  This time it's too big.  
`Tag 9`  
**Aoi：**  
O-o-oh no, you're right...!  
There's no room left on the board for anything else!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I never thought I'd stumble at this very first hurdle...!  
  
**Aoi：**  
At this rate, I...  
I'll be doomed to eternal lonerdom from my first day...  
  
**Aoi：**  
\"Heheheh, I skipped class to do some origami!\"  
the school bullies will say,  
as they throw paper airplanes at my defenseless back!  
  
**Aoi：**  
No... they might even draw a target on me  
and use me for darts practice!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Nobody brings darts to school.  
`Tag 10`  
**Aoi：**  
Oh, but they do! They'll throw their feather tokens  
from the Gryphon Feather charity scheme...  
 Aaargh!  
  
**Aoi：**  
How terrifying...!  
  
**Choice: (11)**  Then I'll shield you.  
`Tag 11`  
**Aoi：**  
Huh...?  
 No, you can't! If you do that,  
the bullies will set their sights on you instead!  
  
**Aoi：**  
They'll corner you behind the school building  
and make you eat piping-hot sweet potatoes!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Even then... You'd put yourself on the line?  
For someone like me...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Yes, of course...  
 We're the BB Brigade!  
We'll stick together and get through this ordeal!  
  
**Aoi：**  
No, more than that—let's make friends at St. Theresa's  
and achieve the BB Brigade's ultimate goal!  
  
**Aoi：**  
You and me together, {player}!  
  
**Narration：**  
So it was that the two members of the BB Brigade  
swore a solemn oath to make friends at St. Theresa's Academy.
