**Suzume：**  
*sigh*...  
Why am I such a klutz?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Just the other day, I carelessly blasted off the wall of the Orphanage  
with my own magic...  
And I've messed up in all sorts of other ways, too.  
  
**Suzume：**  
When I destroyed the Orphanage wall, milady said that  
it was perfect timing since parts of it were damaged,  
so I saved her the trouble of tearing it down.  
  
**Suzume：**  
But I'm sure she was just saying that so I wouldn't feel bad.  
My actions incurred additional costs to fix that wall.  
I cause nothing but trouble.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Urgh, I've failed as a maid.  
Not only am I useless, but I also cause Miss Saren endless worry.  
Ack, no! Feeling sorry for myself isn't going to achieve anything!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I should, at the very least,  
work hard for milady to pay off the cost of the wall repairs...  
No! I must make up for *all* of my past mistakes!  
  
**Suzume：**  
To start off, I'll successfully buy the items milady requested of me!  
Surely I can handle running an errand.  
Um, I believe the emporium should be around here somewhere?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ack! Whoops, uh?  
Eeep!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ow...  
I-I just tripped over something!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Thank goodness that happened before I bought anything!  
If I was carrying eggs or anything fragile,  
they'd all be broken by now.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wh-what did I kick?  
Oh, there seems to be a row of what appear to be guardian deity statues?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I guess I didn't notice these guys and tripped over them.  
I'm sorry. Um, mister guardian deity...  
Are you okay?  
Are you hurt?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hmm? These statues are actually really dirty.  
They've been left out here in this plaza,  
exposed to  
the rain and wind, without anyone ever giving them a nice clean.  
  
**Suzume：**  
All right!  
I'll clean you up all nice and shiny to apologize for bumping into you.  
I'm particularly good at cleaning off stains. Since I'm a maid, after all!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hmm, hmm, hmm, let's clean you up and make you shine! ♪  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh?  
There's something oddly soft about this particular guardian deity statue...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hang on. Eeeek?!  
Y-you're not a guardian deity statue! You're a human, aren't you?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wait, is that you, {player}?  
It is, isn't it?  
Um, I'm so sorry for all of the trouble I caused for you the other day!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Um, {player}?  
What are you doing sitting next to all of these guardian deity statues?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's a hobby of mine.  
**Choice: (2)**  I can't move.  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzume：**  
I see... Uh, that's quite an odd hobby to have.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, don't mind me! I wasn't making fun of you or anything!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm not quite sure what's so interesting about it,  
but I think it's great that there are so many different hobbies out there!

`Tag 2`  
**Suzume：**  
What? Why? Do you have a stomachache or something?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Or have you been paralyzed by some kind of curse?  
Don't tell me that the guardian deity statues lined up here  
are actually what's left of humans placed under the same curse?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, I see.  
That's not the case?  
I'm sorry for being so dim-witted!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Suzume：**  
Um...  
Could it be that you're so hungry that you can't move?  
  
**Suzume：**  
The grumble bug in your belly's been growling this whole time.  
It is lunchtime right now, after all.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Since it appears as though you're incapacitated, {player}...  
I'll go to that stand over there to buy something for you.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Please wait a moment.  
What I buy from the stand will be my treat, of course.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Don't be shy and please help yourself.  
This is to apologize for all of the trouble I caused for you the other day.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm ever the klutz, so I'm always causing trouble for others.  
I just want to give you a proper apology.  
No, I want to take responsibility for everything!
