After the pair finish carrying their shopping home, a strange light envelops them. Within the light, Ameth shows the amnesiac {player} a dream, in which the clumsy Suzume knocks vegetables to the ground on a shopping trip.

**Suzume：**  
Phew, we're finally able to unwind.  
Goodness me, I'm exhausted.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Thank you very much, {player},  
for carrying all of the items I bought.  
  
**Suzume：**  
With your help, I was able to make it back to  
the Sarendia Orphanage without dropping any of my shopping in a bout of clumsiness.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hm? I should be thanking  
the guardian deity statues? Oh, the golems?  
You might be right there. Thank you all so much.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Eheheh. I suppose I got repaid for what I did, much like in  
the picture book.  
 Milady is actually quite fond of stories like this,  
so I'm sure she'd be jealous if she found out.  
  
**Suzume：**  
In any case, while I can't offer the best hospitality, you all must be  
tired, so please do rest up.  
 Would you like to have dinner here  
as a sign of my gratitude for carrying my shopping?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I have to cook up quite a lot of food for the children here  
at the Sarendia Orphanage anyway,  
so an extra mouth to feed wouldn't make much difference.  
  
**Suzume：**  
As for the golems,  
I'll fill you up with magic instead of food.  
Everyone, line up, please!  
A spring in your step! Full of pep!  
  
**Suzume：**  
*giggle*  
The golems are filled with glee.  
They're so adorable!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Be that as it may, I do believe they are public property,  
so I can't just leave them here.  
 Perhaps I'll pay a visit  
to the local government office tomorrow and look further into this.  
  
**Suzume：**  
First and foremost, I must find out what exactly these golems are.  
If I ask Miss Saren, I should be able to use her privileges to gain access to  
the reference room in the library. I'm sure I'll get to the bottom of this.  
  
**Suzume：**  
If it turns out these golems don't have an owner of their own,  
then I can take them in myself.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm lacking in assistance on the manual labor side.  
It'd be a great help to have someone around  
to help me carry things and the like.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'd really appreciate it if the golems could help me with  
odd jobs like that.  
 I'm always such a klutz,  
and I'm not on top of all of my household chores either.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Whoops.  
I shouldn't be standing here chitchatting. I need to get dinner started.  
Please wait a moment! ...  
Gahhh?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Th-that was close.  
I nearly fell over...  
  
**Suzume：**  
I almost cracked open the eggs  
everyone so carefully carried here for me.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Tee hee hee.  
Thank you for supporting me, {player}!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hang on. Huh?  
{player}, there seems to be some kind of light around us?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wh-what is this?!  
Did I press some kind of button  
I shouldn't have with my klutzy ways?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ack... GAHHH?!  
  

---  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh no! Now I've done it!  
I tripped up and crashed... causing all of the nicely lined-up vegetables  
to scatter across the floor!  
  
**Suzume：**  
F-forgive me for causing this mess!  
  
I'll pick everything up right this instant!  
And I'll purchase all of the bruised or scratched-up vegetables!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Aww, why am I always like this?  
And after milady did all of that research  
to find me the cheapest bargain!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Now I'm back to square one because of another clumsy mishap!  
Urgh, I'll make sure she deducts the cost of the vegetables from my pay!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Even though I don't have much money left  
after all of the plates I've broken this month!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Eep...?  
Huh? {player}?  
Hello!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I didn't expect us to cross paths here, {player}.  
Do you happen to live in this neighborhood?  
  
**Suzume：**  
My house, or rather, the estate owned by the person I serve,  
is in the neighboring town.  
I've traveled all the way here in search of cheaply-priced vegetables.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Milady always says to  
use one's feet to keep costs low!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh...  
Are you helping me pick up the vegetables?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Thank you very much!  
Eheheh. You're always so kind, {player}.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ack! I'm sorry.  
Our fingers touched as we reached out to pick up the same vegetable.  
Oh gosh, this is just like one of those old manga stories for young girls.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Tee hee hee.  
You wouldn't think it, but milady is quite a fan of those kinds of stories, so I often read them as well.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I can also relate to them  
because a lot of them feature clumsy protagonists.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Eheheh. It's charming when it happens in a manga,  
but in reality, it's just troublesome for all those involved.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Not at all.  
**Choice: (2)**  What type of manga do you like?  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzume：**  
You think so? Eheheh.  
I'm sorry for making you go out of your way like that for me.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Don't worry, being like this doesn't bother me that much. I look at it in  
a positive light! Being a klutz is part of what makes me unique.  
I'm also working hard to fix it, though I haven't seen any results yet.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzume：**  
Huh? Me?  
Hmm... I find pretty much anything interesting.  
I like school-life manga as well.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I mean, as you can tell,  
I live quite an out-of-the-ordinary life, what with being a maid and working for a mistress.  
  
**Suzume：**  
So  
reading about the love lives or club activities of normal students is fascinating to me.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Don't get me wrong—I'm very much content with my current lifestyle.  
However, I can't help but wonder about many things, such as  
what my life would've been like  
if I'd been born into a normal family.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Suzume：**  
All right, perfect.  
That's all of the vegetables picked up.  
Thank you very much for helping me, {player}!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Were you out buying ingredients for your dinner as well,  
{player}?  
 I see. Your parents are out on business,  
so you have to cook for yourself... Is that correct?  
  
**Suzume：**  
If that's the case, might I offer you an invitation to have dinner with us?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm sure milady would love to have you,  
and if I were to buy all of the bruised vegetables... Then there would be  
too much for us. They'd just rot.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Don't be shy.  
Consider it a sign of gratitude for helping me pick up the vegetables.  
Do join us, if it's not a hassle for you.

**Ameth：**  
Suzume  
already has a fantasy-like life of her own to begin with,  
without needing to come all the way over \"here\".  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's a maid, after all.  
  
**Ameth：**  
In fact, I've only ever seen her dressed like that.  
Does she always have her maid outfit on?  
I want to see her wearing something else, like pajamas.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Whoops.  
I'm so sorry. You must be pretty confused without an explanation or anything.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you were watching just now was something akin to a dream.  
To supplement the memories you lost, obtain cohesiveness...  
I suppose it's a type of adjustment.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's almost as if the foundations a being laid for you to regain  
your memories. I'm sure you have no idea what's going on right now,  
so you don't really have to worry about it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Everything will become hazy right after you wake up again, anyway.  
You should just ignore it and go about your daily life.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You might be living an outrageous life, just like in a manga...  
But to you, it's just your average life.  
Your reality.  
  

---  
  
**Suzume：**  
{player}?  
What's wrong? You look all dazed.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Perhaps you really are tired from carrying all of the shopping?  
Get all the rest you need, okay?  
Dinner's ready as well, so go ahead and eat up!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hehehe.  
I'm not the greatest cook...  
So it might not taste the greatest.  
  
**Suzume：**  
It tastes good?  
I'm so happy!  
You always compliment me, {player}.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Given who I am...  
I'm so very grateful.  
Milady is much the same. She's kind as can be.  
  
**Suzume：**  
It'd be rude to everyone who praises me if I  
keep deprecating myself...  
  
**Suzume：**  
So I'll put more effort into trying to be more positive.  
I'll also try to not be so clumsy... as best I can, at least.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Eheheh.  
I'll continue to do my very best to serve those around me!
