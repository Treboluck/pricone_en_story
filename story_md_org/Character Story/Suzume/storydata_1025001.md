# Suzume Episode 1
Suzume—the maid who serves the owner of the Sarendia Orphanage, Saren—has put a little too much into her cleaning and destroyed a wall with her magic. The guilt makes her consider suicide, but {player} swoops in.

**Suzume：**  
Hmm, hmm, hmm. ♪  
Cleaning, cleaning, cleeeaning. ♪  
La la laaa. ♪  
  
**Suzume：**  
Phew, perfect! I might be a ditz when it comes to other  
household chores, but cleaning is the one thing that I'm good at!  
Oh, milady! I'm not unwanted anymore, right?  
  
**Suzume：**  
This building here that houses the Sarendia Orphanage  
was a rundown house to begin with...  
But now I've cleaned it up to the point where it's pretty liveable.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Goodness me...  
Since Miss Saren was so insistent on finding the cheapest place,  
I had my work cut out for me!  
  
**Suzume：**  
After all, she bought this for a rock-bottom price, because it was  
originally slated to be torn down.  
 It's falling apart all over the place,  
so cleaning and repairs are pretty big tasks on their own.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm sure she didn't want to ask her parents, or her old guild, Nightmare,  
because of the history she has with them, but still...  
She didn't have to go the trouble of shouldering all of this responsibility.  
  
**Suzume：**  
But I guess that's just the type of person she is.  
I'll respect her and, at the very least, do everything in  
my power to support her.  
 I'll give it my all! For milady!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Even so, this orphanage building is pretty big...  
There are still many places I haven't gotten around to yet.  
 I made sure  
to clean the children's bedrooms, and the hall on the double, though.  
  
**Suzume：**  
If I have to clean all of the other rooms and hallways,  
one after the other...  
  
**Suzume：**  
At this rate, I'm never going to finish.  
It doesn't help that the children make a mess right after I finish cleaning up.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm also to blame, since I'm so clumsy that I make my own mess or  
break things.  
 I do want to get around to cleaning the building's  
outer walls, roof, and garden as well.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I can't stay on top of things all on my own.  
We don't have enough help at all.  
 Even so,  
I don't think asking the children to help would be the right thing to do.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, I just had a great idea!  
Since I'm a magic-user myself...  
Maybe it would be a good idea  
for me to put my magic to good use and apply it to my housework?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm not great at using magic, though.  
My parents pretty much forced me to learn it from them.  
 But it's a maid's  
duty to serve others by taking full advantage of their own skillset!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Uhhh. If I remember correctly, there's some kind of magic specifically for cleaning.  
My memory's pretty hazy, but I'll give that spell a try!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Shazam! Spick and span, sparkle and shine!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wha—?! H-huh?!  
The wall in front of me just blew off. That's weird, isn't it?  
Don't tell me the spell I cast just now was magic used for attacking?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ack! I remember now!  
I just used a spell to wipe out all weak monsters!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I only remembered the \"wipe out\" bit and assumed it was for cleaning.  
I guess it wasn't magic for housework?  
Oh no! I messed up again!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, I guess this is punishment for trying to casually use my magic to  
cut some corners? Numbskull, nitwit, argh! I'm such a knucklehead!  
Wh-what do I do?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I've destroyed the building's wall!  
Oh, the enormity of this blunder! I cannot show my face to milady!  
I-is cutting open my belly the only way to atone?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Father, Mother, I'm sorry I wasn't a better daughter! I will depart this world before you!  
May milady's future be filled with happiness!  
Farewell!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hm?  
Huh! It doesn't hurt!  
Why?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ah, it appears as though the knife I drew to commit seppuku  
has been taken from me by someone?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Eep?!  
Um, who might you be?  
Wh-what business do you have with this establishment?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ah, yes.  
I work for the Sarendia Orphanage. My name is Suzume.  
  
**Suzume：**  
More specifically, I am but a humble maid  
who serves the matron of this orphanage.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I guess you must be {player}.  
My apologies for not showing you the hospitality you deserve  
as our guest. As you can see, I'm currently in the middle of something.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wha?! I'm so sorry!  
I was wondering why you were burnt to a crisp.  
Don't tell you received a direct hit from my offensive magic?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I blasted off a wall, and also injured a passerby as well?!  
Oh no! Now I feel even more horrible!  
 I'm not even worthy  
of having the right to choose such a noble death as that of seppuku!  
  
**Suzume：**  
The only way for me to take responsibility for this is to blow my own head off using my offensive magic!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Calm down.  
**Choice: (2)**  If anything, I think that's being irresponsible.  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzume：**  
Relax?! There's no time for me to relax right now!  
I must take responsibility for my actions at once!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzume：**  
Huh? Uh, what do you mean by that?  
I don't quite understand!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Suzume：**  
Aww... You're right.  
I can somewhat gather  
what you're trying to say, {player}.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Even if I were to die, it wouldn't bring anybody joy.  
It'd be wrong for me to be the only one to take the easy way out.  
  
**Suzume：**  
In any case,  
I'll clean up the remains of the wall I blasted off.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'll take care of all my unfinished business first.  
It's only common courtesy to clean up after oneself, so I'll commit seppuku after that.  
  
**Suzume：**  
What? Seppuku isn't the way to go about this?  
Then... perhaps I should cut off a finger?  
  
**Suzume：**  
That's not right either?  
But I don't know of any other ways to atone for my actions.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I suppose this is a crucial time for  
the Sarendia Orphanage, since it was established just recently.  
Perhaps even I could be of some use if I were to live on.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'll carry on living, work as if my life depends on it, and take full responsibility for my actions.  
Um, would that be appropriate?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh?  
You're going to help me clean up?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Um, {player}?  
Why are you being so kind to me?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I don't mind, though. Your assistance is appreciated.  
You are quite the mysterious person.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Eheheh. Thank you very much.  
Talking to you has calmed me down a little, {player}.
