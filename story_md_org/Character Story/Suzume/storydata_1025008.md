**Suzume：**  
Hrm... Hrrrm?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh! I've got it!  
Right here. If I move the knight here...  
Hehehe! I believe that's checkmate!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ah!  
Not that one!  
This knight here to this square...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Eheheh. Games of chess don't usually work out for me, since I slip up  
and knock everything over.  
That's why I'm having you move  
the pieces for me, {player}.  
  
**Suzume：**  
But when you're about to lose,  
you purposefully misunderstand my instructions  
and try to place pieces on the wrong squares!  
  
**Suzume：**  
You can't cheat like that.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Argh, what did I just say?! Not that knight!  
Come on,  
{player}! You're more of a sore loser than I expected,  
aren't you? You get quite competitive when it comes to games.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Especially since you usually give off such a peaceful,  
kind-hearted impression.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I didn't expect  
you to get so passionate about games and have such strong  
feelings about wanting to win, or not wanting to lose.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I mean, that's supposed to be a compliment!  
It's not a bad thing, I don't think! Like having a boyish charm.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hang on. You tried to feign carelessness in an attempt to move the chessboard right now, didn't you?  
You can't do that! This needs to be fair and...  
GAHHH?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ahaha...  
I lost my balance and kicked the chessboard over.  
Looks like we'll just have to abandon this game.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Goodness me.  
I got carried away with the game.  
It's quite late now.  
  
**Suzume：**  
{player}... Won't your family be worried  
if you don't make your way home soon?  
  
**Suzume：**  
What? You're not leaving until you win?  
Ah! But, {player}, you have amnesia, don't you?  
  
**Suzume：**  
You're still a novice who's just learned the rules.  
It's still too soon for you to win against me.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I was taught how to play tabletop games, such as this one, by my parents.  
It's important to have these kinds of skills in order to entertain guests.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm also quite good at mahjong and a range of card games.  
I'm pretty klutzy when it comes to household chores,  
but I seem to have a knack for these kinds of games.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Perhaps it's because the rules and objectives are clear, so I can focus on playing it.  
  
**Suzume：**  
In any case, I think it'd be best for you to call it a day and head home now.  
They say public safety around these parts has been deteriorating  
as of late, and it's dangerous when it gets dark.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Also... {player},  
you live with someone who you see as your little sister, right?  
  
**Suzume：**  
She'll be worried if you don't come home at a reasonable time.  
If you want, I can lend you the chessboard and pieces.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Please take them home with you to practice.  
Then you can come back here to play again.  
You're always very much welcome here.  
  
**Suzume：**  
EEEEK?!  
{player}, you're glowing again.  
What is the meaning of this? It... doesn't seem like some form of magic...

**Suzume：**  
Oh no, oh no, oh no!  
I'm going to be late!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ack! GAHHH?!  
I-I'm so sorry  
for bumping into you!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hello, Suzume.  
**Choice: (2)**  Are you okay? You're not hurt?  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzume：**  
Ah, yes!  
Hello, {player}!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wait, now's not the time for casual greetings!  
Are you okay?!  
You hit your head against the telephone pole when I bumped into you!  
  
**Suzume：**  
You're... you're bleeding!  
I'll tend to your injuries right now!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, yes!  
I'm fine!  
You caught me just in time, so I don't have a single scratch!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hang on, {player}! The impact of breaking my fall  
made you hit your head against the telephone pole!  
You're bleeding! I'll tend to your injury!  
  
`Tag 3`

**Suzume：**  
There.  
Okay, you're all fixed up now.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm a klutz, which makes me prone to tripping over,  
so I always carry a first-aid kit along with me.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm really sorry!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Actually, {player},  
what are you doing in front of the mansion I work at?  
Are you here to see Miss Saren?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hmm?  
Perhaps you happened to be nearby, so you came all the way  
to the front entrance in the hopes of seeing her?  
  
**Suzume：**  
What? It's not Miss Saren, but me you wanted to see?  
Wh-why would you want to see a humble maid like me?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh?  
You wanted to have a revenge match after the game of shogi we played the other day?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh...  
 I did end up winning last time.  
You've practiced and gotten a lot better since then,  
so you want another game?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hmm...  
I'd absolutely love to, but I'm sorry.  
I don't think I'll be able to today.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Miss Saren has gone overseas with her parents to attend an  
important meeting.  
 I had matters to attend to myself as well,  
so I wasn't able to accompany them, and I've been keeping watch here.  
  
**Suzume：**  
They've finally returned today,  
so I was just on my way to meet them at the airport.  
But my school commitments ran long, so I'm on the verge of running late.  
  
**Suzume：**  
At this rate, I'll end up making Miss Saren wait!  
Th-that's why I'm in a rush!  
As such, I'm very sorry, but let's play shogi next time!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wait, oh no?!  
I spilled the contents of my bag  
when I almost fell over earlier!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I must pick everything up!  
Th-the ticket for my restaurant reservation was in here as well!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh...  
You're helping me pick up after myself, too?  
That'll really help me out! I'm sorry for all of the trouble I cause you!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ah, right then! I'll be on my way now!  
Sorry!  
Err? GAHHH!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I-I fell over again...  
Huh? What's the matter, {player}?  
  
**Suzume：**  
What? You're coming along with me because you're worried?  
It's not like you have anything to do today, you say?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Th-thank you so much!  
Honestly, that would really help me out.  
I fall over every few steps when I'm flustered!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Please support me if I'm about to fall!  
Thank you, {player}!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Miss Saren, I'll make my way to you right at this instant!

**Ameth：**  
That Suzume. She really is always such a handful.  
There's just no leaving her on her own...  
But you know what?  
That doesn't mean she's a hopeless girl completely incapable of anything.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I mean, it seems like she's pretty good at games and such.  
Her clumsiness probably kicks in when she's distracted or flustered.  
Maybe it's a matter of focus.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, anyway, that's not something for me to think about.  
Suzume and you should confront it yourselves.  
Think long and hard  
about it, and make sure you take good care of and support her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Actually, by the looks of it, you probably don't need me to remind you.  
Continue doing what you can to help those near you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm sure one day you'll be rewarded for your efforts.  
My predictions are pretty accurate, you know?  
I am almost a god-like figure over \"here\", after all.  
  

---  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, are you awake, {player}?  
  
**Suzume：**  
You suddenly fell asleep...  
So I made the decision to bring you to the bedroom.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I couldn't do it myself,  
so I had the golems help me.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Can you get up? You don't seem to be well.  
Are you okay?  
If you don't think you can move right now,  
then please just rest as you are and try not to push yourself.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'll use some communication magic to contact the  
hotel you're staying at.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I might have some difficulty since communication magic is rather difficult, though.  
  
**Suzume：**  
However, I'm still a mage.  
I'll do my very best...  
{player}?  
  
**Suzume：**  
He's fallen asleep again.  
Perhaps he's sleepy because his brain got a workout playing chess.  
Eheheh. Just like a little baby.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Please sleep peacefully, Master.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Just kidding.  
It's not like you're my master. Right?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Tee hee hee.  
I'm sure milady would be quite jealous  
if she saw me right now.
