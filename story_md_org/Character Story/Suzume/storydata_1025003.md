**Suzume：**  
Eeeek! A-aaack?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ouch...  
I-I tripped over again.  
  
**Suzume：**  
But at least there's a silver lining. I'm so glad you're carrying  
the items I purchased, {player}.  
I can trip over as much as I like and the items will be fine!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh?  
You've fallen over yourself, {player}.  
Are you okay?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ah! You tried to stop me from falling,  
but you lost your own balance and fell over as well.  
I-I'm terribly sorry for getting you caught up in my clumsiness!  
  
**Suzume：**  
You really didn't need to try to stop me from falling.  
I've done my best to learn how to break my own falls...  
So I get by with only minimal damage when I fall over.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh? The focus of my efforts is unconventional?  
 I suppose you're  
right. But it's better than not doing anything at all, correct?  
 You  
could say my clumsiness is an incurable disease, or a curse, even.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Trying to fix that is an undertaking to be carried out over the long term...  
I just need to make sure I don't cause any trouble  
or concern to others when I have a bout of clumsiness.  
  
**Suzume：**  
In any case...  
{player}, you have a graze on your kneecap.  
Please wait while I apply some healing magic to it right away.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh?  
Wh-why are you reeling with such a terrified look on your face?  
You'll be fine! I won't blow you up like I did to the Orphanage wall.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Right then, please stay still.  
Take that! Fit and fighting. Ready for smiting!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Eheheh.  
I have a bit of a knack for healing magic.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I suppose you could say I've grown accustomed to it, with all of my tripping over and injuring myself.  
I do mess up if try to rush myself, however.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Do you have pain anywhere else?  
If so, I'll heal you right up!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  My head hurts.  
**Choice: (2)**  My heart hurts.  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzume：**  
Oh dear. Well, you did slam into the ground quite violently.  
Where does it hurt? Please show me.  
It might be wise to examine it further, if you really did hit your head.  
  
**Suzume：**  
But I don't possess those skills myself...  
In any case, I'll just provide some provisional treatment for now!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzume：**  
What?! How do you expect me to deal with that?  
I-is it because I'm too big of a klutz?  
Does your heart hurt because the sight of me is just so pitiful?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I-it's okay! I'm quite happy as I am!  
Please, put your mind at ease!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Suzume：**  
There!  
All right,  
shall we call that a full recovery then?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Phew.  
Using magic sure is exhausting.  
  
**Suzume：**  
However,  
{player}, thanks to your help with carrying my shopping,  
I've been able to conserve some of my energy.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm still feeling fit as a fiddle!  
Eheheh.  
You're such a kind person, {player}.  
  
**Suzume：**  
You're just paying me back for treating you earlier?  
But that was my way of apologizing to you for the other day!  
Being thanked for an apology is all sorts of confusing!  
  
**Suzume：**  
However, that is rather charming.  
It's as if the good you do for others is good you do yourself. Much like giving and taking acts of kindness.  
  
**Suzume：**  
The world would be so peaceful  
if everyone were like you, {player}.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hm?  
Huh? {player}... What happened to my shopping?  
  
**Suzume：**  
You appear to be empty-handed.  
Did you, perhaps, drop it somewhere?  
You must be just as scatterbrained as me, {player}!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Whatever shall I do? Where could you have possibly dropped it?  
Um... Uh...

**Suzume：**  
Hm?  
It appears as though some tiny fellows are carrying my shopping.  
Could it be...? Are they the guardian deity statues from the plaza?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Perhaps...  
They weren't guardian deity statues, but golems instead?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Golems are quasi-organisms created by mages.  
Could they possibly have been abandoned by their owner  
and left at that plaza?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Are these golems repaying me  
for giving them a good cleaning, perhaps?  
I've read a fairy tale like that before.  
  
`image display end`  
**Suzume：**  
Actually, no.  
It's probably because I touched them to get them cleaned up.  
  
**Suzume：**  
My magic powers were transferred into them.  
All I did was awaken the dormant golems.  
  
**Suzume：**  
As such, {player}, when I asked you  
to help me carry my shopping...  
 they must have misunderstood  
that as an order for them, so they're just doing what they were told.  
  
**Suzume：**  
But you know what...? Thinking of them as guardian deity statues  
repaying me for what I did, just like in the fairy tale, is rather lovely.  
It's more romantic that way... and a much happier thought.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Eheheh.  
I suppose the good you do for others really is good you do yourself,  
milady!
