## Subtitle: Suzume's Lucky Day
  
**Suzume：**  
Oof, ugh.  
Argh, this cargo is so heavy!  
But... but there's not far to go!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Thank goodness! I can finally see Landosol in my sights.  
It was so far!  
I didn't think I'd make it by sunset.  
  
**Suzume：**  
But I've also miraculously come all this way without causing any trouble  
or coming across any monsters!  
Looks like I've got luck on my side today!  
Hehehe!  
  
**Suzume：**  
But, actually, knowing me... There's all the chance in the world that  
I'll have a disastrous bout of clumsiness  
 and make everything go to  
waste by falling into a pit or something at the very end!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I must keep my wits about me and do my very best until the end!  
You can do it, Suzume!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Yipes?!  
Oh, you scared me!  
Could you please not call out to me all of a sudden like that?  
  
**Suzume：**  
You... Um, {player}?  
Fancy seeing you here. What are you up to around these parts?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Out for a stroll.  
**Choice: (2)**  Out to get some food.  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzume：**  
Ah, I see. The weather is rather lovely today.  
It's so hot that I've worked up a sweat myself.  
  
**Suzume：**  
One must exercise every so often to maintain good health.  
I think it's absolutely wonderful to go on a relaxing walk  
while basking in the sun's rays.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzume：**  
Wha? {player}...  
Instead of buying food at a store, you hunt wild animals  
and pick fruits to gather your food?  
  
**Suzume：**  
That's awfully wild of you.  
Don't tell me that you're, perhaps, poor?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh!  
Come to think of it, I brought some cookies I made this morning!  
If you're hungry, go ahead and help yourself!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm not great at cooking...  
so they might not taste very good, though.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Suzume：**  
Um, in any case...  
It's quite dangerous, as monsters appear outside of the town, you know?  
Well, I suppose I should speak for myself.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I had some minor business to attend to...  
I'm actually on my way back from my home village now.  
  
**Suzume：**  
While it's deep within the mountains, it's still within walking distance.  
So I often walk to and from there,  
especially since it would be a waste to spend money on a carriage.  
  
**Suzume：**  
The monsters around here are peaceful, and not very strong either.  
In fact, I could probably handle them myself.  
It's not too dangerous if you don't venture into the forests.  
  
**Suzume：**  
But letting your guard down would be your greatest undoing!  
I've heard rumors that there's been a stark increase in monsters lately.  
  
**Suzume：**  
However... there was something I just had  
to bring back from my hometown at all costs,  
so I took the plunge and set off on a little trip.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I spent a night there, and I'm on my way home now.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Milady is busy herself, so I didn't want to spend too much  
time away from the Sarendia Orphanage.  
 I worry about  
the children, so I must get back to them as soon as possible.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh?  
You'll help me carry my goods?  
Well, uh, I'd very much appreciate the help.  
  
**Suzume：**  
{player},  
you helped me carry some things the other day as well.  
Why are you always so kind to me?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Even though I sent you flying with my magic  
and caused you so much trouble...  
You must be an upstanding character, {player}!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Well then... I'll happily accept your offer of help.  
If you help me carry my goods,  
then I'll be able to get back to the Sarendia Orphanage sooner.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Eheheh.  
Some men sure are reliable!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I try to do everything on my own.  
Then I end up overwhelming myself...  
  
**Suzume：**  
And then I find myself in some kind of mishap, and cause a whole world of trouble.  
Sometimes I need to rely on others, it seems.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hehehe.  
I've met someone wonderful. You, {player}.  
I think luck really is on my side today!
