**Hatsune：**  
Mmm... Hmmm?  
Is that a monster I hear...? Zzz...

**Hatsune：**  
Mmm! What a great nap!  
Hatsune is back and ready for action!  
Sha-shing!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hm? Where am I?  
Why am I all the way up in the mountains?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh hey, it's {player}!  
You look exhausted. What's up?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh?! You saw me floating around in my sleep and were  
too worried about me to get any sleep yourself?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wow... You stayed awake just to watch over little ol' me?  
Thank you so much, {player}!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Sometimes my superpowers go off when I'm sleeping, so I'll just  
fly away without even knowing it...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Watching over me must've been a real pain,  
so lemme do  
something for you to repay the favor!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
So what do you want? Your wish is my command!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  You don't need to thank me.  
**Choice: (7)**  I can ask for [i]anything,[/i] right?  
`Tag 6`  
**Hatsune：**  
Aww, don't be like that! I'm gonna feel guilty until I do  
something!  
C'mon, I'll do anything!  
  
Jump to tag 8  
`Tag 7`  
**Hatsune：**  
You sure can! And if it's something I can do, then I'll do it!  
Nooo questions asked!  
  
`Tag 8`  
**Hatsune：**  
With my superpowers, most things are as easy as─  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Yikes! A-a monster?!  
We've gotta get outta here!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hey, I know!  
You took care of me while I was sleeping, so I'll  
take care of you now!  
I'll use my teleportation and whoosh us  
on outta here! Whoosh!  
  

---  
  
**Hatsune：**  
And we're here!  
We were outta there in a literal flash! Pretty cool, huh?  
Aw yeah! We did it! Love and peace!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh? Uh... I don't think I've ever seen this cave anywhere  
before.  
Hey {player}, do you know the way out of here?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Right, of course not. I don't know... which way it  
is... either...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
But we'll be oookie-dokie. Totally okay. I just have to  
teleport us somewhere else!  
*yawn*  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh... But I just teleported, and I'm just... so exhausted...  
Zzz...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I'm so sorry, {player}. It's beddy-bye for me...  
Zzz...  
  
**Narration：**  
Knowing Hatsune wasn't waking up for anything, {player} picked her up and frantically searched for the exit.
