# Hatsune Episode 9
Along with {player}, Hatsune wanders the city in search of a way to remedy her sleepy constitution. From an outsider's perspective, it looks as though they are on a date.
  
## Subtitle: Operation Waking Beauty!
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is heading to Landosol with Hatsune  
on his back, who has fallen asleep after using her  
superpowers to exterminate monsters.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Mnhh...  
Zzz...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Mm, hnnn...  
*yawn* What a great nap...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Good morning.  
`Tag 1`  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, mornin'...  
Wah!  
{player}?!  
Don't scare me like that...!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, I see.  
I nodded off again after using my superpowers.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Sorry, {player}.  
I'm always such a pain.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wait... that means...  
{player} saw my sleeping face...  
Oh god, I feel so embarrassed all of a sudden!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Important question... {player}, was I okay?  
I-I wasn't drooling or anything, was I?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
*sigh* I wonder if there's anything I can do about my chronic fatigue...  
It's gotten to the point where I can't even just hang out with Shiorin anymore.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  How about we try some sleepiness countermeasures?  
`Tag 2`  
**Hatsune：**  
Sleepiness countermeasures?  
Nice idea! You might be onto something!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I bet we can find lots of methods in Landosol!  
All right, it's settled. Let's go!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Um... First, I think I'll try some herbal therapy.  
Let's check out that stall over there! Excuse me!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Hi there. What can I do you for?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Um, do you happen to have any herbs that'll stop me from sleeping?  
  
**Man 1：**  
Hm? Oh, you mean for drowsiness, right?  
I've got just what you need. These here are the popular types.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I'll take that one!  
Okay, here we go. Down the hatch!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Thanks, come again—  
Uh, you're taking it here?  
You're supposed to take it when you feel sleepy.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Strike while the iron's hot! *glug glug*...  
Haaah!  
Yep, that hit the spot!  
Thanks, mister!  
All right, what's next?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I wonder if they have anything in here?  
Sleep stoppers, sleep stoppers... Oh!  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Are you looking for tools to prevent sleepiness?  
If so, maybe you'd be interested in these pressure-point sandals.  
They stimulate the soles of your feet enough to keep you awake.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wow, they sound perfect!  
I'll take 'em!  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Wonderful! Please hold on a moment while I wrap them up...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ah! No need! They're going straight on my feet!  
  
**Woman 1：**  
O-oh...  
Well, in that case...  
Thank you, come again!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ughhh... This is torture. It hurts so much to walk...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Want a piggyback ride?  
`Tag 3`  
**Hatsune：**  
N-no, I don't wanna trouble you.  
Besides, I won't know if they're effective until I properly break them in...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
But thanks.  
You must be exhausted from me dragging you around all day.  
Wanna take a break somewhere?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Speaking of which, I heard there's a popular cafe around here.  
Coffee's great for keeping yourself perked up, so let's check it out!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wow! ♪ It smells amazing!  
Eheheh, I'm gonna enjoy this!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Mmm...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Mmnhh...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I-I was sooo wrong!  
This coffee's way too bitter!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Urghhh, yeah, this stuff'll definitely keep me awake...  
But there's no way I can drink it all...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'll drink it for you.  
**Choice: (5)**  I'll have half of it.  
`Tag 4`  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh? Will you?  
Thaaanks!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Hatsune：**  
Please, take it!  
You can have all of it if you want!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Hatsune：**  
How is it...?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Bitter...  
`Tag 7`  
**Hatsune：**  
Right...? Are you okay?  
Oh yeah, I knew this might happen, so I ordered cake! It should cleanse  
the palate!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Here, open wide!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Well? Is that any better?  
Sorry for making you drink my coffee...  
You can have more cake if you want!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Hey, look at those two lovebirds over there  
being all mushy and stuff.  
We should be like that.  
Say \"ah\"!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Stop, it's too embarrassing!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
What? It's fine! We're on a date.  
That couple's doing the same thing, so don't be shy.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
They're totally talking about us, right...?  
A-ahahah...  
I guess they've mistaken us for a couple.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Well, this does look a lot like a date...  
I mean, the coffee... w-w-  
we indirectly kissed 'cause we shared it!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I-I think we should get going.  
There are loads of anti-sleep measures I've yet to try!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
If I blow up that monster over there using my superpowers and I don't  
get sleepy, that means it's a success, right?  
I've tried so many things, one of them's gotta work!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Here I go!  
Taaake this...  
W-waaah!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Whoaaa! That was a lot more super than usual...  
What's going on...?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
But I did it! ♪  Sha-shing! ☆  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Eheheh.  
As long as I don't get sleepy now...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Mnhh...  
Zzz...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Mm, hn...  
*yawn* What a nice nap...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Good morning.  
`Tag 8`  
**Hatsune：**  
Mornin'...  
Huh? Waaah!  
Was I sleeping?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh-wha-wha? It's gotten so late...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
*sigh* I tried so many things, but they all failed.  
I'm so sorry you wasted your day on me.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  We'll figure it out eventually.  
`Tag 9`  
**Hatsune：**  
Y-yeah, maybe.  
Ahahah...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
O-oh no...  
  
If I failed, that means he saw my sleeping face again...  
I forgot about that!  
  
**Narration：**  
Hatsune didn't realize that her superpowers were quietly being  
strengthened by the failed attempts at countering her sleepiness.
