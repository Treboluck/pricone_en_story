**Narration：**  
{player} is out shopping with Hatsune.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I wanna kind of change up my room. Maybe make it a bit  
cuter, y'know? So I'd like to find something cute to put in  
there, but... I'm just not sure what.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
That's why I invited you out with me today.  
To hear your thoughts!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
So without further ado, let's get—  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Aagh! That's bright! This is just like before, isn't it?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wait, huh...? I'm so sleepy all of a... Zzz...

**Hatsune：**  
Boy, the zoo sure was fun!  
Hey, let's go check out the gift shop!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I wanna pick up a present for Shiorin while we're here.  
What should I get her?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, this little panda plushie might be good!  
I think cute things  
like this are right up her alley!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh? Y-you think they suit me too?

**Hatsune：**  
Whaaat? Get real! If there's anything that suits me here,  
it's... this tiger here!  
Roooar!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Rawr! Rawr! I'm gonna eat you, {player}!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh? What do you mean you wouldn't taste that good?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Really? I think you look pretty tasty, myself.  
You're bigger than me, so you'd definitely be more filling!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Not to mention, you're super funny, and nice, and forthright,  
and handsome, and generous...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wha-huh? That's got nothing to do with the flavor, has it?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ahaha... Yeah, geez. What am I saying?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You can eat me if you'd like.  
**Choice: (2)**  You're not... really gonna eat me, are you?  
`Tag 1`  
**Hatsune：**  
Why would you let me?!  
More importantly, I-I'm not gonna eat  
you for real, you weirdo!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Hatsune：**  
O-obviously not!  
Come on, do I *look* like I'm gonna eat you?!  
  
`Tag 3`

**Hatsune：**  
Man, you really rattled me with all that crazy talk...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh?  
You're gonna buy this for me to make up for it?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Really?! Thank you so much! Well, I think you deserve  
a thank-you for that!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Homph!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Heehee. J-just a little nibble. O-on your cheek. That's all.

**Ameth：**  
Aaand scene. ♪  
  
**Ameth：**  
Wow, Hatsune sure is forward. I'm honestly shocked.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And like, homph?! *HOMPH?!*  
Could she be any cuter?!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Regardless, it looks like you're just as friendly \"here\" as you  
are on the over \"there\". Just enjoy yourself for the time being.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm probably going to need your help pretty soon,  
but until then...  
  
**Ameth：**  
I think that's enough for today.  
Bye-bye. See you next time!

**Hatsune：**  
*yawn*... Was I asleep again?  
Oh, were you sleeping here too, {player}?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh? You dreamt about a zoo? That's the same dream I had!  
Talk about déjà vu, huh?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, that's it! Totally changing the subject, but why don't we  
put a stuffed animal in my room?  
I think that's just the cute  
touch I need!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh? You'll buy one for me?!  
Score! Thank you!  
Now, how should I repay you?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wait... Th-that reminds me...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hey, uh... S-something other than that!  
I might've \"eaten\" you  
in the dream, but it was just in the heat of the moment,  
y'know? I was just so happy, I...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
*whimper* God, even if it was a dream,  
why would I do something so crazy?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Just forget it! Forget all about it!  
We had a dream here, but it's gone now!  
  
**Narration：**  
Saying this, Hatsune fled the scene in her embarrassment.
