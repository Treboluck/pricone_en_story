## Subtitle: Sleeping Beauty Comes of Age
  
**Narration：**  
Having not seen Hatsune since she last lost control of her superpowers,  
{player} becomes worried and decides to pay her a visit.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Just a minute! Who is it?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh? Wah!  
Why are you here?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh? 'Cause you got worried?  
Oh, right... Sorry, I guess I'm still being a nuisance.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
My superpowers have been acting up since back then...  
So I decided to just stay at home.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
'Cause if my superpowers go crazy again when we're in town,  
I'm pretty sure someone's gonna notice...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ughhh, whenever I'm in Landosol I just end up causing trouble for  
everyone, so I'm just gonna be a shut-in for the rest of my life...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Any idea what's causing it?  
`Tag 1`  
**Hatsune：**  
Not a clue!  
Why is this happening to me...?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hey, from your point of view, have you noticed anything at all unusual?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You're hiccupping a lot lately.  
`Tag 2`  
**Hatsune：**  
Hiccupping?  
Huhhh? Maybe...?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ah...  
Now that you mention it, I guess these days I do hiccup  
each time my superpowers manifest...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  What does Shiori say about it?  
`Tag 3`  
**Hatsune：**  
Sh-she can't get involved!  
If something happened to her, I'd never forgive myself!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Honestly, even just talking to you like this might end up causing you  
trouble.  
So it's best if you just go home already...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'm not leaving.  
`Tag 4`  
**Hatsune：**  
Argh! If something bad happens, don't say I didn't warn you!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
But...  
thanks...  
You saying that makes me feel kinda relieved—  
  
**Hatsune：**  
*hic*  
Zzz...

**Hatsune：**  
H-huh...?  
Waaah, I did it again...  
I'm so sorry, {player}!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Changing the subject, where the heck are we?  
Er...  
l-let's ask that person over there...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wh-whoaaa! That's no person, it's a monster!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Protect Hatsune.  
`Tag 5`  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH  
  
**Hatsune：**  
{player}! Are you all right?!  
Why, you little...!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
{player}, are you all─  
Wh-whoaaa! What's with this light?!  
A-ahhhhh!  
  

---  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh? It's {player}.  
...Heeey!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Well, well, well, fancy meeting you here!  
You heading somewhere?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I've got nothing to do, so I'm just taking a walk.  
It's good to give your legs a stretch every once in a while, right?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Wanna accompany me?  
**Choice: (7)**  I'm pretty bored too.  
`Tag 6`  
**Hatsune：**  
Yeah, let's go, let's go!  
Well, no idea where to though!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I'll go anywhere, as long as it's with you!  
  
Jump to tag 8  
`Tag 7`  
**Hatsune：**  
Well then,  
I guess we're boredom buddies!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Then I might as well do you the pleasure of tagging along!  
I'll teach you the secrets to the art of killing time! ☆  
  
`Tag 8`  
**Hatsune：**  
Anyway, it sure is peaceful today, huh?  
Wait, oh nooo!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Over there! A kid just ran into the road...!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  I'll save 'em!  
`Tag 9`  
**Hatsune：**  
{player}, look out!  
Take that, Truck-kun!

**Hatsune：**  
Huh...? {player}...  
Thank goodness, he's still alive...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I managed to rescue him with my superpowers...  
  
Eheheh, that's a relief...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
This whole time, have I been... sleeping... on his lap?  
Oh, I see. He's looking after me 'cause I conked out in the street.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
But y'know... thinking about it, his face is super close.  
Scratch that, his face is waaay too close!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Uuurgh, but I'll headbutt him if I jump to my feet...  
Wh-what should I do?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wait, has he been watching me sleep this whole time...?  
Uuurgh, I hope I wasn't drooling or anything...!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
A-and now it's awkward 'cause I've waited too long to get up...!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
*peek*  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ah! I made eye contact...!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
...Zzz... I-I'm still sleeping, y'know.  
In fact, I'm so deeply asleep that I'm in a coma.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
And don't forget, Sleeping Beauty won't wake up without a kiss from  
her Prince Charming.  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Lean in.  
**Choice: (11)**  Don't kiss.

**Hatsune：**  
Huh? Whoa there!  
Time-out! Time-out right now!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Y-you can't just do that all of a sudden!  
Come on! You startled me!  
  
Jump to tag 12  
`Tag 11`  
**Hatsune：**  
Hnnn... Huh?  
  
![101201102.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/101201102.webp)  
**Hatsune：**  
Ahhh! You can't poke me like that!  
It's against the rules!  
  
`Tag 12`  
**Hatsune：**  
Gosh, haven't you ever heard of tact?  
But... eheheh, I'm glad you're okay, {player}.  
  
![101201101.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/101201101.webp)  
**Hatsune：**  
I'm sleepy with relief. Just give me...  
mmm... five more minutes...  
Or maybe  
thirty... Zzz...

**Ameth：**  
Hello, it's good to have you back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Doesn't matter which world you're in, you're always trying to protect  
Hatsune. How admirable.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I know it seems like she's always using you,  
but make sure to be there whenever she's in trouble.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, I trust you two will be just fine.  
Anyway, that's about all I've got for you this time.  
Bye-bye.

**Hatsune：**  
! Ah, the monster...!  
Oh, guess I killed it...  
Thank goodness...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, right! {player}, are you okay?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Phew... You're just sleeping.  
What a relief.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
...That's right.  
This time I protected you with my superpowers...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
...Wait.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
They just activated normally. If I remember right, I didn't hiccup at all.  
I wonder why?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Either way, I'm just glad you're not hurt.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Poke, poke!  
I'm gonna tease you.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
You really are asleep, huh? Heheh...  
We'll save the wake-up kiss... for next time, okay?  
  
**Narration：**  
So saying, Hatsune prodded {player} on the lips.
