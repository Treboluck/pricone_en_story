## Subtitle: The Night the Stars Fell
  
**Narration：**  
{player} has brought Hatsune to see Shiori.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I can't believe something like that happened...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
And I can't believe he carried me here while I was sleeping! Bad boy!  
Shiorin's the *one* person I didn't wanna worry...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You'll make her more worried if you keep quiet.  
`Tag 1`  
**Shiori：**  
He's right, Hatsune.  
I'd rather you talk to me when you need help.  
We are family after all.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
*sob* I'm sorry, Shiorin─  
  
**Hatsune：**  
*hic*  
Zzz...  
  

---  
  
**Shiori：**  
Eeek!  
Oh... So that's what it's like.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I see...  
So her superpowers go off every time she hiccups...  
Ah, this isn't the first time...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ah...?!  
Ahhh!  
I-it happened again!  
I'm so sorry!  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's okay, Hatsune.  
A while ago, we had the same problem.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh, you serious?  
This has happened before?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes.  
There was this one time when your hiccups just wouldn't stop...  
And just like now, your superpowers were going off all over the place.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh? Maybe you're right.  
Ahahah...  
I honestly don't remember...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Heheh. Come on, pull yourself together.  
  
**Shiori：**  
...Listen, Hatsune.  
You're not trying to forcefully suppress your growing superpowers,  
are you?  
  
**Shiori：**  
And because you can't hold them back... your hiccups are acting as a  
trigger for them to go wild?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Gosh, you're right...  
That's my Shiorin!  
But how do I fix it?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Sorry, that part I don't know...  
Last time, it just suddenly cured itself...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I see...  
But thanks.  
It's already a great help just knowing the cause─  
  
**Hatsune：**  
*hic*  
Zzz...  
  

---  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ah!  
Not again...  
Wait, what?  
Is this Landosol?!  
*sob* {player}, Shiorin, I'm so sorry.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
How are we gonna get back?  
If I do this, maybe I can force my myself to hiccup...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ah!  
This poster...  
  
**Shiori：**  
\"Star Festival Canceled\"...  
Did something happen?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
It's all my fault... I made the stars disappear!  
*sigh*... Everyone was looking forward to it, but I went and messed it  
up...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hatsune... don't blame yourself like that─  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ah... I see.  
So that's what it is.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Did you just have a revelation?  
`Tag 2`  
**Shiori：**  
Yes.  
It's just speculation...  
But perhaps you started feeling guilty about your superpowers  
because they caused the Star Festival to be canceled...  
  
**Shiori：**  
And as a result, your superpowers are going haywire?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Because Hatsune is really kind-hearted.  
**Choice: (4)**  I think Shiori's right.  
`Tag 3`  
**Hatsune：**  
Y-you think?  
Well, I guess if you say so...  
then maybe...?  
G-gosh, you're making me blush.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Shiori：**  
Yes. It's because you're so kind...  
I can sense that you're really concerned about the people who are upset  
that the festival got canceled.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Hatsune：**  
Hmmm...  
But assuming that's the case,  
what am I supposed to do...?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hah,maybe I should just make my own meteor shower...  
  
**Shiori：**  
That's it, Hatsune!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh?  
What do you mean?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Let's make the Star Festival happen!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
So 'cause of what you said, I slept a ton to make sure I can  
control my superpowers...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
But I don't know if I can actually make stars fall from the sky.  
  
**Shiori：**  
You'll be fine, I'm certain.  
  
**Shiori：**  
If we can produce a meteor shower for all the people who were  
looking forward to the Star Festival...  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm sure all the doom and gloom you're feeling about possibly causing  
the festival to be canceled will also clear up.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Yeah, maybe.  
But my superpowers are a total mess lately, so I have my  
reservations...  
  
**Shiori：**  
But you said it yourself, right?  
When you had to save {player},  
you were able to control your powers.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ah...  
Yeah.  
I don't think I hiccupped at all then.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm absolutely sure  
those superpowers were a manifestation of  
what you were feeling in your heart.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wh-what I was feeling in my heart...?!  
Sh-Shiorin!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Huh...?  
I mean, it's true, isn't it?  
You're always using your superpowers for the sake of others, right?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
O-ohhh, that's what you mean!  
You caught me off guard there...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
...But yeah.  
I believe it's best for me to use my superpowers in that way.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Right. Then you should use your heart's desire to help people in need  
as a way to control your superpowers.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Let's make the Star Festival happen, for everyone's sake.  
`Tag 6`  
**Hatsune：**  
...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Yeah... You're right.  
I get it now, Shiorin! {player}!  
I'm gonna give it all I've got!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
All righty! Let's get started!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Urnghh...!  
H-huh? Was this how I did it?  
Er...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Uuurgh, I've totally forgotten how to properly use my superpowers...!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Let's do it together!  
`Tag 7`  
**Hatsune：**  
Whoa! Is this your power, {player}...?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
There's so much strength welling up inside me...!  
Yeah, this'll do it!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Somehow it's a really warm sensation...  
It's the feelings inside your heart,  
I bet...!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Whee... My power's getting super charged!  
Now I feel like I can do anything! ☆  
  

---  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Let the Hatsune Star Festival begin!  
Sha-shing! ☆

**Hatsune：**  
Yay!  
I'll keep 'em coming! ♪

**Hatsune：**  
Shioriiin! Look, I'm totally on fire!  
And here's some more! Sha-sha-sha-shing! ☆

**Shiori：**  
Heheh. You look like you're having lots of fun.  
It's already such a relief.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
{player}, thank you! This meteor shower is a gift for all  
the people of Landosol, made from our combined superpowers!  
Yay! Love and peace!

**Little Boy：**  
Whoa!  
That's so cool!  
  
**Little Girl：**  
The sky's full of stars!

**Woman：**  
Wow... So beautiful...!  
And so captivating!  
  
**Man：**  
Well, I'll be darned...!  
It's festival time, everyone! Let's begin the Star Festival!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Whew... That was so much fun!  
I wonder if everyone else enjoyed it.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I did. It was amazing, Hatsune.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Eheheh!  
I'm glad to hear it!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Mmnh... Oh, I'm already drifting off... Urghhh.  
But this time I think I'll sleep... like a... baby...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Mnhhnhh... Well then, off to dreamland I go...  
Nighty night, Shiorin...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
{player}...  
...If you could rouse me with a wake-up kiss,  
that would be... nice...  
Zzz...  
  
**Narration：**  
The story of The Night the Stars Fell would go down in Landosol's  
oral tradition for generations as an event brought about by a single  
sleepy girl.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hnnn... Zzz... Eheheh... ☆
