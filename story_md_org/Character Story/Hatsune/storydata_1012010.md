## Subtitle: Subconscious Psychic Powers
  
**Narration：**  
Hatsune is roaming around town  
looking for {player}.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
There you are!  
Hey! {player}!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Have you been hard at work? You just finishing up?  
I see! Perfect timing!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
By the way, what kind of work were you doing?  
Uh-huh, preparations for the Star Festival...  
Wait, what? You were  
packing up 'cause it's been canceled?  
What the heck happened?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Whaaat? The festival itself was canceled 'cause the annual meteor  
shower that should be observable around now is nowhere to be seen?  
Didn't think that was possible.  
Weird.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
...Uh, wait a sec. Meteor?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Um, that meteor wouldn't happen to be...  
the one that I destroyed,  
would it...?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm afraid so...  
**Choice: (2)**  Probably not.  
`Tag 1`  
**Hatsune：**  
I-I knew it!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Hatsune：**  
Urghhh... It's hard to believe that it's not related...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Hatsune：**  
And everyone was so excited for the festival!  
What should I do? I've really screwed things up!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh? There wouldn't have been a festival anyway if Landosol  
had been destroyed?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
...Yeah. Thanks, {player}.  
I don't feel so bad about it now.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
But I guess it's not good to overdo it with the superpowers, huh?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
...Actually, there's something troubling me.  
I came to you hoping for some advice─  
  
**Hatsune：**  
*hic*  
Zzz...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  ?!  
`Tag 4`  
**Narration：**  
Suddenly thrown into the air, {player}  
grabs a string that appears in front of him.  
  
**Little Girl：**  
Oh, my balloon!  
Thanks for getting it for me!  
  
**Little Girl：**  
You're really good at jumping!  
It's almost like you were flying in the sky!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Zzz... Zzz...  
  
**Little Girl：**  
Huh?  
Why's this lady napping in the street?!  
What a weirdo! ♪  
  
**Hatsune：**  
*gasp* H-huh...?  
  
**Little Girl：**  
Ah! Morning, miss!  
Why were you sleeping in a place like this?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh?! Errr, beats me!  
I just suddenly felt sleepy!  
Ahahahahah!  
  
**Little Girl：**  
Heheh, you're so funny!  
Mister, thanks for getting my balloon! Bye-bye! ♪  
You too, miss, bye-bye! ♪  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Y-yeah!  
Bye-bye! ♪  
  
**Hatsune：**  
...Um, {player},  
did I by any chance use my superpowers just now?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Actually, you don't have to answer that!  
*sigh*... I knew it...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Y'know, I've been feeling awful lately, or maybe I've been feeling too  
good...  
I'm not really sure to be honest, but my superpowers have been  
acting of their own accord.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
What's more, I instantly feel sleepy whenever it happens.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
But I've started waking up pretty quickly...  
I bet it's 'cause of all those things we tried!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
*pant* *pant*...  
I think I bought a little too much...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
That old lady over there's carrying too many bags.  
I have to go help her.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
*hic*  
Zzz...  
  
**Narration：**  
Before he knows it, the woman's shopping bags  
are in {player}'s hands.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  ?!  
`Tag 5`  
**Old Woman：**  
Huh?  
Where are my things...?  
D-did somebody snatch them?!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Oh, thank goodness.  
You're just carrying them for me.  
Sorry about that. You took me by surprise is all.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ah! H-huh...?  
Where's {player}...?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, is he helping the old lady with her bags?  
Hey, me too! Lemme lend a hand!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Thank you both for carrying all this for me.  
I don't know what I would've done without your kindness.  
Take care, and have a lovely day.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
See you, grandma!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Eheheh, I'm glad I could be useful...  
H-huh? What's wrong? You look so tired.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Ahhh, ahahah...  
I didn't by any chance use my superpowers without realizing again,  
did I...?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I'll keep your secret safe.  
`Tag 6`  
**Hatsune：**  
{player}...  
Great, thanks...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Even though I cause you all sorts of trouble...  
You're always so nice to me...  
*sigh* But I shouldn't rely on you so much...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Well,  
I'd best get going now!  
I'll just end up causing you more trouble if I stay...!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I don't mind.  
`Tag 7`  
**Hatsune：**  
Really...? Even though I'm being such a nuisance...!  
I'm so happy...! H─  
  
**Hatsune：**  
*hic*  
Zzz...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Where did... my clothes go?  
`Tag 8`  
**Woman：**  
Let's see, what should I make for lunch today...?  
Uwaaaaghhh!  
Pervert!  
  
**Woman：**  
Don't look around as if you don't know  
it's YOU I'm talking about!  
Why've you got no clothes on in the middle of the street?!  
  
**Woman：**  
Th-this is public indecency!  
Y-you should be ashamed of yourself...!  
  
**Man：**  
What's going on? I heard a scream... Eh?  
You, boy! What're you doing?! Put that thing away!  
  
**Man：**  
He's clearly up to no good...!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  It's not what you think.  
`Tag 9`  
**Man：**  
Not what I think...?  
Exactly what am I misunderstanding about this situation?  
Explain yourself!  
  
**Woman：**  
What?  
You were seeing to that girl after she collapsed on the side of the road?  
Then why are you like that...?  
  
**Man：**  
Well, I guess you don't seem like such a bad guy...  
  
**Woman：**  
You're right... He does have quite a friendly face.  
Even though there's barely a lick of clothing on him...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Zzz...  
{player}... Stop it, you shouldn't touch me there...! ♪  
  
**Both：**  
...  
  
**Both：**  
Someone, heeeelp!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Grab Hatsune and run.  
`Tag 10`  
**Man：**  
Ah! He's getting away!  
  
**Woman：**  
Stop right there!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Zzz... Tee hee... Being carried bridal style...  
It's like a dreeeam...! ♪  
  
**Hatsune：**  
*yawn*... Mmn...  
*gasp* I didn't do it again, did I?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh? {player}, why aren't you wearing any clothes?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Uh, d-don't tell me...  
while I was asleep, you were...?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
...Huh?  
My superpowers made your clothes... disappear?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
F-forgive meeeee!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
...Oh my god, I'm so sorry.  
All I do is cause you trouble...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I know you told me you don't mind,  
but this is just...  
  
**Choice: (11)**  It's actually pretty fun.  
`Tag 11`  
**Hatsune：**  
...Fun?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
It's fun 'cause it's impossible to predict what'll happen...?  
I see. Well, if you put it that way...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Yeah...  
I'm having fun too.  
Every time I wake up, your face is so close to mine...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I-I mean!  
  
You must be cold, so let's go find your clothes!  
Ah, do you wanna wear mine?! I'm just messin' with ya, eheheh!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
All righty then, I'll find your clothes!  
It's about time I showed you how helpful my superpowers really are!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Let's hurry!  
We wouldn't want you to get sick now, would we?!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so, with a smile on her face,  
Hatsune returned to the city with {player}.  
  
**Woman：**  
Oh my. What are these clothes doing on the ground?  
...I wonder who they belong to.  
  
**Man：**  
Let's take them to the lost and found at the guard station.
