## Subtitle: Hatsune's Creed
  
**Narration：**  
At Hatsune's request, {player} has gone shopping with her.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I shopped my little heart out!  
Thank you so much for  
tagging along with me, {player}!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, I almost forgot!  
They gave me something when  
I got my change—  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Whoa! Wh-what's with this light?!  
It's so bright!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Nngh... I'm so sleepy all of a sudden... And I haven't even...  
used my superpowers...  
Zzz...  
  

---  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hey, {player}! You decide what you're gonna buy?  
I'm still on the fence...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh! Hey, I like this one!  
I'm gonna get it!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wha... whaaa?! Wh-what's wrong, {player}?!  
Why are you grabbing my hand like that?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh? Ooh, you were just reaching for the same thing?  
R-right! You like this one too, huh?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Well, we're in trouble here. There's only one left.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
All right! This calls for a bout of rock-paper-scissors!  
The winner gets to buy it!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Okay, here we go! Rock... paper... scissors!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Aagh! I-I lost?!  
I really wanted it, too!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
But I guess that's life. I'm the one who suggested rock-paper-scissors,  
so the prize is yours, {player}.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Wait, what? You thought I was gonna use my superpowers?  
Just to win a game?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
We-heh-hell, just wait 'til I let you in on this little secret.  
Superpowers must never be used for selfish reasons!  
Sha-shing!  
  
**Staff：**  
Hello there! If you have your receipt,  
you can enter our lottery!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh my gosh, {player}, look! It's a lottery wheel!  
We just got done shopping, so I think we get a try.  
Let's go for it!  
  
**Staff：**  
Hello there, sir! Let's see...  
For this amount, you can try twice.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
The grand prize is a vacation for two!  
Gosh, I'd love to go on a vacation...  
Go on, {player}! I believe in you!  
  
**Staff：**  
And it's white. Here's some tissues as a consolation prize.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Aww... No good, huh?  
But that's okay!  
You still have one more spin!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh? You sure you're cool with me doing it?  
All righty, I'll do my best! ☆  
  
**Hatsune：**  
If I get first prize, I can go on vacation with {player}!  
How cool would that be? The coolest ever!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh! B-but I'm not gonna use my powers!  
Obviously!  
I would never! Not in a million years.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
No superpowers... no superpowers...  
Okay, maybe some superpowers.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sounds like you want to use your secret weapon.  
**Choice: (2)**  Some should be fine.  
`Tag 1`  
**Hatsune：**  
W-who me?! Not me!  
*whistle*  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Hatsune：**  
N-no!  
I can't!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Hatsune：**  
But... it's a vacation getaway... Hnngh, I really wanna go!  
Hiyah!  
  
**Staff：**  
And iiit's... white! Here's your tissues, ma'am.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hrrgh!  
*sob*  
I guess... no trips for me...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Too bad about that lottery, huh?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I'm sure we would have won if I'd used my superpowers,  
but...  
that's totally cheating, huh?  
Oh well, let's get back to shop—  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh my gosh! I can't believe it! I've been looking for this  
tote bag for ages!  
Lookie, lookie! Isn't it the cutest?  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh? You were looking for this bag too, {player}?  
But... what do we do? There's only one left...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
We're doing this again, huh?!  
Fine by me!  
Rock-paper-scissors 2.0!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Rooock... paper... PAPER!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh! You used... scissors?!  
W-well, you know what? Take this!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Hnnngh!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I did it! I got you to do rock instead!  
Therefore, I win!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh? It doesn't count 'cause I used my superpowers?  
D-darn... Busted, huh? Heehee...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
I'm really sorry! I just need it, okay?!  
Please don't be mad!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
See, my little sister Shiorin told me she wanted this bag,  
so I wanted to get it as a present for her...  
  
**Hatsune：**  
B-but you're right. I shouldn't cheat.  
So here!  
The bag is yours, {player}!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh? You're okay with me winning?  
Yaaay! Thank you so much, {player}!

**Ameth：**  
And that's that. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Think of what you just saw as a dream of sorts.  
Chances are you'll forget everything the second you wake up,  
so no need to brood over it too much.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I gotta say, I never thought Hatsune actually had her act  
together.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I mean, the little goofball winds up falling asleep without any  
regard for time and place. I figured she'd just be using her  
superpowers willy-nilly.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's not easy to resist the temptation to use those kinds of  
powers for yourself. Most people wouldn't be able to.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But it looks like she's pretty firmly set on using them for  
everyone but herself.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You know, that kinda reminds me of you, too. You always put  
the well-being of others before your own.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You'd better look after her to make sure she doesn't push  
herself too hard.  
Hang in there, buddy.  
  

---  
  
**Hatsune：**  
*yawn* Boy, that felt good. I guess I fell asleep in the middle  
of the road again?  
That's weird. I haven't used my superpowers  
all day today!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Huh? Wait, were you sleeping too, {player}?  
Wow, I wonder what happened to us!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, I did have a really nice dream while I was out  
though, so maybe it was for the best!  
I was out shopping with you!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
That's right! We did a lottery and—  
Wait,  
how did you know that?!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
We had the same dream?  
Whoa.  
Talk about a crazy coincidence.  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Though I kinda wish we'd had a better dream to share together!  
Like, we could've at least won the lottery or something!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
Oh, hey! I almost forgot! We got lottery tickets when we  
finished shopping in real life too!  
We might've just had  
duds in our dream, but not here and now!  
  
**Hatsune：**  
U-um, but obviously, I'm not gonna use my powers!  
At least, not much.  
  
**Narration：**  
Even though Hatsune swears she won't use her superpowers for  
herself, she always has a hard time resisting the temptation.
