## Subtitle: An Absolute Geas
  
**Narration：**  
Despite a variety of challenging obstacles,  
{player} managed to make his delivery to Elizabeth Park  
and return home safely. But the very next day...  
  
**Christina：**  
Good day!  
It is I, Christina Morgan, vice-captain of Nightmare!  
  
**Christina：**  
I have it on good word that a certain {player}  
is residing here at the Sarendia Orphanage!  
I wish to see him at once. Will that be possible?  
  
**Christina：**  
...Wait, there's nobody here.  
How careless. Any kind of villain could sneak inside.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hellooo? Is anyone home?!  
Shall I start a fire and smoke you out?  
  
**Christina：**  
...Hm?  
 Ah, {player}!  
We meet again! It's good to see your face.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahaha. Looks like you've only just woken up.  
 It's past lunchtime, you know?  
 At least try to live a healthy life!  
You'll only regret it when you're older! ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
At any rate...  
You and I need to have a little talk. All right?  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh, don't look so worried.  
 Violence isn't my goal here.  
This orphanage is run by dear young Saren, yes?  
Displeasing her would make things difficult for me.  
  
**Christina：**  
I won't cause any trouble, so please, settle down.  
  
**Christina：**  
And as I promised, yesterday's incident is over.  
I haven't reported it to the palace,  
and I have my subordinates' word that they won't either.  
  
**Christina：**  
Nothing will remain on your record.  
And I won't hold anything against you, so don't worry.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hahah. In short, I'm just an ordinary guest.  
So a cup of tea wouldn't go amiss.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah, thank you.  
 Rather cheap tea leaves you have here.  
Young Saren never changes, does she?  
She could easily live a much finer life, but she'd rather wallow in poverty.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm?  
 Oh, Saren and I have some work history together.  
But enough about that. I'm not here to talk about young Saren.  
  
**Christina：**  
I'm here to talk about the two of us.  
  
**Christina：**  
Take a seat.  
Don't worry, this will be over before we finish our tea.  
  
**Christina：**  
Good. You're an obedient one.  
Here goes, then. This is a little awkward for me to say, but...  
  
**Christina：**  
Young {player}.  
I need you to marry me.  
  
**Christina：**  
...  
  
**Christina：**  
You look rather confused.  
That's fair enough. We've barely met, so this must seem quite rushed.  
  
**Christina：**  
Actually, you have amnesia too, don't you?  
Do you know what marriage is?  
  
**Christina：**  
To marry is to become a loving family,  
sworn to remain together for the rest of your lives.  
  
**Christina：**  
By the way, as it would be unfair to take advantage of your  
lack of memories, I should probably make this entirely clear...  
  
**Christina：**  
By the laws of this land, each citizen can only marry one other.  
  
**Christina：**  
Marriage is one of the most important vows  
a person can make in their lifetime.  
  
**Christina：**  
I am asking you to choose me as your lifelong partner.  
  
**Christina：**  
...You still seem quite unsure.  
 This is hard for me too, you know.  
I am not some floozy who would happily swear her life away  
to a man she just met.  
  
**Christina：**  
However, I have no choice.  
There is a custom in my family  
of swearing a solemn \"geas\" to the gods once each year.  
  
**Christina：**  
To break this geas is the greatest taboo of all,  
and those who do so are hunted down and executed  
by the rest of our clan.  
  
**Christina：**  
A ridiculous notion, isn't it?  
 I think so too.  
But such are the ways of old and esteemed families.  
Our captain wears that ridiculous armor for similar reasons.  
  
**Christina：**  
At any rate... When I was still quite a young girl,  
I made an unfortunate geas.  
I swore that I would marry the first man to touch my chest.  
  
**Christina：**  
I come from a respectable family, you see.  
As soon as I entered my adolescence,  
I found myself plagued with proposals from would-be suitors.  
  
**Christina：**  
Nobles are always eager to marry for political reasons, you see.  
  
**Christina：**  
But I was still young, and had no desire to pledge that youth away.  
The insistent pleas of one foolish man after another  
quickly became irritating.  
  
**Christina：**  
So I swore the geas I just mentioned, and threw it in their faces.  
\"If you want to marry me so much, just try to touch me!\" I said.  
  
**Christina：**  
Even back then, I was an incomparable fighter,  
so I enjoyed leaving those oafs lying in the dust.  
  
**Christina：**  
It amused me to no end  
watching noble young men debase themselves like clowns.  
  
**Christina：**  
I had no end of fun back then,  
but eventually, they realized the futility of their efforts and gave up,  
so I had forgotten all about that old geas.  
  
**Christina：**  
But yesterday, after returning home, I remembered my oath.  
Accident though it undoubtedly was, you did touch my chest.  
Though all you did was fall, and it was I who caught you in my arms.  
  
**Christina：**  
Still, a touch is a touch.  
By the geas I swore, I find myself duty-bound to marry you.  
Is that clear? Do you have any objections?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are you sure you're OK with that?  
**Choice: (2)**  Well, can't argue with a geas.  
`Tag 1`  
**Christina：**  
I am hardly thrilled.  
As I said, this is difficult for me.  
  
**Christina：**  
But to the clan into which I was born,  
and thus to me, this geas is absolute.  
  
**Christina：**  
In this world filled with uncertainties,  
I cannot help but cling to the few things I can be sure of.  
  
**Christina：**  
It is... difficult to explain, and perhaps unlike me,  
but I am scared.  
  
**Christina：**  
My family has always openly sworn to honor our geases without fail.  
If I selfishly choose to break mine, it would shame them all.  
And I've caused my family enough trouble as it is.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Christina：**  
Hmm...  
I don't like that attitude. Are you resigning yourself?  
  
**Christina：**  
I have no wish for a resentful husband.  
If possible, I would like to make you truly desire me.  
Matrimony should be a vow between equals.  
 Wouldn't you say?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Christina：**  
Ah, well.  
 At any rate, to me, this geas is absolute.  
Even if you do not wish it, I must marry you without fail.  
  
**Christina：**  
But while I do take pleasure in dominating others,  
I would prefer to respect your wishes where possible.  
  
**Christina：**  
If you find me lacking as your betrothed, speak your mind.  
I will make an effort to improve.  
  
**Christina：**  
Though there's little I can do if the difference in our ages concerns you.  
I turned 27 this year, while you, I presume, are still in your teens.  
Ordinarily, such a pairing might be out of the question.  
  
**Christina：**  
But alas... For all my abilities, altering my own age is beyond me.  
Even magic can't achieve such a feat.  
The years we have lived through are ours to keep.  
  
**Christina：**  
Still... Though this may be little comfort,  
such gaps are not uncommon among noble houses.  
  
**Christina：**  
For their family, for blood and for honor,  
noble scions are married off as early as possible.  
  
**Christina：**  
Indeed, in my rash and rebellious youth,  
it was to avoid that fate that I originally formed this unbreakable geas.  
  
**Christina：**  
But ah well.  
I know this is very sudden, and you will need time to accept it.  
I cannot wait too long, but I'll leave it at this for today.  
  
**Christina：**  
Starting tomorrow...  
I will do all in my power to secure your hand in marriage,  
so be ready for that.  
  
**Christina：**  
I will \"absolutely\" not hold back.  
Not until the day we make our wedding vows.  
  
**Christina：**  
...Haha.  
Have you ever heard a marriage proposal so lacking in romance?
