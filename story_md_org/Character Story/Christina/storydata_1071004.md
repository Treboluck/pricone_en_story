## Subtitle: A Precious Thirty Minutes
  
**Narration：**  
In accordance with her geas,  
Christina has been visiting {player} day after day  
to seek his hand in marriage.  
  
**Narration：**  
Despite being quite busy with her Nightmare duties,  
she somehow always manages to show up  
just when {player} least expects it.  
  
**Narration：**  
To begin with, she put in plenty of effort to sell herself,  
doing his housework to demonstrate her domestic skills,  
or telling him at length about her storied past.  
  
**Narration：**  
But lately, she has begun to tire of this,  
and her attempts at wooing {player} have become  
more and more half-hearted.  
  
**Narration：**  
Even so, she always makes sure to visit him  
at least once a week.  
  
**Narration：**  
Compared to her usual life in search of conflict and bloodshed,  
these moments with {player} are a calm respite  
that provides her with more comfort than even she expected.  
  
**Christina：**  
I'm coming in.  
How have you been, young lad?  
  
**Christina：**  
Hahah.  
It occurred to me that you may be more interested in younger girls,  
so today I've brought some cute photos from my childhood to show you.  
  
**Christina：**  
I've grown a lot since then, but this is still me, after all.  
Perhaps it will stir some new forms of affection in you...  
 Hmm?  
  
**Christina：**  
It looks as if he's... fast asleep on the sofa?  
  
**Christina：**  
I often come to visit him at this hour,  
so he should by rights have expected my arrival...  
  
**Christina：**  
Where's the fun in mounting an ambushon a completely  
unwitting victim?  
 Though I suppose it at least indicates  
that he's making no efforts to reject me.  
  
**Christina：**  
Still, our progress has been so slow that it begins to grate.  
What cause could he have to hesitate,  
when such a gorgeous bride is his for the taking?  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh...? Now what is this light?  
It reminds me of the glow when {player}  
activates his ability...

**Christina：**  
Hi~! Long time no see!  
Aren't you happy to see your old friend Chris? ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
Wait, huh?  
You, boy. Manning the crepe stand.Can I ask you something?  
  
**Christina：**  
I was expecting to find a woman named Akira here,  
but is she not around?  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm...  
So you're taking care of the stand for her.  
How upstanding of you. I should apologize for my friend's behavior.  
  
**Christina：**  
Still, Akira does have the oddest tastes.  
She must have enough savings to live a life of luxury,  
so why does she insist on running this crummy old crepe stand?  
  
**Christina：**  
I guess she'd say that sitting here and watching the passersby  
gives her some sort of inspiration...  
Should I try it myself sometime and see?  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh, I'm sorry. It's rude of me to loiter here without buying a thing.  
Let's have a nice crepe, then. You can choose the toppings.  
  
**Christina：**  
More to the point, if Akira's left you in charge,  
does that mean you're an associate of hers?  
Hmm... Your face does seem somehow familiar...  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh, no.  
 I didn't mean to pry.  
I should probably introduce myself first.  
  
**Christina：**  
My name is Christina Morgan.  
An American. I'm in charge of a certain large corporation.  
  
**Christina：**  
Our main operations take place back in my homeland,  
but I happen to have some business in this country right now...  
  
**Christina：**  
So I thought I'd take the rare opportunity  
to drop by and greet an old friend.  
  
**Christina：**  
But it seems I arrived at the wrong time.  
I'm fairly sure my information was reliable,  
but I suppose Akira realized I was coming and skedaddled.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmph... That sly old fox.  
So it's true that she's hiding from the Seven Crowns.  
To think she'd even avoid her old friend... That pains me a little.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hand Christina a crepe.  
**Choice: (2)**  Gawp in amazement.  
`Tag 1`  
**Christina：**  
Oh? Already? That was fast.  
Thank you. I'll be sure to savor it.

`Tag 2`  
**Christina：**  
What's that expression for?  
Could it be you've heard of me before?  
  
**Christina：**  
Well, I suppose we all  
did make a name for ourselves with that \"Seven Crowns\" title.  
Perhaps I do qualify as a minor celebrity.  
  
**Christina：**  
And unlike the others who prefer to avoid attention,  
I'm not shy about showing myself.  
Lately, I've been drowning in TV and magazine interviews.  
  
**Christina：**  
It's a boon for a corporation's leader to be in the public eye.  
As you can see, I'm a stunning beauty, so it's easy promotion.  
A little tedious, but ah well. I embrace the ostentatious life.  
  
**Christina：**  
...Hm. That crepe's starting to smoke.  
If it's done, hand it over.

**Christina：**  
Let me dig in.  
*munch munch*  
Hmm... Why is this country's food so bland?  
  
**Christina：**  
I can taste the quality ingredients, though,  
so with a better location and PR, these would probably sell.  
Would you like some tips? I am in that line of business.  
  
**Christina：**  
Well, not that I expect Akira would care a jot.

**Christina：**  
...Oh dear, we're clean out of time.  
I worked hard to free up these thirty minutes in my schedule,  
but they were over in a flash.  
  
**Christina：**  
It's a shame that I couldn't see Akira,  
but ah well, if I log in during work hours,  
I'm sure I can track her down in Legend of Astrum instead.  
  
**Christina：**  
In that undying paradise that we created together.  
  
**Christina：**  
Well then, I should be going.  
Thank you for the diversion, young {player}...  
Adieu! ♪

**Ameth：**  
Aaaand welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Everything you just saw was basically a dream.  
When you wake up, you'll forget it all.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Honestly, I'm getting pretty tired of repeating that every time.  
Maybe I'll make a recording, so I can just sit back and replay it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway. Looks like you'd met the Regina Geas  
\"over there\" as well as \"here,\" huh?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Coincidence? No... I get the feeling meeting you  
was actually one of her goals in coming here.  
After all, she knew your name even though you never said it!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh—\"Regina Geas\" is just another name for Christina.  
All the members of the Seven Crowns  
have been given these fancy titles by the media.

![200700801.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/200700801.webp)  
**Ameth：**  
Christina's the \"Regina Geas,\" and the other six are  
\"Omniscient Kaiser,\" \"Labyrinth Queen,\" \"Metamorph Monarch,\"  
\"Leaping King,\" and... who does that leave?  
  
**Ameth：**  
All of them sound like royalty, don't they?  
That's why together they're referred to as the \"Seven Crowns.\"  
  
**Ameth：**  
They were only supposed to be pretend rulers,  
presiding over the game they created...  
But after the world's reconstruction, the name's no joke.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Those seven people hold absolute power in this world.

**Ameth：**  
For Christina's part, it looks like she's forgotten  
all about her old position.  
But that doesn't make her any less important.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Be very careful how you deal with her.  
She's a ticking bomb.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Still... I'm pretty surprised  
how amiable a relationship you've managed to form.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Myself, I'd like nothing better than if you could keep up  
that peaceful friendship.  
  
**Ameth：**  
In the old world, you were enemies, bitterly opposed,  
and you never were able to resolve your differences.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So it's almost like a miracle that you're walking hand in hand.  
In fact, it's a dream come true.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And marriage?  
 Well, why not?  
I'd be happy to wish you two all the best! ♪  
  
**Ameth：**  
This is all just a fleeting dream...  
So this impossible future, this new life, is for you to enjoy as you wish.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'll see you around, {player}.  
Until our next dream together.

**Christina：**  
...  
  
**Christina：**  
...Mmnhh?  
Just for a moment, I feel like I lost consciousness...  
  
**Christina：**  
In fact... What's this? I'm recalling unfamiliar memories.  
\"Seven Crowns,\" \"Regina Geas,\" \"Numbers Avalon,\"  
the \"Round Table\"...  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah, young lad. Were you and I... enemies in a past life?  
  
**Christina：**  
If that's true... If we are mortal foes...  
Then marriage, a harmonious unity of love,  
really is an impossible dream.  
  
**Christina：**  
That makes me feel... surprisingly sad.  
  
**Christina：**  
Young lad... Are you still fast asleep?  
Without even a blanket? You'll catch your death of cold.  
  
**Christina：**  
Let me rest your head on my lap.  
That should be a little warmer.  
  
**Christina：**  
Whatever our past holds, and whatever our futures...  
Right now, there's nothing to stop us sharing our warmth.
