## Subtitle: The Troublesome Vice-Captain
  
**Christina：**  
Fellow knights of Nightmare!  
This tedium is unbearable! Say something to entertain me!  
  
**Christina：**  
If your words are stimulating, I will see you go rewarded.  
But if you bore me, you will be punished!  
  
**Christina：**  
Removing your heads would create a scarlet fountain  
that might brighten up this dull scene!  
Ahahahahahah! ☆  
  
**Royal Knight A：**  
Here we go again with the vice-captain's wild fancies.  
  
**Royal Knight B：**  
She's old enough to know better,  
so why does she always have these childish outbursts?  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmmm? What was that you said? I'm afraid I didn't quite hear you.  
Could it be that the deathly serious knights of Nightmare  
are actually indulging in a little joke?  
  
**Christina：**  
If so, let's hear it loud and clear!  
Come, now! You'd do well not to test my patience!  
  
**Royal Knight A：**  
N-no...  
W-we didn't say anything, Vice-Captain.  
  
**Royal Knight B：**  
How'd she hear from all the way over there? She's got the devil's ears!  
Heavens save us...  
Better avoid saying anything unnecessary while she's in earshot.  
  
**Christina：**  
What's this?  
 Tell me, why are you gathered around this spot?  
Is there some entertaining diversion?  
Let me see.  
 Hmmmm...?  
  
**Royal Knight A：**  
Ah—careful where you step!  
It looks like this so-called secret society, \"Labyrinth,\"  
didn't take the best care of their hideout!  
  
**Royal Knight B：**  
That's right! We wouldn't want you to trip over on the uneven floor  
and scratch your impeccable skin!  
  
**Royal Knight B：**  
Urnghh...  
Wh-why did you kick me, Vice-Captain?  
  
**Christina：**  
I have little patience for bootlicking.  
Besides, do you think I would trip over like a common fool?  
  
**Royal Knight A：**  
Does *anything* make her happy...?  
Wh-what a royal pain...  
  
**Royal Knight B：**  
Urgh...  
No wonder she's infamous throughout all of Nightmare...  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm...  
How tedious. This place is nothing but an empty den.  
  
**Christina：**  
Tiresome indeed! I agreed to hunt down these Labyrinth scoundrels  
because I thought it might provide a thrilling diversion,  
but they're far too good at running and hiding like vermin.  
  
**Christina：**  
They leave these empty hideouts here and there as decoys,  
while the actual guild members are always long gone.  
  
**Christina：**  
I would have thought even a single hideout of this scale  
would require vast funds and labor to build...  
  
**Christina：**  
Yet they treat them as disposable...  
Just who are these people?  
 I must say it intrigues me.  
  
**Christina：**  
...What's this?  
I see you have a prisoner tied up on the floor!  
  
**Royal Knight A：**  
Ah, yes...  
Actually, we found him loitering not far from this hideout's entrance.  
  
**Royal Knight B：**  
Out in these remote mountains...  
He wasn't responsive to questioning, either, so we took him in  
under suspicion of being associated with Labyrinth somehow.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hohoh.  
Good work! I'll enjoy giving this one a proper interrogation.  
  
**Christina：**  
Tell me, boy... Are you conscious?  
Let's have ourselves a nice little chat! ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Answer honestly.  
**Choice: (2)**  Play dead.  
`Tag 1`  
**Christina：**  
Hahah. You're surprisingly cooperative.  
Looking me in the eye and responding without fear...  
That takes a certain measure of courage.

`Tag 2`  
**Christina：**  
Hmm...  
Just a dead body, is it? How tedious.  
  
**Christina：**  
Knights! Take him and throw him into the ravine.  
A hearty meal for the wild beasts. Kindness to animals is a virtue! ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
...Aha. I heard a squeal.  
A word to the wise: I decide whether you live or die,  
so you should avoid displeasing me if you value your head!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Christina：**  
At any rate...  
Tell me, what's your name?  
What brings you to these lonely mountains?  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm...?  
Hold on. I think I recognize your face.  
  
**Christina：**  
Could you possibly be... the boy named {player}?  
  
**Christina：**  
Her Majesty has quite the interest in you.  
Not long ago, she was scouring the land for information on your whereabouts.  
  
**Christina：**  
How deeply intriguing.  
Our ruler, who has never showed any interest in others,  
was determined to hunt you down by name...  
  
**Christina：**  
Who exactly are you, boy? I'm going to need a full answer.  
Let's talk until you're willing to share, my dear {player}!
