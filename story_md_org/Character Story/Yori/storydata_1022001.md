**???：**  
H-huh?  
It should be around here somewhere...  
  
**???：**  
I'm sure this is where the amazing bargain store is supposed to be...  
But I can't see anything of the sort...  
  
**???：**  
Wh-what do I do now...?  
I don't want to give up after coming all this way...  
  
**???：**  
I could ask someone for directions!  
A-ahh, but, the thought of talking to a complete stranger...!  
  
**???：**  
No... I won't let my bashful nature rule my life!  
Asking for directions can't be that hard!  
  
**???：**  
Oh! Here comes someone now!  
I'll ask if he knows where it is!  
  
**???：**  
H-h... Hello!  
  
**Passerby：**  
Whoa, you scared the heck outta me!  
What do you want?  
  
**???：**  
Ahhhhh! I-I'm so sorry!  
It was so rude of me to surprise you like that!  
My voice came out louder than I expected...  
  
**???：**  
Umm, so... Uhhh... There's a store...  
 Wait, no!  
I need to ask for some...  
 Uhhh... Ahhh...  
  
**???：**  
I-it's very nice to meet you... M-my warmest salutations...  
Wait, what am I even saying?!  
  
**???：**  
Um... Listen... That's not what I...  
What I meant was... Ahhhhh...  
  
**???：**  
A-actually, never mind!  
Forget I said anything!  
  
**???：**  
*sigh*... I messed up big-time...  
All I'm trying to do is ask directions!  
Why do I have to get so nervous?!  
  
**???：**  
L-let's try again!  
This time, I'm going to ask properly!  
  
**???：**  
Here comes another person!  
A-all right, here goes...  
  
**???：**  
Hello!!!  
  
**???：**  
...Ahhhhh!  
I shouted in his face again!  
Why do I keep making the same mistakes?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Did you want something?  
**Choice: (2)**  Wow, that was loud.

Ah... Y-yes!

Are you going to help me?!  
  
Jump to tag 3

I-I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to shout!  
Please forgive me!!!  
...Wait, I just shouted again...

**Yori：**  
Umm... Listen.  
Ahh, my name's Yori, and I...  
 Ahhh, wait, no!  
Why am I introducing myself?!  
  
**Yori：**  
The thing is, uhh... I need... bargain directions...  
  
No, wait! I'm looking for a store, and... ummm...  
  
**Yori：**  
Actually, forget it!  
I'm sorry for bothering you!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Follow her.

Whaaa...?! Is he chasing me?!  
B-but why?  
Leave me alooone!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Follow her.

**Yori：**  
O-oh, come on... Why are you still following me?!  
That does it... I'm gonna sprint!  
  
**Yori：**  
*pant* *pant* *pant*  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Follow her.  
`Tag 6`  
**Yori：**  
He's still on my tail?!  
Hey, listen! What are you playing at?!  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh? You still haven't heard what I wanted?  
You call that a reason?!  
I told you, forget I said anything!  
  
**Yori：**  
Y-you're so stubborn!  
What's the point in being so persistent?!  
  
**Yori：**  
I looked like I needed help...?  
W-well, I guess you're not wrong...  
 But even so, there are limits!  
  
**Yori：**  
I was just trying to ask for directions!  
I'm looking for this cheap bargain store!  
  
**Yori：**  
...Huh?  
Y-you'll show me where it is?  
  
**Yori：**  
Thanks to your help, I managed to buy what I wanted...  
But I've never known anyone as stubborn as you before.  
  
**Yori：**  
The thing is, I'm bad at talking to people...  
Especially when I try to talk to a boy, I get so nervous,  
my words get all tangled up...  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh? I'm talking to you normally now?  
  
**Yori：**  
...Wait, huh? Now that you mention it...!  
You were so persistent back there,  
I guess my irritation drowned out my nerves!  
  
**Yori：**  
N-no, I'm not mad anymore!  
Sure, you were a pain... But you did really help me out.  
  
**Yori：**  
And it looks like I can talk normally once I get over the initial nerves.  
I don't think I've ever talked this much with a boy before...  
  
**Yori：**  
H-hey...  
What's your name, anyway?  
  
**Yori：**  
...I see...  
I-if you don't mind, could we...  
  
**Yori：**  
A-a-a-actually, never mind!  
See you later!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Follow her.  
`Tag 7`  
**Yori：**  
Ehhhh?!  
Why are you chasing me again?!  
  
**Yori：**  
We still weren't done talking...?  
I literally told you \"never mind,\" didn't I?!  
There's persistent, and then there's just ridiculous!  
  
**Narration：**  
Somehow, Yori seemed to have made a new friend.
