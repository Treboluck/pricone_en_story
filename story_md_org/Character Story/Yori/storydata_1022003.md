**Narration：**  
Today, Yori and {player} have come to a meadow  
to complete another of her flower-gathering quests.  
  
**Yori：**  
This should be where the flowers she wanted grow...  
...Hey, listen. I just... wanted to say... Th-thank—  
  
**Yori：**  
...Aaahhhhh, no! I never asked you to come out here with me!  
You just tagged along all on your own!  
  
**Yori：**  
Aaaghhhhh!I did it again!  
Why can't I just thank him?  
  
**Yori：**  
Never mind... I can always say thank you later.  
For now, let's focus on doing what we came here for!  
  
**Yori：**  
Right, so... the flower... Here we go!  
This red flower is the one we're looking for!  
  
**Yori：**  
Its pollen has a nasty sting,  
so make sure to keep it away from your face!  
If you get it in your eyes, they'll be watering for the rest of the day!  
  
**Yori：**  
As for how many we need to collect...  
Well, she said she needed a whole bunch!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'll get lots, then!  
`Tag 1`  
**Yori：**  
Wow, you're really raring to go.  
Then how about we make it a contest?  
  
**Yori：**  
I'm a lot more competitive than I look, you know!  
Games are my hobby, after all!  
  
**Yori：**  
All right, it's a contest!  
And the loser... has to do whatever the winner says! How's that?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  No objections here.  
**Choice: (3)**  Ooh, what should I make her do...?  
`Tag 2`  
**Yori：**  
In it to win it, huh?  
Well, we'll see just how long that confidence lasts!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Yori：**  
Why are you acting like you've won already?!  
You wait and see, I'm not gonna lose!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Yori：**  
The winner is whoever finds the most!  
Ready... go!  
  
**Yori：**  
...  
  
**Yori：**  
I... I can't find them anywhere...  
  
**Yori：**  
The first few were so easy to uncover,  
but somehow I've still only got one handful...  
At this rate, I'll lose for sure...!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Call out to her.  
`Tag 5`  
**Yori：**  
Waaahh?! Wh-what? What do you want?  
...You can't carry any more, so you came to drop them off?!  
  
**Yori：**  
Whaaaat?! That pile you've got... Are those all...?!  
There's... so many...  
  
**Yori：**  
...N-no, no, no... I-is that all you've got?  
I've already found way more than that, of course!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I'll go and find some more.  
`Tag 6`  
**Yori：**  
Ahh... Did I... just get him more fired up...?  
Why do I always have to be like this?!  
  
**Yori：**  
Aaaaghh!  
Wh-what should I do?! If I lose, I have to do anything he says...!  
  
**Yori：**  
Waaaahhhh!  
I should never have suggested this contest!  
...Ahh, but... I can't just back out at this point... Urghh...  
  
**Yori：**  
A-at any rate, I'd better get looking!  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh? Was that a hint of something red...?!  
  
**Yori：**  
...I knew it!  
There's lots of them, too!  
  
**Yori：**  
All right! With this many, I'll win for sure!  
Though there might be more patches like this...  
Better gather them quick and keep searching!

**Monster：**  
Rrrrrghhhhhh!  
  
**Yori：**  
Aaaahhhh! Monsters?!  
And they seem kind of angry?!  
  
**Yori：**  
Y-you don't think...  
The flowers I was just picking were growing from these guys?!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Protect Yori.  
`Tag 7`  
**Yori：**  
{player}...! I-it's too dangerous!  
Even together, we can't handle this many...  
  
**Yori：**  
I'd like to run, but...  
They're all so angry, I'm sure they'll chase right after us...  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh? The flowers you gathered?  
But what are you going to do with...?  
  
**Yori：**  
Ehhhhh?! You threw them at the monsters?!  
That's only going to make them even more angry!  
  
**Monster：**  
Grrrruooghhh!  
  
**Yori：**  
H-huh? It looks like they're hurt...  
How come?  
  
**Yori：**  
Oh! Of course!  
These flowers have eye-stinging properties...!  
  
**Yori：**  
I guess we should run now, huh?  
A-all right! Let's move!  
  
`image display end`  
**Yori：**  
Whew... I think we made it to safety.  
...Oh, but... I left all the flowers I collected behind...  
  
**Yori：**  
Huhhh?!  
You held on to all of yours?!  
  
**Yori：**  
I don't have a single flower... and you've got tons...  
Then that means... you're totally the winner?  
  
**Yori：**  
U-urghhh... Oh, fine then!  
Say whatever you want, and I'll do it!  
  
**Yori：**  
Wh-what is he going to say?  
If he makes me do anything funny...  
Wh-wh-what then?!  
  
**Yori：**  
B-but... I guess if it's him...  
...Wait, what am I even thinking?!  
  
**Yori：**  
...Huh?  
You want to go another round?  
Th-that's all...?  
  
**Yori：**  
...Aaaahhhh...!  
  
**Yori：**  
*sigh*  
Yeah... I should've known...  
That's the kind of guy you are, huh...  
  
**Yori：**  
All right, then!  
But this time, I'm not going to lose!  
  
**Narration：**  
That day, {player} earned himself an upgrade  
from \"persistent airhead\" to \"serious rival\"!
