## Subtitle: Thank You Is the Hardest Word
  
**Narration：**  
Today, {player} is doing some canyon hiking  
in search of rare materials.  
  
**???：**  
Heeeeeelp!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  A voice from up above...?  
`Tag 1`  
**???：**  
Is someone down there?! P-please, you've got to help me!  
I climbed up this cliff, but now I can't get back down!  
And my hand's... slipping...!  
  
**???：**  
Ahhh! It collapsed under—?!  
I-I'm gonna— I'm gonna faaaaall!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Catch her.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yori：**  
Aaaaahhhhh!  
  
**Yori：**  
*thwump*  
  
**Yori：**  
I... I thought I was a goner...  
W-waaaahhh! Thank-you-I'm-so-sorry!  
My deepest apologies for troubling you with my...  
  
**Yori：**  
...Wait... Oh, it's just you.  
Whew... I got all nervous for nothing.  
  
**Yori：**  
What was I doing in a place like that?  
Just a little errand. Fetching materials.  
  
**Yori：**  
Our guildmaster's suffering from a bit of a magic shortage.  
So our whole guild is collecting materials to help her recharge.  
You could call this a sort of guild mission.  
  
**Yori：**  
There's a type of flower that only blooms on this cliff,  
so I was trying to retrieve some,  
but I got myself stuck halfway up...  
  
**Yori：**  
Wh-what's with the angry face...?  
...It's dangerous to go alone?  
You're actually worrying about me, huh...  
  
**Yori：**  
Well, of course I'm quite aware it's dangerous!  
But... Well... Ummm... The thing is...  
  
**Yori：**  
I didn't have anyone I could ask to come with me!  
Is that so wrong?!  
  
**Yori：**  
Normally my sister comes with me on these quests,  
but today she had something else to do...  
  
**Yori：**  
And I don't have anyone else I can turn to...  
If I asked someone, I'm sure they'd just think I'm too pushy...  
  
**Yori：**  
...  
  
**Yori：**  
*sigh*  
I'm sure my sister would know just what to do at times like this...  
  
**Yori：**  
You see, my sister can make friends with anyone, just like that.  
She's so bubbly and popular...  
It makes me kind of jealous...  
  
**Yori：**  
I've always wished I could become  
more like her myself, but...  
Talking to people is just too hard...  
  
**Yori：**  
That's why I'm hoping when our guildmaster's all recharged  
and back to her full strength,  
she might be able to cast a spell to cure my shyness...  
  
**Yori：**  
I mean, look at me. Coming out here all on my own  
because I didn't have any friends to help me...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You've got me.  
**Choice: (4)**  Am I that useless?  
`Tag 3`  
**Yori：**  
H-huhhh?! You mean I should rely on...  
Wh-where'd you pull that cool line out from—  
  
**Yori：**  
Wait, no!  
That definitely didn't sound cool or anything!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Yori：**  
Huh? I-I didn't mean to say  
I can't rely on you or anything...  
  
**Yori：**  
Sure, you're a bit loopy, but you're always helpful...  
And you might be an airhead, but you're really dedicated...  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Yori：**  
If you're trying to say you'd like to help...  
Th-that doesn't make me super happy or anything!  
  
**Yori：**  
B-but... Umm...  
Are you sure that would... be okay?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Sure, I'll help.  
`Tag 6`  
**Yori：**  
Really?!  
Well, um... Th... Thank y...  
  
**Yori：**  
...H-hmph!  
If you really insist, I guess I'll let you help out!  
  
**Narration：**  
Yori got so embarrassed, she couldn't bring herself to say \"thank you.\"
