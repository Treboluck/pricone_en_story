# Yori Episode 6
Encouraged by the realization that she's able to talk to {player} normally, Yori starts to think that there's no need to cure her shyness after all. But when she sees her sister Akari getting all friendly with {player}, she quickly changes her mind.
  
## Subtitle: Maybe Someday...
  
**Narration：**  
Yori and {player} are running away  
from a ravenous monster.  
  
**Monster：**  
RRRAAAAGGGHH!  
  
**Yori：**  
Aaaaaghhhh!  
Why are there monsters here?!  
  
**Yori：**  
This is all your fault, you know!  
\"Let's see who can find the most four-leaf clovers,\" he says!  
In a dangerous place like this?!  
  
**Yori：**  
Huh? You had no idea there were monsters  
around here either?  
  
**Yori：**  
Oh, well...  
I guess I can't blame you then...  
  
**Monster：**  
RRRAAAAGGGHH!  
  
**Yori：**  
Wait...  Forget whose fault it is!  
We need to do something about this monster!  
  
**Yori：**  
Come on, let's run for it!  
I'm sure it won't follow us into the city!  
  
**Yori：**  
I know! Instead of a clover hunt, let's have a race!  
Whoever makes it to the city first wins!  
Ready... go!  
  
**Yori：**  
...  
  
**Yori：**  
*pant* *pant*...  
All right! That's a win for me!  
  
**Yori：**  
Whew, I'm so pooped...  
I never thought we'd run into such strong monsters...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It was fun, though.  
**Choice: (2)**  Sorry...  
`Tag 1`  
**Yori：**  
Haha... Well, I guess.  
My heart leapt into my throat, but it *was* pretty exciting.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Yori：**  
No, don't apologize!  
It wasn't your fault, was it?  
You didn't mean to find any monsters!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Yori：**  
Still, after all that running, I'm pretty thirsty...  
I'm kind of hungry too, so shall we get a meal somewhere?  
  
**Yori：**  
Great! I know a cafe just around the corner,  
so let's go there!  
  
**Yori：**  
...  
  
**Yori：**  
Wait, huh?! Me and {player},  
getting a meal together...?  
 Isn't that like a date?!  
  
**Yori：**  
No no, wait, forget that!  
I only just realized this, but...  
Have I been talking to him totally normally?!  
  
**Yori：**  
Usually I always get embarrassed and freeze up a lot...  
But I don't think I've done that once today!  
  
**Yori：**  
And actually, I don't think I've caught myself  
getting all jealous of Akari lately, either!  
  
**Yori：**  
...Huh? What am I talking about?  
Oh no! Did I say that out loud?!  
  
**Yori：**  
I mean, it's no big deal really...  
You know my sister, she's got tons of friends...  
And I always kind of envied her that...  
  
**Yori：**  
But now, I have lots of fun talking to you!  
Okay, maybe I still can't talk to anyone else...  
But as long as I have you to hang out with, I'm not sure I mind!  
  
**Yori：**  
Maybe I don't even need to ask Illya  
for a cure for my crippling shyness after all...  
  
**Akari：**  
Ooh, {player}! There you are!  
Honestly, I've been looking everywhere!  
  
**Yori：**  
Akari?!  
  
**Akari：**  
Oh, you were hanging out with my sister?  
Well then, now you can come with me  
and I'll show you a really good time!  
  
**Akari：**  
Eheh! I'm just kidding!  
Ahaha... Look at you going all red! That's so cute!  
  
**Yori：**  
Wh... Wh... What the heck?!  
Why are these two all flirty?!  
  
**Yori：**  
H... Hey!  
I'll have you know he was just about to go have dinner with me!  
  
**Akari：**  
Oh, is that right?  
...Wait, huh? That's a bit weird.  
Don't you hate hanging out with {player}?  
  
**Akari：**  
'Cause at home, you're always complaining about him, right?  
Why would you want to go out for a meal with him?  
  
**Yori：**  
Y-you've got it all wrong!  
I don't, um... I mean, he's...  
  
**Yori：**  
He's, uh... You know... I mean, I...  
...  
  
**Yori：**  
Urghhh! Why am I freezing up now?!  
I was talking to him normally a minute ago!  
  
**Yori：**  
Aa... aahhh... Aaahh...  
  
**Akari：**  
Huh?! Is something wrong, sis?!  
Wh-why are you crying?!  
  
**Yori：**  
No, it's... *sniff*...  
nothing really... Aaahh...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Pat her on the head.  
`Tag 4`  
**Yori：**  
H-hey! What's that for...?  
Do I look like a child to you?!  
  
**Yori：**  
...Aaahhh...!  
  
**Yori：**  
I really have gotta cure this shyness after all...  
You wait. I'm gonna complete even more guild quests!  
  
**Yori：**  
I'll grant my wish, and then...  
Then I'll tell {player} exactly how I really feel!  
  
**Narration：**  
Yori gained a renewed passion for her guild's activities,  
but she still had no idea that her fellow guild members  
also had their eyes on {player}...
