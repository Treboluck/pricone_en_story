**Narration：**  
Maho is patrolling the roads outside the city.  
Coincidentally enough, she runs into {player},  
who has also accepted the same job.  
  
**Maho：**  
Miracle Mahorin, with a twinkle and a twirl... ☆  
  
**Maho：**  
Hehe. It's ever so lovely that we can work together, my prince.  
Looks like destiny won't let us stay apart! ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh... I shouldn't get carried away.  
First, I've gotta inspect the road's condition.  
  
**Maho：**  
My prince, don't those rocks look unsafe?  
We wouldn't want kids trippin', so let's pick them up.  
  
**Maho：**  
The road's a little worn out over here.  
Communication magic isn't my specialty,  
but I should report this to have it fixed right away.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're really going all out!  
`Tag 1`  
**Maho：**  
I can't stay the same old me forever!  
Be it magic or my work,  
I'm always tryin' to improve! ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
So, um, for communication magic,  
first I specify the coordinates, then...  
What was the next step?  
  
**Maho：**  
D-don't you worry!  
Lately, Kasumi's been givin' me lessons,  
and I've been studyin' proper spells from scratch, too!  
  
**Maho：**  
First, I build up magical energy...  
Wait, huh?  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Maho：**  
A monster ambush in a place like this?  
Looks like my search magic had some holes...  
Anyway, leave this to me!  
  
**Maho：**  
Umm... the key to proper attack magic  
is to not release all the power at once,  
but control it carefully...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Maho：**  
Huh? Waahhh?!  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh—my prince!  
Thank you for protectin' me! ♪  
  
**Choice: (2)**  No \"Twinkle twinkle hoy! ♪\" today?  
`Tag 2`  
**Maho：**  
I... I won't be needing that ol' spell!  
Don't you worry, my prince! ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
I'll make sure it works this time.  
Um... First I build up power, then control it properly...  
  
**Maho：**  
Ohhh...? I messed it up again.  
Now I've gotta start over...  
  
**Maho：**  
...Huh? My prince?  
Why're you movin' in all close to me like that?  
  
**Maho：**  
We should run...?  
But the monster's still...  
Waaahhh?!  
  
**Maho：**  
...Well, we've sure come a long way from the road.  
  
**Maho：**  
It's gettin' dark, so I guess we oughtta hurry.  
The monster...  
still seems to be pretty close by.  
  
**Maho：**  
It's gonna be okay, my prince! ♪  
I know it didn't work out before, but this time I'll do better...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You should just use your usual magic.  
`Tag 3`  
**Maho：**  
...N-no, I can't!  
  
**Maho：**  
Ah...  
I-I beg your pardon, my prince.  
I shouldn't have raised my voice...  
  
**Maho：**  
But... I really can't use my usual magic.  
  
**Maho：**  
I've gotta use the magic I've been studyin'.  
Otherwise, I can't prove that I've been workin' hard...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Why's that so important?  
`Tag 4`  
**Maho：**  
...When I went back home,  
I told my father what I've been thinkin', and how I truly feel inside.  
  
**Maho：**  
All the experiences I've had bein' a guildmaster...  
How I love the gals so much, it makes the hours seem like seconds...  
And how I've  
met you, my prince…  
  
**Maho：**  
My father seemed so happy to hear it all.  
\"You've been workin' so hard,\" he said, and then he told me this.  
  
**Maho：**  
\"Don't worry about our shop for now.  
Just go ahead and follow your heart.\"  
  
**Maho：**  
I was so happy to hear that...  
Even though I oughtta be workin' to take over from my parents...  
  
**Maho：**  
But that's exactly why I've gotta live up to my father's trust.  
To work hard at magic, at my guild work, at everything...!  
  
**Maho：**  
First, let's go find that monster,  
then use the magic I studied to...  
Wahhh?!  
  
**Maho：**  
M-m-m-my prince?  
Wh-why're you suddenly holdin' my hand...?  
I-it's real nice, but we've gotta go find the monster…  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Let's work hard together.  
`Tag 5`  
**Maho：**  
Huh...?!  
  
**Maho：**  
B-but I'm a guildmaster,  
so I've gotta to be able to do it all on my own...  
  
**Maho：**  
B-besides, you know I'm a silly ol' princess.  
If you treat me too kind, I'll only end up relyin' on you.  
But if... if you really don't mind...  
  
**Maho：**

**Maho：**  
There's our ol' friend the monster.  
My prince, will you lend me your power?  
  
**Maho：**  
I'm right as rain now, so don't you worry.

...No matter what,  
you try to help people with that kind heart o' yours,

**Maho：**  
We really managed to defeat it...  
But I might've used a bit too much power...  
Ah...  
  
**Maho：**  
My prince...  
Thanks for catchin' me in your arms...  
But it might just be too late for me...

You can put me down now.

I know I'm a silly spoiled princess, awful at fancy magic,
