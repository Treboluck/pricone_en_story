**Maho：**  
Hey!  
My prince! ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh, it's the real deal!  
I'd been wantin' to see you all day,  
so part of me thought I might've just conjured up an image of you.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hehe.  
Yeah. Good to see you too. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Surprised I ran into you here, though.  
What're you up to?  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh?  
Procuring food for dinner?  
  
**Maho：**  
You do have that there fishing set, now that you mention it.  
Oh, my prince. You and your survival instincts. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
You'd have all the meals and nap time you wanted  
if you hopped along to our guildhouse.  
All you have to do is ask. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Then again, some of gals might not be best pleased  
if someone who ain't beastfolk kept comin' around often.  
  
**Maho：**  
Things can still be a li'l bit awkward  
between races right now, can't they?  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh well, though. We just gotta keep at it.  
Them walls'll get broken down one day.  
I just know it. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm?  
Oh, right. I'm here for Caon-related work.  
  
**Maho：**  
More specifically, we're helpin' out at another  
beastfolk guild's beachside store.  
  
**Maho：**  
Yeah.  
They're not a part of Caon,  
specifically.  
  
**Maho：**  
Most beastfolk do belong to  
the Menagerie in some form or another, though.  
  
**Maho：**  
Connections stem from all over, basically.  
Sometimes we all meet up,  
sometimes we help out with each other's work.  
  
**Maho：**  
That's what's goin' on today.  
The Menagerie was made by beastfolk for beastfolk,  
so it only makes sense that we help each other out.  
  
**Maho：**  
Even Caon gets outside help from other guilds sometimes.  
Give and take, as they say.  
  
**Maho：**  
That said.  
Helpin' out at this store's provin' to be awfully exhausting.  
More so 'cause I don't do so well out in the sun.  
  
**Maho：**  
All the other gals told me to get some rest,  
so here I am. Findin' shelter in the shade.  
  
**Maho：**  
I feel bad, though.  
I'm gonna have to get a li'l bit more stamina in me.  
  
**Maho：**  
Lots of mighty strong gals among us beastfolk.  
Meanwhile, I just hold everyone back.  
  
**Maho：**  
Pretty sure I ended up like this  
'cause of my sheltered upbringing.  
Pathetic, really.  
  
**Maho：**  
I'm a li'l bit jealous of them all, to be honest.  
And you as well, of course. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Waugh...  
I think you're shining again, my prince.  
  
**Maho：**  
Gosh. It's so bright.  
Even brighter than the sunlight here. ♪

**Maho：**  
Oh, if it ain't my prince.  
What a coincidence! ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Take it you're on a li'l stroll, too?  
Weather sure is perfect for it.  
  
**Maho：**  
I didn't wanna waste away in my room during the weekend.  
Figured I'd go have a peek at the park on the outskirts of town.  
  
**Maho：**  
Did you have any plans?  
If not, then how about you join me?  
  
**Maho：**  
There's a real pretty lake there.  
They even have li'l boats for people to hop on. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh?  
You're more than happy to?  
Great! Let's be on our merry way, then. ♪

**Maho：**  
Gosh.  
This breeze is so nice. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
I'm surprised it ain't more busy.  
That just makes it more romantic, though.  
Ehehe. Feels like I'm livin' in a fairy tale. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Thanks for rowing the boat for us.  
I can take over if you start to feel tired.  
Last thing I want is to make you do all the work.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Don't worry. It's plenty fun.  
**Choice: (2)**  Naught but a simple task, my princess.  
`Tag 1`  
**Maho：**  
You do look like you're enjoyin' it, yeah.  
  
**Maho：**  
You really do have those moments  
of childlike excitement, don't you?  
  
**Maho：**  
Not that I mind.  
You're mighty cute when you do. ♪  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Maho：**  
Gosh!  
Someone's excited to play the role.  
  
**Maho：**  
Did all the physical exertion get you worked up?  
I love it, though. You're so bold and cute. ♪  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Maho：**  
Wah!  
  
**Maho：**  
That gave me an awful fright.  
Didn't think we'd bump into someone else's boat.  
Sorry about that.  
  
**Maho：**  
There's a lot more boats around now, too.  
  
**Maho：**  
Careful now, my prince.  
Last thing we want is to be capsized.  
Especially 'cause I can't swim.  
  
**Maho：**  
W-waugh!  
We sure are bumpin' into a lot more now.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm?  
You're sorry for not rowing properly?  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh, please.  
Ain't no need for you to apologize. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
You're puttin' all this effort in for little ol' me.  
How could I not be happy to have such a wonderful prince? ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Ehehe.  
Nothin' but couples in all the other boats, too.  
  
**Maho：**  
Wonder if that's how they all see us, too?  
  
**Maho：**  
Lotsa people do this on dates, after all.  
I remember a certain movie from long ago...  
  
**Maho：**  
A prince and princess that eloped together shared  
a kiss on a boat.  
  
**Maho：**  
I always wanted that sorta experience myself. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
My prince... ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Hey there. Don't be movin' about now.  
What's got you in such a panic?  
  
**Maho：**  
I just wanted to get a li'l bit of dirt off your face.  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh. You thought I was makin' a move, didn't ya?  
Heh. Li'l cheeky boy. ♪

**Ameth：**  
And that's that. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Really now.  
You two still play the prince and princess  
roles even on the \"other side,\" huh?  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's a bit strange if I'm being honest, but hey.  
So long as you're both happy.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Only issue is that your amnesia gets in the way compared  
to your \"previous\" self.  
You're a bit more... stoic, I guess?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Not to imply that one or the other is better, of course.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway.  
You're acting all prince-like,  
just the way she wants it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I guess that's fine enough on its own.  
A person's fantasies become reality when  
someone else wholeheartedly accepts them.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Not bad, {player}  
You're even making me a little bit happy.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I can only imagine how nice it must be  
to share the same experiences and sights as someone else.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ah, man.  
I sure wouldn't mind if a dashing prince  
came along to swoop me off my feet. ♪  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oops.  
Listen to me getting all romantic.  
Think I let Maho influence me a bit too much.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I've got things I need to do.  
I can't forget that.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway.  
My work here's going pretty smoothly,  
so just leave things to me.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Life's bad enough as it is, so you focus on getting through that.  
Don't be afraid to retreat into your dreams and fantasies sometimes either, though.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Be the cool, dashing prince Maho wants you to be.  
Show us that you can overcome the cruel fate you've been dealt.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, that's enough for today.  
Bye-bye! See you around!

**Maho：**  
My prince?  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh, there we go.  
Help a gal out if you're awake.  
Somethin's been pullin' on your rod with a mighty vigor.  
  
**Maho：**  
Doubt you want it to go flyin' into the sea,  
so I've been keepin' a hold of it.  
  
**Maho：**  
You know, I ain't exactly strong, though.  
My arms are about ready to give in.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm?  
Ahaha. No need to apologize.  
You ain't done anythin' wrong.  
  
**Maho：**  
Must be awfully tired if you fell asleep while standing, though.  
You deserve a rest.  
  
**Maho：**  
Mind if I ask what sorta dream you had, though?  
Sure seemed like an awfully fun one, at least.  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh?  
I was in it?  
  
**Maho：**  
Ehehe...  
Now that makes me real happy.  
I have plenty of dreams about you, too.  
  
**Maho：**  
Always together, even in our dreams.  
Can't think of anythin' more fulfilling than that. ♪
