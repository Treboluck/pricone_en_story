**Maho：**  
Look, my prince.  
The stars are all shinin' bright now.  
  
**Maho：**  
Crystal Mountain's all lit up nice and pretty  
thanks to the light from the moon and stars. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
It's so lovely. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Hey, my prince.  
It's a li'l bit lonely if I'm just talkin' to myself.  
  
**Maho：**  
Aww.  
Ready to doze off now, are we?  
You'll never wake up again, though, so don't.  
  
**Maho：**  
Crystal Mountain's one of those mighty cold areas.  
Lemme fix up a li'l spell to keep you nice and warm.  
  
**Maho：**  
Miracle Mahorin,  
twinkle twinkle hoy! ☆  
  
**Maho：**  
Yay. That went well.  
Got a feelin' that being around you  
makes me a lot better at using magic.  
  
**Maho：**  
But, well...  
I reckon there's still a 50% chance it won't go the way I was hopin'.  
  
**Maho：**  
How're you feelin', though?  
Nice and warm?  
  
**Maho：**  
Lovely. That's what I was hopin' for.  
Mighty lucky it went well, though.  
Otherwise you'd have exploded from the inside.  
  
**Maho：**  
No need to worry about that now, though.  
And lookie. I even made us a li'l fire.  
  
**Maho：**  
Come sit over here, my prince.  
  
**Maho：**  
We can get all snug and warm together.  
Snuggy-snuggy... ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Thanks.  
**Choice: (2)**  You're awfully calm, Maho.  
`Tag 1`  
**Maho：**  
Ehehe.  
No need for thanks, now.  
  
**Maho：**  
It's my fault that we got flung outta  
the carriage in the first place.  
  
**Maho：**  
Now it's my job to make sure I get you back  
home safe and sound.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Maho：**  
Oh, prince of mine.  
Don't just be referrin' to me like that.  
I'd love it if you called me \"Princess Maho.\"  
  
**Maho：**  
Is this your way of pickin'  
with me, mayhaps?  
  
**Maho：**  
That said, though,  
I probably should be panickin' a li'l bit more.  
  
**Maho：**  
But this is just how I am, you know?  
If anything, this all feels like a fun picnic to me. ♪  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Maho：**  
Oh...?  
Ehehe.  
My communication magic finally got through. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Yup.  
We can't just be sittin' around here forever,  
so I've been using magic to get in touch with Caon.  
  
**Maho：**  
Reckon they'd be awfully worried about me, too.  
  
**Maho：**  
Wasn't exactly the easiest thing in the world to do  
when I didn't know their locations.  
  
**Maho：**  
You hafta do all sorts of calculations and stuff to find coordinates.  
It's a real hassle.  
  
**Maho：**  
But anyway. Seems like they're gonna come and get us outta here.  
Won't be long until we're home free now, my prince. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Plenty's come back to me about what happened, too.  
  
**Maho：**  
Far as I can remember, bandits broke into the museum  
that hired us. That's how we ended up gettin' kidnapped.  
  
**Maho：**  
Ain't got a clue if they were plannin' on sellin' us off or not,  
but they tied us up  
 and threw us on  
that there carriage.  
  
**Maho：**  
On the bright side,  
we managed to escape before the worst could happen.  
  
**Maho：**  
What's more,  
the rest of Caon noticed I was missin'  
and got real worried.  
  
**Maho：**  
They decided to trace my scent and lingering magic  
without missin' a beat.  
  
**Maho：**  
And doin' that took them right to the bandits' hideout.  
Which they wiped out in an instant.  
  
**Maho：**  
I'm a li'l bit worried about the bandits, to be honest.  
Those gals wouldn't know restraint if it hit 'em upside the head.  
  
**Maho：**  
Gettin' the stolen goods back would've been good enough,  
but they went and dealt with the culprits as well.  
  
**Maho：**  
A mighty fine result for Caon, if ya ask me.  
  
**Maho：**  
See? I told you we just gotta be nice and patient.  
Everythin' got sorted, and we didn't even hafta do anything.  
  
**Maho：**  
That's how it usually goes. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
All the issues get resolved.  
Everyone lives happily ever after.  
Just like in them fairy tales. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm...  
Now that I think about it,  
were you there to visit the museum?  
  
**Maho：**  
It's free,  so that makes sense.  
Seems like the perfect place to pass some time.  
  
**Maho：**  
What's that?  
You've got amnesia?  
  
**Maho：**  
And that's why you were at the museum?  
'Cause you figured that goin' around lookin' at old stuff might  
trigger your memories?  
  
**Maho：**  
Well then.  
You ain't got it easy, do you?  
Poor li'l thing.  
  
**Maho：**  
Wish I could do somethin' to help out,  
but even magic can't solve everythin'.  
  
**Maho：**  
Actually.  
You were just there mindin' your own business...  
  
**Maho：**  
But you still got caught up in all this mess.  
  
**Maho：**  
This never woulda happened if I'd kept my wits about me.  
I shoulda chased those bandits off quick.  
  
**Maho：**  
Now I feel real guilty.  
Keepin' people safe is meant to be  
Caon's job, but here we are.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm?  
You're sorry as well? How come?  
You ain't got nothin' to apologize for...  
  
**Maho：**  
You saw those bandits gettin' ready to kidnap me,  
so you jumped in to try and stop them?  
  
**Maho：**  
But you fell short and ended up gettin' yourself caught, too?  
  
**Maho：**  
Well then.  
You really are the prince I thought you were. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Just the fact that you tried to save me  
makes me real happy, you know.  
  
**Maho：**  
Things don't always go as well in real life as they do in fairy tales,  
but that's fine. We just hafta learn and grow.  
  
**Maho：**  
If we do that, then we'll have a nice, happy ending waitin' for us. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Let's become better, stronger people.  
Together.  
  
**Maho：**  
Then you'll get your chance to protect me for real.  
  
**Maho：**  
As for me...  
I'll make sure I become the sorta princess  
that's worth puttin' your life on the line for in the first place. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh, those voices sound mighty familiar.  
Seems like our escort's here, my prince.  
  
**Maho：**  
My prince...?  
Aww. Fell asleep, did we?  
  
**Maho：**  
Don't worry. I'll keep you warm and snug.  
  
**Maho：**  
See? Nice and warm.  
Good li'l boy.  
  
**Maho：**  
I really mean it, too. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Ahaha.  
All's well that ends well, I guess.  
  
**Maho：**  
Another happy ending for Princess Maho. ♪
