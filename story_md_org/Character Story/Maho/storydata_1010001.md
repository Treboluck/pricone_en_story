**Maho：**  
Zzz... Zzz... ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Urgh.  
Hey there. Don't be shaking me about.  
I'm havin' myself a nice li'l nap here...  
  
**Maho：**  
*yawn* Phew! ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh.  
Good mornin' to ya. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm?  
And who might you be?  
  
**Maho：**  
Ah. Pardon me.  
My accent's a li'l bit thick,  
ain't it?  
  
**Maho：**  
Plenty of folk tell me it's hard to understand.  
Believe it or not, though, it's the official language of an awfully old beastfolk kingdom.  
  
**Maho：**  
It ain't used that much  
elsewhere these days, alas...  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh well, though.  
We've still got our tradition.  
Can't be ignorin' that, what with me being a princess and all. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm...?  
That's odd.  
I'm havin' a little trouble moving here.  
  
**Maho：**  
Mighty dark in here too,  
but I assume we're on a carriage?  
  
**Maho：**  
And if that be the case,  
then someone's fixin' to take us somewhere.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hey...  
Is it just me, or am I all tied up?  
Talk about strange. The rope's diggin' in real right, too. It's awfully sore.  
  
**Maho：**  
Well I'll be.  
You're all tied up too!  
Poor li'l thing, you.  
  
**Maho：**  
That begs the question, though.  
How did we end up here in the first place?  
You wouldn't happen to know, would you?  
  
**Maho：**  
If anything, I reckon some dastardly devil's gone and kidnapped me.  
Just couldn't keep his hands off a princess like me.  
  
**Maho：**  
That, or a real mean queen from over yonder  
is lookin' to have me erased for good.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hehe.  
I love me a good fairy tale,  
but now it feels like I'm livin' in one. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
How about you, though?  
If you're all tied up like me, then you hafta to be some sorta prince.  
  
**Maho：**  
That, or you're a dashing knight that  
got caught while tryin' to save me.  
  
**Maho：**  
Poor li'l fella...  
Givin' your life to save your dear princess,  
only to fall short and get yourself caught as well.  
  
**Maho：**  
Makes me real happy that you'd go that far for li'l old me, though. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Ain't no need to worry, though.  
  
**Maho：**  
The princess and her prince go through all kinda  
ordeals in fairy tales.  
  
**Maho：**  
At the end of the day, though,  
they come out the other end and get  
their happily ever after endin'.  
  
**Maho：**  
So yeah.  
We just gotta be nice and patient.  
  
**Maho：**  
I'm feelin' mighty tired too, if I'm being honest.  
Think it's time to pay a li'l visit to the land o' nod.  
  
**Maho：**  
Good night, dear prince. ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I need you here in the land o' sol.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm no prince.  
`Tag 1`  
**Maho：**  
Mmm...  
Fine, fine.  
No need to shake me.  
  
**Maho：**  
The carriage is leavin' me all motion sick as it is.  
I might have a li'l accident if you keep it up.

`Tag 2`  
**Maho：**  
Oh, gosh.  
I didn't notice before, but you're a real looker, ain't you?  
  
**Maho：**  
Maybe you really are the prince of some far-off land.  
You just don't know it.  
  
**Maho：**  
I reckon that's the case, at least.  
Trust a mage's instinct on this one, dear prince.  
  
**Maho：**  
Right now we're just a gal and a guy  
gettin' carted off to who knows where.  
But hey. We might be more special than we think.  
  
**Maho：**  
We could've been anything in our past lives.  
Including a prince and a princess.  
  
**Maho：**  
Just neither of us remember it now. ♪  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Maho：**  
Hehe.  
Mind turnin' around for me,  
dear prince?  
  
**Maho：**  
Figured.  
Those ropes are diggin' in real hard, ain't they?  
Want me to use a li'l bit of magic to ease the pain?  
  
**Maho：**  
I ain't exactly a pro at healin' magic,  
but I can do that much, at least.  
  
**Maho：**  
What's that?  
I should just cut the ropes with magic so we can escape?  
  
**Maho：**  
Gosh! You've got a good noggin' on those shoulders.  
Quick, simple and effective.  
Never woulda thought of it myself  
  
**Maho：**  
That said.  
I'm... a li'l bit of a klutz when it comes to controllin' my output.  
  
**Maho：**  
Worst case scenario,  
I could end up wipin' you out without a trace.  
And that'd be awfully rude now, wouldn't it?  
  
**Maho：**  
No point in giving in before trying?  
Gosh. That's a mighty brave and cool thing to say.  
You know the way into my heart, don't you?  
  
**Maho：**  
Startin' to get the feelin' that you might be  
the prince I was destined to be with. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Ehehe.  
And if that's the case, then you're sure to live through this.  
  
**Maho：**  
I'll make this work.  
Then we can escape together, hand in hand. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Okie-dokie!  
Let's get this done nice and quick. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Miracle Mahorin,  
twinkle twinkle hoy! ☆
