**Maho：**  
Oh! If it ain't my prince! ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
You remember li'l old Princess Maho, right?  
Mighty pleased to see you again, my prince. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Waugh?!  
  
**Maho：**  
Owwie...  
I forgot the road was all bumpy 'round these parts.  
  
**Maho：**  
Gotta keep my eyes peeled.  
Otherwise I'll trip over like that, hehe. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh. Don't worry,  
I'm fine.  
  
**Maho：**  
I'd hate to get these here lovely clothes all dirty,  
so I always cast protective magic on them.  
  
**Maho：**  
It's supposed to just keep the dirt away,  
but it ends up protecting me a li'l bit from physical impact and the like.  
  
**Maho：**  
Not sure why, but hey.  
It's nice and handy. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Truth is, I've never been taught how to use magic properly.  
Everythin' I know is from self-study and research,  
which ended up with me learnin' all sorts of weird spells.  
  
**Maho：**  
All the basics, though? They go right over my head.  
Ain't a mage on this continent as lopsided as me.  
  
**Maho：**  
Li'l bit embarrassing to admit. Ehehe. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
More importantly.  
What brings you 'round here, my prince?  
  
**Maho：**  
These parts ain't exactly safe these days.  
Wanderin' around like that can make you an easy target.  
  
**Maho：**  
But that's why we're here.  
Caon, keepin' the streets safe, one day at a time.  
  
**Maho：**  
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't mighty tired right now,  
but at least everyone else can shake me awake  
if I end up passing... out...?  
  
**Maho：**  
Huh?  
Well, I'll be. Where'd everyone else run off to?  
Got any clues, my prince?  
  
**Maho：**  
Hehe.  
That was a silly question, wasn't it? ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
This ain't good, though. Got myself lost again.  
I hafta stop spacing out whenever I'm on a walk.  
  
**Maho：**  
Well, it could be worse. I'm still on my home turf,  
so gettin' home won't be an issue.  
Won't stop everyone else from worrying about me, though.  
  
**Maho：**  
This stinks.  
Why am I always like this?  
  
**Maho：**  
I even got you involved in all that  
kidnapping malarkey not that long ago, too.  
  
**Maho：**  
Again, I'm awfully sorry for that.  
I promise I'll make it up to you soon. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Well, I'll be.  
Lookit you, my prince.  
You're all nice and shiny.  
  
**Maho：**  
It's real pretty, but maybe a li'l bit too bright. ♪  
  

---  
  
**Maho：**  
Well, if it ain't my darlin' prince.  
Good day. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Been a li'l while since we met offline.  
How've you been?  
I take it you're heading home from school?  
  
**Maho：**  
*squee* Lookit you in your uniform! ♪  
Almost mistook you for a dashing knight, I did. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Me? My school's awful lenient.  
Today's one of those days where classes end early.  
  
**Maho：**  
Wrapped up in the mornin',  
so I've just been strollin' about to kill time. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Which brought me here.  
Have a gander at this.  
Do you know what it is?  
  
**Maho：**  
I sure don't.  
But there's so much cute li'l stuff in it.  
All nice and shiny, too. So pretty. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Never thought I'd find a treasure  
trove of magic 'round these parts. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh? It's called a \"claw crane?\"  
Well, I'll be.  
Didn't realize they were givin' names to treasure chests now.  
  
**Maho：**  
You're saying I'll be able to  
save all these adorable li'l dolls if I can unlock it?  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh ho...  
So this is the place I've been hearing so much about.  
  
**Maho：**  
The magical wonderland of hopes and dreams.  
A paradise full of fun for all.  
In other words, an arcade! ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
This is my first time at one.  
I'm never usually 'round these parts,  
and there ain't any near my school.  
  
**Maho：**  
Goin' on li'l adventures like this sure can be worth it.  
Never thought I'd get myself mixed up in a lovely new story like this. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
I even got to see you again in the middle of it. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Hey, hey.  
I wanna give this here claw crane a try.  
Do you know how to work it?  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm.  
You'd love to show a gal how to go about it?  
Thanks a bunch. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
First you put a coin in it.  
...Gosh!  
That's an awfully loud noise.  
  
**Maho：**  
Okay. And then you hit that button?  
Wow.  
This is some real magic. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh. Would you mind saving  
that doggo over there for me?  
  
**Maho：**  
Poor li'l thing's surrounded by nothin' but cats.  
We oughtta bring it into our care. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Gosh, you're so good at this.  
Keep it up! I've got your back! ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh. Oh... It fell back in.  
Guess we couldn't save it...  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm.  
This claw crane must be an awfully challenging trial if  
even my prince can't conquer it.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Try again.  
**Choice: (2)**  Let Maho have a shot.  
`Tag 1`  
**Maho：**  
Oh? Goin' for it again?  
Now that's my prince. Never givin' up, no matter the circumstances.  
  
**Maho：**  
If anyone can save that li'l doggo, it's you. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Good luck.  
I believe in you. ♪  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Maho：**  
Huh?  
You want me to do it?  
  
**Maho：**  
I dunno if I can...  
You know how much of a klutz I can be.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm. But I can't just abandon the doggo...  
  
Okay.  
I'll do it.  
  
**Maho：**  
I'll need all your support too, my prince. ♪  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Maho：**  
Ahh! Whoa!  
Ohh...? Well, it fell into that there hole.  
  
**Maho：**  
Wh-what does that mean?  
Oh. I was able to save it?  
  
**Maho：**  
Thank goodness. That's a relief.  
Welcome to our lovely world, you lovely li'l thing. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm?  
You want me to have it?  
That makes me mighty happy, but are you sure?  
  
**Maho：**  
Well, if you insist. It can be my li'l puppy.  
Don't worry. You'll love it at my castle. I promise.  
  
**Maho：**  
Ehehe.  
The Maho-Maho Kingdom's got a new resident,  
and it's all thanks to you. ♪

**Ameth：**  
And that's that. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Think of what you just saw as a dream of sorts.  
Chances are you'll forget everything the second you wake up,  
so no need to brood over it too much.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Gotta say, though.  
That Maho sure does live in  
her own little world, doesn't she?  
  
**Ameth：**  
The two of you just spent some time at a regular old arcade,  
but it played out as some grand adventure inside her head.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm kind of jealous, though.  
Sure seems like she's always having fun.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And hey.  
Same could apply to you, really.  
She's always getting you wrapped up in her adorable stories.  
  
**Ameth：**  
There's something about you when you're with her, too.  
It's like your inner kid comes out to play.  
  
**Ameth：**  
More so when you're both calling each other  
\"prince\" and \"princess\" and whatnot.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh, don't worry. I'm not ripping on you for it.  
Happiness all depends on the person, after all.  
  
**Ameth：**  
\"That\" Maho always dreamed about a world similar to the ones  
in her fairy tales and picture books, so I'm curious what's replaced that for \"this\" one.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's in a fantasy land now, but it's not like she's free of any problems.  
I sure hope it didn't break the illusion.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hehe.  
You don't really mind either way though, do you?  
'Cause you'll be by her side, no matter what the story is.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's your job to keep both her and her dreams safe.  
Mr. Prince.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway.  
That's enough chatter from me today, so I'll excuse myself now.  
Catch you later! ♪

**Maho：**  
Zzz... Zzz...  
  
**Maho：**  
Mmm...?  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh. Guess I fell asleep.  
Thanks for waking me up, my prince. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Ehehe.  
You fell asleep right outta nowhere,  
so I got nice and snug to keep you safe.  
  
**Maho：**  
Or that was the plan.  
But you looked awfully comfy,  
so I ended up joining you in the land o' nod. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
We oughtta be careful, though.  
Bound to catch a cold if we sleep out in the middle of the road at night.  
  
**Maho：**  
What say we get ourselves sorted and make our way home,  
my prince? ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Yeah.  
Caon's guildhouse is just up this here road.  
  
**Maho：**  
That's where I'm staying for now.  
Fancy comin' on over for a li'l bit?  
  
**Maho：**  
I'll make you some tea to wake you right up.  
And if anyone else is there, I'll get them to escort you home.  
  
**Maho：**  
Sound good?  
Then let's be headin'.  
Mind if we hold hands on the way, too?  
  
**Maho：**  
Ehehe.  
Your palm's all nice and warm.  
  
**Maho：**  
Kinda feels like I'm still dreamin', if I'm being honest. ♪
