## Subtitle: An Invite to the Princess's Castle
  
**Maho：**  
And here we are.  
Welcome to Caon Castle, my prince. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Ehehe.  
I do like to call the guildhouse our castle, yessiree.  
  
**Maho：**  
I even got some of the decor lookin' just like it.  
Most of the other gals ain't fond of it,  
but I respect that kinda outlook as well. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Ain't no one here, though.  
Wonder if they're all out?  
  
**Maho：**  
Caon's full of free spirits.  
Don't really mind 'cause we didn't have much work today,  
but it's a li'l bit lonely when it's this quiet.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hehe.  
Our castle sure is spacious though, ain't it? ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
We're as big a guild as they come,  
so we need the space to account for that.  
Plenty of gals that'd be upset if it was all small and packed, too.  
  
**Maho：**  
Yeah.  
Us beastfolk ain't really used to livin' in crowded cities and the like.  
We're more of the outdoor, one with nature sorta type.  
  
**Maho：**  
To put it nice and simple,  
the more space they have, the happier they are.  
  
**Maho：**  
As for me, I had more of a sheltered upbringing.  
Spending a buncha time in my room has been  
normal for me, ever since I was a li'l kid.  
  
**Maho：**  
If anything, I feel a lot less comfortable out in the forest and stuff.  
Always worried about my clothes gettin' all dirty.  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh, lookit me.  
What sorta host keeps their guest  
standing about all day?  
  
**Maho：**  
Feel free to sit anywhere that suits your fancy.  
I'll go get some tea and sweets for us. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh, right.  
You might wanna avoid them cushions over there.  
  
**Maho：**  
Everyone's got their own turf and stuff here.  
Think of it like goin' around  
and touching people's personal belongings.  
  
**Maho：**  
Main reason they don't like it is  
'cause they don't want other people's scent on them.

**Maho：**  
Over here.  
This spot's all mine, so you can touch all you want. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Ahaha.  
Right?  
I've got the fanciest bit 'round these parts.  
  
**Maho：**  
And well...  
I'm technically the guildmaster of this here family.  
  
**Maho：**  
Still don't think I fit the role, but well...  
We're allowed to do whatever we want with our personal space,  
so I went and made it all nice and fancy.  
  
**Maho：**  
Looks right out of a fairy tale, don't it?  
  
**Maho：**  
Feel free to sit there, yeah.  
  
**Maho：**  
Ehehe.  
Arthur. Gawain. Lancelot.  
I'm home. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm?  
Oh. Sorry about that. Was speakin' to these here dolls.  
There's loads lined up, right?  
  
**Maho：**  
Now then, everyone.  
Say hello to my prince. ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I take it you like dolls?  
**Choice: (2)**  Good day. My name is {player}.  
`Tag 1`  
**Maho：**  
You betcha. ♪  
I love 'em to bits.  
They're so cute, aren't they?  
  
**Maho：**  
Some I brought from home,  
some I went around shopping for.  
Some I even made on my own! They just keep increasing. ♪  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Maho：**  
Oh!  
You went and beat 'em to it.  
Talk about a mighty polite prince. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Thanks.  
Lotsa people look at me funny when  
they hear about what I'm into.  
  
**Maho：**  
But it didn't bother you one li'l bit.  
That makes me real happy. ♪

`image display end`  
**Maho：**  
Yeah.  
Sewing and stuff is one of my hobbies.  
  
**Maho：**  
Most of the clothes and dolls I have now I made on my own.  
Want me to make some for you, too?  
  
**Maho：**  
That sounds good, yeah.  
I'm the one that got you all dirty, after all.  
Only makes sense to make it up to you.  
  
**Maho：**  
Ehehe.  
Lemme sew up somethin' real nice and pretty for you. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Mind if I take your measurements for it?  
  
**Maho：**  
It'll be a li'l bit embarrassing,  
but I've always wanted to make clothes for a guy. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
You're okay with it?  
Great!  
Gosh. How come you're so kind?  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh yeah.  
We've got a nice, big bath downstairs.  
Reckon you might wanna wash yourself down there, first.  
  
**Maho：**  
I'll get you some clothes to change into.  
Almost time for lunch, too.  
  
**Maho：**  
I'm the host, so I'll give you what's worth. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
And then we can do loads and loads of talkin'.  
  
**Maho：**  
Oops. Sure have done a lot of talkin' about myself, haven't I?  
Tell me more about yourself, my prince.  
I wanna know everything there is to know about my destined one. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
My prince...?  
Oh. He went and dozed off.  
That explains things.  
  
**Maho：**  
Must've been real tired.  
And knowing him, he's probably been out  
helping all sorts of folk in need.  
  
**Maho：**  
Same way he tried to  
help me when we first met.  
  
**Maho：**  
It must be real tough. You'll do your best,  
but end up falling short sometimes.  
You might struggle to overcome all the evils in the world.  
  
**Maho：**  
But I reckon you'll be fine.  
After all,  
no one's as kind as you are.  
No one shines as bright as you do.  
  
**Maho：**  
There ain't a single person in this world  
more fitting to be called a prince than you are. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh...?  
You okay there,  
my prince?  
  
**Maho：**  
Waugh.  
Don't go falling onto me, now.  
Now I can't move.  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh, you.  
Just cravin' to be spoiled, aren't we?  
  
**Maho：**  
If my lap's good enough, then you're more than welcome.  
Sleep tight.  
Maybe I'll sing you a li'l lullaby, too.  
  
**Maho：**  
Ehehe.  
All stories really do come to a good end.
