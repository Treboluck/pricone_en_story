Waugh... Urng...  
Don't be shaking me about.  
I'm beggin' ya...  
  
**Maho：**  
Using magic makes me feel awfully exhausted, you know?  
Lemme get a li'l bit more shut-eye.  
  
**Maho：**  
Mmm...  
*yawn* Phew. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh, gosh. That was a mighty big yawn.  
I'd get a right big scoldin' from my mom and dad if they saw that.  
  
**Maho：**  
Mmm!  
That's me nice and refreshed.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hold on a sec.  
Just where in the world am I?  
  
**Maho：**  
It's mighty pretty, to say the least. All sparkly and lovely. ♪  
Oh, I know!  
This is Crystal Mountain, isn't it?  
  
**Maho：**  
Waugh!  
Come now, my prince. No need to shake me anymore.  
I'm wide awake.  
  
**Maho：**  
Is somethin' up?  
You're lookin' real flustered.  
  
**Maho：**  
Simmer down, I say.  
Nothin' good comes from panicking.  
  
**Maho：**  
Slow life, easy life.  
Take a break whenever you can. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Waugh!  
Don't go pullin' on my tail, now.  
It's mighty sensitive.  
  
**Maho：**  
Never took you for such a meanie, my prince.  
Really now. What's gotten into you?  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm?  
The carriage got busted up,  
so we can't make it back home?  
  
**Maho：**  
Well, if that's how it be...  
What say we spend the rest of our days here as a merry couple?  
  
**Maho：**  
Aye. That sounds good.  
A nice happily ever after for us. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Waugh.  
Please, not the ears...  
  
**Maho：**  
They're just as sensitive as my tail.  
You can't go touching them out of nowhere.  
  
**Maho：**  
Not unless you're willin' to take responsibility through marriage.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hmm...  
Ohh. Now I remember what's goin' on here.  
  
**Maho：**  
We were tied up all tight and  
stuffed into a carriage,  
weren't we?  
  
**Maho：**  
How'd things go after that,  
though?  
  
**Maho：**  
Well then.  
So I went and blew up the whole carriage with a li'l spell?  
Ahh, right. That's when I tried to undo your ropes, ain't it?  
  
**Maho：**  
Sorry about that.  
Like I said, I'm a bit of a klutz.  
Sure didn't expect *that* to happen, though.  
  
**Maho：**  
Silly old me.  
Now I'm all worried about the driver and horses.  
Hope they ain't hurt...  
  
**Maho：**  
What's that?  
The blast sent us tumblin'  
all the way down here?  
  
**Maho：**  
I can see the cart with a big ol' hole in it  
away up over there, now that you mention it.  
Surprised we ain't even hurt after takin' a fall like that.  
  
**Maho：**  
You used your own body to shield me?  
  
**Maho：**  
Aww. That's sweet of you.  
I knew you were the sorta gallant prince that'd keep me safe.  
Just like in all them fairy tales. Ehehe. ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'd rather not be called a prince.  
**Choice: (2)**  I think we have more pressing issues here.  
`Tag 1`  
**Maho：**  
Aww...  
Don't say that.  
You'll get me all sad now.  
  
**Maho：**  
We used to be lovers in another life.  
You've just forgot about me, is all. Probably.  
  
**Maho：**  
That's what my heart tells me, anyway.  
I was the princess of the Maho-Maho Kingdom, and you were the prince.  
  
**Maho：**  
Ehehe.  
It's real fortunate that fate brought us together again.  
Only fair that we give our thanks by becomin' a happy couple. ♪  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Maho：**  
Yeah...  
Ain't no guarantee we'll be able to climb our way back up  
now that we've tumbled this far down.  
  
**Maho：**  
It's a mighty pickle, it is.  
  
**Maho：**  
But I'm as laid-back as they come.  
A pickle or two ain't enough to change that. ♪  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Maho：**  
Ehehe.  
A li'l bit late, but how about I introduce myself?  
  
**Maho：**  
I'm Maho, princess of the Maho-Maho Kingdom.  
It's a mighty pleasure to meet you. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Oh. Have you heard of this li'l guild called Caon?  
I'm, well... Technically I'm its leader.  
  
**Maho：**  
Not by choice, though.  
The rest of the members are all as free-spirited as can be,  
so I pretty much got forced into the position to keep 'em in check.  
  
**Maho：**  
Speakin' of.  
We were actually in charge of security  
at a museum in town today.  
  
**Maho：**  
Things've been gettin' real sketchy around Landosol recently.  
Seems like a burglar or somethin' got in not too long ago.  
  
**Maho：**  
It's only a small museum, too.  
They ain't got anything mega valuable.  
  
**Maho：**  
Work's work, though.  
And Caon doesn't slack off.  
We gathered up some fine members and went at it.  
  
**Maho：**  
That might've been the issue, though.  
I got a li'l bit complacent knowing they were with me.  
  
**Maho：**  
All the textiles and artwork lined up there caught my eye.  
Got me thinkin' about ancient civilization and its culture, you know?  
  
**Maho：**  
I was caught up in my own li'l world.  
And then, before I knew it,  
I was sittin' in the carriage opposite you.  
  
**Maho：**  
Zonin' out entirely at times like that is a bad habit or mine.  
  
**Maho：**  
My guildmates are probably worried sick, too.  
Can hardly blame 'em when I disappeared outta the blue.  
  
**Maho：**  
We hafta get home.  
This place is awfully chilly, too.  
It's making my ears all droopy.  
  
**Maho：**  
And you're shiverin' all over the place, too.  
  
**Maho：**  
Fine, fine.  
I'll let you use my tail.  
  
**Maho：**  
Ehehe.  
Nice and warm, ain't it?  
Just like a big ol' scarf.
