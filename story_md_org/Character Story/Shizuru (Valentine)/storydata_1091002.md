# Shizuru (Valentine) Episode 2
When Shizuru attends a cooking class to hone her skills as a chocolatier, she spots {player} taking a difficult lesson. She tries to help him out in secret, but gets so distracted that she fails to learn anything about chocolate-making.
  
## Subtitle: Cooking with Big Sis
  
**Narration：**  
Determined to make amazing chocolates for {player},  
Shizuru decides to attend a cooking class that's being held in the city.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
All I've got to go on is this pamphlet,  
but this is the right place for the cooking class, right?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
People are saying it'll be hosted by a famous chef,  
so I can't wait to see what kind of recipes they'll teach us!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Woooow, there sure are a lot of students here.  
I guess it *is* nearly Valentine's Day.  
I can't be the only one who wants to make great chocolates!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
All right! For my little bro's sake,  
I'm going to become a top chocolatier!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh? There are students in the next kitchen over, too.  
Oh, I guess they're holding a regular cooking class.  
Hmm? They're mostly girls, but I see one boy...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hey, could it possibly be {player}?  
Ahhh, it really is you! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
What crazy luck!  
But why are you learning to cook?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I see, I see... You want to cook a meal for Kokkoro and the others  
to thank them for everything they do for you?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Eheh, that's so noble!  
I'm so proud to have such a kind little bro!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, is that the teacher now?  
I'm sorry, I think the lesson's starting!  
I'd better get back to my own class!  
  
**Teacher 1：**  
Good day, my dear students.  
I will be your instructor for today's lesson.  
I'm glad to have this opportunity to teach you the art of chocolate.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I'll do my best!  
  
**Teacher 1：**  
Well then, let's start by handing out the recipe sheets.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I see, I see... Looks like we're making Yule Logs today.  
  
**Teacher 1：**  
Rather than start with the basic bonbon or praline,  
we're going to attempt a more elaborate dessert  
that's popular during the festive season.  
  
**Teacher 1：**  
As I'm sure you all know,  
the standard Yule Log uses a sponge cake roll as the base,  
but this rich variant is formed from ganache and mousse alone.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hmm, sounds like a pretty tricky recipe.  
But I'm doing this for {player}!  
I can't back down from a challenge!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Whew... Now that the initial mixture is ready,  
I need to wait a few minutes, right?  
Yep, seems fine! This is going well!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I always thought \"tempering\"  
was just melting the chocolate down and mixing it,  
but there's more to it than I realized...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Now, I guess it can't hurt  
if I go and check in on {player} for a moment.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Let's see... What's on the menu?  
Whaaaa?! {player}, what kind of advanced lesson  
are you taking here?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
\"Avocado Prawn Cocktail\"...  
\"Asperges à la Sauce Hollandaise\"...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
\"Sea Bream Roti\"...  
\"Smoked Salmon with Deep-Fried Brik\"...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
\"Shrimp Poêlé on Saffron Risotto\"...  
\"Creamy Clam Sauce Pasta\"...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
\"Foie Gras Terrine\"...  
\"Caramelized Fig Tarte\"...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Th-these all seem way too difficult for a beginner!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
{player} must've been so determined to please Kokkoro,  
he signed up for the highest level class.  
But will he really stand a chance here?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ahhh... I don't think he knows what he's doing...  
He's looking around all confused...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Well then! If my little bro is in trouble,  
that's my cue to offer a helping hand!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But I've got to be careful not to hurt his feelings!  
It won't be easy, but I'll have to subtly support him  
without letting him notice me!  
  
**Teacher 2：**  
Next, we will prepare the Sauce Hollandaise.  
Take the melted butter, wine, lemon juice, and sugar...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh no, he's mixing them all wrong!  
I'll whip up a better version... and sneakily switch them!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ahhh! You can't let the sauce boil that long!  
L-let me reach over... and turn off the heat...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
...Ohhh, his hands are shaking as he cuts the vegetables!  
It'll take him forever at that rate....  
I have to help somehow!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
B-but if I slip him a pile of neatly-cut veggies, he'll definitely notice...  
No, there's no time to think!  
I've just got to do it as subtly as I can reasonably manage!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
*pant*... *pant*... S-somehow I managed  
to finish everything without him noticing...  
But what does his teacher think?  
  
**Teacher 2：**  
H... how delicious! What a magnificent dish!  
I was rather concerned for you at the start,  
but you really pulled through.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Thank goodness... The teacher seems to really like it.  
Just look at that smile...  
Hee hee, your big sis is proud of you!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Now, I should get back to my own lesson...  
Hm? {player}'s coming this way.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
H-how was the lesson, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I cooked a great meal.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll cook again sometime just for you!  
`Tag 1`  
**Shizuru：**  
Wow, incredible!  
Did you really make all this?  
It looks scrumptious!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh? R-really?!  
That's wonderful...  
I couldn't possibly be happier right now, {player}!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shizuru：**  
I'm so glad it went well!  
Make sure you take those dishes home safely, now!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hee hee. He looked so thrilled with himself.  
That beaming smile alone was worth all the hard work.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Now then! I'd really better get back to my own lesson.  
...Wait, I never got beyond the preparations, did I?!  
I left for quite a while... Hope I'm OK on time...  
  
**Teacher 1：**  
And that concludes our lesson for today.  
Good work, everyone!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh? Whaaaaaaa?!  
Th-the lesson's over!  
I didn't learn a single thing about making chocolates!  
  
**Narration：**  
Standing before her prematurely abandoned chocolate creation,  
Shizuru hung her head in despair.
