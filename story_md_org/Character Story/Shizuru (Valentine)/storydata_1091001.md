## Subtitle: Bound Together
  
**Narration：**  
Valentine's Day is just around the corner,  
and while the city bustles with excitement and hints of romance,  
Shizuru and Rino have come to visit a boutique in the city center.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
So, will you be making any chocolates for Valentine's Day?  
  
**Rino：**  
Eh?! Where'd that come from?!  
O-of course I'll be making some for Big Bro!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yes, I thought so!  
 My little bro's so sweet,  
who wouldn't want to give him chocolates?!  
I get it, I really do!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Actually, I was planning to make  
some special chocolates for him myself, too.  
...  
Together with Eriko.  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh? With Eriko?!  
Y-you mean like,  
 \"the Destroyer\"? That Eriko?  
How'd you end up making plans with her?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hee hee, that's a secret!  
But this is one contest I can't afford to lose.  
It's a battle of feminine pride!  
  
**Rino：**  
Wh-what does she mean, a \"battle\"?!  
Urgh... I've got a bad feeling about this...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Anyway, I'm hoping that {player} himself will come  
and watch as we make the chocolates for him.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But then, isn't it super important that I look as cute as possible?  
That's why I've come to pick out an outfit to wear while cooking!  
  
**Rino：**  
So basically, you need someone to help you choose a cute outfit,  
and that's why you brought me. Is that right?  
  
**Rino：**  
Well, leave it to ol' Rino!  
I'll pick out an outfit that brings out all your charms, Big Sis!  
I can even customize it for you!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Ooh, such confidence!  
 Oh, by the way,  
don't breathe a word to {player} about the chocolate.  
If he finds out, it won't be much of a surprise.  
  
**Rino：**  
Well, of course!  
Do you think I can't keep a secret?  
My lips are shields, as the saying goes!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Let's keep our weapons  
 away from our mouths, shall we?  
I think what you mean is \"My lips are sealed.\"  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh! Right, yes!  
But if it's such a secret,we shouldn't let Big Bro  
find out we're here either, should we?  
  
**Rino：**  
Sneaky-sneaky, snoop and prowl...  
 Wahh?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hmm? What's wrong?  
  
**Rino：**  
I think Big Bro's... right over there.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Whaaa?!  
Wh-why would he be in this store?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Looks like he's working here.  
He does sign up for a lot of these random jobs...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  How can I help you?  
`Tag 1`  
**Shizuru：**  
Aaahh! Suddenly he's right behind me?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Well, that secret didn't last long.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Aww... But I guess since he's here now,  
we should try to subtly find out his fashion preferences!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hey, hey, {player}!  
What kind of outfit do you think  
would make your big sis look great while cooking?  
  
**Rino：**  
That's your idea of \"subtle\"?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Something that's easy to move around in?  
**Choice: (3)**  How about something traditional?  
`Tag 2`  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh? Easy to move in?  
I mean, that does sound nice and practical...  
But for cooking, though?  
  
**Rino：**  
I don't think cooking in a tracksuit  
will win you any cute points...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hmm... What else could we try, I wonder?

`Tag 3`  
**Shizuru：**  
Traditional clothes, huh?  
Hey, Rino, how about a kappogi smock?  
  
**Rino：**  
That'd just make you look like a granny...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
A-a granny...?!  
Leaping past \"big sis\" two whole generations to \"granny,\" huh...  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh? {player}, you've got some  
recommendations to show us?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh! A cute apron!  
Look, Rino! Don't all these white frills  
fit my big sister image to a tee?  
  
**Rino：**  
\"Big sister\"? Looks more like...  
a newlywed bride, if you ask me...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
A-a bride?!  
I... I... I...I'm really just {player}'s big sister,  
not his wife or anything!  
  
**Rino：**  
Why are you going redder than a watermelon?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
...Um, no reason.  
Anyway, smocks and aprons are both great for cooking in,  
but I'm not sure if they're exactly a treat for my little bro's eyes.  
  
**Rino：**  
Rather than going for the domestic angle,  
you might look better  
 in something more professional, like a real chef.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, I see!  
That does sound more like my style!  
  
**Rino：**  
Great! Let's go with that direction for your outfit!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Well then, where should we start looking?  
  
**Rino：**  
Recently, using cute ribbons as an accent is the in thing!  
D'you think they have any ribbons here?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Well, let's look around and see!  
...  
Hmm? There's a single ribbon down here for some reason.  
  
**Rino：**  
Ooh!  
 It looks super cute, as well!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
\"Ribbon of Love: Guaranteed to bind two souls together.\"  
Me and {player} are already bound together by fate,  
but this sure does sound romantic!  
  
**Rino：**  
It's a bit long to use as an accent on an outfit,  
but there's gotta be some use for it!  
  
**Rino：**  
Like maybe... you could wrap the chocolates with it  
before giving them to Big Bro!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hmm... Hey, Rino, what do you think might happen  
if we use this ribbon even though we're already bound together?  
I've simply got to find out! I'll go and give it to him!  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh?! Wha—Big Sis?!  
You're just going to give him a ribbon out of nowhere?!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Hey, {player}~!  
Take this token of your big sister's love!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Accept the ribbon.  
**Choice: (6)**  Hug Shizuru.  
`Tag 5`  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, {player}!  
I knew you'd accept your big sister'spassionate feelings!

`Tag 6`  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh! You'd rather take your big sister herself?  
Ooh, you really are the sweetest thing~!  
  
`Tag 7`

**Shizuru：**  
Wait, huh? The ribbon suddenly started moving...  
Waaaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Rino：**  
Whaaa?! Big Bro and Big Sis  
are all wrapped up in roving ribbons!  
I-is this what it meant by \"binding together\"?!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  This is a little bit... uncomfortable...  
`Tag 8`  
**Rino：**  
Oh no, oh no! They're tied so tight they can't move an inch!  
I've gotta do something about those ribbons!  
  
![109100102.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/109100102.webp)  
**Shizuru：**  
Ahhh, I'm so close to {player} right now!  
His silky hair smells so nice...  
Looks like we'll just have to stay together forever!  
  
**Rino：**  
H-hold up, Big Sis!  
I'm not sure what's going on,  
but you're breaching our agreement!  
  
**Narration：**  
As Shizuru and {player} became totally tangled together,  
Rino tried frantically to loosen the nefarious ribbons.
