**Narration：**  
Today, {player} is out on a job delivering ingredients  
when he tries taking a shortcut through a dingy back alley.  
  
**Brawler：**  
Tch...! She's tough!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Well, of course! I'm a brawler by trade, you know!  
I don't lose to anyone in a fight!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Now, why don't we end this?  
 Yahhh!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Wait, what the heck?!  
Hey, you there! You're in the way!  
Can you make yourself scarce?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  S-sorry!  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll step aside!  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaya：**  
Yeah, just step aside! It's no biggie!

**Kaya：**  
If you don't wanna get hurt, I'd hightail it outta here!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Brawler：**  
Dunno what your deal is...  
But sorry, kid. Take this!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Whoa—what was that for?!  
Why, you...! Don't get random civilians mixed up in this!  
  
**Brawler：**  
You fell for it!  
 Huoooaaarghhh!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Like heck I did!  
 Hyahhh!  
  
**Brawler：**  
Gueghh! ...N-no way...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, c'mon. Done already?  
Well, can't expect much from scum who'd take advantage of a passerby.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Ah, man. Talk about a disappointment.  
Hey, kid. You OK? Hurt at all? Any scratches?  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Looks like you're fine.  
 Sorry about just now.  
When I'm in a fight, I can get kinda intense.  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Hey! Get up! Don't just lie there!  
I'm paying you good money for this, remember?!  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Dummy. Your guy lost, and that's that!  
Which means we're splitting today's haul  
eighty to me, twenty to you, got it?  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Tch... All right, all right.  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Hey, brawler girlie! Here's your pay!  
I knew I was right to bet on you.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Yeah, anytime.  
Next time you need a fight dealt with, you know where to come.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Now. I got a tidy profit, so that'll do for today...  
Oh, but tell me, kid—why were you in this back alley?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Delivering ingredients?  
Wait, don't tell me that bag's full of...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Ohhh boy. The eggs are all smashed up. That'll be my fault...  
Sorry! Guess I'd better compensate you for all that damage.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Are you sure?  
**Choice: (5)**  You seemed so angry a minute ago...  
`Tag 4`  
**Kaya：**  
Yeah, don't worry about it.  
I made a fat sum from that fight just now, anyway.  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Kaya：**  
Angry, me...?  
 No, no!  
I wasn't angry or anything—I was just getting into it.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Kaya：**  
Thing is, when I'm in a fight, it gets me fired up like nothing else.  
I'm more laid-back normally.  
Can't keep that energy up all the time, can I?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Anyway, we'd better find whoever's expecting this stuff.  
Bring me along—we can apologize together. So, uh...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Sorry. What was your name again?  
Actually, we only just met.  
 Guess you didn't tell me yet.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I'm {player}.  
`Tag 7`  
**Kaya：**  
And I'm Kaya.  
 Good to meetcha!  
  
**Kaya：**  
So this is the place...  
Wait, hold up. I know this joint!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey, old man! You in there?  
  
**Man：**  
Coming...  
 Oh! Why, if it isn't Kaya!  
Man, you really saved my hide that one time!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, drop that already.  
But if those land sharks give you trouble again,  
you just let me know.  
  
**Man：**  
Of course!  
 So, who's the boy?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Actually, he got mixed up in a fight on his way to this diner.  
I think I mighta messed up the ingredients you wanted.  
  
**Man：**  
Say what now? Hmm, can I have a look at that?  
...Well, dang. I don't think I can pay for smashed goods.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Yeah, I figured. Look, I'll fork out the money you paid for the ingredients.  
So just this once, can you pay this guy for the job anyway?  
  
**Man：**  
Hmm...  
 Oh, all right. Since it's you asking, Kaya,  
I'll pay him the full sum.  
  
**Kaya：**  
For real?!  
 Nice one, old man! I owe ya!  
OK, then. Here's your cash.  
  
**Man：**  
Nah, don't bother. I can always buy more eggs.  
And if I get in trouble again, you'll fight for me, won't you?  
  
**Kaya：**  
'Course I will! I'll give you a huge discount, even!  
Don't worry—no one beats me in a brawl!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Whew, good thing he's such a nice guy, huh?  
You got your pay, and I didn't even have to compensate him!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  I want to repay you for your help.  
`Tag 8`  
**Kaya：**  
Repay me?  
 No, don't bother!  
You wouldn't be in this mess if it weren't for me and that dumb brute.  
  
**Kaya：**  
But lessee... If you really wanna do something for me,  
you can hire me for a job sometime.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Like, a delivery job...?  
**Choice: (10)**  I also fight monsters now and then...  
`Tag 9`  
**Kaya：**  
Delivery?!  
I mean, I *am* physically fit,  
and I can handle myself on the road, but...  
  
Jump to tag 11  
`Tag 10`  
**Kaya：**  
Monsters, huh... Not *quite* my thing.  
Well, fighting monsters might be fun too, once in a while.  
  
`Tag 11`  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, ah... What I mean is,  
the kind of work I usually do is handling people's fights.  
  
**Kaya：**  
For the right fee, I'll face any opponent, or any number of 'em.  
Brawler's guarantee.  
  
**Kaya：**  
So if you find yourself in a tight situation,  
then you can give me a call.  
  
**Kaya：**  
You don't look like a fighter yourself,  
 so it works out, right?  
You can usually find me 'round these parts, so drop by anytime.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, look how late it's gotten while we were yapping.  
I should head back. Later, dude.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey! If it ain't {player}!  
Don't tell me you need my help with a delivery?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Haha! I'm kidding.  
But I *am* free today, so if you wanted...  
  
**Choice: (12)**  I need your help with a fight.  
`Tag 12`  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, right. You need me to fight for you...  
...Wait, really?! You actually brought me a real fighting job?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Well, of course I'm down for that!  
Heheh! Bring it on! I'm getting fired up!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Take me to 'em!  
I'll show you why they call me a professional brawler!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Who'd've thought this kid  
would find me a job the very next day?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Maybe meeting him  
 was better luck than I thought!  
  
**Narration：**  
With a small grin on her face,  
Kaya went along with {player}  
to attend to the job he'd brought her.
