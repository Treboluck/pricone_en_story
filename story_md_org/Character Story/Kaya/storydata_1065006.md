## Subtitle: Back Alley Turf
  
**Narration：**  
One day, while taking a stroll through Landosol's back alleys,  
{player} finds his path blocked by a group of young kids.  
  
**Boy 1：**  
You there! Halt!  
Identify yourself!  
  
**Boy 2：**  
What's your business here?! Lookin' for Kaya or somethin'?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Kaya's around here?  
`Tag 1`  
**Boy 1：**  
Oh, so you do know Kaya!  
Then you gotta pay the toll!  
  
**Boy 2：**  
Yeah, pay up!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Yeah, yeah, that's enough.  
This guy's a friend of mine. Let him pass, OK?  
  
**Kaya：**  
So what brings you here? Looking for me?  
No, wait. Let me guess. ...You're just on a stroll, aren't you?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, come on, don't pull out your wallet! Put it away!  
Geez... Who takes a few kids' demands seriously?  
Well, I guess that's what's so funny about you.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Sorry, sorry. The whole toll thing's just a joke.  
It's a code word we use when friends drop by.  
  
**Kaya：**  
You kiddos did great.  
Here's your pay for today. Don't spend it all at once.  
  
**Boy 1：**  
Aw yeah! Let's go buy snacks later!  
  
**Kaya：**  
These kids do lookout work for us on our turf around here.  
And as you saw, we reimburse them for the trouble.  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Truth is, they all lost their parents to the Lost phenomenon.  
They used to pickpocket for a living.  
  
**Kaya：**  
But now, thanks to this job,  
they can get by in a more honest way,  
without getting their hands dirty.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Honestly, I'd like it if we could provide proper care for them too,  
but too many handouts and they'll grow reliant on us, see?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Of course I know there's the Sarendia Orphanage.  
A lovely place that looks after children with Lost parents.  
  
**Kaya：**  
But they've already got a ton of kids, right?  
Foisting all these on 'em too wouldn't be right.  
They're a small guild, with more than enough on their plate already.  
  
**Kaya：**  
So we came up with our own system.  
It's not perfect, but it's gotta beat a life of thieving.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You're doing amazing work.  
**Choice: (3)**  Is there anything I can do to help?  
`Tag 2`  
**Kaya：**  
Nah, I'm not doing much myself.  
Me and them have a strictly give-and-take relationship.

`Tag 3`  
**Kaya：**  
Haha, you're a real do-gooder, ain'tcha?  
Don't worry. You can leave these kids to us.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Kaya：**  
I mean, it's not even me who started this, it's the boss.  
I'm just helping out a little.  
  
**Boy 1：**  
Ahhh~! Are those two *still* chatting away?  
Kaya! Lookout duty's boring!  
  
**Boy 2：**  
Actually, don't they seem weirdly close?  
Don't tell me you're Kaya's boyfriend?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Huh? Oh, come off it. He's just a bud.  
Take care of your buds, kiddos.  
  
**Boys：**  
'Kay...  
  
**Boy 1：**  
Hey, Kaya. I'm bored, so give us another fighting lesson!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Sure, sure, all right.  
Then get yourselves in an orderly line!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, this?  
 When I've got time, I teach them a bit of martial arts.  
It's good to make sure they can protect themselves, right?  
  
**Kaya：**  
I know. Why don't you join in?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  If you're not gonna tickle me.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kaya：**  
Huh?  
 Ahaha!  
You're still hung up on that?!  
  
**Boy 1：**  
Hiyahhh! Take this special attack!  
  
**Boy 2：**  
Say what?! I'll never lose!  
Jump Kiiiiiick!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh boy. Forget practice, now they're playing hero games!  
...It's good to see them having fun.  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
Oh-hoh? What's with all these brats making noise?!  
Who gave you permission to mess around on our streets?!  
  
**Boy 1：**  
...  
  
**Boy 2：**  
W-we just...  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Oh, just what we needed.  
These two are from the gang a few blocks over.  
Sometimes they come over and cause trouble on our turf.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey, punks. Bullying kids today, are you?  
Have you really got nothing better to do?!  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
Kaya... You again?!  
These dumb brats have been intruding on our gang's turf.  
This is their fault, not ours.  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
I-if you want a fight, we can take you any day!  
  
**Kaya：**  
You think so, do you?  
OK, kiddos, get these punks!  
  
**Boy 2：**  
Kiiiiick!  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
Owww!  
 Th-this brat! He kicked me in the shin!  
  
**Boy 1：**  
Yahhhh!  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
Aurgh!  
A-a punch... to the balls... is just low...!  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
Dammit...!  
We go easy on you 'cause you're brats, and you think you're tough?!  
If you want a real beating, we'll give you one!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Don't tell me they're gonna use weapons?!  
Sorry, I might need your help with—  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Haha. Guess he's ready before I even need to ask.  
That's my bud for ya!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey, punks! Time to give it a rest!  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
Tch... Who's this dude? A new guy...?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Now then... What's it gonna be?  
If you agree to slink on home, I might let you off the hook this once.  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
Let us off...?!  
 Kaya!  
It's time you learned to show us a bit of respect!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Isn't that my line...?  
One more step, and you're picking a fight with the whole Family.  
You understand that?  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
A-as if we're gonna buy that!  
...No gang's gonna mobilize over a handful of brats!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Wanna try us?  
The boss'll be happy to give the order.  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
...Tch! You'll regret this, I swear!  
C'mon, let's get outta here!  
  
**Boy 1：**  
Aww yeah!  
The bullies ran for it!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Nicely done, kiddos!  
  
**Boy 2：**  
Heheh! If they come here again,  
we'll fight them off on our own next time!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Yeah. You protect your own hide. That's the golden rule.  
  
**Kaya：**  
But if things look real bad, you run and find me or the boss.  
Got that?  
  
**Boy 1：**  
Yeah, we know! Thanks, Kaya! And you, dude!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Man, what a fine bunch!  
You even know when to say thank you. Good kids!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Now then... Can you report this to the boss for me?  
She should be over in the guildhouse.  
  
**Boy 2：**  
Okay! Then let's race to see who can tell the boss first!  
C'mon, guys!  
  
**Kaya：**  
After facing down real gangsters... Talk about lively.  
Thanks, {player}, for helping me keep them safe.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  That's what buds do, right?  
**Choice: (7)**  I just did what anyone would do.  
`Tag 6`  
**Kaya：**  
Heheh! I knew you'd understand!  
You're a swell guy, you know that?  
 You oughtta be proud of yourself.

`Tag 7`  
**Kaya：**  
Anyone...?  
 Hahahah!  
Don't think I've heard anyone use that line for real before!  
  
`Tag 8`  
**Kaya：**  
{player}... Thanks a bunch!  
I'm really glad to have a bud like you!  
  
**Narration：**  
And giving {player} a hearty slap on the back,  
Kaya flashed him a big smile of gratitude.
