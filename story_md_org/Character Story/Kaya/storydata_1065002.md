**Narration：**  
Having requested Kaya's services,  
{player} takes her to meet the client she'll be fighting for.  
  
**Kaya：**  
This place, huh.  
 So? Where's the client we're meeting?  
  
**Sister：**  
You can't just snatch my lion plushie, Big Bro!  
I was still playing with it! Give it baaaack!  
  
**Brother：**  
No way! It's my turn to play with Mr. Lion now!  
Anyway, he belongs to me, not you!  
  
**Sister：**  
Waaahhh! Big Bro, you big, mean dummy!  
  
**Kaya：**  
C'mon, show me the client already!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She's right here.  
**Choice: (2)**  It's this little girl.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaya：**  
Uh...  
 Wait, hold up.  
When you said a fight... did you mean this sibling squabble?

`Tag 2`  
**Kaya：**  
Huh, this kid here?  
 It's a pleasure.  
...  
Yeah, no!  
Don't tell me the fight you mentioned is this sibling squabble?!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, for the...! I'm a brawler. My business is fistfights!  
I can't step in and punch a little kid.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Sorry, but you're on your own with this one.  
Later.  
  
**Sister：**  
Aren't you gonna help...?  
Please! Get my lion back for me! I'll give you all my candy!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey! Quit tugging, kid!  
  
**Kaya：**  
*sigh*... Payment in candy, huh.  
All right, fine. You've got yourself a deal.  
  
**Brother：**  
Whaaa?! That's not fair!  
 I'm the one who's gotta deal  
with your stupid crying all the time!  
Let me have this one thing!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Hmm, yeah. From the bro's perspective,  
the little sis must seem like she's got it good.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey. Are you two the only kids in your family?  
You won't have much fun if you keep fighting.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Even if this toy does belong to you, bro,  
it can't be all that hard to play nice with your sister.  
 Can it?  
  
**Brother：**  
W-well... I guess if you put it like that...  
...We could try playing together.  
  
**Sister：**  
Really?!  
 Yaaaay! I wanna play with Big Bro!  
  
**Brother：**  
C'mon then. Let's go play with Mr. Lion in the park!  
  
**Sister：**  
Yeah!  
 Thanks for helping, nice lady!  
  
**Kaya：**  
And off they go.  
...That little girl... She just wanted to play with her brother.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Buuut... you're still not off the hook, buster.  
Next time, I want a real job!  
I'm not gonna be satisfied till you bring me a proper fight!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I've got a job for you.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kaya：**  
For real? It's not like the last one, is it...?  
Well, whatever. Why don't you just take me to the client?  
  
**Girlfriend：**  
Why are you always late to every single date?!  
You don't actually care how I feel at all, do you?!  
  
**Boyfriend：**  
Haven't I explained this already?!  
When stuff comes up at the end of work, I can't just pack up and leave!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Hey.  
Don't tell me I'm dealing with a lovers' spat this time?  
  
**Girlfriend：**  
Oh, you're the fight lady, are you?  
I'll pay good money, so give this idiot a piece of my mind!  
  
**Girlfriend：**  
He's always making excuses...  
I've had it up to here with his nonsense!  
  
**Kaya：**  
A piece of your mind, huh...  
Now look, missus. Do I look like a wordsmith to you?  
  
**Kaya：**  
I only handle fights with these two fists.  
Do you want me to punch your fella?  
 If you're paying, I'll do it!  
  
**Girlfriend：**  
N-no, you mustn't hit him!  
Don't you lay a finger on him! If he got hurt, I'd just die!  
  
**Girlfriend：**  
I'm sorry... I was just so lonely...  
And I worry that you're working yourself too hard, as well...  
It drives me crazy...  
  
**Boyfriend：**  
I see... I'm sorry. I didn't know you felt that way.  
You know I only work hard to earn us a happy life together!  
I love you so much...  
  
**Girlfriend：**  
So do I... Despite it all, I just can't stop loving you...  
My darling...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Well, well. This is steamy.  
Have you forgotten we're still standing here?  
  
**Girlfriend：**  
Oh, I'm sorry! We got lost in our own little world...  
I guess it's thanks to you that we made up.  
Here, take this. Payment in full!  
  
**Boyfriend：**  
Haha. My honey...  
Let's go... somewhere more private now, shall we?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Yeah, yeah. You go have fun.  
I guess we got the cash, but that was... mentally straining.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Here you go. Take your portion. We're free now, so let's grab a snack.  
You're coming too, since you brought me this great job and all.  
  
**Kaya：**  
The crepes here are good, right?  
That one's on me. Seeing as you did bring me work.

**Kaya：**  
Mmm, delish! It's so sweet!  
After I've used my brain, nothing beats a sugar dose!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  You look so different from when you're fighting.  
**Choice: (6)**  Wow, you really like that stuff.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kaya：**  
Really? It's just the same old me.  
My face hasn't changed or anything, right?  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Kaya：**  
Well, yeah! Tasty things are just tasty!  
Are you any different?  
 You seem to be enjoying yours.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Choice: (8)**  I think I like you better like this.  
`Tag 8`  
![106500202.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/106500202.webp)  
**Kaya：**  
Well, uh... thanks. ...  
Really, though. No need to joke around.  
  
**Kaya：**  
I dunno what I expected, but you're a pretty funny guy.  
Something about the way you act, I guess? You talk kinda funny, too.  
  
**Kaya：**  
What d'you even do for a living?  
You've got a sword, so I doubt it's all just deliveries.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Don't tell me you're a brawler too...?  
 Nah, no way!  
Seriously, what *is* your deal?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Actually, I'm not sure about that myself.  
`Tag 9`  
**Kaya：**  
Huh? What's that supposed to mean...?  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Oh, wow. No memories or anything at all?  
How do you even survive, living like that?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Still, not remembering stuff that everyone else knows...  
That's gotta be kinda tough.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Us dragonfolk are the opposite.  
There's things we remember that no one else does.  
  
**Kaya：**  
You might not get it, with your memory loss,  
but a ton of things in this world have been twisted way outta shape.  
  
**Kaya：**  
And us dragonfolk, we remember the world before that,  
while everyone else has forgotten.  
 It's a real weird situation.  
  
![106500203.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/106500203.webp)  
**Kaya：**  
Well, that's enough about me. Point is, maybe you and me,  
with both our memory dealies,  
 can be good friends!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Anyway! Now that we've filled our stomachs, what next?

**Ruffian：**  
Hey, dumbass, that hurt! Watch where you're walkin', will ya?!  
Now I've got crepe all over my clothes!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Someone's gotta teach you some manners!  
How 'bout I punch your dumb face in?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Uhhh... Sorry if I'm wrong.  
But you just picked a fight with my bud here, right?  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Yeah, I sure did. What's it to you, dumb broad?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Then I'll take you up on that fight instead!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
You will, will ya?! You've got some guts, girlie!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Hm...? Those wings... that tail...  
That flashy hair, and those hands!  
Are you that dragongirl brawler everyone's been talking about?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Sounds like me.  
 Guess I've gotten myself a reputation.  
So, big guy? What exactly does it change if I am?  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Hah! Rumors or no rumors, I'm not losing to some brat!  
I'll kick your stupid ass!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Heh. Is that right?! Now we're talking! I'm all fired up!  
Come at me, then! I'll pound you into the dirt in seconds flat!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
You think you're such hot stuff!  
We'll see whose face ends up in the dirt!  
  
**Kaya：**  
What's that? Are you done already?!  
Then I guess it's my turn! Yahhh!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Guoarghh!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Man, I've been itching for a real fight!  
Yah-yah-yah!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Guahh!  
Sh-she's too strong...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, c'mon. After all that talk, this is the best you can do?  
Not even enough for a warm-up...  
 Well, whatever.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Listen up. You better not try anything with my friend again.  
Next time I catch you, I'm not holding back.  
 We clear?  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Aaghhh...  
I-I'll never do it again!  
  
**Kaya：**  
*sigh*...  
 Ahh, that felt good!  
 Oh, but it's almost time.  
I've got work, so I better head off.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Today was a weird one, but thanks.  
For you, I'll take on a fight anytime, free of charge.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Welp, later!  
  
**Kaya：**  
A sibling quarrel, a lovers' spat, and a regular punk...  
It wasn't exactly easy, but it was surprisingly fun.  
  
**Kaya：**  
And did he say he likes me better when I'm enjoying a crepe?  
...What a funny guy.  
  
**Narration：**  
Thinking back over the day she'd shared with {player},  
Kaya couldn't help but break into a grin  
as she headed off to her next real job.
