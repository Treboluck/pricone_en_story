**Narration：**  
With no jobs to handle at the moment,  
{player} is on an aimless stroll through the city.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey—it's you! Having another lazy day?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Man... Truth is, so am I.  
I haven't had a single job request lately.  
  
**Kaya：**  
I know.  
 Since you're here, why don't we team up  
and scour the city for hidden jobs? Sounds good, right?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sure!  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm in!  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaya：**  
Ooh, decisive!  
All right! We're gonna find a great job, you and me together!

`Tag 2`  
**Kaya：**  
Nicely said! Fights are always breaking out,  
so I'm sure we'll find a client somewhere!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kaya：**  
Well then, let's get moving!  
  
**Kaya：**  
After all that enthusiasm,  
 we've had no luck...  
Well, I guess there's no point rushing these things.  
  
**Man：**  
Why don't you just admit it already?!  
  
**Woman：**  
Excuse me?! This omurice was my idea to begin with!  
You're the one who suddenly put it on your own menu!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey, it's him.  
You know, the guy you were delivering to on the day we first met.  
What's gotten him riled up?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Wait, I know her face too.  
She runs a diner I'm always visiting.  
  
**Man：**  
The rice uses my original spices!  
Besides, nobody owns the recipe to omurice, do they?!  
  
**Woman：**  
I worked hard to perfect that omelette topping!  
Oh, it's no use talking to you.  
I'll just have to let my hired brawler settle this.  
  
**Brawler 1：**  
Looks like she's not backing down. What's your call?  
  
**Man：**  
Hmm... I guess I have no choice...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Whoa, whoa, whoa. They've both brought brawlers into this?  
Man, it really must be serious...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey, you there. Can I ask something?  
How did those two get into such a nasty fight?  
  
**Onlooker：**  
They were arguing about stealing each other's recipes.  
Apparently whoever loses this duel has to close up shop.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Close up shop?!  
You've gotta be kidding me!  
  
**Kaya：**  
It's true both their menus have pretty similar flavors,  
but I always found them warm and comforting.  
  
**Kaya：**  
One time, I even saw them talking about cooking together.  
I always thought their food was similar 'cause they were great buds...  
  
**Kaya：**  
How did they end up in such an awful state?  
I can't let either of them close up shop over this!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey, old man! Lady!  
 Hang on a minute, will ya?!  
I don't want to see the two of you fighting!  
  
**Man：**  
Kaya...! Sorry, but you can't change my mind.  
The pride of my business is at stake here!  
  
**Woman：**  
Pride? What pride?  
Your business has always been a cheap imitation of mine!  
  
**Man：**  
Say what?!  
You're the one who copies me!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Seriously, just quit it, guys!  
If you wanna fight, you'll have to take me down first!  
  
**Brawler 2：**  
Urk... Hey, missus, is this a good idea?  
That girl's a famous face among us brawlers...  
  
**Kaya：**  
C'mon, I'm sure you can talk this out if you try!  
Right? You've both got such great diners that people love.  
  
**Man：**  
I appreciate the sentiment, I really do.  
But this is one battle I can't back down from.  
  
**Man：**  
Mr. Brawler, it's up to you!  
  
**Brawler 1：**  
Roger that, sir.  
  
**Woman：**  
I knew it would come to this. So be it, then.  
 Take his brawler out!  
  
**Brawler 2：**  
All right! That's what I like to hear!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Dangit... Is there really no way to stop this?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  It's not your fault, Kaya.  
**Choice: (5)**  Are you OK, seeing all this?  
`Tag 4`  
**Kaya：**  
I know that, but...  
It still kills me to see buds fighting like this.

`Tag 5`  
**Kaya：**  
I'm fine...  
...Sorry, no. It's pretty tough. Sorry to make you worry.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Kaya：**  
Still, nothing I can do about it now... Ugh, let 'em fight.  
I'm sure it'll be over before too long.  
Let's go kill some time.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Well... I guess it'll be over at this point...  
  
**Man：**  
Why...? Why is this happening?  
  
**Woman：**  
Our beloved diners...  
  
**Kaya：**  
What the heck...?  
 Why are both your diners in ruins?!  
  
**???：**  
Well, well, well. Is this a customer?  
 I'm terribly sorry.  
These diners both happen to be closed for business today.  
  
**Kaya：**  
I'm just a friend.  
Who the hell're you? What did you do to them?!  
  
**Proprietor：**  
Ah, my apologies.  
 I am the proprietor of another eatery.  
I also provide services to many establishments in this area.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Say what...?  
  
**Proprietor：**  
It was with my support that this lady  
set up her diner to begin with.  
  
**Proprietor：**  
Now, my dear. When I introduced you to that brawler,  
did we not agree that if you lost, you would leave everything to me?  
  
**Woman：**  
Y-yes...  
  
**Proprietor：**  
And the outcome was a draw.  
 Which means you both lost.  
From that moment, your rights transferred to me,  
so I took the liberty of demolishing both diners.  
  
**Proprietor：**  
You know the old adage.  
 Petty conflicts benefit no one!  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
Heh! That's our boss for ya!  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
Your efficiency sends shivers down my spine!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Wha—? Aren't those...  
the pair of louts who were intruding on our turf?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Why, you... You hired gangsters  
to tear these places down before anyone could stop you!  
  
**Proprietor：**  
Whatever do you mean? I hired these good men  
for an entirely separate demolition job, but since they finished early,  
I had them move on to this one right away.  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
Exactly! Kaya, don't get weird ideas into your head!  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
All we did here was take care of some honest work!  
  
**Man：**  
Why, these little...! How dare they do this to us?!  
  
**Proprietor：**  
Now...  
 I have a proposition to make you both.  
  
**Woman：**  
A proposition...?!  
  
**Man：**  
Are you mad?!  
After everything you've done, what can you possibly offer us?!  
  
**Proprietor：**  
I will arrange for your diners to be rebuilt.  
But of course, you will need to foot the construction bills yourselves.  
You can be sure that I will claim my dues in full!  
  
**Man：**  
Wh-why, you...!  
  
**Woman：**  
The nerve of this man!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Dirty rat... I see your scheme.  
You had this all planned out from the start!  
  
**Proprietor：**  
Oh...? Whatever could you be referring to?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Don't play dumb! You hired these gangsters way ahead of time,  
ready for when the lady lost, or at least failed to win!  
  
**Proprietor：**  
Heavens, no. I could never claim to possess such foresight.  
I was merely prepared for all eventualities. ...Ahahah!  
  
**Kaya：**  
You phony... Who d'you think you're fooling?!  
  
**Proprietor：**  
Now, what will it be, my dears? Will you take my offer to rebuild?  
Or perhaps you would rather confront me in indignation?  
Let's see...  
 We could always settle this with a brawl.  
  
**Proprietor：**  
As you can see, I have two reliable hired hands.  
...  
The outcome is obvious. Give up and accept my terms.  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
Hahahah! Too bad for you!  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
If you know what's good for ya, you'll do as he says!  
  
**Woman：**  
Urgh... Our precious diners..  The flavors... the memories...  
  
**Man：**  
It's all over... There's nothing left for us...  
But if I'm ruined either way, I'll at least put up a fight!  
You're going down with me!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Don't bother, old man.  
You guys... From here on out, this fight belongs to me.  
  
**Man：**  
K-Kaya...?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Just one thing—I'm afraid I'll need payment up front.  
I'm a pro brawler. I can't take on a client's fight without a fee.  
  
**Man：**  
Actually, I just used up all my funds on the last brawl...  
I don't even have the money to rebuild. I can't afford your services...!  
  
**Woman：**  
Same here... What do we even have left to offer...?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...One rupie. I'll charge one rupie between you both.  
Just promise me you won't go fighting again.  
  
**Woman：**  
Of course...! Yes, it's a promise...!  
So please help us, Kaya!  
  
**Man：**  
Oh, Kaya... Thank you!  
 I'm prepared now.  
If you lose this fight, we'll accept his terms, however cruel...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Always a pleasure!  
 I've taken receipt of my one-rupie fee!  
So don't worry, old man...  
Losing a fight is the one thing I'd never do in a million years!  
  
**Proprietor：**  
Hmm...? My, my, what's all this?  
Have you taken on this brawl in my clients' stead?  
How touchingly kind!  
 So sad that it will spell the end for you!  
  
**Kaya：**  
'Fraid that's my line, buster.  
 Listen up, punks!  
The fight this old man and lady picked with you  
belongs to none other than me now!  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
Nobody said anything about facing Kaya!  
Did she really take it on for a single rupie?!  
Where the hell's the profit in that?!  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
But bro, we can't refuse, right?!  
This is our chance to finally take her down!  
  
**Proprietor：**  
Hmm. It seemed cruel to assault you two-on-one,  
but if you have your own ally, the numbers match!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Let's do this, Kaya.  
`Tag 7`  
**Kaya：**  
...Wait, why'd you follow me out here?  
This is gonna be one heckuva scuffle. You oughtta keep your distance.

**Choice: (9)**  I'll back you up.

...Well, thanks. I really appreciate it.  
At times like this, it feels great to have  
 a loyal bud!

**Kaya：**  
Heh. That's just what I needed to hear!  
  
**Kaya：**  
My body's feeling hotter than ever!  
I'll be using that power of yours!  
  
**Kaya：**  
With a bud by my side, I can't afford to give a single inch!  
Oh yeah, oh yeah! I'm getting so fired up, there's no stopping me!

**Kaya：**  
Haaaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
H-hey... What the heck is that?!  
Doesn't Kaya look kinda different from usual?!  
  
**Kaya：**  
The sheer power is flooding my body!  
I couldn't lose this fight if I tried!  
I get it... So this is my dragonfolk strength...!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh, man. If I lose focus, it's gonna sweep me away!  
We don't want a repeat of Elpis Island. I've gotta control it!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey, punks! Peel your eyes, open your ears, and carve it into your souls!  
This is what you get when you make an enemy of a dragongirl!  
  
**Kaya：**  
I'm about to kick every one of your asses!  
Hyyyaaaaarrrrrrghhhhh!

**Gangsters：**  
Aaaghhhhhhhh!  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
We can't beat this girl! R-ruuuun!  
  
**Kaya：**  
You're not getting away!  
This is for the old man and his flattened diner!  
  
**Kaya：**  
And this one is for the dirty tricks you played on that lady!  
  
**Gangsters：**  
Gyaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Proprietor：**  
N-no way! She defeated them both...?!  
Waaaaaghhhh!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Where d'you think you're going?! Yahhhh!  
  
**Proprietor：**  
Gueeeerghhh!

**Kaya：**  
Whew...  
 Huh, I'm back to normal.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Hey, rat! Why did you do all this?!  
If you want to avoid any more pain, spill the whole story!  
  
**Proprietor：**  
M-my own establishment was struggling with sales...  
So I thought, if I took out some of my rivals...  
  
**Proprietor：**  
Crushing both of these two at once would be very efficient,  
so I spread rumors to spur them against each other...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Talk about dirty tactics...!  
Now listen. You're gonna pay the full price of rebuilding both diners!  
  
**Proprietor：**  
Yeearghh! Y-yes, ma'am!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Good. That settles that, then...  
Old man, lady, we're done here.  
  
**Man：**  
Yeah... Thank you, Kaya.  
...  
Are you all right, too?  
  
**Woman：**  
Yes... Thanks to you protecting me from that flying debris...  
...  
How about you? Aren't you hurt at all?  
  
**Kaya：**  
Heheh, you two seem friendlier already.  
I hope you take this opportunity to become better buds.  
  
**Old Man：**  
What's this? Don't tell me you two need marriage counseling again.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Oh yeah, they were at each other's throats until...  
Whaaaaa?! Hey, gramps, what'd you just say?!  
These two are... married?  
  
**Old Man：**  
Well, yes. Originally, they ran a diner together,  
but they were constantly arguing about the recipes, you see...  
  
**Kaya：**  
Huh... Who'da thunk it.  
...Maybe you could try doing this together again?  
  
**Woman：**  
Actually, I was just thinking the same...  
I'd feel much better with you by my side, darling.  
  
**Man：**  
Yeah. I'm getting a sudden hankering for the taste of your omurice!  
Will you make it for me again?  
  
**Woman：**  
Yes, of course!  
  
**Kaya：**  
...Guess they're OK now.  
Well, they can sort this out between themselves.  
  
**Gangster 2：**  
...Hey, since when are they so lovey-dovey?  
 Owww...  
  
**Gangster 1：**  
H-hey, sir... While they're not looking...  
  
**Proprietor：**  
Y-yes, good idea...  
  
**Man：**  
Kaya, dear, thank you so much.  
If it weren't for you, who knows what might have happened...  
  
**Woman：**  
Oh, I quite agree. We're so grateful!  
Once we're back in business, you must drop by.  
We'll treat you to a special feast!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Sure! I'll look forward to it!  
...Now then, somebody needs to move this rubble.  
 Right, you punks?  
  
**Proprietor：**  
Urk!  
  
**Gangsters：**  
Yeearghh!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Did I just see you trying to run...?!  
As if money alone is gonna settle this!  
You ruined these diners, and you're gonna clean up the mess!  
  
**All：**  
Yes, ma'am! We're so sorryyyy!  
  
**Kaya：**  
Man, though, what a shock.  
I never dreamed those two were husband and wife.  
  
**Kaya：**  
Glad things're looking up for them, in business and in love.
