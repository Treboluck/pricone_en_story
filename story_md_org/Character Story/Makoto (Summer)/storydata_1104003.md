# Makoto (Summer) Episode 3
Makoto loses consciousness in the midst of saving a drowning child, but {player} rushes in to save her in turn. Though she thanks him for the act, she can't help but wonder if he performed mouth-to-mouth on her.

**Narration：**  
Makoto and {player} continue their  
patrolling duties while clearing up a number of issues along the way.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Phew.  
Seems like things've finally calmed down on the beach.  
  
**Makoto：**  
We barely had a chance to take a breather.  
I figured we'd be busy,  
but not *this* busy.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Then again, it's good that we haven't had to deal  
with any near drownings or injured people.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Accidents at the beach can come at the cost of someone's life.  
The less work we have to do, the better.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Which reminds me.  
How well can you swim?  
  
**Makoto：**  
I remember you coming close to drowning  
when we all went to the beach together.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I see, I see.  
So not too well, then?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Mind showing me a more concrete example?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ahhh... Okay.  
Now I get it.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Not exactly the best display from a fellow beachside officer, if I'm being honest.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Leave it to me.  
**Choice: (2)**  I've got a special plan.  
`Tag 1`  
**Makoto：**  
Oh? Sounding super confident there.  
You'll go get it? Get what, exactly?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Makoto：**  
A special plan? And what would that be?  
Hey, where're you running off to?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Makoto：**  
Ahh...  
I was curious why you sounded so confident, but really now...  
  
**Makoto：**  
You're gonna bust a swim ring out just like that?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
And you look super proud about it, too!  
Hm? You won't drown as long as you have that?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Well, as long as you're cool with it...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Plus,  I'll spring into action first if anything goes down.  
You ain't gotta push yourself.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Collateral damage can be one of the scariest parts about accidents at the beach.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh, sorry. In this case, that refers to when  
someone ends up drowning while trying to save another person.  
Hoist by their own petard and all that.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh? What does that mean? Uh...  
Argh! This whole exchange is an example of it!  
Well, not quite, but still!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Anyway—  
  
**Man：**  
Help! A child's drowning!  
  
**Makoto：**  
...!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Let's hurry!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Where's the kid that's drowning?!  
  
**Man：**  
Over there!  
  
**Makoto：**  
How'd he get that far out?!  
Did the current drag him away?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Just wait! I'll be right there!  
  
**Makoto：**  
You wait here, {player}!  
Got it?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Raaaghhh!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I made it!  
  
**Boy：**  
*gasp* Ahhh!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I'm here to help!  
Calm down and grab on to me.  
  
**Boy：**  
*pant, pant*  
  
**Makoto：**  
That's it. Just keep still and hold on tight.  
  
**Makoto：**  
All right, we're back on the shore. You're safe now.  
Take some deep breaths. You're not hurt anywhere, are you?  
  
**Boy：**  
...with me.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh? Something wrong?  
  
**Boy：**  
My sister... was with me too...!  
Please... Please save her!  
  
**Makoto：**  
?!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Over there!  
`Tag 4`  
**Makoto：**  
She's even further out!  
Dammit!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I'll be right there!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Just a bit more... Tch.  
Swimming this much is taking its toll!  
  
**Girl：**  
...!  
  
**Makoto：**  
You okay?!  
  
**Girl：**  
...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Uh-oh. She's not looking great.  
I gotta drag her back myself!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Crap... I'm about at my limit!  
I gotta get her back to shore, at the very least!  
  
**Makoto：**  
...!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ugh! I swallowed some of the water!  
Dammit! I'm passing out...!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I shouldn't have... brought up the idea of... collateral damage...  
  
**Makoto：**  
...?  
What's that?  
A swim ring?  
  
**Makoto：**  
*cough, cough*  
  
**Choice: (5)**  You okay?!  
`Tag 5`  
**Makoto：**  
Oh... It's {player}.  
What're you looking so worried for?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ah. Now I remember.  
I lost consciousness while trying to save that kid, didn't I?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Wait. What happened to the kid?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
They took her to the medical room,  
but she's gonna make it? That's a relief.  
  
**Makoto：**  
How come I'm okay...?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Did you save me?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Actually, I remember what happened now.  
You swam as hard as you could using that swim ring.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Thanks for saving me.  
And sorry for being so pathetic.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  You were cool as can be.  
`Tag 6`  
**Makoto：**  
Hehe...  
You're full of it...  
  
**Makoto：**  
That reminds me.  
I swallowed a fair amount of sea water, right?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Did you perform first-aid on me, too?  
Haha. Now I'm glad I taught you.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hm?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Wait a minute.

**Makoto：**  
Hey, did you...?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Did you do it...?!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Do it?  
**Choice: (8)**  Do what?  
`Tag 7`  
**Makoto：**  
Uh, y-you know...  
K-ki...  
That thing I taught you last!

`Tag 8`  
**Makoto：**  
Hey...  
What's with that wry smile?!  
Gimme a straight answer!  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Makoto：**  
Come on, don't mess me around here!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh? You think there's someone in need over there?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Don't you dare run!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Get back here!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Tell me if you did it or not!  
  
**Narration：**  
Makoto couldn't help but blush every time  
she touched her lips for a while after that.
