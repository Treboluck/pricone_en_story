## Subtitle: One's Conviction
  
**Narration：**  
Having been taught the particulars behind the job by Makoto,  
{player} joins her in patrolling the beach.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh, look!  
That has to be it!  
  
**Makoto：**  
This is the pouch you lost,  
isn't it?  
It's even got the cat-shaped seashell you mentioned.  
  
**Girl：**  
Yeah, that's it.  
It really means a lot to me, so thanks!  
  
**Makoto：**  
No prob. Just don't drop it again, okay?  
I gotta file a report, too, so drop by the station over there later for me.  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Oh nooo!  
A fight's broken out!  
  
**Makoto：**  
A fight?! I'll be right there!  
  
**Man 1：**  
I dropped my shaved ice thanks to you bumping into me!  
  
**Man 2：**  
My ass. You're the one too busy staring at your lady  
to watch where you're going!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Okay, that's enough!  
I get where you're both coming from, so let's leave it at that!  
  
**Makoto：**  
We're at the beach, fellas.  
Don't ruin it for everyone else. Okay?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I brought this up with the people at the store.  
`Tag 1`  
**Makoto：**  
Oh, thanks.  
Here. He got you a replacement for the shaved ice that you dropped.  
  
**Man 1：**  
R-right...  
Sorry. That was pretty pathetic.  
  
**Makoto：**  
As for you, don't make weird excuses.  
He's allowed to take a stroll with anyone he wants.  
  
**Man 2：**  
Y-yeah, you're right...  
I was just jealous...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Now then. This'll be all done and done after you shake hands.  
Glad I didn't have to settle this with force!  
  
**Man 1 & 2：**  
...  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Apologies for interrupting,  
but my daughter's gone missing!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Got it!  
Mind telling me what she looks like?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Glad we were able to find her.  
All thanks to you shouting to catch her attention.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Today sure is hectic, though.  
Feels like things keep going down everywhere we go.  
  
**Makoto：**  
You must be pooped, huh?  
I'm impressed you're keeping up.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm always happy to help.  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm always happy to help you.  
`Tag 2`  
**Makoto：**  
That side of you is what Yui... Scratch that.  
I think it's pretty great, too.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Makoto：**  
What?!  
How do you manage to blurt out those kind of lines so effortlessly?!  
I really dunno how to respond when you do...  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Makoto：**  
Feels safe to assume that things've settled down around here, though.  
  
**Makoto：**  
How about we take a little break?  
Gotta rest up while we can.  
  
**PAU 1：**  
Oh! Now here's a pretty looking lady!  
  
**PAU 2：**  
Right on the money.  
How's it going, babe? You having fun?  
  
**Makoto：**  
What?  
I'm busy. Go hit on someone else, will you?  
  
**PAU 1：**  
Damn. I like a girl with a fiery attitude.  
  
**PAU 2：**  
What say we have ourselves  
a little summer escapade together?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Nah, I'm good.  
I make it a point not to get strung along by weirdo playboys.  
  
**PAU 1：**  
Aww, come on!  
  
**PAU 2：**  
Aww, come on!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Tch. They're tenacious, I'll give them that.  
Normally I'd just give them a smack on the jaw.  
  
**Makoto：**  
But I'm in beachside officer mode right now.  
Violence ain't the answer.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Um.  
I'm really sorry, but could you leave me alone?  
Please?  
  
**PAU 1：**  
What gives?  
You think you can just give kind dudes like us the cold shoulder?!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Please stop.  
`Tag 5`  
**PAU 2：**  
And who the hell are you, huh?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
{player}...  
  
**PAU 1：**  
You tryna imply that you're her man or something?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
M-my man?!  
Nah, no way! He's Yui's—  
Okay, not yet, but! Um!  
  
**PAU 2：**  
If you ain't her man, then you better scram!  
Heh. Not like anyone'd date a loser like you, anyway.  
  
**Makoto：**  
...Excuse me?  
  
**PAU 1：**  
For sure, dude!  
He ain't got what it takes to hang with a babe like this!  
  
**Makoto：**  
That does it!  
Grit your teeth, punks!  
  
**PAU 2：**  
Eeek?!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Stop her.  
`Tag 6`  
**Makoto：**  
Wha—?!  
Why're you...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Why're you covering for them?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Because I'm a beachside officer.  
**Choice: (8)**  For your sake.  
`Tag 7`  
**Makoto：**  
...!  
Yeah.  
You're right.  
I almost forgot my own job.  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Makoto：**  
For my sake?  
Ahh. Yeah, I shouldn't forget my position.  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Makoto：**  
I let my temper get the most of me there.  
Thanks for stopping me.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey, you two.  
  
**PAU 1：**  
Wh-what?  
  
**Makoto：**  
We're here to help anyone in need.  
Don't get in our way, okay?  
  
**PAU 2：**  
...  
  
**Makoto：**  
You're free to enjoy your time at the beach any way you like.  
I won't stop you.  
  
**Makoto：**  
But if you so much as try and ruin it for anyone else,  
then let's just say that you're in for a big shock.  
After all...  
  
**Makoto：**  
These are  
the beachside officers you're dealing with. ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Got it?  
  
**PAU 1：**  
Y-yeah...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Great.  
Then let's get going, {player}.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sheesh. That took up way too much time.  
Hopefully nothing else happened while we were preoccupied.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh yeah.  
I should thank you again.  
  
**Makoto：**  
You wanna know what for?  
You stopped me when I was about ready to cave their skulls in, right?  
  
**Makoto：**  
I honestly don't care what people say about me.  
  
**Makoto：**  
But the same can't be said when people talk smack about you.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hold up, me!  
You're making this way too awkward.  
  
**Makoto：**  
D-don't get the wrong idea!  
I just don't want people disrespecting my coworkers!  
  
**Makoto：**  
It's got nothing to do with you personally or anything...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Argh, forget this!  
You really throw me for a loop sometimes.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh, check it out.  
Looks like something's going down over there.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Let's get going!  
  
**Narration：**  
Makoto couldn't help but feel a sense of reliability in  
{player} as he continued to grow as a beachside officer.
