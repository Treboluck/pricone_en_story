## Subtitle: A Frantic Festival
  
**Narration：**  
{player} bumps into Akino one day  
while out walking in Landosol.  
  
**Akino：**  
Sir {player}!  
What magnificent timing!  
  
**Akino：**  
You see, I had the perfect idea for how I may become  
a true entrepreneur—namely, investing in the arts!  
  
**Akino：**  
If I am able to make a cultural contribution to this kingdom,  
my father will undoubtedly recognize my ability!  
  
**Akino：**  
So, the first step in House Wisteria's cultural patronage  
is to organize a theater festival!  
  
**Akino：**  
In fact, today is the opening day.  
If you'd like, perhaps we can partake in some theater together  
in the plaza?  
  
**Akino：**  
You would? Why thank you!  
Now then, let us be off at once!  
  
**Akino：**  
My, this is going swimmingly!  
It appears we have a full house!  
  
**Akino：**  
The festival has one-man acts, skits performed by duos,  
and even large-scale plays, so the lineup is quite diverse.  
I can hardly wait  
to see it all unfold!  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh my! It appears some people have collapsed in the wings.  
It looks to be a man and a woman...  
Sir {player}, let's go see if they are all right!  
  
**Man：**  
Ohhh... My stomach...  
  
**Akino：**  
Pardon me? Are you unwell?  
Please, drink some water.  
  
**Woman：**  
Oh, th-thank you...  
  
**Akino：**  
So, what happened here?  
  
**Man：**  
Well, our act is up next,  
but it seems the food we had in the dressing room had spoiled,  
and now our stomachs are killing us... Urgh...  
  
**Woman：**  
We rehearsed so much for our act, too...  
But it looks like... we have to cancel our show. Oww...  
And we had such a great script, too.  
  
**Akino：**  
Hm, I see... You were quite confident in your act, yes?  
  
**Man：**  
Yeah! We really wanted everyone to see it...  
If only there were others who could perform it...  
But it's probably too late to find any stand-ins.  
  
**Akino：**  
Have no fear!  
The two of us shall take the stage in your stead!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Uh, what?  
`Tag 1`  
**Man：**  
Y-you will?!  
We would be so, so grateful if you pulled it off.  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, Sir {player}...  
Forgive me for signing you up for this without asking...  
Are you upset with me?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  We'll figure something out.  
`Tag 2`  
**Akino：**  
I knew I could count on you!  
That's why you're number one on my knights-to-be list!  
  
**Akino：**  
Would you please sit up front and hold the script toward us so we can see it from the stage? Do that while  
whispering stage directions to us, and we shall do our best!  
  
**Man：**  
Th-thank you so very much.  
  
**Narration：**  
The time of Akino and {player}'s performance draws near.  
  
**Akino：**  
The show begins once this curtain rises...  
I-I've got butterflies in my stomach... Very small ones...  
  
**Akino：**  
Let's see, so in this play, a young couple are conversing at home  
when the husband's debts are revealed. However, this only  
reaffirms their love for one another.  
  
**Akino：**  
Despite featuring a cast of just two, it is quite the thorough  
production, with even a basic set for a home.  
  
**Akino：**  
Furthermore... it's a love story...  
N-not that that bothers me, mind you!  
  
**Akino：**  
A-anyway, there goes the curtain!  
We can ad-lib as needed!  
Let's give it our level best, Sir {player}!  
  
**Man：**  
Miss Akino, I'll be helping you first.  
I'll be here, holding up the script, giving you pointers,  
and doing everything I can to help.  
  
**Akino：**  
Understood. In that case, everything should go fine.  
  
**Akino：**  
\"I am a young wife, and my days spent with my husband  
are entirely free of want or discomfort. And yet,  
they are also vexing, as my love for him remains uncertain.\"  
  
**Akino：**  
\"Oh, welcome home, my dear!\"  
  
**Choice: (3)**  It's nice to be back.  
`Tag 3`  
**Akino：**  
\"Yes, it is so nice to have you back, my love.\"  
  
**Akino：**  
A newlywed husband and wife... How sublime.  
Ack, oh no!  
I've got to say my next line!  
  
**Akino：**  
\"Now then, dear, let's sit down to dinner!\"  
  
**Akino：**  
\"Oh? That paper in your hand...\"  
  
**Akino：**  
\"It's a certificate for a 100,000 rupie loan!  
M-my dear!  
When did you take on such debt?!\"  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Uh, it's n-nothing.  
`Tag 4`  
**Akino：**  
\"Right you are. 100,000 rupies? Is that all?  
Why, I can pay that next time I step out to do the shopping.\"  
  
**Man：**  
H-hey, please don't change the script!  
100,000 rupies is a ton of money!  
  
**Akino：**  
Dear me, m-  
my personal conception of money got the better of me!  
  
**Akino：**  
\"Oh, what was I thinking? 100,000 rupies is so much!\"  
  
**Akino：**  
\"B-but let's save the matter of the debt for later,  
and settle down to eat.  
We don't have enough tableware, so I'll go wash some.\"  
  
**Akino：**  
...Wash dishes? How does one wash dishes?  
  
**Akino：**  
Ah yes! You furiously swirl the dishes  
in water until all the grime washes off!  
  
**Akino：**  
\"Hyaaahhh!\"  
  
**Man：**  
Whoa, whoa! That's not how you do dishes!  
Come on, please just do it right!  
  
**Audience：**  
Bahahaha!!  
  
**Akino：**  
Next, the young wife hangs up the laundry in silence,  
biting back her anger towards her husband...  
  
**Akino：**  
Laundry pole, laundry pole... Um, which one is it again?  
Let me see...  
A-ha, I know! If I simply cut  
down a support beam with my sword, it will make a fine laundry pole!  
  
**Akino：**  
\"Sorry, dear, but I'm going to have to use a support beam  
from this room as a laundry pole. I hate to pull a weapon in the house, but... Hah!\"  
  
**Man：**  
What the?!  
Uh, okay, just skip this scene and keep going!  
  
**Audience：**  
Ahahaha! This is hilarious!!  
  
**Akino：**  
What, skip to the next scene?  
Well... we've blown through quite a few,  
so... all that remains is...  
  
**Man：**  
The last one, where you say  
\"What matter is a debt, as long as I have my love with you!\"  
and end the play with a kiss!

**Akino：**  
A-a kiss?!  
  
**Akino：**  
O-oh, I didn't know simple plays like this had such scenes...  
Who would have thought it...  
  
![103200601.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/103200601.webp)  
**Akino：**  
What are your thoughts on this?  
On, well, you know...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  The show must go on.  
**Choice: (6)**  I'm prepared to go through with it.  
`Tag 5`  
**Akino：**  
Y-yes, you're right...  
A show. This is merely a show...  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Akino：**  
P-prepared?!  
I take ityou're speaking for yourself,  
and not as my knight?  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Akino：**  
I... You see, I organized this festival  
for the good of House Wisteria.  
  
**Akino：**  
I believe that working toward the betterment of the people is,  
well... our duty.  
  
**Akino：**  
And that is why... I will do what is asked of me here.  
Are you ready, Sir {player}?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  I am.  
`Tag 8`  
**Akino：**  
Thank you, Sir {player}.  
You truly are a man of unparalleled honor.  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, here goes nothing...  
\"What matter is a debt, as long as I have my love with you...!\"  
And now, the k-kiss—

`image display end`  
**Akino：**  
O-oh dear! That section of the set I cut...  
  
**Akino：**  
Is falling down on us!  
  

---  
  
**Akino：**  
*cough* *cough* *cough*  
That turned out more like the punchline of a comedy skit...  
  
**Audience：**  
Bwahahaha!!  
Man, what a hoot!  
  
**Akino：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Narration：**  
Yaaaaay!! Bravo!!  
  
**Akino：**  
Wh-why this is...  
I-is this what they call a \"standing ovation?\"  
  
**Man：**  
Miss Akino! As the one who penned that play, you really outdid yourself up there!  
  
  
**Akino：**  
Forgive me,  
I didn't mean to make such a travesty of your hard work.  
  
**Woman：**  
The changes you two made to our script were simply amazing!  
  
**Akino：**  
Uh, what?  
  
**Woman：**  
It was meant to be a straitlaced drama,  
but after seeing those grins in the audience,  
I realized that this is the right way to go!  
  
**Man：**  
The key is that laughter can cure any marital discord!  
We cannot express enough gratitude for you  
taking our places up there!  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, um, it was nothing...  
A-at any rate, it appears things worked out in the end.  
  
**Akino：**  
I must say, that was quite thrilling, though.  
Being married to you, I mean, Sir {player}... Eheheh.  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus the first-ever House Wisteria Theater Festival  
came to an end with roaring fanfare from the audience.
