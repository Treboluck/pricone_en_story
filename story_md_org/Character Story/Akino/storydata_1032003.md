Akino heads into a forest with {player} to fix her poor sense of direction. When they inevitably get lost, she suggests that he leave her behind, but some clever thinking on his part leads them both to safety.
  
## Subtitle: Woodland Wandering
  
**Narration：**  
{player} arrives at the edge of a forest,  
having been asked to meet with Akino.  
  
**Akino：**  
Sir {player}, I very much appreciate  
you joining me here today.  
  
**Akino：**  
What brings us here, you ask?  
The truth is,  
I'm of a mind to conquer my horrid sense of direction  
once and for all today!  
  
**Akino：**  
And it was my hope that you could act as my adviser,  
if you would be so willing.  
  
**Akino：**  
You accept?!  
Wonderful! I would expect no less from the leading candidate  
for my personal knight!  
  
**Akino：**  
If ever a soul is in need, you rise to the occasion without a moment's  
hesitation. This profound spirit of charity is just one of the  
many things I value about you, Sir {player}.  
  
**Akino：**  
Now then, as for your compensation, please accept this!  
It isn't much, but I think you should be able to afford  
at least a small airship...  
  
**Akino：**  
You refuse?!  
My, how noble can one man possibly be?  
My desire to have you as my knight grows by the minute.  
  
**Akino：**  
Setting that aside for now, I first need to go over  
how we are going to correct my  
topographical shortcomings today.  
  
**Akino：**  
First, the two of us are going to enter this forest.  
Please take a look at this map.  
  
**Akino：**  
As you can see, proceeding straight from the entrance  
should lead us to a large tree.  
  
**Akino：**  
If we can reach this tree and make it back safely,  
then we shall have proven that my sense of direction is fixed,  
once and for all!  
  
**Akino：**  
But, as this is my training session, I shall take the lead.  
Sir {player}, I ask that you then follow along behind me.  
Is that acceptable to you?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Understood.  
`Tag 1`  
**Akino：**  
A superb answer!  
Well then, time to begin.  
Let us be off!  
  
**Akino：**  
That's odd... We've been proceeding according to the map,  
and yet somehow we've completely lost the trail...  
  
**Akino：**  
Wh-what's that look for?!  
I'll have you know I haven't simply been walking along  
mindlessly here!  
  
**Akino：**  
Listen and marvel at my brilliance!  
The truth is... I left markers along the path!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Markers...?  
`Tag 2`  
**Akino：**  
Heheheh. I've been scattering money behind us  
to mark the way we came!  
  
**Akino：**  
If you look behind you, you should see notes on the trail here and—  
Huh?  
  
**Akino：**  
I, I failed to account for the wind!  
All the money I left behind has blown away.  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, there's nothing we can do.  
Let's give up on reaching the tree for today,  
and make our way back to the entrance.  
  
**Akino：**  
How puzzling... I thought we were retracing our path perfectly,  
but with each step we take, we only seem to be heading  
deeper into the forest.  
  
**Akino：**  
I had no idea this could happen.  
It would seem that not only are these woodlands vast, they're  
also enchanted by a spell that leads all who enter astray.  
  
**Akino：**  
The sun has grown quite low in the sky.  
Whatever are we going to do?  
Oh yes, I know!  
We can burn money to light our way!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  What a waste!  
**Choice: (4)**  Yeah, light it up!  
`Tag 3`  
**Akino：**  
Ah, yes. You are quite right, Sir {player}.  
I suppose the common folk don't go burning money  
simply because it's dark out.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Akino：**  
Light it up indeed! I've heard that in the past, aristocrats  
set fire to paper currency as a way of bringing light  
to dark locations! ...  
Oh no!  
  
**Akino：**  
It appears that I am all out of money...  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Akino：**  
No sense in moping over it, though. We should keep moving.  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh. Um... Did you...  
Did you hear that just now?  
  
**Akino：**  
I-it was the sound of my stomach growling...  
How embarrassing.  
  
**Akino：**  
It would appear that I'm only slowing you down.  
At this rate, things will end in disaster for both of us,  
perhaps even death...  
  
**Akino：**  
Listen, if you were to leave me here, Sir {player},  
I would not hold it against you. Perhaps at least you  
can make it out of this alive.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  No, we'll get through this together.  
`Tag 6`  
**Akino：**  
Sir {player}...  
Thank you, truly...  
  
**Akino：**  
But I wonder, why is it that you are so kind?  
  
**Akino：**  
Apart from my guildmates, everyone else who approaches me  
is invariably after money from either my father or me.  
  
**Akino：**  
Now more than ever before,  
I truly wish to have you at my side as my knight.  
  
**Akino：**  
It's growing difficult to see where I'm walking now...  
May I hold onto your sleeve so that we don't get separated,  
Sir {player}?  
  
**Akino：**  
You have my thanks, once again.  
  
**Akino：**  
My... How many hours have we been wandering now?  
I'm afraid my legs can't take much more of this...  
  
**Akino：**  
Sir {player}?  
What has you so deep in thought?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Okay, let's keep moving straight ahead!  
**Choice: (8)**  Make a rope out of branches.  
`Tag 7`  
**Akino：**  
Straight ahead? Oh my, you're pulling me along so fiercely—  
  
**Akino：**  
But I understand. I place my fate in your hands.  
Let us plunge forward, wherever it may lead us!  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Akino：**  
What are you doing?  
It seems like... you're weaving a rope  
from the branches and ivy along the path.  
  
**Akino：**  
I see! If we lay this out behind us,  
we'll at least know we aren't retracing our steps!  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, Sir {player}, you truly are marvelous!  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Narration：**  
Ten minutes later...  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh! I see lights!  
We've reached the edge of the forest!  
  

---  
  
**Akino：**  
We made it out!  
And it's all thanks to you, Sir {player}!  
Still, how do we get back to town from—  
  
**Man：**  
Hey lady, what were the two of ya up to in the park  
that got y'all covered in leaves an' dirt like that?  
  
**Akino：**  
H-huh? Are you one of the townsfolk?  
W-we lost our way in the forest and—  
  
**Man：**  
Ya got *lost*?  
Uh, ya do know that this park ain't even a fifteen minute walk  
end ta end, don'tcha?  
  
**Akino：**  
But, but that means...  
Could my sense of direction really be so awful...?  
  
**Akino：**  
P-please, Sir {player}, say it isn't so!
