**Narration：**  
One day while gathering materials in a valley,  
{player} spies a girl walking by herself.  
  
**???：**  
*sigh* How troubling.  
I was simply trying to get to my father's study, and then this happens.  
Where in the world am I?  
  
**???：**  
There's no sign of anyone to ask for directions, either.  
I'll never make it back to town like this.  
  
**???：**  
Oh? I heard something...  
Just when I thought I was stuck all alone, a gentleman like yourself appears.  
  
**???：**  
I truly felt I was on my own here.  
So, what business brings you to such a remote location?  
  
**???：**  
Gathering materials?  
What an odd idea. If you need something,  
why not simply buy it?  
  
**???：**  
But, this does suit my situation rather nicely.  
Say, would you be willing to escort me to Wisteria Manor?  
  
**???：**  
Oh? You don't know where Wisteria Manor is?  
Y-you can't be serious?!  
  
**Akino：**  
Wisteria Manor. That's my home.  
Heheh, surely I needn't say any more.  
Yes, I am none other than *the* Akino Wisteria!  
  
**Akino：**  
So?  
Aren't you taken aback?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  O-Of course.  
**Choice: (2)**  Who?  
`Tag 1`  
**Akino：**  
How could you not be?  
So, I suppose I don't need to tell you about House Wisteria, either.  
  
**Akino：**  
Say, why are you avoiding my eyes?  
Wait... You, you actually don't know, do you?!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Akino：**  
What?! You mean to say you truly don't know about me or House Wisteria?!  
Why, th-that's preposterous!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Akino：**  
House Wisteria is a merchant company famous across  
the continent!  
And I am Akino Wisteria, the heiress to this  
great house.  
To think that someone could not know of us...  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh? You've lost your memory?  
Ah, well, that explains things.  
At any rate, might you be able to lead me back to town?  
  
**Akino：**  
You will?  
What a relief. Once I found myself lost here,  
I wasn't sure what would become of me. You are my savior!  
  
**Akino：**  
Phew, civilization at last.  
Wonderful work back there.  
  
**Akino：**  
I'm in your debt.  
You see, my father has been pressuring me to become a merchant in my own right recently.  
That's why I didn't have my usual escort with me today.  
  
**Akino：**  
I can make it home on my own from here.  
Well, thank you very much for your help today. Farewell.  
  
**Akino：**  
Now then, I think the manor must be...  
this way!  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh? Why are you stopping me?  
  
**Akino：**  
What? I'm going back the way we came from?  
Oh I see. I almost ended up right back where we started.  
  
**Akino：**  
The truth is, I... I lose my way quite easily.  
It would appear that I can't make it home unaided after all, even from here.  
  
**Akino：**  
If possible, I'd like to ask you to show me the rest of the way home...  
but you don't know where the manor is...  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh how troubling!  
I fear I'm doomed to spend the rest of my life lost and wandering.  
  
**Akino：**  
H-hey! Where are you going?!  
You can't just abandon me!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Ask a passerby.  
`Tag 4`  
**Akino：**  
Huh?  
Hey, what are you doing?  
  
**Passerby：**  
Oh, the Wisteria place?  
So what ya wanna do is just keep heading straight down this street.  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, I see! You didn't know the way, but you figured one of the  
locals would.  
 And if you at least know what streets to follow,  
then you can guide me home!  
  
**Akino：**  
So,  
now that you've learned the way,  
would you mind showing me back to the manor?  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, I can see the manor!  
Now there's no chance of me becoming lost again.  
  
**Akino：**  
And I owe it all to you.  
Would you please accept this as a reward?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  That sure is a big bundle of paper...  
`Tag 5`  
**Akino：**  
It's just a little token of my thanks.  
It's not much, maybe only enough to build  
a house or so.  
Is it sufficient?  
  
**Akino：**  
What's this? You say you can't accept?  
Why sir, how noble of you. I am most impressed.  
  
**Akino：**  
Tell me, what's your name?  
Sir {player}...  
I see, that has a wonderful ring to it.  
  
**Akino：**  
Say, what's your price?  
I'd like to hire you as a knight in my service. Do name your fee.  
For your services, I would gladly pay any sum.  
  
**Akino：**  
It's not about the money, you say?  
Why, what splendid chivalry!  
I'm growing fonder of you by the second.I swear, I...  
No. I *will* find a way to make you my knight.  
  
**Akino：**  
So, what's it going to take?  
I'm prepared to meet any demand! Well? Well?! *Well?!*  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh! Where are you going?!  
Wait! Please!  
  
**Narration：**  
Frightened by Akino's heavy-handed recruitment offer,  
{player} ran for the hills.
