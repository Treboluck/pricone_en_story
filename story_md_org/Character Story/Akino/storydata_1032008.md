## Subtitle: A Flight of Fancy
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is helping Akino with her shopping.  
  
**Akino：**  
Well, that was a fruitful outing!  
Thankfully, I had you to show me the way.  
  
**Akino：**  
I had heard there was a lovely shop nearby,  
but I simply couldn't find it on my own...  
Luckily, you knew exactly where it was.  
  
**Akino：**  
I mean, would you look at this gorgeous necklace?  
The way it glitters and sparkles is so pretty.  
Why, it's almost like it's glowing itself...  
  
**Akino：**  
Wh-what's this?  
It really is glowing...!  
This light, it seems somehow familiar...

**Schoolboy：**  
Hey, {player}, this class really sucks, huh?  
I can't wait for it to be over.  
  
**Schoolboy：**  
Hm? {player}, your phone's ringing.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Excuse me, {player}, I thought I made it clear that  
mobile phones are to be turned off during class!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sorry...  
`Tag 1`  
**Teacher：**  
If it's an emergency, you may go use your phone in the hallway.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Leave the classroom and answer the phone.  
`Tag 2`  
**Akino：**  
Oh there you are, {player}.  
Good morning. Lovely weather we're having today.  
  
**Akino：**  
You were in class?  
Oh yes, I see. I receive my credits on a different schedule,  
so I have no classes today.  
  
**Akino：**  
But enough about that, {player}. You see...  
I was wondering if I could have a moment of your time right now,  
if you are so inclined, of course.  
  
**Akino：**  
Also, if possible, I would like to meet in person.  
  
**Akino：**  
What? Where am I now, you ask?  
Actually... you could say that I'm practically  
on top of you right now!  
  
**Schoolboy：**  
Wh-what the heck?!  
There's a helicopter landing of the roof!  
  
**Schoolgirl：**  
Whoa! But why?  
Is it some kind of drill?  
  
**Schoolboy：**  
Let's go check it out! Whatever it is has got to be  
way more interesting than this snorefest!

**Akino：**  
Ohohoho!  
Excuse me, everyone, I apologize for the intrusion.  
I am Akino Todo. Pleased to make your acquaintance.  
  
**Akino：**  
I would like to ask you all something:  
where might I find {player}?  
  
**Teacher：**  
What?  
So we have {player} to thank for this?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Hide.  
**Choice: (4)**  Run.  
`Tag 3`

**Akino：**  
That's odd, I don't see him anywhere...  
Heh... He can try to conceal himself, but I *will* flush him out.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`

`image display end`  
**Akino：**  
He may think he can run to the ends of the earth...  
but I've already ascertained that he was just in the school.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Akino：**  
Now then, {player}. Won't you please show yourself?  
  
**Akino：**  
...So that's how it is, is it?  
Very well. If you won't come out willingly,  
we'll simply have to do things my way.  
  
**Akino：**  
I'm hereby offering a reward!  
A handsome sum bestowed upon  
whomever finds {player} for me!  
  
**Schoolboy：**  
Oh hell yeah!  
Hey, lady! He's right over here!  
  
**Akino：**  
My, so you were right here under my nose all along.  
  
**Akino：**  
What do I want, you ask?  
Fair point. I *have* neglected to tell you  
why exactly it is I'm here.  
  
**Akino：**  
I was hoping you would show me around the common streets.  
I came up with the idea last night and was so excited  
that I simply couldn't wait! And thus, here I am.  
  
**Akino：**  
You can't because you have school?  
Well then, what if there were no more classes?  
  
**Principal：**  
What the... What in the world?  
What's the meaning of all this?!  
  
**Akino：**  
Ah, what delightful timing.  
I assume you are the headmaster of this academy?  
Can I get you to cancel all classes for the day?  
  
**Principal：**  
Uh, well... That's completely ridiculous.  
  
**Akino：**  
Excuse me, but are you aware of whom you're speaking to?  
I am Akino Todo. A call to a few of my family's friends,  
and one or two of your schools will—  
  
**Principal：**  
Eep! S-say no more!  
No more school for today!  
  
**Akino：**  
Now you have permission, and there's nothing keeping you here.  
So, let us be off at once!  
Here, take my hand. We're taking off!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Where should we go?  
`Tag 6`  
**Akino：**  
Oh, I see you are already thinking about our destination.  
You were unsure at first, but now you're all gung-ho!  
I'm pleased. We are going to have a splendid day together!

**Ameth：**  
Okay, and that wraps up another dream.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Wow, that girl doesn't do anything in half-measures, does she!  
Once she's set her mind on something, she sees it through.  
Now that's a force to be reckoned with!  
  
**Ameth：**  
But Akino isn't a bad person at all,  
and thanks to you, she's beginning to understand  
how normal folks see the world, little by little.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You can stick with her until she gets a good grasp  
on how things work, right?  
If you can, she could turn out to be a really nice catch.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You being the way you are, though, you'd probably do that  
even without me telling you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyhow, that does it for today.  
Catch you later. ♪

**Akino：**  
*yawn*  
My, it would appear I dozed off.  
  
**Akino：**  
I had the most puzzling dream.  
I went to pick you up so that you could show me  
how the commonfolk spend their days.  
  
**Akino：**  
Oh, yes.  
We rode a vehicle that soars the skies like an airship, and—  
  
**Akino：**  
Wait, don't tell me you had the same dream?  
How strange...  
  
**Akino：**  
Regardless, it was very pleasant!  
Having you show me around town sounds quite enjoyable.  
  
**Akino：**  
Why, yes! No need for it to be just a dream,  
not when we can actually tour the town!  
I'm sure we will have a grand time!  
  
**Akino：**  
Now that that's settled,  
I'll come to your home with an airship to pick you up,  
maybe even as soon as tomorrow!  
  
**Akino：**  
Heheh... Sometimes dreams really do come true.  
  
**Narration：**  
The thought brought a happy smile to Akino's face.
