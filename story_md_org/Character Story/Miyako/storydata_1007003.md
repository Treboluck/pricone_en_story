## Subtitle: The Secret History of Miyako
  
**Narration：**  
Miyako has come to play with {player} as usual.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hey, {player}! Give Miyako pudding!  
And let's play together too, I guess!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hmm?  
{player}? Why the funny face?  
  
**Miyako：**  
You want to know why Miyako became a ghost?  
Ummm...  Miyako doesn't really know.  
  
**Miyako：**  
What about when Miyako was alive?  
I don't really remember that either...  
  
**Miyako：**  
What's all this anyway?  
Why're you suddenly asking weird things?  
  
**Miyako：**  
...If I remember when I was alive...  
I might know why I became a ghost?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hmmm... I guess...? It would be nice to know...  
Okay then! Let's get investigating!  
We'll find out together!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ahhhhh... But... Living was so long ago...  
Miyako really can't remember at all...  
  
**Miyako：**  
We should start simple? Remember more recent things?  
Right, right...  
Ummmm... Yesterday...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Yesterday Miyako ate pudding!!!  
The day before yesterday there was no pudding...  
But the day before that, Miyako had pudding! Ahhhh...!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hmm? Only things about pudding isn't enough?  
Uhhh... But Miyako only really remembers pudding...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Next we'll ask other people?  
Try to find someone who knows about Miyako?  
  
**Miyako：**  
That sounds easy!  
I'll go floaty around...  
And ask lots of people from above!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hey everybody!  
 If anyone knows things about Miyako,  
come and tell Miyako!  
  
**Waiter：**  
Ahh! It's you!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ahh! Can it be...  
 You know something about Miyako?!  
  
**Waiter：**  
Oh, I know you all right...  
  
**Waiter：**  
You're the brat who ate my customer's pudding yesterday!  
Get back here and pay!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Oh, I forgot... That happened yesterday too...  
Quick {player}, run awaaay!  
  
**Miyako：**  
We went lots of places,  
but nobody knew about Miyako at all...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Nobody knows even one thing  
about before Miyako was a ghost...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That's a shame...  
**Choice: (2)**  Hey, cheer up!  
`Tag 1`  
**Miyako：**  
Yes. A big shame.  
Hmm? Actually, is it really a big shame?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Miyako：**  
How do I cheer up?!  
Miyako has no energy for cheering!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Because... 'Cause... Miyako hasn't had pudding since this morning!  
Need more pudding! Puddiiiing!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Miyako：**  
We never found out how Miyako became a ghost...  
But but but! I got to go to all sorts of places with {player}!  
That was really fun!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Maybe I don't remember when I died...  
But I remember other things!  
Like... When you gave me pudding, I was super happy!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Playing with you is so much fun!  
Let's play again tomorrow!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Who cares why I became a ghost!  
Just being with {player}  
 is enough for Miyako!  
  
**Narration：**  
And who could argue with a smile like that?
