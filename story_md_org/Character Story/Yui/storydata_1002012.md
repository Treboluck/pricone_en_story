## Subtitle: The Power to Protect
  
**Narration：**  
Yui is asked to go shopping by her childhood friend, Makoto.  
She makes a shopping list while they chat.  
  
**Yui：**  
Makoto, are these all the groceries  
you want me to buy?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yeah, thanks.  
Oh yeah, you should ask *him* to go with you.  
I hear there's a gang of  
bandits haunting the highway these days, so it's a good excuse, right?  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh, really...?  
...Then I might as well invite him to tag along.  
  
**Makoto：**  
What's up with you today?  
You're unusually enthusiastic.  
  
**Yui：**  
You think so?  
  
It's just that I want to make lots more memories with Mr. Knight...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Is that so...?  
That's the spirit, Yui.  
Now, get going!  
  
**Yui：**  
Thanks, Makoto.  
Off I go.  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight,  
thanks for always helping me out.  
It's not just Makoto's groceries I have to get,  
but the whole guild's, so I can't do it alone.  
  
**Yui：**  
Heheh.  
These days I'm able to converse with him normally.  
In the past, I was so nervous that I couldn't speak to him at all...  
  
**???：**  
Guaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Yui：**  
Was that...  
a scream just now?

**Bandit 1：**  
What heroic garbage are ya tryin' to pull?  
Just hand over whatcha got!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
What's it gonna be? Yer money, or yer life!  
  
**Woman：**  
I knew I should've stayed at home...  
  
**Yui：**  
Those people over there  
are the bandits Makoto was talking about...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Protect the people from the bandits.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
Let me help!  
Everyone, please get out of here! We'll handle this!

Who the hell're they? They still got backup?  
You, go mess 'em up! Let 'em get away an' I'll eat yer eyes fer dinner!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
I'll sort 'em out!  
  
**Yui：**  
I'll stop these cretins with my magic, so you go ahead and save the  
people who are being attacked!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Not so fast!  
  
**Yui：**  
Urk!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Ya think ya can restrict my movements with magic?  
Pathetic! Hyaaa!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Block the attack on Yui.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Heh. Tryin' to be a knight in shinin' armor, protectin' the princess?  
  
**Bandit 3：**  
Havin' trouble holdin' yer sword?! Hurry up and take his head off!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
I'll admit, yer no slouch...  
But I wonder how long ya can keep it up!  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight, get back! I'll block his attacks with magic!  
At this rate, you're...!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Protect Yui.  
`Tag 4`  
**Bandit 3：**

I'll put an end to this!  
  
**Yui：**  
Ah...!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'll protect you, no matter what.  
`Tag 5`  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight...!  
  
**Bandit 3：**  
Tsk! You're one stubborn bastard...!  
  
**Yui：**  
It's always like this... I'm always being protected by him...  
Whether it's in my dreams or in real life!  
...I have to change!  
I don't want him to get hurt anymore than he already has been...!  
  
**Yui：**  
I won't... hesitate any longer!  
I don't want to lose the person I love!  
  
**Yui：**  
Hold on, Mr. Knight... I'm going to save you!  
  

---  
  
**Yui：**  
I've never used this magic before... but if I'm afraid,  
I'll never be able to protect the people I care about!  
That's why I...  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Ya think ya can burn us to ashes, do ya?!  
Come an' have a go, if ya think yer hard enough!  
  
**Yui：**  
I'll unleash my power to support and protect Mr. Knight...!  
  
**Yui：**  
O Light! Be the radiance of judgement that pierces the stars!  
  
**Yui：**  
Goooo!  
  
**Yui：**  
Shooting Star!  
  

---  
  

---  
  
**Bandits：**  
Waaaaaahhhhh!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
No, it's not possible!  
It's only targetin' us!  
  

---  
  
**Yui：**  
The power to make sure the people I care about don't get hurt is mine...  
This is my full power...!  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight! Are you okay?!  
  
**Yui：**  
That's a deep wound... Your pulse is getting weak!  
Stay with me. I *will* save you!  
  

---  
  
**Yui：**  
Flowering Heal!  
  
**Yui：**  
Even if it means sacrificing my own life...  
I'll give everything I've got so that Mr. Knight can live!  
  
**Yui：**  
So make him open his eyes...  
I beg you...!  
  
**Yui：**  
I've staunched the flow of blood...  
  
I'll take care of the bruises later...  
So all that's left for now is to repair the laceration!  
  

---  
  
**Yui：**  
You're going to be okay, Mr. Knight...  
  
**Man：**  
...Are you sure you don't need to come with us?  
  
**Yui：**  
...I'm sure. We'll stay here until I've finished treating these wounds.  
  
**Man：**  
Okay, we'll get going then...  
Thank you. Thank you ever so much...!  
  
**Yui：**  
Farewell...!  
  
**Yui：**  
...Have you come to? No need to worry anymore.  
All of the bandits have been caught and are being taken back to the city.  
  
**Yui：**  
And I'm almost done with your medical treatment, so hold on two secs.  
  
**Yui：**  
...Even when you're gravely wounded, you come to my rescue.  
Thank you.  
But the version of me who always needs your help  
won't be here much longer.  
  
**Yui：**  
From now on, I'll do my best to ensure that we can protect each other.  
You can count on it.  
  
**Yui：**  
...All right, I've completed your treatment.  
You should be able to move now.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Thank you.  
`Tag 6`  
**Yui：**  
Oh, don't worry about it.  
I just did what I could...  
  
**Yui：**  
...Huh?  
...My eyes are welling up... What? Why...?  
  
**Yui：**  
It's so strange...  
The tears just won't stop...  
  
**Yui：**  
*sniff, sniff*...  
  
**Yui：**  
*sniff*... Mr. Knight...  
I was so scared...  
  
**Yui：**  
You were attacked so viciously...  
And you were down and out.  
I thought that was it—that you'd never move again...  
  
**Yui：**  
I was terrified...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Wipe Yui's tears.  
`Tag 7`  
**Yui：**  
Th-...  
...Thank you.  
  
**Yui：**  
Your hand is so warm...  
  
**Yui：**  
...Is it my imagination, or is his face getting closer and closer...?  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight...?  
  
**Yui：**  
This is the first time we've locked eyes so close to each other...  
It totally feels like  
we're about to kiss...  
  
**Yui：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Wait to see if her tears have stopped.  
`Tag 8`  
**Yui：**  
...I'm so confused.  
I have no idea when I should open my eyes...!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Heeey! Yui!  
You okay?!  
  
**Yui：**  
Uwehh?!  
Ah! I-it's Makoto!  
...Ahem. Over here!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I was worried when I heard you got attacked by bandits!  
You all right?  
  
**Yui：**  
Yeah! I'm totally fine!  
...Mr. Knight was protecting me.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I see...!  
Good job, {player}!  
  
**Yui：**  
...If Makoto hadn't just shown up,  
I wonder if Mr. Knight and I...  
would've ended up kissing...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yui? You sure you're okay?  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh?!  
Ah, yeah! Nothing wrong at all!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Good to hear. I'm glad you're fine.  
...Did you two get along well?  
I bet you made some good memories.  
  
**Yui：**  
Memories...  
Definitely. But it's not like anything good happened,  
so I wouldn't exactly call them good memories...  
But today was certainly unforgettable.  
  
**Yui：**  
Thank you, Makoto, for giving me the courage I needed.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Anytime! I'm happy for you, Yui!  
Let's go grab a bite to eat!  
You're coming too, right?  
  
**Makoto：**  
...What? You've got work to do?  
  
I wanted to squeeze all the juicy details out of you.  
  
**Yui：**  
Please, Makoto, not now...  
  
**Yui：**  
...Mr. Knight! Thank you for everything you do...  
See you soon!  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight... No matter how badly or how many times you're hurt,  
I'll heal you up.  
Because if you're happy, then I can be happy too.  
  
**Yui：**  
But one day, I know... I'll be able to  
put a smile on your face!  
  
**Narration：**  
As she watched {player}'s figure disappear into the  
distance, Yui gained a little bit of self-confidence knowing that she  
had saved him for once.
