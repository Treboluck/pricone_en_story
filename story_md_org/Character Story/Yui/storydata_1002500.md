Th-thank you!  
I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for all your help!

You're thanking me...?  
Oh—could this be because it's my birthday today...?

**Yui：**  
Oh, I know!  
 If you happen to have time...  
would you like to taste-test a new recipe I learned?  
  
**Yui：**  
Eheheh... Thanks!  
 I'll try to make sure it turns out delicious!  
After all, seeing you smile is the best gift I could ask for...  
Wait, n-n-no, it's nothing! I didn't say anything!
