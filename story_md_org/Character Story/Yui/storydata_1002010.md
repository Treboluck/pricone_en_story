**Narration：**  
One day, after {player} and Yui finish work,  
they are returning to Landosol from a village beyond the mountains.  
  
**Yui：**  
Now that we've come this far, we should be able to see the city any  
minute now...  
  
**Yui：**  
The job I had with Mr. Knight was fairly easy.  
I'm glad we got it done without a hitch...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
What?! Why's there a monster here?!  
We're so close to the city...!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Be careful.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
Yeah... This monster's covered in injuries.  
It must have been in a fight...  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRRAAAAAOOOGGHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
It collapsed...  
I guess it's already been weakened.  
  
**Yui：**  
Wh-what?! I'm losing my footing!  
Mr. Knight!  
  
**Yui：**  
...I can't believe we slipped all the way down here...  
I guess we can't make it back up to the road we fell from, huh?  
  
**Yui：**  
Look! There's a cave over there!  
Should we go inside...?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's see what's in there.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
Don't worry if it's dark.  
I'll brighten up the place using my magic.  
  
**Yui：**  
...There are many signs of a human presence in here.  
If I'm right, then maybe there's another exit somewhere.  
  
**Yui：**  
I only said that to make the situation seem more hopeful...  
But whether there's actually another exit or not,  
I have no idea...  
  
**Yui：**  
If there isn't, then we're stuck,  
seeing as we can't call anyone for help...  
  
**Yui：**  
I wonder if we'll be able to get out of here...  
  
**Yui：**  
I-I actually don't mind being trapped here with you...  
...Just kidding.  
Sorry, this isn't the time for jokes.  
  
**Yui：**  
Eek! So cold...  
Something just dripped on me...  
  
I don't think it's water, though. It's kind of sticky—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
Ahhhhhh!  
M-m-m-monster?!  
So it wasn't water...  
it was monster drool...?!  
  
**Yui：**  
Ewww... gross...  
But that's the last thing I should be worrying about!  
We need to put some distance between ourselves and the monster!  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight, this is where I use my magic—!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
Another one?!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
They keep coming!  
Just how many are there...?! We can't escape like this...!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
Look out!  
  
**Yui：**  
My barrier guarded us from the attack...  
But...  
  
**Yui：**  
If I run out of magic power, the barrier will disappear...  
Before that happens, we need to carve out an escape route...  
  
**Yui：**  
I wish... there was something we could use  
to help us make a getaway...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
It's no use... They're all getting worked up.  
If only we could somehow distract them for a second...!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
My barrier's going to break...!  
  
**Yui：**  
...Huh...?  
That one monster is injured...  
Could this be the monsters' territory?  
  
**Yui：**  
...I see. It must have fought the injured monster we saw earlier!  
Since one of their kind sustained injuries in that fight, the monsters  
are also cautious of us now...!  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight, there's something I want to try. Do you mind?  
  
My barrier will disappear, and if I fail,  
there's a chance we'll both end up badly injured...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I believe in you.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yui：**  
Thank you...!  
...Healing light, come forth!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
Ah...!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
...They've stopped attacking?  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
They're leaving...  
Wait, maybe they're not. They're looking back at us...  
Oh, maybe...!  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight, maybe we should follow them.  
I think they want to tell us something!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
This is... Can you believe it? Look over there!  
There's a town! ...Thank goodness. We're saved...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Yui：**  
The monsters are returning to their territory...  
If we'd fought them, we probably would've endedup like the  
monster that collapsed right in front of us...  
  
**Yui：**  
...Mr. Knight.  
Thanks for putting your trust in me earlier.  
  
**Yui：**  
If something dangerous like that happens again,  
will you still believe in me...?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'll always believe in you.  
`Tag 4`  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight...  
I'll continue to believe in you too.  
From now until forever...!  
  
**Narration：**  
After sensing {player}'s deep trust in her,  
Yui vowed to believe in him in the same way.
