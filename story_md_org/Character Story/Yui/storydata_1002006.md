**Makoto：**  
Yui. Throw me a bone here.  
Having tea together and all that is good,  
but PLEASE tell me you didn't just let him go home after that.  
  
**Yui：**  
...Sorry. That's exactly how it went.  
He had work lined up as well,  
so I didn't have a choice but to see him off.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Figures...  
Listen. I hate to break it to you,  
but you're gonna be friend-zoned for life at this rate. You really  
wanna be shopping for books together like fifty years from now?  
  
**Yui：**  
Err, I'd rather avoid that...  
  
**Makoto：**  
I get that you're scared, but there's an easy solution to that.  
You gotta find out how he feels about you first, so get your butt outta here and go do that!  
  
**Yui：**  
Ehhhhh?!  
  
**Yui：**  
I can't believe I actually got kicked out of my own guildhouse.  
Makoto sure means business...  
  
**Yui：**  
Find out how he feels about me? How am I even supposed to  
do that?  
This is Mr. Knight we're talking about. I'm not even  
sure where he'd be at this time...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Right here.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
Whoa!  
G-good afternoon. Fancy meeting you here, huh?  
  
**Yui：**  
Hey... You wouldn't happen to have a moment, would you?  
If you do, can we move somewhere else?  
  
**Yui：**  
Here should do.  
Thanks for coming along.  
  
**Yui：**  
First of all, thanks for helping me with my shopping the other day.  
I learned a lot of new magic thanks to that.  
  
**Yui：**  
For example...  
  
**Yui：**  
How do you feel? Nice and warm?  
In simple terms, this spell both heats you up and makes  
ice-based attacks ineffective.  
 I'd been wanting to learn it for a while.  
  
**Yui：**  
Wait a minute. What am I doing?!  
This isn't the time for lectures on magic!  
  
**Yui：**  
Urgh. How am I supposed to ask him something like that?!  
Help me out here, Makoto!  
  
**Yui：**  
I-  
it's pretty nice, isn't it? It'll come in handy if  
we're ever in a cold region and someone needs help.  
  
**Yui：**  
Or I hope so, at least. I just want to be useful...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You always have been.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
Oh... You think?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You're more important than you realize.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yui：**  
Important, huh...  
Really? That wasn't just my own selective hearing?  
  
**Yui：**  
Wow. I didn't know he felt that way about me...  
  
**Yui：**  
I won't lie. It's really... fulfilling to hear him say that.  
It's giving me this warm, fuzzy feeling.  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight...  
I really need to know. Is there anyone he likes?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  What do you mean by \"like?\"  
`Tag 4`  
**Yui：**  
Huh?! D-did I... Did I say that out loud?! Uhh...  
W-well, you see...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'm really curious.  
`Tag 5`  
**Yui：**  
Hmm... You are an amnesiac, now that I think about it.  
Did you forget what it means to like someone, too?  
  
**Yui：**  
Let's see here... If you like someone, then you get all sorts of  
feelings when you're with them. Excitement. Happiness. That sort of stuff.  
You also wish you could spend more time with them.  
  
**Yui：**  
Of course, you can like someone in the same way that you like food.  
  
But that's not how I meant it.  
It's a bit... deeper than that.  
  
**Yui：**  
For example,  
I like Hiyori and Rei a lot.  
But I don't LIKE like them.  
  
**Yui：**  
Sorry, this must sound really confusing.  
I get the idea behind it myself,  
but it's just really hard to explain...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Is there anyone you like?  
`Tag 6`  
**Yui：**  
Me?!  
Err, uhh...  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh gosh, oh gosh!  
How am I supposed to respond?! Should I just be blunt?!  
  
**Yui：**  
Th-that's a secret!  
One day I'll tell you, so be patient until then!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I will.  
`Tag 7`  
**Yui：**  
Thanks...  
  
**Yui：**  
It might take a while, but one day I'll do it.  
One day I'll find the courage to tell him.  
  
**Yui：**  
That day will come. I promise.
