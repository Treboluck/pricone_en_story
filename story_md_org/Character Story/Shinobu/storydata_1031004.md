Shinobu informs {player} that he is popular with a number of female ghosts. This gives her father some bad ideas, but then they wake up from Ameth's dream. Even in real life, Shinobu seems jealous of the spirits haunting him.
  
## Subtitle: A Haunting Experience
  
**Narration：**  
One day while walking through Landosol,  
{player} runs into Shinobu.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh, {player}. Hello again.  
And, ah... Hello to the rest of you, too.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  \"The rest of you\"?  
`Tag 1`  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh, when I say \"the rest of you,\"  
I mean all the spirits who are merrily haunting you.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Whenever I meet you,  
you seem to be surrounded by lively spirits.  
You must never be lonely.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...Huh? You can't see or hear anything?  
Oh, of course... normal people can't see them.  
Since I am a spirit medium, I can see them clear as day.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh, if you'd like, I could try...  
 Aahhh!  
Wh-where is all this light coming from?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Aaaaahhhhh!  
  

---  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh, {player}. Good evening.  
This is a nice surprise.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Where are you all off to tonight?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  \"All\"? It's just me, actually...  
`Tag 2`  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh, I'm sorry.  
All those people surrounding you are spirits, aren't they?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Since they're so clearly visible, for a moment  
I thought they were living people.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...That's right. You're surrounded by a crowd of spirits as usual.  
And almost all of them female, too.  
How do you make yourself so popular?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  That's kind of scary...  
**Choice: (4)**  I'm popular, huh?  
`Tag 3`  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh, there's nothing to be afraid of.  
They all seem incredibly fond of you,  
and eager to protect you from harm.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
What kind of spirits are they, you ask?  
Well, ah... Putting it into words might be tricky...

`Tag 4`  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh, yes. With so many of them haunting you,  
I imagine they'll drain your spirit of all its energy  
in no time at all.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
What's wrong? You seem awfully flustered.  
...You don't want to be drained dry?  
Oh, I see.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Well then, perhaps somebody should warn the spirits  
not to drain your energy so much.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Shinobu：**  
I know. Let me try channeling them.  
I think it'll be easiest if you meet them yourself  
and have a little chat.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I'll allow them to briefly possess my body.  
In a moment you'll be speaking not to me, but to the spirits.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...  
  
**Shinobu?：**  
{player}! It's great to see you!  
  
**Shinobu?：**  
Huh? You don't know me?  
 Well, how rude!  
I'm always watching over you, you know!  
  
**Shinobu?：**  
It's me! Your very own great-grandmother!  
  
**Shinobu?：**  
You can always count on old Granny  
to keep you nice and safe!  
  
**Shinobu?：**  
Hold on a minute!  
You don't need to protect him, because I will!  
  
**Shinobu?：**  
Who am I? Just a deceased policewoman who's madly  
in love with you.  
 If anyone tries to lay a finger on you,  
I'll send them straight to the slammer!  
  
**Shinobu?：**  
Well then, if {player} ever gets injured,  
he'll need a nurse like me to look after him!  
I'll give him a love injection!  
  
**Shinobu?：**  
Eheheheh... You've got such talent for attracting trouble...  
I've never encountered such an intriguing subject...!  
  
**Shinobu?：**  
I'll write an epic novel based on your exploits,  
and finally make my big debut!  
Or, uh, I would, if I was still living...  
  
**Shinobu?：**  
Yo, bossman!  
I'm gonna keep you safe even if it kills me!  
Wait, I'm already dead, aren't I?  
  
**Shinobu?：**  
BI-BEEP... BZZZT...  
\\ I AM A CYBORG. A CYBORG GHOST.  
\\ YOU WILL BECOME ROBOTIC AND GHOSTLY LIKE ME.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Okay, now I'm more scared.  
`Tag 6`  
**Shinobu：**  
Whew... That should do for today's channeling, I think.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Hmmm...? My father says,  
 \"Ghosts or otherwise,  
it makes me sick to see you surrounded by girls, brat.  
I'll curse you to death.\"  
 ...His words, not mine.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Really, Father, that's so childish.  
Besides, {player}... is a good person!  
I... I can see why they...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...Huh?!  
Father, are you serious?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Um... Now he says,  
 \"Fine, how's this?!  
I'll set you up with one of those ghostly ladies, brat!\"  
...His words, not mine.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
\"With my spirit powers, I'll give you the ability to see 'em!  
No point wasting time with living girls when you've got  
so many dead ones, right?!\"  
 ...So he says.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
\"In return, stay away from my Shinobu!\" he says...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  That's, uh, a very nice offer, but...  
**Choice: (8)**  You've got yourself a deal!  
`Tag 7`  
**Shinobu：**  
\"Don't be shy, brat! Which one's your type?!\" he's saying...  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Shinobu：**  
\"Great! I'm on it!\" he's saying...  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Shinobu：**  
W-wait a minute, Father!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Shouldn't we help these spirits pass on to the next life?  
I'll give {player} a proper exorcism.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Got that, {player}?  
I'll blast those spirits away from you,  
so you should really just forget all about them.

**Ameth：**  
Ahaha! That was hilarious!  
So, how did you like my little present?  
  
**Ameth：**  
All that just now was a little dream I put together for you  
based on your memories with Shinobu. See?  
Wasn't it the best?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I've gotta say, I didn't realize your talents for attracting ladies  
worked on dead girls, too!  
I'm no expert when it comes to \"that\" world, so that was a surprise!  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's funny, too... I always thought I was the only girl  
who could appreciate your unique charms...  
...Haha, just messing with you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, you collect more of those lost memories,  
and I'll whip up more dreams like this for you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Dreaming of your history with lots of different girls...  
That's what'll lead you to the truth of this world.  
So good luck!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, see you later! ♪

**Shinobu：**  
Unnhh... What was... I just...?  
It looks like I must have fallen asleep...  
{player}, are you all right?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
What? You just had a dream?  
A dream where I channeled spirits for you?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
That is a surprise. I just had the exact same dream myself.  
How very unusual. Did our unconscious minds  
sync up in the astral plane somehow?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Huh? You'd like me to try channeling them for real?  
W-well, that is within my power...  
But are you sure it's the best idea?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I, ah, don't think it's wise for you to get too close  
to those female ghosts.  
 Why don't you bring some  
male ghosts along sometime, and we can try it then?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Huh? Why do the ghosts' genders matter?  
U-um, well, I mean... Ahhh...  
  
**Narration：**  
Shinobu seemed to be more than a little jealous  
of the spirits haunting {player}.
