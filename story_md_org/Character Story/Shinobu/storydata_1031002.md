## Subtitle: An Unlikely Exorcism
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh... {player}.  
It's been a while.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Hey there, brat! You're looking perky!  
Why don't you die already?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father. Don't greet our friend with death wishes.  
That's quite rude.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Bah! I'd rather not talk to him in the first place!  
Talking to men is a waste of my time on this earth!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Technically, that time is over...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh—my father was originally a famous spirit medium,  
but he lost his living body in a little accident on the job.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Though he's already dead, his powers are as strong as ever,  
so he still takes on exorcism jobs and the like.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I often help him out with his work.  
In fact, we're on our way to an exorcism right now.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
A spirit has been appearing repeatedly, and scaring the local  
residents.  
 We received several requests from the same area,  
so we're heading there to investigate.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
I don't care if it's one request or five score and eleventy!  
I accepted this job for one reason...  
  
**Skullfather：**  
'Cause they're saying it's a beautiful lady ghost!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
So this is where all the spirit sightings were reported.  
Father, it sounds like she mainly appears at night,  
so let's wait here awhile.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'll help too!  
**Choice: (2)**  This seems dangerous...  
`Tag 1`  
**Shinobu：**  
That's quite all right.  
My father and I have completed many exorcisms,  
and we have never yet failed.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Every request we've accepted has ended in success.  
Except for the time my father became a skull, I suppose.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Shinobu：**  
No, we'll be fine.  
My father is a professional, so exorcism is simple for him.  
And I for my part have helped him countless times.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shinobu：**  
So please, you should hurry home.  
It's likely that the spirit won't even appear today,  
so this will be quite boring.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...You want to wait anyway?  
I see...  
In that case, let's hide here and see what happens.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Ah! Something approaches! What is that?  
  
**???：**  
\"...\"  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Ahh! What a beaut!  
I knew this job was a winner!  
Hey there! How's it hanging, gorgeous ghostie?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Ahh... Father...  
 Honestly, now.  
I hope you're going to actually exorcise her...  
  
**???：**  
\"Well done! That's the correct answer!\"  
  
**Skullfather：**  
O-owwwww! Wh-what's this ghost's deal?!  
It's got a body...?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Huh? It's not a ghost?  
  
**Skullfather：**  
C-come to think of it...  
Aren't there supposed to be monsters in human form  
prowling around lately?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh... You mean the \"Shadow\" rumors...?  
Then is this one of them? Not a ghost, but a monster?  
  
**???：**  
\"Hee hee... Does it suit me?\"  
\"Okay, let's pick up the pace!\"  
\"Time for a pop quiz!\"  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Guahh! Th-this ain't good...  
I can't exorcise it if it's not a spirit!  
Shinobu! Let's make a tactical retreat!  
  
**???：**  
\"Try to behave yourself a little better.\"  
  
**???：**  
\"That looks fun! I wanna play!\"  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Th-there are more Shadows all around!  
Father, we're surrounded! What now?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
{player}, you at least should make a run for it!  
You don't have anything to do with this exorcism...  
I'll hold them off while you escape!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I was such a fool...  
You were worried about us from the start.  
But in the end, we put you in danger...  
  
**???：**  
\"Hey, that tickles!\"  
  
**Shinobu：**  
O-oh no! It's right behind me!  
Aaaaahhhh!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Protect Shinobu.  
`Tag 4`  
**Shinobu：**  
{player}! A-are you all right?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
H... How dare you harm {player}...?!  
I won't forgive you!

**Shinobu：**  
I swear on my life, I will protect him!  
Haaaaahhh!  
  
**???：**  
Greeeeeaghhh!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I... defeated it? Where did I find this strength?  
No, that can wait till they're all defeated!  
Haaaaahhhh!  
  
**???：**  
Yeeerghhhhh!  
  
`image display end`  
**Shinobu：**  
*pant* *pant* *pant*  
I... I think that should be the last of them...?  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Sh-Shinobu! You were amazing!  
You totally wrecked all those monsters by yourself!  
That's my daughter, all right!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
No... You're wrong, Father.  
The one you should really be thanking is {player}.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
What? I didn't see him do anything but watch... Hmm?  
Hey, brat, why're you sweating buckets?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
He lent me his strength to defeat all those monsters.  
I'm not sure what kind of magic he used...  
But I'm right, aren't I?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  See, I have this sword...  
`Tag 5`  
**Skullfather：**  
That sword lets you power up Shinobu's abilities?  
That's hard to believe... But the proof's in the pudding, eh?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
But it must take a lot out of you too, right?  
The whole time I was fighting,  
you looked like you were struggling...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Thank you so much, {player}.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Hmmm. If we keep bringing him along to our exorcisms,  
it'll make my job easier... Shinobu'll be safer, too...  
And it's not like I care if the brat has to struggle...  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Hm? Hang on, though.  
I don't like seeing him so close to Shinobu!  
This is a tricky little conundrum... Very tricky...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father...  
If you keep being rude to {player}, I'll make you regret it.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Aaargh! My daughter's a demon!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
{player}... Thank you again for all your help today.  
I swear to repay you with my own strength.  
Next time... I'll be the one to protect you.
