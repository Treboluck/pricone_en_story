## Subtitle: Day of the Skull
  
**Narration：**  
Today, {player} and Shinobu are having  
a friendly conversation.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
That really happened?  
Haha... You tell the most interesting stories, {player}.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Hrmmph...  
Hey, Shinobu! It's high time we went home!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Wait, Father!  
We were just getting to the most interesting part...  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Just getting to it...?  
You've been yapping away there for hours!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Grrrrrrrr...  
Shinobu's getting far too friendly with that brat lately...  
C-could it be... she's developed feelings for...?!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
N-no, that couldn't possibly be right!  
Shinobu's still just a kid who can't do a thing without  
her daddy! Honestly, she's such a handful! Y-yeah...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
So what happened was...  
 Aaahh!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Catch Shinobu before she falls.  
`Tag 1`  
**Skullfather：**  
Whaaaaaaat?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh, I'm so sorry, {player}!  
I just... lost my balance for a moment...  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Shinobu and the brat... Shinobu and the brat...  
Shinobu and the brat...!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Grrraaaagghhhh!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
F-Father?!  
  
**Woman：**  
Aaaahhh! A surge of magic is tearing the buildings apart!  
  
**Man：**  
R-run for it!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
S-stop this! Father!  
You can't let your magic run wild in the city!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Grrraaaagghhhh!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
M-my father is out of control!  
It's like he's gone blind with rage...  
Wh-what could have caused this?  
  
**Royal Knight A：**  
Where's the rampaging monster?! Is it that skull?!  
  
**Royal Knight B：**  
Let's take it down! All knights, chaaaaaarge!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Grrraaaagghhhh!  
  
**Royal Knight A：**  
Aaaaaghhhhhh!  
  
**Man：**  
Even the royal knights are no match?!  
At this rate, Landosol will be destroyed!  
  
**Woman：**  
A devil has come for us! See the flames of Megiddo...  
Here to herald the end of the world!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Wh-what should we do?  
My father is an esteemed channeler blessed with boundless  
magical energy! I can't think of any way to overpower him...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
But... what could have triggered all this in the first place?  
If it's something he feels strongly about, only women...  
or women... or women come to mind…  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...Huh? What about me?  
I suppose it's true that he dotes on me...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh! It couldn't be... just now... When I...  
 e-ehm...  
When I... t-tripped into your arms...?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh, Father, you idiot! Going wild over a thing like that...  
But in that case, I can't see how we're going to stop him...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's try to reason with him.  
**Choice: (3)**  Slap me in the face.  
`Tag 2`  
**Shinobu：**  
R-right, of course.  
Father! You have to stop destroying the city!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
You've got the wrong idea about how things are  
between me and {player}!  
It's not like I have any... Um, I mean... Ahhh...  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Shinobu：**  
Huh?!  
I couldn't possibly do that!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...You want to show my father that we don't get along at all?  
I-I can't do that!  
After all, I... I actually feel... U-umm...!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Shinobu：**  
Aaaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
......... *kiss* .........  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...Ahh!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I-I-I-I'm so sorry!  
I-I just fell over, and my lips...?!  
Wh-wh-wh-wh-what did I just...?!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Wha-wha-wha-whaaaargh?!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
B-but... It was just an accident! Nothing special!  
I-it was only the cheek!  
N-nothing to worry about, really!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Y-y-y-y-y-you braaaaaaaat!!!  
You're dead, you're dead, you're dead!  
You are sooooooo dead!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Shut up for a moment, Father!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Guaaaarghhh!  
  
**Man：**  
N-no way!  
That girl defeated the monster!  
  
**Woman：**  
Th-then the city is... The world is saved!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I... I'm so sorry, {player}!  
I-I'll wipe your cheek clean right now. Hold still a second!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...Huh? Thanks for stopping my father's rampage?  
Who cares about that right now?!  
I just... I just...!  
 Oh, I can't think straight!  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
You two, could we talk a moment?  
We've got witnesses claiming this monster  
is a relative of yours...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Never mind that! {player},  
y-  
you're not getting the wrong idea, are you?!  
That was just an accident, and...  
  
**Narration：**  
With Shinobu so thoroughly flustered, it took quite some time  
to get everything cleared up with the authorities...
