**Narration：**  
One day, in the early afternoon...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
By the way, Rem, what do you usually do in your free time?  
  
**Rem：**  
In my free time?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes, exactly!  
Lately, you've been keeping our guildhouse  
as spick-and-span as spick-and-span can be, right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We really appreciate it,  
but we also feel kind of bad making you do all that work...  
  
**Rem：**  
Oh, please don't worry about that.  
I do it because I like to.  
  
**Rem：**  
All the cleaning and cooking at the Orphanage,  
and cleaning this guildhouse too. It's what I enjoy doing.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, I see, I see~!  
Even still, though, we can't let you do all this for nothing.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm... If only we had some way  
to repay you or take your mind off things...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She could do Gourmet Guild stuff with us?  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh! That's a nice idea! I like it!  
It'll be tons of fun!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hey Rem, hey Rem,  
how do you feel about delicious delicacies~?  
  
**Rem：**  
Delicious food?  
I suppose I like it as much as anyone...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Our mission in the Gourmet Guild  
is to feast on all the wonderful flavors the world has to offer!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Why don't you come along for a change?  
I was actually just about to go and get some ingredients!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
How crazy is that? Doesn't it make your heart dance?!  
  
**Rem：**  
Oh, I see. Gathering ingredients...  
Are you sure I wouldn't be in the way if I went along?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Not a chance in the world!  
Actually,  
 good food's always tastier the more people you share it with!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You're with me on that, right, {player}?  
  
**Rem：**  
Even Master {player}...?  
Very well, then. I will  
 take you up on your offer.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Excellent!  
Well then, let's us get going, shall we~?!  
  
**Rem：**  
So, ah...  
I was happy to come along with you, but...  
  
**Rem：**  
Um, Miss Pecorine? Why are we out here in the mountains?  
Weren't we going to buy ingredients?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ah, but that's  
 where you're wrong, my dear Rem!  
Our target today is a legendary fruit that grows on this mountain!  
  
**Rem：**  
L-legendary, you say?!  
That sounds like a very ambitious objective indeed.  
  
**Rem：**  
I must apologize for agreeing to come along on this trip so lightly.  
I am a failure as a Gourmet Guild member...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No, no, it's totally fine!  
All people are equal in the face of delicious food!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
In fact, I'd never heard of this legendary fruit before, either.  
But {player} heard some rumors about it  
from a group of adventurers in the city!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  They say the taste sends you straight to heaven.  
**Choice: (3)**  They say it sells for an unbelievable price.  
`Tag 2`  
**Rem：**  
Well, that does sound enticing!  
I would love to have the chance to taste it!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Sell it?! As if we'd consider that!  
Our mission is to find it  
 and taste it for ourselves!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm planning to use the legend  
as an ingredient in the most amazing dessert!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What if it really sends us to heaven?  
 That would be crazy!  
But doesn't it sound super exciting, too?  
  
**Rem：**  
Um... To be honest, my heart's starting to race a little!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Right?!  
Excitement and sustenance all in one!  
That's why I love our Gourmet Guild! ♪  
  
**Rem：**  
Hee hee... Very well, then.  
  
**Rem：**  
For today, I too will be a fellow member of the Gourmet Guild.  
  
**Rem：**  
Let us find this legendary fruit  
and sate our hunger for excitement and nutrition alike!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Legendary fruit, here we come!  
`Tag 5`  
**Rem & Pecorine：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Rem：**  
Still, I must say these mountain trails are very uneven.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
True enough!  
We'd all better be extra careful not to trip and fall.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If we get injured now,  
it'll spoil our ability to enjoy the feast ahead of us!  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes, I'll be careful.  
...Hm? Where's Master {player}?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ummm... Huh~?  
I thought he was right next to us just now...  
  
**Rem：**  
You don't think he might have slipped down one of these slopes...?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I found it!!!  
`Tag 6`  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, I guess there was nothing to worry about.  
  
**Rem：**  
So it seems.  
I'm glad he wasn't hurt...  
  
**Rem & Pecorine：**  
...  
  
**Rem & Pecorine：**  
Huh?! You found the fruit?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Amazing work, {player}!  
I knew we could count on you!  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes, I am impressed as well!  
Sure enough, I see in {player}'s hand  
a most unfamiliar-looking fruit...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes, it looks...  
 kind of like a tentacle?  
  
**Rem：**  
It does look very much like that.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  What's up, you two?  
`Tag 7`  
**Pecorine：**  
That might turn out to be  
a slightly awkward question to answer, but...  
  
**Rem：**  
Master {player}!  
There's a monster behind you!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wooooow!  
That's a big ol' monster all right!  
  
**Rem：**  
Master {player}, quickly, this way!  
The two of us will protect you!  
  
![109700401.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/109700401.webp)  
**Pecorine：**  
Rem!  
I'll charge at the monster,  
so can you time your attack to match?!  
  
**Rem：**  
You'll charge in ahead, I follow, and then we...?  
All right, understood!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hup! Hahh! Yahh!  
Whoa-oa-oa... You're pretty strong for a monster...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But if you only look at me,  
you won't see what's coming at you from behind!  
  
**Rem：**  
Hup! Haaaahhhhh...!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And then I follow through with an attack of my own!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
`image display end`  
**Rem：**  
W-we managed to beat it!  
But I can't believe the legendary fruit was really a monster...  
  
**Rem：**  
I suppose legends aren't that easy to find in real life...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't let it get you down, Rem!  
A seeker of delicious food  
has to be prepared to face a few disappointments!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Maybe we didn't find a legendary fruit.  
But we still found ourselves a tasty ingredient for dinner!  
  
**Rem：**  
Hm? H-huh...?!  
A tasty ingredient?  
 You mean this monster itself?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes!  
 Monsters can be tastier than you'd think!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Besides, what we kill, we should eat.  
Living at the top of the food chain, I feel like that's  
 our duty, in a way.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Is that weird?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Not at all.  
`Tag 8`  
**Rem：**  
...No, it's not strange at all!  
It's a wonderful philosophy.  
 I'm moved by your passion!  
  
**Rem：**  
Very well, then.  
Please allow me to handle tonight's cooking.  
I promise I will prepare a true gourmet feast!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh~!  
 Sounds crazy! I can't wait!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well then, we can't keep Kokkoro and Karyl waiting.  
Let's head back to the guildhouse! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
You said you were after a legendary fruit,  
so I was expecting some kind of delicious dessert...  
  
**Karyl：**  
So why the actual heck  
did you bring back a great big monster instead?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm super sorry, Karyl! I was hoping to satisfy your insatiable cravings  
with a delicious bowl of heavenly sweetness, too...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Who're you calling insatiable?!  
And coming from the Glutton Queen herself!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
M-Miss Karyl, don't be like that.  
 Let us just be thankful  
that my lord, Miss Pecorine and Miss Rem returned safely...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, of course that's good, but...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Calm down a little, Karyl!  
Rem's cooking up a feast for us in the kitchen.  
I'm sure it's going to taste amazing!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Urgh... Lately, thanks to all of your influence,  
I'm almost getting used to eating monsters, and that scares me...  
  
**Karyl：**  
What? \"Spoken like a true Gourmet Guild member\"?  
Oh, shut up!  
  
**Rem：**  
Thank you for your patience!  
Everyone, the meal is fully prepared,  
so please come in and take your seats!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh,  
 it's the moment of truth!  
What kind of food will it be? My heart's all aflutter!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Rem's monster cuisine... I must take notes myself.  
My lord, please take a seat beside me.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Time to face the music, I guess...  
Gotta be prepared for the worst kind of horrors...  
  
**Rem：**  
My apologies once more for the extended wait.  
Well then, I will begin by serving today's appetizers.  
  
**Karyl：**  
N-no matter what it looks like...  
Wait, huh?  
 This food looks... pretty normal!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Rather than normal,  
I would say it appears positively delectable.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huhhh?! This is too amazing!  
I don't think I've ever seen a monster dish that looks like this!  
  
**Karyl：**  
H-hold your horses!  
We can't make any judgments till we taste it!  
  
**Karyl：**  
That's right... The moment when hope turns to despair  
is always the most painful of all...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl, what could have driven you to such insights...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Gahhh... Fine, I'll eat it!  
It's do or die!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Mmph! *munch munch*...  
Uh-huh... Yeah... Hmm... *munch munch*...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
H-how is the food, Miss Karyl?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Karyl? Is it all right?  
  
**Karyl：**  
...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Rem, this food...!  
  
**Rem：**  
Y-yes,  
 Miss Karyl?  
Was the meal not to your liking?  
 If so, I...  
  
**Karyl：**  
This food...  
 How could you make it so delicious?!  
  
**Rem：**  
Wahh?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I mean, it's monster meat, right?!  
And yet the appearance, the taste, it's all perfect!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh my.  
 Resounding acclaim from Miss Karyl!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Mmmm~!  
It's true, this is super good! How crazy is that?! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No wonder it satisfied even our Karyl's  
 insatiable cravings! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Sure, I'm insatiable!  
I don't care what you call me right now!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ohhh, Rem...  
You should stay in this world forever!  
Then you can join the Gourmet Guild for good!  
  
**Rem：**  
Miss Karyl...  
  
**Rem：**  
I am most humbled by your praise.  
As a maid, nothing could make me happier!  
  
**Rem：**  
And yet, the fact remains that I must return home.  
Until I do, I will strive to satisfy you as best I can.  
  
**Rem：**  
So please, try to make do with that.  
...But I truly am delighted  
 by your offer.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Urghhh...  
Why do you have to be such a good girl?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I knew it was a good idea inviting Rem to our guild!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, this is most delicious.  
Miss Rem, you will have to show me how you made it in detail.  
  
**Rem：**  
But of course!  
  
**Rem：**  
Master {player}, how are you finding it?  
I hope it's to your tastes.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  It's sending me straight to heaven.
