# Rem Episode 2
Rem goes on a trip into town with Kokkoro and {player}, but they run into a hitch when after buying too many snacks, Kokkoro runs out of money to pay for their shopping. Eager to help, Rem clears the road of a fallen tree with her trusty morningstar, and the reward is more than enough to cover their costs.

**Narration：**  
Another fine day in Landosol,  
and Rem is hurrying into town  
to meet up with Kokkoro and {player}.  
  
**Rem：**  
Oh, how awful. I should really have set off sooner.  
The orphanage's children are just too adorable...  
  
**Rem：**  
I must hurry if I am to make it in time.  
It may not be very proper, but I'll have to run...  
  
**Man 1：**  
Hey!  
How's it lookin' over there?  
  
**Man 2：**  
Nope, this thing ain't budging an inch!  
Yeesh, what a piece o' work!  
  
**Rem：**  
Oh, a crowd of people... Did something happen here?  
  
**Rem：**  
Excuse me, sir. Is something the matter?  
  
**Man 1：**  
Hmm? A maid?  
Well, uh... Take a look for yourself, it's plain to see.  
  
**Rem：**  
Plain to see...  
A fallen tree in the middle of the road?  
It seems quite large...  
  
**Man 1：**  
There was a monster causing trouble 'round here.  
We managed to chase the beast off, but this is the result.  
  
**Man 1：**  
We gathered the town's men to shift it,  
but it's not exactly going great... This job'll take all day.  
  
**Rem：**  
And with the road blocked,  
all these carriages are unable to pass...  
  
**Rem：**  
...Um, would you like me to provide any assistance?  
  
**Man 1：**  
Huh?  
Assistance... from you, little maid?  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes. Strenuous labor is a strength of mine.  
What do you say?  
  
**Men：**  
...  
  
**Men：**  
Baaaahahahahahahah!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Uh, listen, girlie.  
That's a nice offer an' all,  
 but I don't think you'd be much help!  
  
**Man 2：**  
What'cha gonna do with those toothpick arms?!  
Whew, what a regular riot!  
  
**Rem：**  
Hmph...  
Actually, I was being quite serious...  
  
**Man 1：**  
Well, if you say so.  
But this kinda stuff is men's work, little maid.  
  
**Man 1：**  
If you really got rid of this thing, hell, I'd give you all the cash  
we were gonna spend at the tavern tonight!  
  
**Rem：**  
...Oh... I see.  
  
**Rem：**  
Very well, then.  
I apologize for intruding where I'm not wanted.  
  
**Rem：**  
Everyone, good luck with your work.  
I'll be on my way now.  
  
**Man 1：**  
Uh-huh! You take care now, Li'l Miss Strongarm Maid!  
  
**Men：**  
Baaaahahahahahahah!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, Miss Rem! Over here!  
My lord, it appears Miss Rem has arrived.  
  
**Rem：**  
I must apologize for the wait.  
I was sidetracked by a small distraction...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh no, we do not mean to blame you at all.  
We had our own fun in the meantime, at any rate.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
There are so many new stalls around lately.  
My lord was most curious to sample their wares.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I recommend the monster cuisine!  
**Choice: (2)**  I recommend the monster-style cuisine!  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Since becoming acquainted with Miss Pecorine,  
we have grown accustomed to monster meat,  
but is it also becoming a trend in the city?

`Tag 2`  
**Rem：**  
Monster \"style,\" you say?  
I'm not sure I quite understand why  
one would imitate the flavor of monster meat...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rem：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Rem? You seem distracted.  
Perhaps you have some concerns about our plans today?  
  
**Rem：**  
Oh, no, it's not that.  
I just had a slightly vexing encounter on my way here...  
  
**Rem：**  
I've been looking forward to  
this outing with both of you, so please don't worry.  
  
**Rem：**  
In fact, I am filled with spirited motivation!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh my. How very reassuring.  
Well then, my lord, shall we begin our shopping in earnest?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hm? You may have eaten too much?  
And now you're having trouble moving...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well, that is a little awkward.  
Ehm... Whatever shall we do?  
  
**Rem：**  
Perhaps, if he wouldn't mind,  
I could carry Master {player} on my back?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, what a kind offer.  
Let us do that, then.  
 Are you sure you can manage it?  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes! Strenuous work is a strength of mine!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So with this and this,  
 that should be everything.  
Miss Rem,  
 are you managing all right with my lord?  
  
**Rem：**  
No problem at all. I'm just fine.  
If anything, he feels rather light!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And my lord...  
 Ah, he is sleeping.  
I suppose your back must be a most comfortable resting place.  
  
**Rem：**  
His stomach was very full, after all.  
Now, let's finish up the shopping and head back.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Agreed.  
Well then, let me pay for...  
 Oh!  
  
**Rem：**  
...?  
Is something wrong, Miss Kokkoro?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Th-this is not good, Miss Rem.  
I do not have enough money to pay!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This must be because we visited all those stalls just now...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It is entirely my own mistake.  
I should have thought this through better...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  It's not your fault, Kokkoro.  
`Tag 4`  
**Rem：**  
Master {player}, did we wake you?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord!  
 I must apologize.  
It appears I have made a grave error...  
  
**Rem：**  
Still,  
 this *is* awkward.  
I'm afraid I don't have any of this world's money either...  
  
**Rem：**  
But we can hardly return home  
without the necessary items...  
  
**Rem：**  
...  
  
**Rem：**  
Oh!  
 Would you be able to give me a moment?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Rem...?  
  
**Rem：**  
I may not have any money to hand,  
but I do have one idea  
 for how to obtain some!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This is... the main road?  
There seem to be a great number of people gathered around...  
  
**Rem：**  
Excuse me. Could I speak to the foreman here?  
  
**Man 1：**  
Yeah?  
We're pretty busy right...  
 Ohh?  
Well, if it ain't the little maid from earlier.  
  
**Man 1：**  
What brings you back here so soon?  
  
**Rem：**  
That offer you made earlier—did you mean it?  
  
**Man 1：**  
My offer...?  
  
**Rem：**  
That if I take care of this fallen tree,  
you will give me your tavern funds for this evening.  
  
**Man 1：**  
...?  
 Oh! I did say that, huh?  
Now that you mention it, it's all coming back to me.  
  
**Man 1：**  
But, uh, what about it?  
You're not actually gonna try to move this thing, are ya?  
  
**Rem：**  
What if I told you  
 that I would do just that?  
  
**Men：**  
...  
  
**Men：**  
Baaaahah hahahahahahahah!  
  
**Man 1：**  
All right, sure! It's a promise, girlie!  
If you think you can really move this thing, that is!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Sounds like a small price to pay!  
  
**Rem：**  
I will hold you to that!  
No taking it back afterwards!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Uh-huh, sure thing.  
So, are we done here?  
You're in the way of our...  
 Ehh?  
  
**Man 1：**  
What is it, mister? Quit pulling my sleeve.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  It's dangerous there.  
**Choice: (6)**  You ought to step back.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord is quite correct.  
Everyone, I think you should keep your distance.

`Tag 6`  
**Rem：**  
Thank you, that's quite helpful.  
Well then, this will only take a moment...

**Man 1：**  
H-huh?!  
Where'd you pull that great big weapon out from?!  
  
**Rem：**  
It's for self-defense!  
  
**Rem：**  
Haaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Men：**  
...  
  
**Man 1：**  
Th-the whole tree was smashed to splinters...  
  
**Man 2：**  
The road's totally clear...  
  
**Rem：**  
Will this be quite sufficient?  
  
**Man 1：**  
Huh?

Strenuous labor is actually a strength of mine! ♪

**Man 1：**  
U-uhhh.  
 S-sure does... seem that way.  
...I mean, you're quite right, ma'am!  
  
**Man 1：**  
H-here! This is  
 the money you asked for!  
  
**Rem：**  
Ah, thank you!  
...  
Miss Kokkoro, will this sum be enough?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Let me have a look.  
One, two, three...  
 Yes, this is plenty!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  That was amazing!  
`Tag 8`  
**Rem：**  
Oh, you flatter me! Thank you very much.  
I'm just glad I was able to clear up that misunderstanding.  
  
**Rem：**  
Well then, shall we all  
 return to finish our shopping? ♪  
  
**Man 1：**  
Gotta say though, damn...  
  
**Man 1：**  
Maids sure are  
 somethin' else, huh...
