## Subtitle: Maid Power
  
**Rem：**  
Phew, all the laundry's hung up now.  
I believe that should conclude my morning duties.  
  
**Rem：**  
My sister is still with Miss Suzume, I suppose?  
And Miss Emilia seems to be playing with the children.  
  
**Rem：**  
...Which leaves me with very little to do.  
Oh, how very awkward...  
 Oh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, can you bend down for a moment for me?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, thank you very much.  
You have a rice grain stuck to your cheek from breakfast, you see.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Here we go...  
 There, all gone!  
You look more dashingly well-groomed than ever, my lord.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Thanks, Kokkoro.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, no. There is no need to thank me.  
As you know, it is my life's calling to serve you faithfully.  
  
**Rem：**  
What a wonderful philosophy!  
 I am deeply impressed.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, Miss Rem.  
 A good morning to you.  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes, Miss Kokkoro, Master {player}.  
A good morning to you both.  
  
**Rem：**  
I happened to see you both just now,  
and the deep bond you share warmed my heart.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Deep bond...? Is that how we appear?  
I am but a devoted attendant in my lord's service...  
  
**Rem：**  
Oh no, it is quite admirable.  
I think I could learn a great much from you.  
  
**Rem：**  
By the way, what exactly is your relationship to one another?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Kokkoro helps me out all the time.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
I was sent by Lady Ameth  
to serve as my lord's trusty guide and attend to his needs.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It was her divine will that brought us together.  
But now, I serve him gladly through my own heartfelt loyalty.  
  
**Rem：**  
Ah, I see. What very unique circumstances.  
  
**Rem：**  
...  
  
**Rem：**  
Excuse me, Miss Kokkoro.  
If it's not too much trouble, may I take over your role for a short while?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Take over... my role?  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes.  
As you know, since we arrived in this world,  
Miss Saren has been kind enough to let me help out at the orphanage.  
  
**Rem：**  
I am not dissatisfied with this role, but...  
At this rate, I fear my Maid Power may fall into decline.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
M-Maid Power, you say?  
What manner of power is that, exactly?  
  
**Rem：**  
According to what Subaru has taught me,  
it is an energy stemming from the desire to serve others.  
  
**Rem：**  
If a maid were to lose this power,  
she would have no right to call herself a maid at all...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Th-that sounds like a terrible fate indeed...  
  
**Rem：**  
As such... Even just until lunchtime, say!  
Would you allow me to perform your duties today?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well, ah... I cannot decide that alone.  
My lord, what do you think?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Sounds good to me.  
**Choice: (4)**  You think you can handle it?  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, my lord. A bold and decisive verdict.  
Very well. If you do not object, nor shall I.

`Tag 4`  
**Rem：**  
Of course,  
 I will perform these duties with the utmost of care.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well then, since you have my lord's blessing,  
I suppose we will grant your request.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As it happens,  
we were just about to go on a shopping trip for the others...  
  
**Rem：**  
Understood.  
I promise to accomplish this task without fail.  
  
**Rem：**  
Let us go shopping, Master {player}!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Please take good care of my lord, Miss Rem.  
  
**Rem：**  
So, I gladly took on this shopping errand,  
but this is worrisome.  
  
**Rem：**  
The vegetables of this world  
are named slightly differently from those that I know.  
  
**Rem：**  
They are very similar in appearance,  
but I'm not sure if they match this shopping list perfectly...  
  
**Rem：**  
Hm? You will check on my behalf, you say?  
Oh, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.  
  
**Rem：**  
I was too careless.  
I should have confirmed in advance...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I think you're doing a great job.  
`Tag 6`  
**Rem：**  
Thank you most kindly.  
But I am still very much learning.  
  
**Rem：**  
At this level of Maid Power,  
I cannot even approach the ideal I strive for.  
  
**Rem：**  
What ideal, you ask?  
Why, that would be  
 my sister, of course!  
  
**Rem：**  
My sister is the perfect lady.  
I must work hard each and every day to be more like her.  
  
**Rem：**  
Master {player},  
don't you have anyone you look up to in that way?  
  
**Rem：**  
You don't quite understand?  
Umm, what do you mean by...  
  
**Rem：**  
Oh!  
 I think this is everything.  
Let's continue our chat after we've paid for these groceries.  
  
**Rem：**  
Actually, I've never thought about it before,  
but I suppose coins are unique to each region, aren't they?  
  
**Rem：**  
This world's currency has such unfamiliar designs.  
Do you know what this emblem represents?  
  
**Rem：**  
You're not sure either?  
Oh—please don't look so despondent about it.  
I was only a little curious...  
  
**Rem：**  
Huh? Amnesia?  
Surely you don't mean to say...  
  
**Rem：**  
Oh, silly me!  
We're keeping other customers waiting.  
Let's pay for these before we continue.  
  
**Rem：**  
Phew... We finished our shopping in the end.  
Still, I must say, that was a big surprise.  
  
**Rem：**  
You can be such a tease, Master {player}.  
Do you enjoy giving people shocks like that?  
  
**Rem：**  
Haha... Ahaha.  
 I'm only joking.  
There's no need to get so flustered.  
  
**Rem：**  
Still, it must be difficult for you.  
Having no memories... I can't imagine what it would be like.  
  
**Rem：**  
So, this is why Miss Kokkoro serves you so earnestly...  
  
**Rem：**  
Huh? It can be awkward, but it's not that much trouble?  
  
**Rem：**  
Because you have Miss Kokkoro and the others?  
  
**Rem：**  
...  
Well. That is a lovely thing indeed.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  That includes you, too.  
`Tag 7`  
**Rem：**  
Me? To rely on?  
That makes me happy, but I really haven't done much of...  
  
**Rem：**  
Oh, yes!  
In that case, would you like to join me in my studies?  
  
**Rem：**  
I still have so many things to learn about this world.  
I'm just like you.  
  
**Rem：**  
\"Let's help each other and talk of the future...\"  
Those are the words of a hero I look up to.  
  
**Rem：**  
I would love to teach you whatever I can.  
Basic calculations and housework, for instance.  
  
**Rem：**  
Would you like that?  
  
**Rem：**  
I-I didn't think you'd be *that* pleased.  
Ahh! Please don't run off! You might trip and fall!  
  
**Rem：**  
What a very lively young man...  
 Ah.  
  
**Rem：**  
I think I can appreciate why Miss Kokkoro  
hates to let him out of her sight!  
  
**Rem：**  
We have returned from our errand!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, welcome back, my lord, Miss Rem.  
How was the shopping trip...  
 Oh?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You seem to be holding hands...  
  
**Rem：**  
Oh, so we are.  
Actually, I have to do this, or else he...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Can it be...  
 My lord...  
Do you no longer have any need of me...?  
  
**Rem：**  
Huh?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Rem can serve you better...  
This brief time together has proven it beyond doubt...

**Rem：**  
Oh, no!  
That's not true at all!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Rem...?  
  
**Rem：**  
Master {player} told me a lot about you.  
In fact, I was deeply awed by your devotion!  
  
**Rem：**  
All the duties you perform can't be easy.  
You have so much to be proud of!  
  
![109700102.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/109700102.webp)  
**Rem：**  
Miss Kokkoro, you are fanatical as a demon!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
F-fanatical as a demon...?  
  
**Rem：**  
This expression  
 is the highest praise I know.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I-is that a fact...?  
Well then,  
 ehm...  
 That makes me blush somewhat.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
All that I have done is fulfill my duty.  
I am luckier than I can say to have met my lord in this way.

**Kokkoro：**  
Well then, my lord.  
If I may, I would like to serve by your side once more.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Would you allow me that honor?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Permission granted.  
**Choice: (9)**  I'm always counting on you.  
`Tag 8`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh! Such an air of authority, my lord!  
I feel truly awed by your splendor!

`Tag 9`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, and I will strive to live up to your needs.  
To serve you with all my body and soul.  
  
`Tag 10`  
**Rem：**  
Such a deep bond indeed...  
I cannot allow myself to fall behind!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, yes.  
Miss Rem, how is your Maid Power coming along?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Did your trip with my lord  
help to solve your immediate worries?  
  
**Rem：**  
Well, let me see.  
  
**Rem：**  
I would say it was a most productive experience indeed!  
  
**Rem：**  
Hee hee.
