## Subtitle: Gorgeous on the Job
  
**Narration：**  
Yuki is collapsed in the middle of the street.  
  
**Yuki：**  
*pant*... *pant* I-I can't go on...  
My life is over...  
  
**Yuki：**  
They say that only the beautiful die young...  
So this is my punishment for being so adorable, huh?  
  
**Yuki：**  
Hm? Can I help you?  
Are you hitting on me?  
  
**Yuki：**  
I can't believe people would still hit on me when I'm dying on  
the streets. I guess I'm just too irresistible.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Oh, it's you, {player}. What is it?  
Oh, you're stopping because I collapsed?  
  
**Yuki：**  
How nice of you to care about me.  
You're so sweet, {player}.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Huh? You want to know why I was lying on the road?  
  
**Yuki：**  
You're just so curious about me, aren't you?  
Okay, I'll allow it, if you insist.  
  
**Yuki：**  
You see, I'm practically starving.  
I'm completely broke, so I haven't had a meal in my stomach  
since yesterday.  
  
**Yuki：**  
You must work to make money, right? But just think!  
What would happen if one day, while I was working, I wound up  
getting into some accident  
and my face was scarred forevermore?  
  
**Yuki：**  
The whole world would despair if that happened! Despair, I say!  
So no matter what, I simply cannot work.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Ugh. But I'm so hungry...  
Poor nutrition wreaks havoc on one's complexion.  
Oh, my poor, beautiful face!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Oh, what am I to do?  
  
**Yuki：**  
I know! Hey, {player}...  
Would you mind treating me to lunch?  
Please, you're my only hope!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm broke too.  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's find you a job.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuki：**  
Et tu, {player}?  
Well, then, what should we do?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Yuki：**  
What? Didn't I just say that I'm not going to work?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Yuki：**  
Huh? Seriously?  
You think we should be pragmatic about this?  
  
**Yuki：**  
Oh, I suppose you're right.  
You probably can't afford to buy my meals for me every day.  
  
**Yuki：**  
All right... I suppose I should find myself a job.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Just imagine—me, working among the common people  
and earning my keep...  
I bet I'll look gorgeous.  
  
**Yuki：**  
You know of a good place to work, {player}?  
By all means, lead the way.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Oh, you must be joking! Road maintenance?! A construction  
site?!  
This is all physical labor! This is for men with beefy  
muscles!  
  
**Yuki：**  
I don't wanna work here, surrounded by these sweaty meatheads!  
Ughhh... It smells so bad in here. I can't breathe.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Why would you take me to a place like this?  
  
**Yuki：**  
They pay a daily wage, so we can make a quick buck?  
I guess that's a decent enough reason, but still...  
  
**Boss：**  
Are you the new recruits?  
Ya better work hard.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Disgusting... This guy reeks of B.O....  
I can't do it! I can't work in a place like this!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Augh! They just got mud on me!  
This is the worst...  
They'd better have a good excuse for getting mud on my perfect  
beauty!  
  
**Boss：**  
Yeesh, quit yer whining, rookie.  
If you hate mud that much,  
you oughtta just dunk yourself in it.  
Believe me, you'll get used to it soon enough.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Eek! Stop it! You got mud on my face!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Unbelievable... How dare he!  
Does he have any idea what he's done?!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Hey, wait a second... Ooh,  
I was right!  
I can see myself in this puddle!  
  
**Yuki：**  
I'm so beautiful, even when I'm covered in mud.  
If anything, I'm more stunning than before.  
My beauty never fails to stand out!  
  
**Yuki：**  
*sigh*... I'm just so gorgeous...  
  
**Boss：**  
Hey! Quit gazin' at that stupid puddle and get back to work!  
You ain't done a single thing since you got here!  
Ugh, this new recruit is useless!  
  
**Boss：**  
Oi, you there! Yer friend ain't helpin', so you'd better work  
twice as hard to make up for it!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so, {player} worked himself to the bone to make  
up for the work Yuki refused to do...
