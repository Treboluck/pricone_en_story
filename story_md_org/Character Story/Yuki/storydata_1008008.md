## Subtitle: Don't Ever Let Me Go
  
**Narration：**  
Yuki has asked {player} to meet up with him.  
  
**Yuki：**  
There you are, {player}.  
Are you all ready for our date?  
  
**Yuki：**  
What? You didn't know it was a date? Don't get picky about the  
wording. You get to spend time with me, which is all that  
matters.  
  
**Yuki：**  
All right, so where should we—  
  
**Yuki：**  
Aah! That's bright! Didn't this happen before?!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Aaaugh!  
  

---  
  
**Yuki：**  
{player}, it's okay if you want to stare at me a lot more.  
Let's make the most of our time together today.  
  
**Yuki：**  
I mean, look at me. How could you not stare at me  
every moment you get?  
  
**Yuki：**  
Oh, I think I get it.  
Could it be that you're so blinded by my  
beauty that you need to look away once in a while?  
  
**Yuki：**  
I have that effect on people just by existing.  
Poor little me and my sinful beauty.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Huh? Why are you sighing?  
You're being kind of a drag today.  
Maybe I should spend the day with someone else.  
  
**Yuki：**  
If I put my mind to it, someone will ask me out in  
no time flat!  
  
**Flirt：**  
Hey there, cutie! What's up?  
  
**Yuki：**  
Whoa, already?  
I wasn't even trying yet...  
Can you believe my allure?!  
  
**Yuki：**  
When you're as adorable as I am, people are just drawn to you,  
I guess.  
Don't you think so too, {player}?  
  
**Flirt：**  
Eh? You're with someone? Lame.  
Why don't you ditch that loser and  
let me show you a good time?  
  
**Yuki：**  
Really? I don't know... I'm really attached to {player}.  
We've even held hands in the nude. Hee hee.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Aww, {player}! You look so flustered!  
You are too precious!  
  
**Flirt：**  
What the hell?! Don't ignore me while you  
shamelessly flirt with your stupid date!  
  
**Flirt：**  
I can hold hands in the nude too, you know!  
Here, I'll show you!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Noooo. {player}, heeelp!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Stop him.  
`Tag 1`  
**Flirt：**  
You got something to say?  
I'm sick of jerks like you, getting lucky  
while guys like me strike out!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Please, don't fight!  
Stop fighting over me!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Shhh, that's not helping.  
**Choice: (3)**  This is your fault, you know.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yuki：**  
Hehe, don't you love my pleading voice?  
But really, you shouldn't fight over me.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Yuki：**  
My fault? Oh, because I'm so irresistible.  
Is that what you meant?  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Yuki：**  
That's right! This is all because of my fathomless beauty!  
These perfect looks of mine  
are to blame...  
  
**Flirt：**  
Both of you, shut the hell up!  
You're seriously asking for a beatdown!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Uh-oh, we made him mad...  
I don't think we can talk our way out of this one.  
And I don't want to see you getting hurt, {player}.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Huh? What are you doing, {player}?  
Why are you grabbing my hand?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Let's make a run for it.  
`Tag 5`  
**Yuki：**  
Oh, you took my hand so we can run away...  
O-okay. Let's run.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Just don't let go of my hand, okay?  
  
**Yuki：**  
*pant, pant*...  
We managed to escape. When you're as beautiful as me, you run  
into trouble like that sometimes. It's a pain.  
  
**Yuki：**  
My exquisite beauty is both a blessing and a curse  
from the heavens.  
I can't help it.  
  
**Yuki：**  
There is nothing on this planet that is as charming as I am!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Oh, but... You did look rather handsome  
while you were pulling me along by the hand.  
  
**Yuki：**  
I hope you never let me go again.

**Ameth：**  
And that's that. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just saw was basically a dream.  
Once you wake up, you'll probably forget that you saw it.  
Don't worry too much about it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Yuki from the \"other side\" is exactly the same  
as the one \"here\", huh.  
  
**Ameth：**  
He has no problem stringing people along  
and causing trouble, because he knows he's  
the cutest.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's kind of scary how committed he is to believing that.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I guess being vain isn't such a bad thing.  
I might even envy him a little.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's enough meaningless chitchat. I'll let you get back  
to your regular programming.  
See you again! ♪

**Yuki：**  
Are you finally awake, {player}?  
I think we both fell asleep again.  
  
**Yuki：**  
I had the weirdest dream. A man was hitting on me,  
but then you rescued me, {player}...  
  
**Yuki：**  
I knew it. You had the same dream, didn't you?  
Hehe. You and I are so connected.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Oops, I almost forgot. We were in the middle of a date.  
We've lost some precious time, so let's get going.  
Are you ready?  
  
**Yuki：**  
Oh, wait! {player}!  
I wanna hold hands with you  
while we walk together today.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Hee hee. Don't ever let go of my hand again, okay?
