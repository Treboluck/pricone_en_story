# Yuki Episode 5
Yuki sells all of his guild's possessions so that he can travel the world in a hot-air balloon and show off his beauty. However, the other guild members angrily catch up to him and put a stop to his travel plans.
  
## Subtitle: A World Tour?!
  
**Narration：**  
Yuki has asked {player} to meet up with him.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Hey, {player}!  
I'm here!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Lucky you,  
to be able to wait for a beauty such as me.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Okay. Let's go!  
  
**Yuki：**  
What do you mean, \"where\"?  
Oh, didn't I tell you?  
  
**Yuki：**  
I've made up my mind.  
I'm gonna travel the world!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Don't you pity all the people who don't know that such a  
beautiful person like me exists?  
That's why I want  
to travel the world and spread the word about ME!  
  
**Yuki：**  
For starters, I want to go around visiting cities I haven't  
been to before. You'll help me out too, right, {player}?  
Okay, let's get going.  
  
**Yuki：**  
{player}! Over here!  
With this, the monsters won't bother us.  
Come and see!  
  
**Yuki：**  
It's a hot-air balloon! If I'm in the sky,  
monsters can't reach me.  
I'm gonna visit  
other towns in this!  
  
**Yuki：**  
I was gonna ask you to come with me, {player},  
but this hot air balloon can only hold one person.  
Sorry, but I'm gonna do this alone.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I want to go with you.  
**Choice: (2)**  What a relief. I can stay put.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuki：**  
I get it.  
You don't want to leave my side  
because I'm so beautiful, right?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Yuki：**  
You don't have to put on a brave front.  
I know you're dying to come with me.  
You're so cute when you act like this.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Yuki：**  
But I need you to stay here, okay?  
The guild will miss you if you come with me, {player}.  
I'm leaving them in your capable hands.  
  
**Yuki：**  
I hate sad goodbyes,  
so I'm gonna get going.  
Take care, {player}! Bye!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
W-wait... Please, wait!  
{player}, please stop Yuki!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Ayumi... If you've come to stop me, don't bother.  
I know you'll miss me, but I have to go.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
That's not it! Most of our household furniture and belongings  
are missing!  
When I asked a merchant about it, he said that you  
sold it all.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Oh, that.  
I needed money to buy this hot-air balloon.  
  
**Yuki：**  
I always thought that furniture was ugly,  
so I took it upon myself to sell it.  
  
**Ayumi：**  
B-but that furniture belonged to everybody!  
I don't think you were allowed to sell it...  
  
**Ninon：**  
'Tis correct! Give me back my wall scroll,  
post-haste!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I really need that sofa for my daydreaming.  
  
**Monika：**  
How dare you take our shared property and use it for your  
personal gain! Come back here at once!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Sorry guys, liftoff has already started.  
I'm going on a voyage around the world.  
  
**Monika：**  
Darn it, Yuki's trying to get away!  
Ayumi, fire at will!  
  
**Ayumi：**  
What? Y-yes ma'am! Right away.  
Hyah!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Hey! She popped a hole in my balloon!  
I-I'm falling... Nooo!  
  
**Monika：**  
All right, we got him!  
You'd better get our furniture back, Yuki!  
  
**Yuki：**  
L-let go of me! The world needs meee!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so, Yuki's great journey ended in failure before it barely even got off the ground.
