## Subtitle: Marry Me or Else
  
**Narration：**  
One day,  
as {player} and Yuki are out and about together...  
  
**Yuki：**  
Hey {player}, where should we go next?  
  
**Yuki：**  
Huh? What's with that guy?  
He's headed straight for us.  
  
**Messenger：**  
Excuse me, but are you Yuki?  
  
**Yuki：**  
Huh?  
Yeah, that's me. I'm Yuki.  
  
**Messenger：**  
My lord has heard rumors about you...  
That you are an exceptionally beautiful woman.  
He would like to ask for your hand in marriage.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Wha? Marriage?  
Hmm, I don't know...  
  
**Messenger：**  
Please, I implore you. My lord is a distinguished noble  
in this city. At his side, you will want for nothing.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Wow, a noble, huh...  
But I'm gonna pass.  
I'm not ready to get married yet.  
  
**Messenger：**  
I see... You leave me no choice.  
I will take you to him by force!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Huh?! Aaaugh! Let go of me!  
{player}, heeelp!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Chase after them.  
`Tag 1`  
**Noble：**  
Ah, you must be Yuki. The rumors were right—  
Actually,  
you are more beautiful than words can describe.  
Now, come here and vow to become my wife.  
  
**Yuki：**  
I'm telling you, I don't wanna!  
I have no intention of marrying you.  
  
**Noble：**  
What reservations do you have?  
If you become my wife,  
I'll buy you anything you want. You can bask in a  
life of luxury!  
  
**Yuki：**  
That's beside the point.  
  
**Messenger：**  
H-hey! You can't go in there!  
This is a private residence!  
  
**Noble：**  
What's the meaning of this?!  
Who the hell are you?!  
  
**Yuki：**  
{player}!  
Did you come to save me?!  
  
**Noble：**  
Is he a friend of yours? He appears to want to take you back.  
Too bad. Yuki is my bride, now. Give up and go on home.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Aren't you listening? I'm not marrying you.  
Besides, I'm actually a guy.  
  
**Noble：**  
Ha! That's a good one! You could've come up with a  
better lie if you wanted to avoid marriage.  
One that's more believable.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Listen... I'm not lying...  
  
**Noble：**  
Trespasser, you should leave.  
Come any closer and I will cut you into pieces.  
  
**Yuki：**  
N-no!  
I'll be fine, {player}. You should go home...  
I don't want to see you get hurt.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Take a step forward.  
`Tag 2`  
**Noble：**  
That answers that.  
Prepare to die!  
  
**Yuki：**  
{player}! Look out!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Augh!  
  
**Noble：**  
What the—! You... jumped in to protect him?!  
What is he to you, anyway?  
  
**Yuki：**  
The truth is, we...  
We're lovers!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  We are?  
**Choice: (4)**  Yup, we're in love.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yuki：**  
We're lovers, right...?  
  
**Yuki：**  
See? {player} is nodding his head.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Yuki：**  
Hee hee! I knew it...  
I just knew you felt the same way as I do.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Yuki：**  
We're dating, and it's serious!  
So you better give up on the idea  
of making me your bride.  
  
**Noble：**  
Hmph. I don't care if you have a boyfriend!  
I've already made up my mind that you are to be mine!  
  
**Yuki：**  
That didn't work either? Ugh, I'm out of options.  
I'm gonna have to prove to you that I'm male.  
  
**Noble：**  
You're still going along with that joke?  
No one believes your lies.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Fine. Have a feel for yourself.  
  
**Noble：**  
F-feel... What?!  
No, I can't.  
Although...  
  
**Noble：**  
You there, maid! Go and check!  
  
**Maid：**  
Pardon, milord?  
M-me...?  
  
**Noble：**  
Hurry it up already!  
  
**Maid：**  
Y-yes, milord...  
Please excuse me, miss.  
  
**Maid：**  
...?! Eek! Goodness me!  
Th-this person is a man!  
  
**Noble：**  
What?! You're telling me Yuki really is a man?!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Do you believe me now?  
I'm a guy.  
  
**Noble：**  
B-but didn't you say that this man is your lover?  
You're both men, for crying out loud!  
  
**Yuki：**  
That's right! Our love transcends the limitations of gender!  
We're that head-over-heels for each other!  
  
**Yuki：**  
So, do you still want to make me your wife?  
  
**Noble：**  
Hurgh... E-even if you're a man, I suppose I could...  
No, I just can't! I lost interest in marrying you the  
second I learned that you're a man.  
  
**Yuki：**  
That just proves you aren't in love with me.  
If you want to marry me, you'll have to love me as I am,  
knowing full well that I'm a guy.  
  
**Noble：**  
I can't argue with that...  
You and I are incompatible. I will give up on pursuing you.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Hehe, we did it!  
You did a great job pretending to be my boyfriend.  
  
**Yuki：**  
That guy was so rude, giving up on me as soon as he knew my  
gender.  
I'm amazingly gorgeous, no matter what's under my  
dress.  
  
**Yuki：**  
You don't care that I'm a guy, right, {player}?  
Aww, you're so cute when you blush!  
  
**Yuki：**  
It's getting late.  
Let's go home.  
  
**Narration：**  
Whether from the enjoyment of teasing {player},  
or the joy of {player} coming to save him,  
Yuki walked home in an especially good mood.
