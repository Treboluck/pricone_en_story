**Narration：**  
One day, {player} and Yuki are out shopping together.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Come on, {player}!  
Let's go to that store over there next.  
  
**Yuki：**  
We're just getting started. As an ideal specimen of cuteness,  
I have a sworn duty to show off as many outfits as possible to  
the people of the world.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Alas, it's not easy being so beautiful. You're  
lucky that all you have to do is carry my bags. If  
anything, you should feel honored—  
  
**Yuki：**  
Ahh! Wh-what's with this bright light...  
I can't see!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Aaaugh!

**???：**  
*fwhoo*...  
  
**Yuki：**  
Haha! Did I startle you? I wanted to give you a present,  
{player}. It's my sweet breath...  
*fwhoo*...  
  
**Yuki：**  
Hehe, I just couldn't help doing that  
after running into you  
out of the blue.  
  
**Yuki：**  
You want me to stop?  
Hehe, I bet you're enjoying it.  
Look at you blushing, {player}. How cute.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Hey, since we've found each other,  
why don't we go on a special date today?  
  
**Yuki：**  
Yeah! You should feel honored  
that you can go on a date with me.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Of course it's an honor. You get to have me  
all to yourself today, {player}.  
All right, let's go.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Yayyy! I bought SO much stuff today!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Did you have fun too, {player}?  
Not like I have to ask.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Huh? The bags are too heavy?  
That's too bad.  
It's a shame that I'm too adorable to be  
carrying my own bags.  
  
**Yuki：**  
I shudder to think what would happen if  
a heavy bag hit my leg and gave me a bruise.  
  
**Yuki：**  
The thought keeps me up at night, and I only  
get around eight hours of sleep as a result.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That's plenty of rest.  
**Choice: (2)**  Can I go home now?  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuki：**  
That's true. I'm really diligent about it.  
  
**Yuki：**  
It would be a disgrace to our country —  
no, to all of humanity—if I ever woke up  
with bags under my eyes.

`Tag 2`  
**Yuki：**  
Are you sure you want to ditch me?  
If you leave me to walk around all by myself,  
I'm gonna get hit on left and right.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Cameraman：**  
Hi there! You're really cute!  
  
**Cameraman：**  
We work for a magazine called \"Cutie Culture\".  
Do you have a minute to talk?  
  
**Yuki：**  
Oh, I thought he was a pickup artist, but he's from Cutie-Cul.  
Have you ever heard of that magazine, {player}?  
It's the most popular fashion magazine for high school girls.  
  
**Cameraman：**  
We're taking quick snaps of  
pretty girls we spot around town.  
Is it all right if we take a photo of you?  
  
**Yuki：**  
Of course!  
  
**Yuki：**  
My beauty is a gift to all of humanity.  
I don't really have the right to refuse sharing it.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  But Yuki's a dude...  
`Tag 4`  
**Yuki：**  
Great, I'm ready  
for my photo shoot!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Make sure you capture all of my oozing charm, okay?  
  
**Cameraman：**  
Awesome. We'll take lots of photos.

**Yuki：**  
Snap away, photographer. This is your  
once-in-a-lifetime chance to photograph me!

**Cameraman：**  
That's it—super job! Not only do you look adorable,  
but your poses are great, too!  
  
**Yuki：**  
Hehe. I'm used to getting my picture taken.  
Cute poses are my specialty!  
  
**Yuki：**  
But let's be real—I can make any pose look perfect. ♪  
  
**Cameraman：**  
Yes... Your beauty matches your confidence!  
Please, let us take some more shots!  
  
**Passerby 1：**  
Look! Isn't that model pretty?  
  
**Passerby 2：**  
She really is!  
I wonder if that's her boyfriend  
standing next to her?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I kind of like the sound of that.  
**Choice: (6)**  I should correct them.  
`Tag 5`  
**Yuki：**  
{player}? What's with that smug look on your face?  
Oh, are you playing the part of my boyfriend?  
  
**Yuki：**  
You, the boyfriend of someone as cute as me?  
Actually, that doesn't sound too bad at all.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Ha, just kidding. Hehe,  
did I get your hopes up?  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Passerby 1：**  
What? You're not her boyfriend? Oh, sorry...  
I didn't realize you could hear us.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Hehe, you don't have to correct them, {player}.  
You're such a little shy guy.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Narration：**  
Ten minutes later...

**Cameraman：**  
Incredible! We've never had a model like you before!  
  
**Yuki：**  
I can do this all day! What about this pose, for your cover?  
And then, you could use this pose for a poster.  
  
**Cameraman：**  
Great poses! Your expressions are perfect, too!  
  
**Yuki：**  
I think this pose also brings out my subtle features!  
  
**Passerby 1：**  
Omigosh, that girl is SO CUTE!  
  
`image display end`  
**Narration：**  
Three hours later...  
  
**Yuki：**  
Hehe, what about this pose next?  
Maybe I look a bit too glamorous in that one.  
  
**Stray Cat：**  
Meow.  
  
**Yuki：**  
I could do this pose, or this one.  
To be honest, I really do look good in any pose.  
  
**Yuki：**  
I'm no longer just a person who happens to be cute.  
I have become cuteness itself!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Everyone's gone home.  
`Tag 8`  
**Yuki：**  
I feel so bad for the models who will be  
in the same magazine issue as me.  
Oh, this beauty is such a burden...

**Ameth：**  
How'd it go? Did you like the dream I granted to you?  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just saw was a dream I made for you and Yuki based on  
both of your memories.  
Did it feel nostalgic? I guess you  
wouldn't know how that feels, given your condition.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'll show you another dream when you've  
gathered enough memory fragments.  
  
**Ameth：**  
To uncover the truths of this world, you'll have to  
watch many dreams of the girls you meet...  
Huh?  
  
**Ameth：**  
You look like you want to interject that Yuki is a boy.  
Don't you get it?  
  
**Ameth：**  
The Yuki on the \"other side\", and the Yuki \"here\", are both  
male, but also female.  
That's what makes him so cute, both in  
appearance and personality!  
  
**Ameth：**  
You must accept the truth in your heart.  
For both Yuki's sake, and for yours.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, see you later! ♪

**Yuki：**  
Umm... Huh? Where am I?  
  
**Yuki：**  
Oh yeah... I was shopping with you, {player}.  
Then I fell asleep somehow.  
  
**Yuki：**  
What? You were asleep too, {player}?  
We both fell asleep together?  
Hehe, that's kind of embarrassing.  
  
**Yuki：**  
But that sure was a fun dream.  
We took so many photos that captured my beauty.  
  
**Yuki：**  
Yeah. I've made up my mind!  
I think I know what I'm gonna do now.  
  
**Narration：**  
Saying this, Yuki smiled in satisfaction, for reasons yet unknown to {player}.
