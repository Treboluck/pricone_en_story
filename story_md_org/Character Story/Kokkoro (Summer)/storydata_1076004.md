**Narration：**  
After their rest on the beach, {player} and Kokkoro  
are walking towards the beach cabin where they are staying.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, my lord...  
I am terribly sorry...  
I seem to have suddenly become drowsy yet again.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I... I fear I cannot stay on my feet...  
Please wait a brief moment.  
I will strike myself on the face to clear my head...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wha...? M-my lord?  
Why are you suddenly lifting me into your arms?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'll carry you to the cabin.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm...  
 Ah, to be quite honest,  
that would be most helpful.  
I am terribly sorry to make you go to the trouble.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The truth is, I am ordinarily asleep in bed by this hour...  
It seems I find it difficult to stay up late. My apologies.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I took a number of naps during the day, so if anything,  
I should be more awake than usual... But playing at the beach  
takes a surprising amount of energy. I am quite worn out.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I feel completely ready for a full night's sleep...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am so sorry to rely on you like this, my lord.  
This is all wrong... It is I who have a duty to protect and guide you...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yet so often, we find our positions reversed...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh...  
Somehow this sensation seems familiar and comforting...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My skin prickling from exposure to the rays of the sun all day...  
The warmth of my lord... His heartbeat...  
Somewhere, I have felt all of this before...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My... lord?  
What is this light?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh...  
I am so sleepy, I can scarcely even think...

**Kokoro：**  
I am terribly grateful, my lord.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
This chance encounter with you here was the greatest of fortunes.  
Just as I thought, you are my savior,  
here to guide me in my hour of need.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Eheh. Actually, I came here with my father to practice my  
swimming technique.  
 But he had a sudden urgent appointment...  
So I was left here alone, unsure how to proceed.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Without my father's help, I did not know how to go about  
learning to swim correctly...  
 So it was a stroke of luck indeed  
that you were here to instruct me, my lord.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Please don't call me that in public...  
`Tag 2`

**Kokoro：**  
Oh? Why would that be?  
My lord, you often seem embarrassed by your title.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
But you are without a doubt the lord I serve...  
So I would find it difficult to address you in any other way.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Hmm... I suppose it is an unusual form of address in our society.  
But to me personally, it feels completely natural  
to follow you as my lord and master.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Still... If it bothers you so much, we will have to find an alternative.  
At least in front of others, I will strive to call you by a different title.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
As a compromise...  
Though of course, in my heart, you will always be my lord...  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Is there anything that you have always wanted to be called?  
A request for me, if you will?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Call me by my name.  
**Choice: (4)**  Call me \"Big Bro.\"  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokoro：**  
Ah... Your name...  
I must apologize, my lord.  
I seem to have forgotten what exactly your name might be.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
My lord is my lord, after all.  
I never expected to think of you in any other way...  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I am terribly sorry,  
 but could you possibly remind me  
what name you usually go by?  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokoro：**  
Ah...  
But, my lord, the two of us are not brother and sister.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Hmm...  
You think is it not unusual for young children to call you in such a way?  
A most intriguing convention... I have learned something today.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Well, then...  
I suppose I have no reason to deny you your request.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
B... \"Big Bro.\"  
  
**Kokoro：**  
...  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Ehmm... Somehow I feel terribly embarrassed.  
This may be a selfish request, but would it be all right  
if I called you \"my lord\" after all?  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Kokoro：**  
Eheh...  
\"Let's just stick with 'my lord',\" you say?  
Thank you very much, my lord!  
  
**Kokoro：**  
You truly are the kindest of fellows.  
I do find no matter who I speak to, they struggle with my mannerisms.  
But you, my lord, are always so patient and understanding.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Even today, though our meeting was mere coincidence,  
you greeted me kindly and went out of your way  
to teach me how to swim. That made me very happy, my lord.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I promise you, I will never forget your kindness.  
Even when I am old and grey, even if I die and am reincarnated,  
these sparks of joy will remain unsullied in my heart.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Someday I would like to repay this debt to you.  
It may be difficult now, but when I am older...  
In some far future, or in another life, I swear I will come to your aid.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
It is a promise, my lord.  
I swear on my own heart.

**Ameth：**  
And... welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just saw was essentially a dream.  
You'll probably forget it all when you wake up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Since you've all been having fun at the beach,  
I guess that affected the kind of memory you recalled this time.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You and sweet little Kokkoro  
were little more than strangers on the \"other side\"...  
  
**Ameth：**  
But it looks like you did run into her one summer  
on a random visit to the swimming pool.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Kokkoro has never had the most \"normal\" of lives,  
but at this point, she was at least attending school normally.  
It looks like she wanted to practice for her school swimming lessons.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Thanks to your help with her swimming practice that day,  
she managed to swim at school without any trouble,  
and that helped her fit in a little better with her classmates.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So you did a fine thing, {player}.  
What a good boy!  
  
**Ameth：**  
I have to thank you for always looking out for my little Kokkoro.  
There's not much I can do for her in my situation...  
I just have to watch and fret in silence.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So it really is a relief that you're making her life so happy.  
In fact... This might sound a little strange,  
but I'm as happy as if it were me, and as grateful, too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So thank you, {player}.  
If you don't mind, I hope you'll keep taking good care of her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
...Oh dear, I guess we shouldn't stand around talking all day.  
It may be summer, but you can still catch a cold sleeping outside,  
so let's wake you back up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Bye-bye, {player}.  
See you again in some other dream.  
  

---  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord... My lord!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. You seemed to stumble all of a sudden,  
and it jolted me wide awake.  
Whatever is the matter? Did you hurt yourself?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh... You think you just lost consciousness for a brief instant?  
Perhaps you're as worn out as I am.  
Here, let me walk by myself after all.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It was very kind of you to try to carry me all the way home,  
but as your loyal guide, I would rather take your hand and lead the way.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Come, my lord. Let us walk home hand in hand!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Off to the place where our family awaits.  
We should get a good night's rest, so that tomorrow and the day after,  
we can enjoy our time at the beach to the fullest.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah... I can hardly wait, my lord!
