**Narration：**  
A few days later...  
The members of the Gourmet Guild  
are enjoying their tropical vacation just as planned.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I-I'm counting on you, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
When I say \"okay,\" please let go of my hands.  
Is that quite clear? \"Okay\" is the signal to—  
 Waaahh?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Aaahh! Mrrblpplh?!  
M-my lord, that \"okay\" was not supposed to be the signal—  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey... Are you OK?!  
What are you two playing at?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*cough* *splutter*  
The salt water got inside my nose... It stings so strangely!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Urghh...  
My feet still reach the seabed here, so I am in no danger of drowning...  
But this is awkward. Swimming is trickier than I expected.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am able to float on the surface, but I cannot navigate  
these waves effectively. And when I raise my face to breathe,  
I quickly find myself sinking.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, I was wondering why you two were hanging around  
in the shallows.  
 Can you not swim?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*sigh* My lord and I did try to prepare for this day...  
We read an instruction book on swimming technique,  
and practiced the front crawl on our beds...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmph... As if you can learn to swim from books.  
Knowledge and experience are different things.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed. It is just as you say, Miss Karyl...  
Whatever shall we do? If we cannot swim,  
that severely limits the beach activities available to us.  
  
**Karyl：**  
True, true.  
 C'mere a sec, Koro.  
{player}, you too.  
  
**Karyl：**  
As for Pecorine...  
Good, she's already swum off like some kind of human torpedo.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm? Whatever do you want, Miss Karyl?  
As you requested, I have come closer to your side...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Uh-huh, stay right there.  
Both of you, hold still for a minute.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Ohhh?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Umm... What exactly did you just do, Miss Karyl?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, I just cast a little spell on you two.  
It's an original one I developed myself,  
so it doesn't have an actual name or anything.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It gathers the oxygen in the ocean water and...  
  
Well, not much use explaining the logic.  
  
**Karyl：**  
To put it nice and simply,  
 it adapts you to the water  
so you can swim like a fish! Or something.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Y-you have transformed us into fish-people?  
Will our skin become all scaly...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's a metaphor!  
 No point explaining with words...  
Just trust me for a second and try getting in the water.  
Then you'll see what I mean about swimming like a fish.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*sigh*  
Well, you are our companion, Miss Karyl,  
so I will try doing as you say.  
  

---  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ohhh...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This is quite wonderful, my lord!  
We are beneath the waves, yet I have no trouble breathing!  
We can move around down here just as easily as on land!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So this is what Miss Karyl was trying to tell us...  
I really do feel as free as a fish in the ocean.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. It seems our bodies are entirely surrounded  
by a magical film of air. Is it being generated  
 to allow us to breathe, I suppose?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We are underwater, yet my skin does not feel at all wet...  
And I can open my eyes without any stinging from the salt water.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Whoa-oh-oh!  
This film is thin, so we still feel the effects of currents.  
I will have to be extra careful not to leave my lord's side.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If I kick off the seabed...  
My lord! I have come to join you!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh... I see we cannot talk out loud.  
That is only natural underwater, of course,  
but I wish I could share this joy with my lord somehow.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. Even without spoken words,  
I suppose we can communicate with gestures and expressions.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord...! ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Reach out to Kokkoro.  
**Choice: (2)**  Try to catch a fish.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. Our feelings seem to be in tune.  
My lord is also reaching out to share his joy. Though his voice cannot  
reach me, he is reaching out with his hands instead...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I will gladly oblige, my lord.  
Here—take my hand in yours.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh...?  
My lord is reaching out to grasp the fish swimming around us.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The way he reacts instinctively to moving objects  
is almost like a young infant.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. The fish have escaped his grasp,  
leaving my lord looking decidedly forlorn.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Fear not, I will not run away.  
My lord, if you would, take my hand in yours instead.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Heheh.  
The touch of your palm is so warm, even here in the water.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, take a look around.  
Many fish I have never seen are all swimming together in harmony.  
And this vivid forest-like scenery around us... Could it be a coral reef?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh, everything is so colorful and pretty...  
I cannot possibly express it with my own words alone.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am so glad that we came to the ocean.  
We must be sure to thank Miss Karyl properly  
for this wonderful spell she has given us.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ohhh dear... Maintaining one's posture here is not easy.  
It feels as though we are walking on some far-off planet  
where the notion of gravity does not apply.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. With your memories lost to you, my lord,  
perhaps you would not understand the notion of outer space...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In the mountains where I grew up,  
I read a lot of books and spent my time imagining such things.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The vast and empty reaches of outer space  
that lie above our heads, beyond even the sky...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Great oceans many times the size of the land,  
their murky depths beyond the reach of mankind...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
All the secrets of the world that lay beyond my home...  
The ways of far-off countries that I had never seen...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
During cold and lonely nights, I imagined all these things  
to warm my heart with wonder.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In order to serve my lord, I have come far from my home,  
and seen so many more things—more wonders—  
than I could possibly have imagined back then.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So although you may not understand why I want to say this to you...  
Thank you so very much, my lord.
