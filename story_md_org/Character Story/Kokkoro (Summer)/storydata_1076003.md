**Narration：**  
That same evening...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Zzz... Zzz... ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
M... mnhh...  
...Mnhhhh?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
H-huh?  
When did I drift off to sleep?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The sun has already sunk below the horizon...  
How terrible. Somehow it feels as though  
I have spent the entire day napping like an infant...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
All the excitement of my first trip to the seaside  
must have drained my energy more than I realized.  
*yawwwn...*  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh.  
Please excuse my yawning. I could not help myse...  
...What's this?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I-I thought my resting place seemed warm...  
It appears my lord is asleep with his arms around my body.  
Ehmmm... How did this come about, I wonder?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl and Miss Pecorine do not seem to be nearby...  
I am a little perplexed. Thinking is difficult when I have just awoken...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I suppose I have no choice.  
It seems a terrible shame when he looks so peaceful,  
but I shall awaken my lord and ask him for the details.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord... My lord!  
Please awaken for me, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
There. A good evening to you.  
It is I, your ever-faithful attendant, Kokkoro.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh, my lord...  
I am having trouble understanding how this situation arose,  
so could you explain what happened here?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Also...  
When you hold onto me so tightly, I fear my bones may break,  
so a looser grip would be welcome.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I do appreciate the warmth of your embrace, but...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Loosen your grip.  
**Choice: (2)**  Play dumb and tease her.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah...  
 Thank you—that is much better.  
I appreciate your consideration, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. Though it is midsummer, there is still a chill in the night air.  
Thanks to the warmth of your arms around me,  
I feel in no danger of catching a cold.

`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh...! Ehm, my lord? Are you still half-asleep and confused?  
Please desist... That is not food for eating.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Honestly... My lord, were you trying to eat my hairpin?  
Real flowers would be one thing, but imitation flowers  
woven from artificial fibers are certainly not edible.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. Since you first joined our Gourmet Guild,  
you have developed quite the love for eating... A good sign,  
perhaps, since eating and sleeping are the key to a healthy life.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
At any rate, ehmm...  
Why is it that the two of us seem to have been asleep here together?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Let's take a walk while I explain.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh,  
 yes.  
A fine idea, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm, I see... It was getting dark, so everyone agreed  
it was time to go home for the day? I do agree—with the low  
visibility after dark, it would be dangerous to enter the water.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So you all gathered up your possessions and prepared to walk  
to the beach cabins where we are to stay.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. I looked over the cabins in advance,  
and they are the most charming little wooden dwellings.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl seemed to have her reservations,  
but I am quite fond of their rustic atmosphere.  
We elves are predisposed to live in harmony with nature, you see.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
At any rate... When you saw I had already dozed off,  
none of you wished to awaken me...  
 So you stayed behind  
to keep watch and allow me to rest in peace.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If I awoke, we could walk to the cabins together,  
and if I did not, you would gently carry me...  
This was the plan that you eventually reached?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Karyl and Miss Pecorine are sharing one of the two cabins,  
while the other is for you and me,  
 so you took it upon yourself  
to look after me as I rested...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
However, as you held me close so that I would not be cold,  
my warmth made you drowsy, and you drifted off to sleep yourself...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That seems to make sense.  
I confess I feel a little ashamed to have made you go to such lengths.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. Our Gourmet Guild companions  
seem to treat me like the child I still technically am.  
Protecting me and spoiling me with goodwill and affection.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am not used to such treatment,  
so I do find it rather embarrassing at times...  
But it makes me happy to be welcomed with such kindness.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In my hometown, the other villagers always treated me with caution...  
They showed me respect as the daughter of the village elder,  
but respect is different from kindness and warmth.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And yet now, you all treat me with the open affection  
that most children are afforded equally,  
and in greater measures than I could possibly deserve.

**Kokkoro：**  
It is a truly blessed life I lead, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
These days I spend by your side—each and every moment of them—  
are precious treasures that used to lie ever beyond my grasp.  
They shine and glitter like the countless stars in the sky above us.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, I am so happy.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. Take your eyes off me for a moment  
and look around us, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Under the sun, the ocean waves glittered and shone  
in a most enchanting fashion, but the calm and shadowy tones  
of this empty beach in the moonlight are quite magical as well.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, my lord...  
The whisper of the waves is like a lullaby.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am beginning to feel rather drowsy once again...
