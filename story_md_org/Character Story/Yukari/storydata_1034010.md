**Narration：**  
A few days have passed since Yukari declared her broth ban.  
{player} is concerned about her, so he has come to the  
Mercurius Foundation's guildhouse.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Ah, this calculation is off.  
It looks like the numbers here haven't been added up properly.  
Let's quickly fix that.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hm? This document finally turned up?  
I asked for this type of application to be expedited.  
It's full of omissions too... I'll have to get in touch with them.  
  
**Yukari：**  
This month's sales report... Looking good,  
but there's still room for improvement.  
Let's put together a plan to cut unnecessary expenses.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Next... Oh! Well, if it isn't {player}.  
What brings you here?  
  
**Yukari：**  
I don't mean to be rude, but I'm quite busy.  
I don't really have time to chat.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hm? What's wrong?  
What's with the surprised look...?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're so efficient.  
**Choice: (2)**  You're not off your face.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yukari：**  
Heheh. Thanks.  
Wait. ...Did you think I was always drunk?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Yukari：**  
Exactly what do you think of me...?  
Well, I suppose that part of my character is all you ever see.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Yukari：**  
That's because I've only ever shown you my careless side.  
What you see now is the real me.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Understand?  
Really?  
  
**Yukari：**  
...Oh, it's already that time.  
Let's go for a dri—...  
Argh, ignore that!  
It just slipped out of my mouth by habit... Yikes...  
  
**Yukari：**  
You mustn't, Yukari!  
You vowed to give up barley broth!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Sorry, I've got to finish off the rest of my work,  
so I can't go for dinner with you!  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day...  
  
**Yukari：**  
I have tons of work today too.  
Well, best get cracking!  
  
**Narration：**  
And the next day...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Heheheh... You're fine, totally fine, Yukari!  
You live to do work!  
  
**Narration：**  
One week later...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Let me see, this document is aromatic...  
These numbers are thirst-quenching...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Doing overtime every day gives me a massive high...!  
At times like this I suddenly want to take a big swig of  
... heheheh...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Are you okay?  
`Tag 4`  
**Yukari：**  
Broth?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Ah! I-I'm fine!  
Because I'm Yukari, and I'm a responsible lady!  
  
**Yukari：**  
No, I'm not overdoing it!  
Responsible ladies show self-restraint!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Th-that's right. I'm locked up in my room doing work all day, so I can't!  
But it's best to get out and about sometimes...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Er... Oh yeah, where did that document go...?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Found it! Here it is!  
  
**Yukari：**  
You'll really come with me?  
That's reassuring, but...  
No, thank you.  
  
**Yukari：**  
I'd better tell you in advance.  
There have been reports of a monster  
on the Mercurius Foundation's distribution route.  
  
**Yukari：**  
We normally have knights do this kind of work.  
But instead of waiting for them to mobilize, it's faster to do it myself.  
  
**Yukari：**  
What? What's that look for?  
Don't you think it's a bit presumptuous to worry about me?  
I am a former holy knight after all.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Besides, getting my body moving  
really helps me keep my mind off other things...!  
  
**Yukari：**  
A-ha! There it is!  
That's definitely the monster!  
  
**Yukari：**  
That nearby... wagon?  
It looks like it's just about to be attacked!  
I'm not sure whether the timing is perfect, or downright terrible...!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Yukari：**  
But it looks like the driver has already escaped.  
In that case, let's go and deal with that thing!  
  
**Yukari：**  
I'm counting on your support!  
Here I go...  
Wait, what?  
It's brought backup...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Yukari：**  
...What the—?  
How are there this many?!  
The reports never mentioned an entourage!  
  
**Yukari：**  
But we've already been spotted. I have no choice...!  
  
**Yukari：**  
I can't drag {player} into this...!  
As a responsible lady, I have to follow through!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hahhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Yukari：**  
There are loads of them, but I can still manage!  
  
**Yukari：**  
I'm just getting started!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Yukari：**  
It's going well!  
Nope, you're not going that way!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  You're one hell of a fighter...!  
`Tag 5`  
**Yukari：**  
What did I tell you?  
There's no need to worry about me.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hehe, have you changed your opinion of me?  
  
**Yukari：**  
I was right. I just need to keep moving  
so that I don't think about barley broth!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Whew. And that's the end of that.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Just in case, we should check on the wagon.  
It's carrying...  
barrels?  
  
**Yukari：**  
They're all smashed up, and the contents...  
Hm? That smell...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Protect Yukari.  
`Tag 8`  
**Yukari：**  
Huh? {player}?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hey... Are you okay?!  
You're fine?  
Thank goodness...!  
  
**Yukari：**  
But what should I do...?  
I've caused you trouble again!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh no... the monsters... are multiplying...?  
It called for reinforcements?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
I'm so, so sorry... This is all my fault...!  
  
**Yukari：**  
What to do? Run away?  
But we're surrounded, and it's not like I  
can sling him over my shoulder and make a break for it...  
Come on!  
I'm an adult, but... my mind is all over the place.  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Drink this!  
`Tag 10`  
**Yukari：**  
...Huh?  
What's that liquid you're cupping in your hands?  
No,  
there's no mistaking...  
  
**Yukari：**  
That smell... that color... It's barley broth!  
The cargo that wagon was transporting...!  
  
**Yukari：**  
H-hold on a minute, {player}!  
Why are you shoving it in my face?  
Stop, I can't! You know I'm under a broth ban!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, it smells so good...  
Not! You sure are persistent!  
We're in the midst of battle! Can't you see we're surrounded?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Stop overthinking it?  
Yeah, maybe I'm thinking of unnecessary things, but...!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Drinking it will somehow help?  
My secret power...?!  
I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about...!  
  
**Yukari：**  
...!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh! So good...!  
I've been dying for a swig...!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Ungh. Damn, I drank it!  
Oh, it's been so long, it feels really strong...!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Huh? Drink summore?  
Come on, stooop!  
Why are ya making me drink?!  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hey, shaddup! Ya talk too muchhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Yukari：**  
I said enough!  
That'sh it, yer all goin' down!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Don't ya dare messh with me!  
  
**Narration：**  
Thus, Yukari cast away her doubts, and in a rampage  
eradicated all the remaining monsters.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Huh?  
Wh-what happened...?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Wh-why are you burned? What happened?!  
You got caught up in it? In what?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
What happened?!
