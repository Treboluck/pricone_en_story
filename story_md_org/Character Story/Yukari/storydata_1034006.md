# Yukari Episode 6
Yukari sets her mind on making a feast by hand, but the dismal results send her into a tailspin. She soon recovers, though, when her womanly ways are praised, making the rest of the night a fun-filled affair.
  
## Subtitle: Praise the Feast!
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is walking around town when Yukari calls out to him.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hey, {player}.  
Can you come over to my place tomorrow?  
  
**Yukari：**  
What? Well,  
y-yeah, it will just be the two of us...  
B-but don't read anything into it!  
  
**Yukari：**  
It's just, lately I feel like I've been showing you  
only the most horrible parts of myself.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I don't think you're horrible in the slightest.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yukari：**  
Ohh, why do you have to be so nice?  
Most people would be  
starting to get fed up with me by this point.  
  
**Yukari：**  
I mean, I'm pretty fed up with myself...  
I just wish I could show you more of what a mature woman I am, {player}.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Which brings us to tomorrow...  
{player}, I'd like to treat you to a home-cooked meal.  
Will you let me show you a little hospitality?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Yes? Really?  
Thank you!  
O-okay then, I need to go get ready!  
See you tomorrow!  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} arrives at the Mercurius Foundation guildhouse.  
He opens the door to find Yukari kneeling and bowing to him  
in welcome.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hello, {player}.  
I bid you welcome.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Wow, this is quite the courteous reception.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yukari：**  
Heheh, you think so? Thank you.  
Now then, my room is over there.  
I'll come and join you shortly.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Huh? Why can't I show you the way?  
Um, well, you see...  
I actually have something I need to take care of first.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, wait, don't come any closer!  
Seriously, I can't move right now!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Owowow...  
M-my legs fell asleep while I was kneeling,  
and now I can't stand up...  
  
**Yukari：**  
G-get it together, Yukari!  
I'm whipping up a meal that will knock your socks off,  
{player}!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Normally I only cook simple dishes, but this is a special occasion.  
I'm making carbonara, gratin, pudding...  
A real full-course feast!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Eep!  
Th-the egg exploded.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You okay there?  
`Tag 3`  
**Yukari：**  
I-it's fine. Perfectly fine!  
Just a little mishap.  
I'll get this turned around,  
and then we'll have the ultimate full-course meal.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Wait, what's that smell?  
 The bacon is burning?!  
Oh nooo, it's black as charcoal...  
  
**Yukari：**  
B-but hey, don't you worry. I've got this under control!  
The real comeback starts now!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Ack! No, no, don't open that closet!  
If you do, the trash bags will...  
Ohhh, it's an avalanche!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hey, where did I put the plates... Eek!!  
  
**Yukari：**  
I tripped.  
Seriously, who would put a vase here?!  
....Oh, I guess it was me.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Um, {player}? Your face is bright red... Are you okay?  
Hey, is that my underwear? I forgot to put it away?!  
Oh, oh, nooo! Forget you saw that!  
  
**Yukari：**  
I-I'm not much good at anything, am I...  
  
**Yukari：**  
L-looks like my plans of showing how much of a grown woman I am  
have gone up in flames...  
I guess a person really can't change overnight, huh.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You've got it all wrong.  
`Tag 4`  
**Yukari：**  
Thanks for saying that, {player}...  
But it's fine.  
You don't need someone who... fails this much as a woman.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh? {player}, did you hurt your arm?  
Did a monster do that to you?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  It's nothing.  
`Tag 5`  
**Yukari：**  
Don't be silly, it must be painful.  
Wait right there, I'll get you fixed up in a jiffy.  
  
**Yukari：**  
There we are. Good as new.  
Make sure to tell me right away the next time you're hurt.  
No acting tough, you hear?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Now that's what I call a responsible adult.  
`Tag 6`  
**Yukari：**  
Huh? Me, responsible?  
C-come on, now you're just teasing me, aren't you...  
You've always known how to push my buttons.  
  
**Yukari：**  
It's just, when I'm with you, {player},  
I feel so at ease that I guess, well,  
I guess I just relax and let myself go too much.  
  
**Yukari：**  
But... that also means whenever I need to talk,  
you're the first person who pops into my head.  
I think you're pretty wonderful too, {player}.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, oh gosh, just listen to me.  
Um, forget I said any of that!  
Yeah, l-let's eat!  
  
**Yukari：**  
As it happens, I keep some pre-made stuff on hand  
in case of kitchen disasters!  
I know, it's not quite  
the stylish spread I promised...  
  
**Yukari：**  
That sounds good to you?  
Thank you, {player}...  
Okay. Well, let's dig in.  
And once we've finished our dinner, it's time for drinks!  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} and a delighted Yukari proceeded  
to make merry until the wee hours of the morning.
