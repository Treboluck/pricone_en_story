**Yukari：**  
Eheheh. Gahahaha!  
Ahh, nothin' beats that first drink after work!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hey...  
You're that cutie-boy from the other day!  
  
**Yukari：**  
C'mon, there's an open spot right here! Siddown, siddown!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Huh? Have I been drinking?  
Heheh, well what else'd I be doin' in a place like this?  
Man, nothin' beats a cold barley broth! I love, love, *love* it!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Huh? My top button is undone?  
Heheh, don't be such a prude!  
What's the big deal, eh?  
  
**Yukari：**  
C'mon, grab yourself a drink!  
  
Ah wait, you're a minor, huh?  
Okay then, juice it is!

**Yukari：**  
Ohh, how can I not drink?!  
I mean, this town is infested with nothing  
but couples lately!  
  
**Yukari：**  
And yet when I walk around town,  
all I get are catcalls from scumbags looking to hook up!  
  
**Yukari：**  
A nice girl like me gets lonely at night too, ya know?  
Ya think I don't want a nice lover boy of my own?  
I still dream of finding my sweet prince!  
  
**Yukari：**  
But all I seem to find in life are losers!  
And that is why I drink!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Pat her head.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, your hand is so warm.  
Are you trying make me feel better?  
*sniffle* You're the only one who's nice to me...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Social conformity? What a joke! Lemme drink however I want!  
I'll have you know, even when I get sloppy drunk,  
I've never *once* had a guy try to take me home!  
  
**Yukari：**  
I always! Always! End up dumped in the street!  
Won't someone please carry me home?!  
  
**Female Customer：**  
Oh, can we get these to go?  
  
**Yukari：**  
W-w-wassat?!  
Wh-wh-who'sh...  
*burp* who'sh the one gettin' carried out? Who?!  
  
**Owner：**  
Um...  
She's just ordering one of our sandwiches...  
  
**Female Customer：**  
I was hoping to eat them at home later...  
Uh, excuse me, are you?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Uh, huh? I'm... Mm, I...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Mmm, can't... k-keep my eyesh open—  
  
**Yukari：**  
...Zzz, zzz...  
  
**Owner：**  
Oh boy, looks like she's passed out again...  
Hey, kid, you know her?  
Sorry to ask, but would you mind seeing her home?  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} carries Yukari back to the guildhouse.  
She wakes up just as he is putting her to bed.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Mmm, hey, is this... my room?  
Oh, {player}?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Let me guess... Did I go overboard with the drinks again?  
  
**Yukari：**  
O-oh, dang it... Ugh, when will I ever learn?  
  
**Yukari：**  
I'm sorry you had to see that...  
I try so hard to present myself as a nice, capable lady,  
but I always seem to ruin it.  
  
**Yukari：**  
I'm sure you must be disappointed in me too, huh?  
You must think I'm awful.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Not at all.  
`Tag 4`  
**Yukari：**  
Huh?  
You're happy to see another side of me? R-really?  
Well that's a relief...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Heheh.  
You know what, {player}? You really are a nice boy.  
Thank you.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Phew. Well, I really blew it today.  
I can't believe I got so drunk that poor boy had  
to take me home.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Wait, no way. He took me home? Really?  
But that would make this the first time a guy has ever  
taken me home...  
  
**Yukari：**  
I went home with a guy... for the first time ever!  
Oh, Ohmigosh!  
  
**Narration：**  
A thoroughly embarrassed Yukari rolled around on her bed alone.
