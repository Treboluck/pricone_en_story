## Subtitle: Finding My Prince
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is walking around town one day when—  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hmm... Agh, it's just so cute!  
If only it were just a teensy bit cheaper,  
I could actually to afford it.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Yukari?  
`Tag 1`  
**Yukari：**  
Huh? Oh, {player}!  
G-good to see you!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Um, about the other day...  
Eheheh, I'm sorry you had to see me all drunk and silly like that.  
  
**Yukari：**  
You said everything was fine, but...  
It'd be nice if you didn't hate me.  
Um, yeah, hahaha...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Seriously, I don't hate you.  
**Choice: (3)**  I was a bit disappointed, to be honest.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, whew.  
Heheheh. Thank you!  
  
**Yukari：**  
That's a big relief.  
Yeah, I mean, I guess you did carry me home, after all...  
How silly of me.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Yukari：**  
What? Oh, oh no!  
I-I've ruined everything...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Wait, you say you're joking...? You don't hate me at all?  
Ohmigosh, you're horrible!  
You shouldn't tease a girl like that!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Yukari：**  
What's that? What am I doing here?  
Well, I was doing a bit of shopping.  
  
**Yukari：**  
And I found this! Take a look at this bracelet in the armor shop.  
Isn't it absolutely adorable?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Unfortunately, it's that price written underneath  
that really steals the show...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Apparently it's a one-off, which is why it's so expensive...  
With the guild finances though, there's no room for luxuries...  
So here I am, stuck just drooling over this lovely item.  
  
**Yukari：**  
*sigh* If only I could afford it.  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day, {player} walks past the armor shop when—  
  
**Tool Shop Owner：**  
Thief!!  
  
**Thief：**  
Gyahyahah! Every last rupie in this dump is mine!  
See ya, suckers!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Grab him!  
`Tag 5`  
**Thief：**  
Huh? What the hell, kid? You lookin' to die or somethi—  
Gwargh!  
  
**Tool Shop Owner：**  
Oh, thank you so much! You have my deepest gratitude!  
If that lout had made off with all of our sales this month...  
Well, we'd have had to close up shop! You really helped us!  
  
**Tool Shop Owner：**  
By way of thanks, please pick out an item from the shop.  
Please, choose whatever you like!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Don't mind if I do.  
`Tag 6`  
**Narration：**  
The next day, {player} goes looking for Yukari.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, {player}.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Hmm? I look a little sad?  
Heheh, sorry. I didn't mean to worry you.  
  
**Yukari：**  
The truth is, I was going to buy that bracelet I wanted today.  
I took out a bit of my savings and was practically  
skipping in excitement on my way to the shop...  
  
**Yukari：**  
But someone beat me to it.  
I really had my heart set on it!  
But I guess it just wasn't meant to be.  
  
**Yukari：**  
It's too bad, really. But that's just life, I guess.  
I'm sure someone with a wonderful, fulfilling life  
got their boyfriend to buy it for them.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Alas, there is no such kind sweetheart in my life...  
I just need to face the facts.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I have a present for you.  
`Tag 7`  
**Yukari：**  
What, a present? You got something for me?  
  
**Yukari：**  
O-oh my!  
This—this is that bracelet I wanted!  
  
**Yukari：**  
D-do I feel better now? No, that's not it.  
How do I put it... It's just that this...  
This is the first time I've ever gotten a gift from a guy!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Okay, deep breaths, Yukari.  
In... Out... In... Out...  
L-let's go over the situation here.  
  
**Yukari：**  
I didn't get the bracelet because I haven't found my true love.  
B-but then {player} came along and gave it to me!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Wait, does this mean... {player} is my prince?! Oh no!  
Ohmigosh!! Wh-what do I do...? How am I supposed to date  
someone who isn't even of drinking age?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
What?! Oh. Well, now that I think about it...  
I probably shouldn't read too much into it. *sigh*  
  
**Yukari：**  
...Still, a gift *is* a gift.  
Really, thank you so, so much! I'll treasure it forever.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Anyway, I know one girl who's going to be happy tonight!  
You really made my day today, you know that? Thanks again!  
  
**Narration：**  
And with that said, an elated Yukari clutched her new bracelet to her chest.
