Hey, {player}...

**Yukari：**  
Th-the thing is...  
  
**Young Man：**  
Hey, Yukari. *This* is your boyfriend?  
You gotta be kiddin' me.  
  
**Yukari：**

**Young Man：**  
What're you two whispering about?  
Something's off here.

**Young Man：**  
Damn show-offs. What's so good about this chump anyway?!

**Yukari：**  
Hmm, maybe that'sh true... but I dunno.

Okaaay, bye-bye!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Whew... I feel a little better after that water.  
Thanks for your help, {player}. You're a lifesaver.  
  
**Yukari：**  
You didn't do anything?  
Don't be silly.  
Thanks to you, I was able to say what needed to be said.  
And that's not all.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Those things I said... Actually, not all of them were lies.  
When it comes to you, {player}, I—

**Ameth：**  
There we are. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Think of what you just saw as something of a dream.  
Chances are you'll forget about it as soon as you wake up,  
so no need to brood over it that much.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Still... Things did seem to be going well for you back there.  
With Yukari, I mean.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's a handful, but it seems like you enjoy that part of her.  
I don't really get it, but I guess there's no harm in wishing  
the two of you well, is there?  
  
**Ameth：**  
After all, it looks like you and drinking are the only things  
keeping \"this\" Yukari and the \"other\" Yukari going...  
So, just keep on being nice to her, okay?  
  
**Ameth：**  
If you do, then maybe you can be more than just  
a younger guy she feels she can open up to...  
Maybe one day, you can be her prince.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But talking to me isn't going to change anything,  
so let's stop there for now. Go collect some more Memory Shards,  
and I'll show you another \"dream.\"  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, catch you later! ♪

**Yukari：**  
...Huh? Is this...?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Um, did you see that just now too, {player}?  
The same dream as me?  
It was... a strange one, to say the least.  
  
**Yukari：**  
But... I can't believe I said all those things to you,  
even if I was drunk.  
I'm so embarrassed.  
  
**Yukari：**  
A-anyway, it might have all been a dream,  
but you still came through for me back there.  
Thank you! ♪  
  
**Narration：**  
Yukari positively glowed with joy as she spoke.
