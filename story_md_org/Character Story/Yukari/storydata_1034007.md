## Subtitle: A Heart-Racing Combo
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is walking the streets when he happens  
upon Yukari having a drink on a terrace.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, why if it isn't {player}. How are you?  
Hey, you've gotta check out this magazine!  
  
**Yukari：**  
It's got a feature ranking all the heart-fluttering situations  
girls want to experience before getting old...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Ohhh, it really ticks me off!  
I mean, I haven't experienced a single one of these things!  
  
**Yukari：**  
Not like I have anyone to do them to me, either!  
I'm gonna grow old without knowing any excitement!  
...*sniffle* *sob* I-I can't bear the thought of it!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  There, there.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yukari：**  
Are you trying to console me...?  
If so, then how about you try these things on me?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Why the surprise? You want to help me, right...?  
Just do some of the things in the list to me.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, yeah, it won't be for real, of course.  
Even just a little taste of these bittersweet moments of youth  
would be enough for me as I ease into old age...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Are you sure?  
`Tag 2`  
**Yukari：**  
Hm? Eheheh, what' s got you so worried?  
What, you don't think I would seriously go for  
a younger fella like you, do you?  
  
**Yukari：**  
C'mon, it'll be good practice for you, too.  
So don't hold back! Lay it on me!  
  
**Yukari：**  
You'll do it?  
Yay!  
Sooo, I want you to do the top three things girls want  
in descending order.  
First up is...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Number three: the hand against the wall!  
Okay. I'm gonna put my back against the wall.  
Now, take your hand and slam it here!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Slam your hand onto the wall.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yukari：**  
Oh...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Y-your face is so close, your breath so warm...  
There's nowhere for me to run...  
A-and your eyes are staring straight into my soul...  
  
**Yukari：**  
I-I...  
I feel like anything could happen at this moment...  
Oh my—  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Step back.  
`Tag 4`  
**Yukari：**  
Huh?  
Whew, I-I gotta say, that got me a little excited!  
If I were even just a little less mature,  
who knows what would've happened!  
  
**Yukari：**  
A-anyways, next!  
Let's see, number two is stroking my hair!  
R-right then! Bring it on!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Stroke her hair.  
`Tag 5`  
**Yukari：**  
Ahhh...  
Mmyeah, wow, I can feel myself melting like pudding...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Eheheh, your hand feels so nice on my head, {player}...  
I could stay like this forever and it would never get...  
Oh!  
  
**Yukari：**  
N-no, I absolutely wasn't melting.  
I'm a grown woman, after all. Th-that was nothing!  
  
**Yukari：**  
*huff* *huff*  
All right, let's wrap this up!  
Now then, number one is...  
Huh?!  
  
**Yukari：**  
A-a hug from behind?  
No, no way, that's too much...  
I mean that's, come on... Right?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh no, I'm totally fine with it.  
I'm just thinking it's too much for you, right, {player}?  
Right?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Y-you're okay with it?  
O-oh, I see... Okay then, whenever you're ready.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Hug Yukari from behind.  
`Tag 6`  
**Yukari：**  
Ohhh... O-oh my.  
{player}, your chest, it's so big and muscular...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Embrace her more tightly.  
`Tag 7`  
**Yukari：**  
Ahh,  
this is... I-I understand now, ohhh—  
  
**Yukari：**  
W-wow, I feel so warm.  
Our hearts, they're beating together... in unison.  
And I can hear you breathing, too...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Ah, no, no!  
I-I can't take any more of this.  
I, uh, {player}!  
I have to bail!  
  
**Yukari：**  
*huff* *huff* Th-that was close.  
If that went on any longer, I don't know.  
I think you just might've fallen for me.  
  
**Yukari：**  
Still, that article was definitely on to something.  
Hmm?  
Here's another page... What do we have here?  
\"The Number One Thing Girls Don't Want Others to See About Them\"?  
  
**Yukari：**  
Let's see, for younger girls it's how sloppy they are...  
while for older women it's... what they're like when drunk.  
Huh.  
You know, that really sounds like me...  
  
**Yukari：**  
...A-anyway, we probably shouldn't take anything printed in  
one of these cheap, mass-market rags too seriously! Yeah!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Feel better now?  
`Tag 8`  
**Yukari：**  
Huh? Oh, yeah, uh, I, well...  
I think maybe I feel a little too good, I mean...  
  
**Yukari：**  
Oh, would you look at the time!  
Thanks for your help, {player}!  
I'd better get home.  
  
**Yukari：**  
S-see you later! ♪  
  
**Yukari：**  
Eek!  
Oww, I tripped...  
I-I got so worked up that my legs are like rubber.  
  
**Narration：**  
A flustered Yukari rushed home,  
clearly shaken up by today's events.
