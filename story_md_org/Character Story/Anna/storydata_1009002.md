**Narration：**  
With an indomitable smirk on her face,  
Annerose von Stechpalm emerges from a darkened alley,  
her legs trembling slightly.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Heheheh... Haha... hah...!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
How could I completely empty my whole purse...?!  
Curse the price tags on those ancient tomes...!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
At this rate, there will be no banquet for me tonight...  
And even I can't maintain this physical form  
without nourishment...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I used up all the money from my last bounty...  
My only hope is to swiftly capture another rogue...!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
And yet... In this terribly depleted state,  
it would be dangerous to mount an attack alone...  
What should I do...?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Aha! Who could it be but my old friend Sigurd?!  
Your timing is perfect!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
My funds have grown slim of late...  
So I was planning to hunt down a new bounty target.  
Would you care to accompany me?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  If there's money in it for me.  
`Tag 1`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Could it be... you too are financially troubled?  
Hah... I see our paths are fated to intertwine.  
Rejoice, Sigurd! Our souls' bond remains unbroken in this world!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
With that decided, let us hunt down our target at once!  
Sound the horn of battle's dawn!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Come, Sigurd! You are ready to begin, I hope?  
If my intel is correct, the outlaw's den  
should lie just beyond here.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Now then, our battle plan for today is...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
An all-out assault!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
What's wrong? Did you expect the mighty Stechpalm  
to resort to cowardly tactics?  
Onward, Sigurd! Let our plan commence!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Show yourself, wanted outlaw! We know you're in there!  
If you refuse to emerge willingly,  
 the ultimate magick  
sealed in my right arm will be your undoing!  
  
**Minion：**  
What in blazes? Bounty hunters, eh?  
You're... that Stechpalm chick!  
The Living Storm of Landosol! Well, ain't that something!  
  
**Bounty：**  
Heh... And she thinks she can take us on, does she?  
I'd like to see her try!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
He has companions?  
Ah well! That should present little issue!  
Any number of rogues will pale before our might!  
  
**Bounty：**  
Big words for a wee lassie!  
C'mon, boys! Slaughter her!  
  
**Minions：**  
Yeahhhh!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Challenge accepted!  
Come, Sigurd! To battle! Now, bare your blade!  
Let us show them the futility of defying the Darkest Knights!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Ngh...! Inconceivable! How can their strength rival ours?!  
  
**Bounty：**  
What's wrong? That the best you got?!  
Guess you're all bark and no bite!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
So, we are faced by monstrous foes!  
I will have to unleash my Ultimate Magick of Infinite Annihilation!  
...Evil Eye, Open!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Awaken, Lord of Hades, to whom the dead bow!  
Rain unending destruction upon those who would defy thee!  
  
**Bounty：**  
C'mon, boys! What're you playing at?!  
Finish her already!  
  
**Minion：**  
You got it, bro!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Ngh...! Their offensive is too intense for words!  
I can't complete my incantation...!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Leave that to me.  
`Tag 2`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Sigurd?! Do you mean to act as bait...?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...So be it. Don't die on me, Sigurd!  
That's an order from your commanding Regent!  
Give them hell!  
  
**Bounty：**  
What now? You think you can take us on your own?  
You've got guts, boy! We'll crush ya!  
  
**Minion：**  
Argh... Hey, quit it! Get back here where I can kill ya!  
  
**Bounty：**  
Dammit! I can't land a hit on him!  
He's a nimble little scoundrel!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Sigurd... You have done well. My incantation is complete!  
Taste the flames of all the magick I possess...  
and know despair, villains!  
  
**Bounty：**  
What kind of power is that?!  
You wouldn't dare! It'll wipe out your friend here, too—  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Take this! Dragonic Demolition Burst!  
  
**Bounties：**  
Nguaaaaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Heh... You poor fools never stood a chance.  
Rejoice, Sigurd! Victory is ours!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
S-Sigurd...?  
What has become of you?! You're burnt all over!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
How could they do this to you?!  
Ngh... Curse you, foul ruffians!  
While I cast my incantation, you bared your cruel fangs?!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I got caught in your magic blast.  
`Tag 3`  
**Stechpalm：**  
You were still down there?! I thought you'd already run away...  
I'm sorry... I'll be more careful next time...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  It's OK, don't cry.  
**Choice: (5)**  Did you just talk normally...?  
`Tag 4`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Wh-what did you say?!  
As if I would ever shed tears of weakness!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Ah... N-nonsense!  
 Whatever could you mean?!  
My majesty is unwavering!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Stechpalm：**  
At any rate, it seems your burns are nothing serious,  
so let us turn these rogues in for our bounty!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Wh-what a reversal of fortune!  
To think there were bounties on all his minions as well!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I never dreamed of such a reward!  
See, Sigurd, these riches are for the two of us alone!  
Is this not the finest of days?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Ah... I know, Sigurd!  
Tell me, are... Are you...  
 free this evening?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Would you join me in a meal of celebration?  
It is my treat! As apology for the damage I caused you...  
And as thanks for your help, in this world and the last!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Where would I be without my comrade,  
Sigurd of the Fulgor?!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so, slapping {player} on the back,  
the triumphant Annerose von Stechpalm set off to find a mighty feast.
