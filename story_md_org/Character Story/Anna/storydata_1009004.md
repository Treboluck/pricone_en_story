**Narration：**  
One day, when {player} is out shopping,  
a shadowy figure manifests before him.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Heh heh heh... We meet yet again, Sigurd!  
But stay on your guard. The Syndicate's eyes are everywhere.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
It is my task to infiltrate their ranks unnoticed.  
As such, I must away!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
What are you doing?  
This is the part where you give our secret greeting!  
Surely you cannot have forgotten...?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
You truly cannot remember our greeting?!  
Honestly, how disappointing...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Listen and learn.  
It's \"In the depths of Gehenna, a gale arises!\"  
Now, don't forget it again!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Though your memories of your past self still have yet to return,  
there is no need to rush. Fate can be a tricky master.  
It will surely grant you what you seek when you truly need it.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Now then! I must return at once to my infiltration of—  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Wh-what is this strange light?!  
A Syndicate attack?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
S-such blinding force!  
 Aaaaaaghhhhh!

**Anna：**  
Almighty mana that governs this plane!  
I sacrifice thee now to summon great treasure!  
  
**Staff：**  
Thank you, have a nice day!  
  
**Anna：**  
Thank you very much!  
  
**Anna：**  
Heh heh heh... Finally, it is in my hands!  
\"Godslayer Bahamutia: The Movie,\" in disc form,  
with the exclusive store bonus!  
 Thank goodness I preordered!  
  
**Anna：**  
I must return home and unveil the wall scroll at once!  
No... Perhaps I should relive the movie's events first?!  
  
**Anna：**  
Ah, but the special audio commentary also intrigues me!  
Two whole commentary tracks, from the staff and the cast!  
  
**Anna：**  
It is thanks to this tale that my world was expanded!  
I still remember how it taught me the value of  
unfurling my wings of creativity!  
  
**Anna：**  
Oh no, wait... I just realized, I have yet to share  
my exploits in Astrum yesterday on social media...  
Perhaps that should take first priority.  
  
**Anna：**  
My \"Chronicle of the Order of Gehenna Immortals\"...!  
It has gained several new readers these past few days,  
so I cannot afford to disappoint them! To my castle it is!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  In the depths of Gehenna, a gale arises!  
`Tag 1`  
**Anna：**  
What?! Who goes there?!  
You, stranger... Why do you know that greeting?!  
  
**Anna：**  
...No, wait...  
I have only ever shared that greeting  
with a single living soul...!  
  
**Anna：**  
Can it be, then?! Sigurd of the Fulgor? Is that you?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  The one and only.  
`Tag 2`  
**Anna：**  
Incredible...!  
 So you too were born into this world  
in the same age as I!  
  
**Anna：**  
We are sworn comrades, our souls bound by fate!  
That must be what has brought about this miracle!  
Heh heh heh... Ahahahahah!  
  
**Anna：**  
To think our reincarnated forms  
would meet in this physical plane, as well as Astrum!  
It brings me great joy!  
  
**Anna：**  
Such a fine miracle would test the power even of the gods!  
It seems our bond has the strength to cross even  
the void between realities!  
  
**School Girl 2：**  
Oh my, I do believe I spy Miss Hiragi!  
A good day to you!  
  
**Anna：**  
Whiergh?!  
 G-g-g-good day...  
  
**Anna：**  
N-now listen, Sigurd!  
The form I take here is but an illusory guise!  
My true self is Annerose von Stech—  
  
**School Girl 2：**  
Oh, Anna, my dear! Good day!  
And whoever might this fellow be...?  
  
**Anna：**  
G-good day...! E-ehmm...!  
H-he is my... cousin. H-he's just passing through...  
  
**Anna：**  
This is bad...! We're right near the school!  
At this rate,  
 my soul's link with this body will be severed!  
  
**Anna：**  
S-Sigurd! \"Anna Hiragi\" is but an alias I use to conceal myself!  
It's not my true identity! I'm begging you, don't forget that!  
  
**Anna：**  
And now, I must away!  
\"In the depths of Gehenna, a gale arises!\"  
Auf Wiedersehen!

**Ameth：**  
There. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just experienced was something like a dream.  
You'll probably forget most of it when you wake up,  
so don't worry about it too much.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You know, I thought Anna was a proper demon,  
but maybe I had her all wrong...  
  
**Ameth：**  
If everything she's been saying was just her personal fantasies...  
That's kind of sad, but also more than a little impressive...  
  
**Ameth：**  
All that stuff about reincarnation...  
I don't know how she can come up with it on the spot.  
Just how deep do these fantasies of hers go...?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, no point in wasting too much time here.  
I think that's enough for today.  
 Bye-bye now!  
  

---  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Mnhh... Hmm?  
Where am I...? What was I doing...?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Ahh! That's right! What of Sigurd?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Ahhh, Sigurd! I knew you would not abandon me!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
So, Sigurd...  
It seems that even if we were born in another world entirely,  
fate would still have conspired to bring us together!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
However! You must forget all about the other identity  
you witnessed just now!  
I-is that quite clear?!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Good day, my dear Miss Hiragi.  
**Choice: (4)**  Got it.  
`Tag 3`  
**Stechpalm：**  
That's exactly what you're not supposed to say!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Well, that's reassuring to hear...  
I'm counting on you, my trusty Sigurd.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Stechpalm：**  
But I have to wonder...  
Are these alternate selves of ours  
still enjoying their lives in that other world...?  
  
**Narration：**  
That day, the incomparable Annerose von Stechpalm  
became so preoccupied with theories about other dimensions  
that she almost forgot to head home at all.
