**Narration：**  
As {player} strolls through the city  
after finishing his work for the day,  
he runs into the auspicious Annerose von Stechpalm.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Heh... Sigurd, there you are!  
I knew I would find you if I came to this area!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
In our former lives, you and I were closer than family,  
after all.  
 Naturally I am able to predict  
every last one of your actions!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Today, I was hoping you would join me  
in preparing for battle with the Institute,  
a new foe that has arisen to—  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Ngh! What is this light?!  
Can it be an Institute attack already?!  
Sigurd, try to stay with me!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
This light... It's too strong...!  
Aaaarghhhhh!

**Anna：**  
Heh... I see the truth now.  
This castle's name is Dracheburg!  
  
**Child１：**  
Whoaaa!  
That sounds cool!  
  
**Anna：**  
Heheh... It does, doesn't it?  
  
**Anna：**  
Atop this castle's tallest tower, a beautiful princess is imprisoned.  
And yet, none can save her, for the castle is guarded by a dragon!  
All who approach its walls will simply become food for the beast!  
  
**Child２：**  
Ohhh... That's scary...  
  
**Anna：**  
Ah, but worry not! For one such as myself,  
slaying a dragon is child's play!  
I will save the princess without fail!  
  
**Child１：**  
Ahh!  
So cool! Awesome!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You seem to be having fun.  
`Tag 1`  
**Anna：**  
These children listen to all of my tales  
with such boundless enthusiasm, I cannot help myself!  
  
**Anna：**  
...Hang on, Sigurd?! Where did you come from?!  
H-h-how did you find me here?!  
  
**Anna：**  
W-wait! It's not what you think!  
The mighty Hecate of the Gale  
would never stoop to playing happily with children!  
  
**Anna：**  
These kids are, ah, residents of this neighborhood...  
And I was... looking after them, in a manner of speaking?  
  
**Child２：**  
Hey, hey, Anna! Who's this guy?  
Is he a friend of yours?  
  
**Anna：**  
Y-yes...? Sigurd is...  
I'm not sure how I should explain...  
  
**Anna：**  
Sigurd and I... ehm... fought together in my past life...  
He's a comrade who stayed by my side to the very end!  
  
**Child１：**  
By your side...?  
Oh! So he's your husband!  
  
**Anna：**  
N-n-no!  
I mean, this is all in our previous life!  
  
**Anna：**  
...It is true that in that world, we were closer than family.  
At the end, we did become lovers... Yes, we were married!  
But all of that took place in a world long perished, so...  
  
**Child２：**  
Ooh, really? You were married?!  
  
**Child１：**  
If you're married, you should kiss him!  
  
**Child２：**  
Yeah, I wanna see!  
Kiss him! Kiss him!  
  
**Anna：**  
Wh-what madness is this?!  
Like I said, this all happened in a previous life!  
In this world, we are not yet so...  
  
**Anna：**  
A-aaahh... Really, we aren't...  
I couldn't... couldn't possibly...  
  
**Anna：**  
W-waaaaghhhhhh!

**Ameth：**  
There. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That Anna is surprisingly pure, isn't she?  
In her stories, she's done all sorts of bold things...  
But when it comes to real life, she gets all embarrassed.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Of course, that's what makes her so cute.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Though I expect she herself wouldn't be happy to hear that.  
So I guess your approach might be best in the end.  
Not fully believing her stories, but not denying them either.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Comrades in a previous life, was it?  
Cute backstory, I know. Is she doing all this on purpose?  
At any rate, the two of you make a good duo.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I hope I can count on you  
to take good care of that girl in the future.  
Mr. Sigurd of the Fulgor!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, that's enough chitchat for now.  
Bye-bye. See you around!

**Stechpalm：**  
...Where... am I?  
I was just... in a dream, and... Urk?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
S-Sigurd!  
Could it be... you entered that dream alongside me?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  At the end, we were married?  
`Tag 2`  
**Stechpalm：**  
N-no no no! That was us in a different world, not...  
We're not about to k-kiss or anything...!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
L-listen... It's only our past selves that were lovers!  
Don't misunderstand my intentions!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
In this life, it's not like I have any...  
A-any... feelings for...!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
W-waaaaghhhhhh!  
  
**Narration：**  
Just like in the dream, the supersonic Annerose von Stechpalm  
fled the scene with a face like burning embers...
