## Subtitle: Rise of the Syndicate
  
**Narration：**  
One day when {player} is out for a walk,  
the tumultuous Annerose von Stechpalm descends upon him in a frenzy.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Listen to this, Sigurd!  
Finally... Finally, the Syndicate has emerged from the shadows!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
The time has come for the Order of Gehenna Immortals  
to confront its greatest enemy!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  They really exist, huh?  
**Choice: (2)**  It... It can't be!  
`Tag 1`  
**Stechpalm：**  
But of course!  
I speak nothing but the gospel truth!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Stechpalm：**  
A wonderful reaction! That's my Sigurd, all right!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Stechpalm：**  
If my intel is correct, it seems a group of villains  
calling themselves the \"Syndicate\"  
have been committing crimes all across the continent.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Their specific identities and numbers are as yet unknown,  
but a bounty has already been placed upon their heads.  
Many bounty hunters are competing to track them down!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Our archenemies have appeared...  
So of course, we must face them ourselves!  
You and I together will stop the Syndicate once and for all!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
If I am to face them,  
I will need the support of my fellow Darkest Knight.  
Will you join me, Sigurd?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'm with you.  
`Tag 4`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Ahh! No less from my comrade!  
I have already identified the location of the Syndicate's lair!  
Let us go now and face them!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
If my intel is correct, the Syndicate's activities  
have been centered on this volcano.  
It must surely hide the location of their evil lair!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...! I sense magical energy!  
 ...There you are!  
You can't hide from me, villains! Show yourselves!  
  
**Syndicate Member 1：**  
Heh heh heh...  
To think you saw through our ruse.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Are you... the Syndicate?  
  
**Syndicate Member 2：**  
Indeed we are!  
Feast your eyes upon those destined to  
spread chaos in this world! The Syndicate!  
  
**Syndicate Member 3：**  
We are the chosen few. Once rulers of a world now fallen,  
this world too will soon be ours!  
Should humanity oppose us, we shall obliterate them!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Did you hear that, Sigurd?! The Syndicate really does exist!  
And those words just now...  
 You fiends must be  
the tyrants who tried to rule our old world... The Planetary Arbiters!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
So the Arbiters founded the Syndicate to conquer this world too,  
and build an new empire of tyranny! But you shall go no further!  
For we are those who stand in the Syndicate's path!  
  
**Syndicate Member１：**  
Whaaaat?!  
But that would mean...! Can it be?!

**Stechpalm：**  
Yes, it is I! Grand Regent of the Order of Gehenna Immortals,  
Annerose von Stechpalm!  
Better known as... Hecate of the Gale!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I will never allow a second coming of Ragnarök!  
'Tis our duty as Darkest Knights to face the Planetary Arbiters!  
Though the old world has fallen, I will not cease to defy you!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
As long as I draw breath, your evils will not go unpunished!  
  
**Syndicate Member１：**  
Hecate of the Gale...! What a fantastic backstory!  
My brothers, is this girl not the ultimate talent?!  
  
**Syndicate Member 2：**  
I feel mortified just watching her!  
This is precisely the turn of events we have longed for!  
  
**Syndicate Member 3：**  
...Your bravado is most impressive.  
However, do you really think you can stand in our way?!  
The Syndicate's power is not to be taken lightly!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
We will not yield!  
Destroying you is my life's purpose!  
  
`image display end`  
**Syndicate Member１：**  
...By the way, who's the fellow standing beside you?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Beside me...?  
Ah! This is...  
  
**Syndicate Member 2：**  
Hold it! Let the guy introduce himself, why don't you?!  
Obviously it'll be far cooler that way!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
U-uhh... I cannot deny that it would be cool,  
but Sigurd is not exactly cut out for...  
  
**Syndicate Member 3：**  
What's wrong?  
Don't tell me he...  
has not yet awakened his memories of the old world?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Well, um, that's true, he hasn't...  
But there can be no doubt that he is my comrade of old!  
  
**Syndicate Member１：**  
Lies! You are lying to our faces!  
Just look at the expression on his face!  
It's got \"Huh???\" written all over it!  
  
**Syndicate Member１：**  
Why, you... Are you trying to get an ordinary guy  
mixed up in our feud?! We may have left shame behind  
long ago, but that's just shameful!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Wait a minute! You've got it all wrong...!  
  
**Syndicate Member 2：**  
I bet when you told him about your past lives, he didn't deny it,  
so you strong-armed him into joining in! ...  
Or worse,  
you roped him into the whole thing from the start!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
H-how do you know all...  
  
**Syndicate Member 3：**  
Hahahah! I knew it!  
For all your bluster, you're only second-rate!  
You have no integrity!  
  
**Syndicate Member１：**  
That guy is only tagging along with you out of pity!  
You're such an embarrassing loner, he feels he has to humor you!  
How could you fail to see that until now?!  
  
**Syndicate Member 2：**  
Unlike the two of you, we all share the same world,  
the same former life! And you think your feeble partnership  
can match the strength of our bonds?!  
 Really?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
W-well, I...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Sigurd... Is it true? Do you pity me...?  
...Of course you do. I can't expect anyone in this plane  
to truly accept my world...  
 I knew that from the start...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Yet like a fool, I kept taking advantage of your kindness...  
I have a duty to put an end to this...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...These people are quite right, Sigurd.  
You don't need to force yourself.  
Just go back to the city...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Thank you for playing along with me all this time.  
Now, leave me.  
These villains are mine alone to face!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I am Sigurd of the Fulgor!  
`Tag 5`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Sigurd...! Do you mean...?!  
You are a fine man indeed!  
  
**Syndicate Member１：**  
That introduction... Can it be?!  
You too are one who has cast your shame into the furnace?!  
  
**Syndicate Member 3：**  
Wonderful!  
The two of you are exactly the archenemies we have been seeking!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
B-but... Sigurd... Are you sure about this?  
Can I really call you Sigurd of the Fulgor...?  
My comrade of old?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  In the depths of Gehenna, a gale arises!  
`Tag 6`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Those words... That is our unholy pact!  
Thank you, Sigurd! There is no more need for words!  
For we have our bond that has crossed worlds!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Hear that, villains?! This man is Sigurd of the Fulgor!  
The hero who fought beside me till Ragnarök claimed our bones!  
My glorious Zweiritter, and fellow Darkest Knight!  
  
**Syndicate Member１：**  
So this is Sigurd of the Fulgor!  
How could I not see...?! Now this is getting interesting!  
Come, let us do battle and seal this world's fate forever!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Today, the Order of Gehenna Immortals  
will face the Syndicate and end their foul schemes!  
  
**Syndicate Member 2：**  
You think you can beat us?! Let's see you try!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Thank you, Sigurd. You really are my truest comrade.  
And now, I must live up to your grand expectations!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Magicks sealed within this eye of mine...  
Go free at last!  
Evil Eye, Open! Extreme Edition!  
  
**Syndicate Member１：**  
Wait a minute... What kind of magical energy is that?!  
Don't tell me this girl is really planning to destroy us?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Magicks of deepest shadow, contort the world into my image!  
May the howling gale reap souls, as the clouds of fulmination  
conceal the open blue!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Cry, my pealing bolts! Run wild, run wild, run wild!  
Pierce through all that stands before you  
with the blinding beacon born of darkness!  
  
**Syndicate Member 2：**  
This ain't what I signed up for! Dammit! There's no time  
to cast any magic that can stand up to all this!  
Wh-what are these chains?! H-hey! Let me go!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Never shall the chains of binding release thy souls!  
Blades of brilliance! End these sinners' misery!  
Soul Punishment Chain Lightning Slash!  
  
**Syndicate Member 3：**  
What is all this power?!  
You mean to tell me... we've lost?!  
G... Guaaaaarrrghhhhh!  
  
**Syndicate Member 2：**  
This can't be happening!  
The mighty Syndicate can never faaaaall!  
  
**Syndicate Member１：**  
You'll see! Others will rise to take our place!  
W-wuaaaarrrgghhhh!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Before my Evil Eye... All shall perish!  
Heheheh... Hahahah... Ahahahah!  
...I think... my magic's all drained...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Well, Sigurd. I guess that's another job well done.  
I just finished signing them over to the authorities.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
The truth is... It turned out they named themselves  
after the Syndicate that appears in the books I write.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
According to their own testimony... They read the Gale Chronicles  
and were spurred by a wave of adolescent inspiration  
to found the Syndicate and commit crimes in that name...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Tired of the drudgery of everyday life, they used my creation  
to envision themselves as dark enemies of the entire world...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...And the worst thing is, when I was fighting them,  
I felt more alive than I had ever been...  
I have no right to call myself any better than them...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I'd always dreamed of doing battle for the fate of the world...  
So when those fantasies manifested in front of me...  
For a moment, the wonder of it all blinded me.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
But I swear, I never meant to encroach on reality  
and endanger people like they did!  
Please believe me on that, if nothing else...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
And yet, it was my fantasies... uh, my written works...  
that twisted their hearts. How can I atone for that?  
Perhaps it's best if I put all of this behind me, forever...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Please don't do that.  
`Tag 7`  
**Stechpalm：**  
It's easy to say that... But one wrong step, and I  
might have ended up just like them...  
No, it might even still happen in the future...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  If it does, I'll stop you.  
`Tag 8`  
**Stechpalm：**  
{player}... Thank you.  
  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
You're right, of course...  
I have you... Sigurd by my side!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
With a comrade whose soul is bound so close to mine,  
how could I stray from the right path?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Even if others choose the path of destruction...  
We can stop them, together!  
 Isn't that right, Sigurd?!  
  
**Narration：**  
And with those words, the exultant Annerose von Stechpalm  
gave a smile as bright as the sun.
