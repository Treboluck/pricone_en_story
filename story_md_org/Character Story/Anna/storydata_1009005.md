**Narration：**  
One day, {player} receives a letter written in code,  
and surmises that the impenetrable Annerose von Stechpalm  
wishes to meet with him.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Ah, Sigurd! You answered my summons!  
I called you here to reveal a great achievement...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
The other day, I learned a brand new magical spell!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I went and splurged on a particularly expensive spellbook,  
and it was worth every rupie!  
Now a powerful new magick is mine to wield!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Aren't you all-powerful?  
`Tag 1`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Ahhh...!  
 W-well, yes, of course!  
I am both omniscient and omnipotent! I have mastered  
every spell under the sun! Clearly I have nothing left to learn!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
It's just that... You know! As I was reading the spellbook,  
it triggered lost memories from my former life!  
A great spell I once wielded was reborn within me!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
In my old life, I fought by your side to defy the gods' tyranny...  
In that battle known as Ragnarök, our old world was lost!  
Reduced to wandering souls, we left many of our memories behind!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
But enough about that!  
I wish to try out this magick I have recalled!  
Come and help me hunt down my latest bounty target!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Now then. If my intel is correct, this should be where  
the wanted criminal we're after was sighted...  
  
**???：**  
...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Ah! There he is! That's our target right there!  
A perfect match for the wanted poster!  
Come, let us attack!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Halt, foul criminal!  
Surrender yourself to the forces of justice!  
  
**Bounty：**  
Tch... Bounty hunters, are you?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Feel the magnitude of my new cosmic finishing move!  
Wrath of the skies, heed my call, and raze the ground below!  
Howling Heavenly Thunderblitz!  
  
**Bounty：**  
Whoaaaaa! Wh-what *was* that attack?!  
Are you tryin' to kill me?!  
You can't collect bounties on the dead, you know!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...H-huh? Did I miss him?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Alas! I learned to use the spell,  
but I can't fully control it yet!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Fine, then! I'll keep firing until I hit!  
Take this! And this! And this!  
  
**Bounty：**  
Hahah! Where d'you think you're aiming?!  
You're not even close to hitting me!  
I'll take this opportunity to skedaddle! Later, losers!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Wahh! Stop!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Curses... My body is drained of all energy...!  
I-I fear this spell is not magically-efficient...  
It is only designed for individual strikes, after all...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
What now? At this rate, our target will escape!  
If he gets away, I will not be able to pay for my spellbooks!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  There'll be other bounties...  
**Choice: (3)**  I'll go capture him for you.  
`Tag 2`  
**Stechpalm：**  
No, that will be too late!  
I purchased my latest tome on credit!  
If I do not pay up by the end of the month, I will be in big trouble!

`Tag 3`  
**Stechpalm：**  
It's dangerous to go alone...  
After all, you have yet to fully recover your memories as Sigurd.  
I cannot expose you to perilous danger.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Somehow, we must both follow him together!  
But with my magic depleted, I can barely even stand...  
Is there no way...?!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Stechpalm：**  
...I have it!  
Sigurd! You must carry me on your back!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
It appears our target is not the most nimble of foes.  
Thank goodness we are in an open space...  
Even while carrying me, you should be able to catch up!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Sounds like a plan.  
`Tag 5`  
**Stechpalm：**  
You would do this for me?! Then let us begin!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Still, ah... This is... a little embarrassing.  
I have never been carried by anyone but my father before...  
Now, Sigurd! After him!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Hmm...?! This is... faster than I had imagined!  
And surprisingly thrilling, too! You make a fine steed, Sigurd!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Onward, Sigurd! Fly like the blazing Hellhound!  
This will be simpler than traversing the wilds of Hades!  
  
**Bounty：**  
Ugh... They're still coming after me?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Already we are almost on top of him!  
Excellent work!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Now, leave the rest to me. Thanks to your comfortable escort,  
I have recovered enough energy for a single strike!  
I won't miss again!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Careful, now.  
`Tag 6`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Heheh... No need for concern! Worry not, Sigurd.  
My true magicks always find their mark!  
This time, he's going down!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Wrath of the skies, heed my call, and raze the ground below!  
Howling Heavenly Thunderblitz!  
  
**Bounty：**  
Guaaaarghhh!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
There, you see?!  
My aim was straight and—  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Wahh!  
Sigurd?! Why have you suddenly collapsed?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Are you OK, Sigurd?! Answer me!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Do not leave me, comrade of mine!  
Our struggle against the Syndicate is still far from over!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  So tired... from running...  
**Choice: (8)**  I'm fine.  
`Tag 7`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Ahh... Thank goodness!  
 You had me worried!  
My heart skipped a beat!  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Sigurd! You're alive! That chase must have drained your energies...  
All that's left is to capture the criminal and take him to the authorities.  
I'll handle that, so you rest here for now.  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Stechpalm：**  
...A... Ahem!  
But, ah... Before we proceed...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Listen... {player}.  
Thank you... for all the help you gave me today.  
I couldn't have done it without you...  
  
**Narration：**  
That day, for the first time in their lives,  
she addressed {player} not as Sigurd,  
but by his real name.
