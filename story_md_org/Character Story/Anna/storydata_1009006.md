## Subtitle: In Search of Past Glory
  
**Narration：**  
On their way back from successfully claiming another bounty,  
the convivial Annerose von Stechpalm takes {player} out  
for a celebratory meal.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
As ever, your help was invaluable to this mission, Sigurd.  
I must thank you  
 for your endless diligence.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
If I were able to fully manifest my true power,  
I would require no aid to overpower these petty criminals...  
But alas, my memories from my past life remain clouded.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
If I could remember my past life more clearly,  
I feel sure it would unlock incredible new powers...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
As such, I have a proposal.  
According to Nanaka and Mitsuki, my friends in this plane,  
there exists a spring known as the Waters of Remembrance.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Legend has it that drinking from this spring  
 awakens forgotten memories  
and parts of yourself that lie buried deep inside!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
And best of all, the spring of which the legends speak  
is said to lie in a cave not far from here!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
So, Sigurd...  
 Will you seek it with me?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sounds like fun.  
**Choice: (2)**  I've got a bad feeling about this...  
`Tag 1`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Spoken like my true comrade! You know where it's at!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Come now, don't be like that. It will be worth it!  
This quest may be just what we need to awaken our powers!  
So please!  
 ...You'll do it?  
 Fantastic!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Well, that settles it, then! Let us depart at once!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
If the tome Nanaka showed me was accurate,  
the mystical spring should be just through here...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Ahh! Here it is! A pool of water!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
However... this looks like perfectly ordinary water to me.  
Can it really be the mystical spring?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Hmm? Sigurd, what's wrong?  
Is something the matter?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Point to a different pool of water.  
`Tag 4`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Ahhh! This pool's water has a strange milky hue!  
I see... So these are the legendary  
Waters of Remembrance...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
First of all, I will try drinking just a single mouthful.  
...*glug* *glug*  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Huh...? Ehm... Excuse me, young man...  
Who exactly might you be...?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Sigurd of the Fulgor.  
`Tag 5`  
**Stechpalm：**  
Mr. Sigurd of the Fulgor... That's... your name, is it?  
I'm sorry if this sounds rude, but I don't know you, do I?  
How did we end up inside this cave together?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Ahh!  
What was I just saying?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
N... No, I remember it all clearly!  
For a few moments, I was back to my old self!  
To the days... before I awakened to my former incarnation!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Some legendary water this is!  
I hoped it would restore memories from my previous life...  
Why would I wish to return to *those* empty days?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
N-now listen, Sigurd! Forget what you just saw!  
Back in those days, I was not myself at all!  
That was nothing more than my tedious past in this plane, not...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Wait a minute.  
If this water calls up past memories from this plane,  
then for an amnesiac like yourself...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Could this be a surefire way to reawaken  
the memories you have lost?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Sigurd... Do you wish to reclaim your own past?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I do.  
`Tag 6`  
**Stechpalm：**  
I see... Then come, take a swig of this water!  
Here, drink your first mouthful!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Although... When I drank it, the effects lasted only an instant.  
Perhaps a single mouthful is not quite enough.  
Come, Sigurd, you should drink another!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Let's go for one more to make sure.  
Come on, drink up!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Yes, we're almost there!  
One last swig for luck!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
How's that?  
Surely this is enoughto awaken countless memories of your past?!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Goo goo.  
`Tag 7`  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Hmm...?  
Sigurd? What is the matter?  
You sound almost like a newborn baby...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Can it be?! You drank too much water,  
and have returned all the way to your infancy?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Wait a minute! That's not good at all!  
I don't know the first thing about caring for babies!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Hang in there, Sigurd! Come back to me!  
Remember who you really are!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Ahhh! Don't cry!  
 There, there... Everything's okay...  
Urghh... How exactly does one calm a crying infant?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Oww! Hey, don't pull on my accessories!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Eek! S-stop that!  
 Where do you think you're touching...?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Y-y-y-y... You don't mean... you want some milk?!  
Even for Hecate of the Gale, some things are not possible!  
...D... do you think I could do it if I tried...?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Ohhh, stop! Be a good boy and just calm down!  
I'm the one who wants to cry right now!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Ahh! I'm so sorry!  
Ohhh... There, there...  
Good boy... Who's a good widdle boy...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Urghh...  
Just how long am I going to have to keep doing this...?  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
But... I can't exactly leave him here...  
I have to stay with him until he turns back...  
I'm the one who made him drink all that water, after all...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Of course. We must never abandon one another!  
That is our pact as the Order of Gehenna Immortals!  
Isn't that right, Sigurd?  
  
**Narration：**  
After a little while, {player} returned to normal,  
and the two of them hurriedly left the cave behind.  
A few days later...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Ahh! I didn't see you there, Sigurd!  
We went through quite the ordeal the other day, huh...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I gave a sample of that water to Mitsuki for analysis,  
and it seems it has the power to strip away  
the drinker's pretenses, revealing their true inner self.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
I still can't believe it sent you all the way back to  
babyhood back there...  
I panicked so much I thought I might die!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
Still, does this mean your true nature is a baby?  
Haha... Even the great Sigurd of the Fulgor  
has the right to crave a little motherly attention in this life, I suppose.  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
...Listen, Sigurd. Looking after others is not a talent of mine.  
But if... if that is truly what you desire, then I...  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
No, wait, what am I saying?! Forget I said anything!  
Obliterate that memory from the Akashic records! All right?!  
  
**Stechpalm：**  
More importantly, I was heading to the bookshop  
to enrich our collection with new tomes!  
You should come too!  
 Now, let us away, my fine comrade!  
  
**Narration：**  
Hurriedly grabbing {player}'s hand,  
the unflappable Annerose von Stechpalm rushed off ahead of him,  
determined to hide the shade her face had suddenly turned.
