# Rei (New Year) Episode 4
Another dream sees Rei invite {player} for a drive. Though she enjoys their time together, it comes to an end in what feels like an instant to her. She talks about feeling like a caged bird, which leads to a promise between them to go even farther away next time.
  
## Subtitle: Take Flight from Your Cage
  
**Narration：**  
Having gotten rid of their pursuers, Rei and  
{player} return to the Twinkle Wish guildhouse.  
  
**Rei：**  
We're finally back. I just hope the door isn't broken.  
Go take a seat. I'll bring us some tea.  
  
**Rei：**  
Hm? It's... awfully bright, considering we're indoors.  
Hey. Did you switch... one of the... lights...

**Narration：**  
It's the day after New Year's.  
{player} is on his way to the station  
following a phone call from Rei.  
  
**Rei：**  
Hey, {player}. Over here. Yes, here. Hop in, will you?  
Quickly, too. I'd rather we not stand out.  
  
**Rei：**  
Driver, please.  
  
**Man：**  
Understood.

**Rei：**  
Good to see you again. Happy New Year's. Sorry for calling  
you along all of a sudden. You were the first person that came  
to mind when trying to decide what to do with my free time.  
  
**Rei：**  
How've you been?  
Making the most of winter break, I assume?  
  
**Rei：**  
Hm...? Your eyes look full of curiosity.  
Ahhh. It's this outfit, isn't it?  
  
**Rei：**  
I had to take part in yet another family-hosted banquet.  
Changing would have taken up too much time,  
so I decided to just come along as-is.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You suit it.  
**Choice: (2)**  Now that's what I call cute.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rei：**  
Thank you.  
What a strange feeling, though. I could only roll  
my eyes when people at the banquet said the same thing.  
  
**Rei：**  
But it sounds genuine when it comes from you.  
Now I'm glad I wore this.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Rei：**  
H-honestly now...  
You're a bit too good at this, aren't you?  
  
**Rei：**  
Not that I mind, assuming you actually mean it.  
O-okay, fine! I get it! You don't need to give me a thumbs up!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rei：**  
Back on topic. What have you been doing over the new year?  
I hope you haven't been sleeping it away.  
...I hit the nail on the head, didn't I? Figures.  
  
**Rei：**  
I can't lie, though. I'm a bit jealous.  
I've been stuck playing the family mascot almost every day.  
  
**Rei：**  
It's just party after party.  
And dealing with all the politicians and big businessmen  
that get invited is beyond suffocating. I can't stand it.  
  
**Rei：**  
Most of them use their parents' influence to push others around,  
then reap all the benefits of their hard work. Absolute scum, really.  
  
**Rei：**  
Says the girl sitting in a car that belongs to her family,  
being driven by chauffeur hired by said family.  
I'm just as bad as they all are.  
  
**Rei：**  
Oh... Sorry about that.  
I didn't ask you to come along just so I could complain.  
I'm pathetic, aren't I?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Let's go as far away as we can today.  
`Tag 4`  
**Rei：**  
As far away as we can, huh...  
That sounds nice.  
We might as well use the opportunity while we can, right?  
  
**Rei：**  
Somewhere nice and far... Ah. I've got it.  
Sorry, but could you take us to the beach?  
  
**Man：**  
Understood.  
  
**Rei：**  
Now then. Let the fun ride begin.  
As for the route...  
We can probably stop by elsewhere first.  
I'm in the mood for something sweet, too.  
  
**Rei：**  
The ocean's come into view.  
It always amazes me just how far it stretches into the horizon.  
  
**Rei：**  
Okay.  
We can get off somewhere around here and go enjoy the beach.  
  
**Man：**  
Apologies, Miss Rei, but it's almost time.  
  
![108900402.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/108900402.webp)  
**Rei：**  
Oh. I... I see. Okay.  
Thank you.  
  
**Man：**  
Not at all.  
Please enjoy this time with your friend to its fullest.  
  
**Rei：**  
A cage bird if there ever was one, right?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Want me to open the window?  
`Tag 5`  
**Rei：**  
Well, we have come this far.  
It'd be a waste not to take in as much as we can.

**Rei：**  
The sound of the waves. The salty breeze.  
Yeah... We're not quite on the beach,  
but this is good enough for now.  
  
**Rei：**  
Thanks.  
I feel like I'll remember today for a long, long time.  
  
**Rei：**  
But this is as far as I can go for now, huh...  
That's kind of frustrating.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Then let's go even further away next time.  
`Tag 6`  

---  
  
![108900404.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/108900404.webp)  
**Rei：**  
Yeah. That sounds good.  
  
**Rei：**  
I'm sure I can make it even further if I'm with you. With my friends.  
  
**Rei：**  
To the ends of the earth, or even beyond.  
You'd all make even space feel like a day trip.  
  
**Rei：**  
But there's something extra special about being with you.  
You always give me these warm, happy feelings.  
  
**Rei：**  
And today you even gave me the courage to push on.  
I can't thank you enough. Really.  
  
**Rei：**  
Ah, right. How about you personally steal me away next time?  
I'll follow you as far as need be if that's the case.  
  
**Rei：**  
*giggle* Just kidding.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Sure thing.  
`Tag 7`  
**Rei：**  
Huh? No, I really was kidding...  
  
**Rei：**  
Sheesh. You're unbelievable, you know that?  
You said it, though, so now you need to keep that promise.

`image display end`  
**Ameth：**  
And... welcome back.  
I whipped up that little dream based on your old memories.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It must be tough living life on rails you never got to choose.  
More so if you're not satisfied with where they lead.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm not going to pretend I understand everything about Rei, though.  
The most I can do is simply feel for her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The same might go for you right now, too.  
But there's a crucial difference between the two of us.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You can be by her side when she needs it most.  
Simple, right? But important nonetheless.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Having someone by you is better than having no one at all.  
No question about it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So yeah. Help her out if she ever seems like she needs it.  
Though I guess you're not the sort of person to  
just up and abandon her, are you?  
  

---  
  
**Rei：**  
Mmm...  
Was that... a dream?  
It was eerily realistic.  
  
**Rei：**  
How terribly ironic, though.  
Not even dreams can properly free me of my cage.  
  
**Rei：**  
I refuse to give in, though.  
One day I'll be free. In every sense of the word.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  I'll help make sure that happens.  
`Tag 8`  
**Rei：**  
Thanks. I figured you'd say that.  
  
**Rei：**  
And I believe in you.  
Just like I always have, and always will.  
  
**Rei：**  
Now then. I've got an opportunity to spend the new year the way I want to,  
so it'd be a waste if I didn't make the most of it.  
  
**Rei：**  
Let's go out into town.  
I'm sure it's bustling right around now.  
  
**Rei：**  
We can't let them have all the fun now, can we?  
So let's get going! Quick! *giggle*  
  
**Narration：**  
Taking {player}'s hand,  
Rei sets off into town.
