**Narration：**  
{player} bumps into Rei during  
Landosol's New Year's celebrations,  
though she seems to be wary of her surroundings.  
  
**Rei：**  
Oh. Hey there.  
I know I already said it yesterday,  
but Happy New Year's.  
  
**Rei：**  
Sorry. I'd love to stay and chat,  
but I'm sort of in a hurry. Let's talk again some other time.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are you looking for someone?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rei：**  
Not quite. I just ran away from a banquet being held by my family,  
so if anything, it's the opposite.  
  
**Rei：**  
I'm the perfect little tool when it comes to dealing with all  
our important guests.  
They come in droves, flashing me their  
fake smiles. It's nothing but a pain, if I'm being honest.  
  
**Rei：**  
Yesterday was especially exhausting.  
At the risk of sounding like a Hiyori knockoff,  
my brain is totally fried.  
  
**Rei：**  
Trust me.  
You'd get out of there ASAP as well if it was you.  
  
**Rei：**  
Oh. A bit out of the blue, but would you mind  
helping me lay low for a while? I was just on my  
way to the Twinkle Wish guildhouse.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Sure thing.  
`Tag 3`  
**Rei：**  
Perfect. Let's try not to stand out.  
  
**Rei：**  
No one's here... But that makes sense.  
Yui's helping out at home,  
and Hiyori had business with the Menagerie.  
  
**Rei：**  
It's been a good while since I was last here without them.  
What a difference it makes when they're not here.  
  
**Rei：**  
I wanted to get away from people,  
but here I am feeling lonely without those two.  
I guess I've changed more than I thought.  
  
**Rei：**  
...Do you mind if I sit beside you?  
Phew.  
  
**Rei：**  
It's always so easy to relax here.  
And I'm more than glad to have a breather.  
  
**Rei：**  
It's especially suffocating at home right now.  
All sorts of nobles keep showing up,  
and I'm forced to listen to them ramble on.  
  
**Rei：**  
First comes the excruciatingly formal introductions. Then they  
brag about themselves at length under the guise of being humble, before capping it all off with empty songs of praise  
  
**Rei：**  
The irony is that they're always scheming against one another  
behind the scenes. That's the sort of people those nobles are.  
Even monsters can't hold a candle to how vile they are.  
  
**Rei：**  
The fact that I'm one of them makes me sick to my stomach.  
  
**Rei：**  
But enough about me. Let's talk about you.  
Did you do anything in particular yesterday?  
  
**Rei：**  
Mochi pounding with Yui? Now that sounds fun.  
Delicious, too. I'm feeling a bit hungry now.  
  
**Rei：**  
We had a fair amount of oseschi dishes here,  
so there might be some left over.  
Let me go check the kitchen.  
  
**Rei：**  
Spending your regular day-to-day life with him must be nice.  
I'm sort of jealous of you, Yui.  
  
**Rei：**  
Hm? Who is it?  
  
**???：**  
Excuse me. I'd like to make a formal request to your guild.  
  
**Rei：**  
It must be urgent business if they're here this early into the year.  
It's cold outside, too, so I'll prepare some tea for them.  
  
**Rei：**  
Sorry. Do you mind bringing them in for me?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Open the door.  
`Tag 5`  
**Woman：**  
Charge!  
  
**Rei：**  
What?!  
  
**Man：**  
Target located!  
  
**Rei：**  
Pursuers?! Shoot!  
I should have figured he would sink this low!  
  
**Pursuer：**  
Restraining target! Hah!  
  
**Rei：**  
Urgh! This isn't good!  
  
**Pursuer：**  
Target restrained! Preparing to withdraw from the premises!  
  
**Pursuer：**  
Do forgive us, Lady Rei.  
Your father has been searching all over for you,  
so allow us to escort you back home.  
  
**Rei：**  
Let go of me!  
I refuse to go back there!  
  
**Pursuer：**  
That spell isn't one you can undo, I'm afraid.  
And your friend is under its effects, too.  
  
**Rei：**  
That good-for-nothing father!  
How dare he get my friends involved!  
  
**Rei：**  
...No. I can only blame myself for being so careless.  
Happy as I was to stumble across him in town,  
I should never have let my guard down.  
  
**Rei：**  
I can't hope to rebel against my father  
if I can't even think on my feet in a situation like this.  
  
**Rei：**  
Maybe this is fate.  
I should live the sheltered life he wants to impose on me.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  That's not a fate you should accept!  
**Choice: (8)**  Is that a fate you really want to accept?  
`Tag 7`  
**Rei：**  
This sudden burst of energy...  
Oh.  
It's you, isn't it?  
  
**Rei：**  
You're right. I shouldn't accept it.  
I [[won't]] accept it! Haaahhh!  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Rei：**  
Of course it isn't!  
Never in a million years!  
  
**Rei：**  
Will you help me out, then?  
  
**Rei：**  
Thanks. That's more than enough.  
Haaahhh!  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Pursuer：**  
She broke free from the spell?!  
Inconceivable!  
  
**Rei：**  
No person, no spell can take away my freedom!  
I'm afraid it's time for you all to take a nap! Haaahhh!  
  
**Pursuer：**  
Gragh?!  
  
**Rei：**  
Now then. Let's get out of here, quick!  
  
**Rei：**  
*pant* *pant* *pant*  
This should be far enough.  
  
**Rei：**  
Hard to believe that even the guildhouse isn't safe anymore.  
It'll be wise not to return there until things settle down.  
  
**Rei：**  
Thanks.  
I wouldn't have gotten away if it weren't for you.  
  
**Rei：**  
And, well...  
I owe you an extra thanks on top of that.  
  
**Rei：**  
I made a big deal about rebelling against my upbringing,  
but there I was, ready to give in. How pathetic of me.  
  
**Rei：**  
The only reason I was able to come to my senses was because of you.  
I can't thank you enough for that.  
  
**Rei：**  
I won't give in.  
I'll rebel against my fate. Against my father.  
That much I swear to you.  
  
**Pursuer：**  
Over there! Target located!  
  
**Rei：**  
They're a tough lot, I'll give them that.  
I'd love to chat more,  
but you should get going.  
It'd pain me to get my friends any more involved in this mess.  
  
**Choice: (10)**  And it'd pain me to just abandon you.  
`Tag 10`  
**Rei：**  
Sorry. Part of me was hoping you would say that.  
I'm counting on you.  
  
**Rei：**  
And with that decided, first we need to shake them off!  
Let's go!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus their grand escape began.
