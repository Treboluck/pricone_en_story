## Subtitle: A Selfish Cause
  
**Narration：**  
Having successfully evaded their pursuers,  
Rei and {player} press on  
to avoid being found again.  
  
**Rei：**  
We've come a long way from town by now.  
Seems like we've outrun them as well,  
so let's use this opportunity to take a break.  
  
**Woman：**  
Please, I'm begging you! Just stop already!  
  
**Noble：**  
Stubborn ladies aren't my cup of tea, I'm afraid.  
Hop back into the carriage for me, will you?  
  
**Man：**  
I-I finally caught up!  
Give her back, you scumbag!  
  
**Woman：**  
Oh! You really did come for me!  
  
**Noble：**  
Pray tell. Did you just call [[me]] a scumbag?  
The very person who saved this fair maiden  
after she made the rash decision to leap off the carriage?  
  
**Rei：**  
Is that...? No. It can't be.  
Why would he be here, of all places?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Someone you know?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rei：**  
That's one way to put it.  
I've met that noble at a ball held not too long ago.  
  
**Man：**  
Of course it was!  
The only reason she leapt off is because you forced her on!  
  
**Woman：**  
I knew it. I just knew you'd come for me!  
  
**Rei：**  
Wait.  
Don't tell me he's trying to force her into marrying him?  
  
**Noble：**  
Hah! Come now. What do you even see in this peasant?  
There's no greater happiness for you than becoming my betrothed.  
  
**Woman：**  
I made it more than clear that I already have someone else!  
I don't need riches. I don't need fame.  
I just want to live a quiet, comfortable life with him!  
  
**Man：**  
Exactly!  
You really think she'd be happy with someone like you?!  
  
**Noble：**  
You may want to watch what you say, peasants.  
Otherwise those dear to you may face some... unfortunate times.  
You in particular, young man.  
  
**Man：**  
What?!  
  
**Woman：**  
I-I'm so sorry!  
Please forgive us for being so insolent!  
  
**Noble：**  
Fantastic. That's what I like to hear. Now answer me this, peasant.  
I have the power and money to ensure her safety. Get her treated  
if she's ever sick. What do you have to offer her, then?  
  
**Rei：**  
That dirty scumbag!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  We need to stop this, Rei.  
**Choice: (4)**  Looks like it's about time for us to make the save.  
`Tag 3`  
**Rei：**  
You're not wrong!  
I know that...!  
  
**Rei：**  
I also know that causing a ruckus here will give us away.  
But even still, I...!

`Tag 4`  
**Rei：**  
Looks like we're on the same page.  
Let's not waste any ti—  
  
**Rei：**  
No. We can't. Causing a ruckus here will give us away.  
But we can't just ignore them!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Noble：**  
The world bends at the will of those with power and money.  
Let me show you an example, in fact.  
  
**Noble：**  
Gentlemen! Stuff her into the carriage for me, will you?  
But before that... I believe this ruffian is in need of a little lesson.  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Aye aye, sir!  
You sure picked the wrong dude to mess with, didn't ya?  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Don't worry. We'll only leave you half-dead.  
Or we'll try to, at least.  
  
**Rei：**  
I can't do it.  
I can't just stand by and watch this happen!  
  
**Man：**  
Ugh! This isn't right...  
This shouldn't be allowed to happen!  
  
**Woman：**  
Someone, please!  
Please help!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Ain't no help for you here! Raghhh!  
  
**Rei：**  
Haaahhh!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Grugh?! Who the hell are you?!  
  
**Rei：**  
You two! Retreat to safety! Quick!  
  
**Man：**  
O-okay!  
  
**Woman：**  
Goodness... Thank you so much!  
  
**Rei：**  
Sorry for leaping in without saying anything.  
I just couldn't bear it any longer, though!  
  
**Noble：**  
Hm? Well, well!  
If it isn't Rei!  
The last time we crossed paths was at that banquet not so long ago.  
Have you been keeping well?  
  
**Noble：**  
Your father has been looking all over for you.  
Quite fervently, in fact.  
Needless to say that I never expected to see you here.  
  
**Noble：**  
Impeccable timing, though. You can come along with my future wife.  
I'm sure your father will be most pleased to see you again.  
  
**Rei：**  
Shut it! I'll never step foot in that house again!  
  
**Rei：**  
Conceited nobles like you make my skin crawl.  
You honestly think the world should bend to your will?!  
Just hearing that is almost sending me into a blind rage!  
  
**Noble：**  
You, of all people, are posing that question to me?  
Heh... Hehehe...  
HAHAHAHA!  
  
**Rei：**  
What's so funny?!  
Spit it out!  
  
**Noble：**  
Oh. I just found it terribly ironic.  
The person who turned down my proposal, thereby causing this  
entire situation, is the one hurtling abuse at me.  
  
**Rei：**  
Excuse me...?  
  
**Noble：**  
Hah! You never even stopped to consider the weight of your actions?  
Who's the conceited one now?!  
  
**Noble：**  
I became a laughingstock. An embarrassment to my family's name.  
So here I am now, desperately searching for a new partner.  
All because of you. And yet I'm the one in the wrong, you say?!  
  
**Rei：**  
Father did try to introduce a number of potential husbands to me.  
But I turned down the very idea without a second thought.  
  
**Noble：**  
This is all on your hands, Rei.  
Those two wouldn't be in this situation if you hadn't been so selfish.  
  
**Noble：**  
Can you live with that?  
Or would like to take responsibility?  
Through marriage, of course.  
  
**Rei：**  
I...  
  
**Rei：**  
I know what he's trying to do. It's all sophistry.  
His actions here are no different from simple abduction.  
He can't be forgiven for them.  
  
**Rei：**  
What about me, then?  
Can I be forgiven for driving him to such madness?  
  
**Rei：**  
No! That's not true! I... I...!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  The only selfish one here is you!  
`Tag 6`  
**Woman：**  
He's right!  
She didn't plan on accepting any proposals at all!  
Right?  
  
**Rei：**  
Y-yes. That's right.  
  
**Man：**  
You stole my fiancée away against her own will!  
That's abduction, pure and simple!  
And a crime's a crime, whether you're a noble or not!  
  
**Rei：**  
Thank you. Both of you.  
You're more than correct.  
  

---  
  
**Rei：**  
Listen up! I won't just stand by as nobles think they can run rampant!  
  
**Noble：**  
Ungh! This is all a farce!  
And it's making me sick! Sickeningly sick!  
  
**Noble：**  
You! Stomp their heads into the ground for me!  
Go as hard as you want!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Just how I like it!  
Hope you're ready to die, punks!  
  
**Rei：**  
It's time! Help me out!  
  
**Rei：**  
Thanks!  
Now then. Come at me!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
You're gonna eat those words!  
  
**Rei：**  
Pathetic! Hah!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Guwaaarghhh!  
  
**Noble：**  
Is this some sort of joke?  
Since when were you this strong?!  
  
**Rei：**  
I'm not fighting alone.  
His strength is my strength.  
Together, we can accomplish anything!  
  
**Rei：**  
Prepare yourself! Haaahhh!  
  
**Noble：**  
Gwaaahhh!  
  
**Rei：**  
Hmph.  
Thanks. I'm in your debt once again.  
  
**Rei：**  
I was wavering, in all honesty.  
But you helped me snap out of it.  
  

---  
  
**Noble：**  
Not like this!  
Dammit! Dammit all to hell!  
  
**Rei：**  
I went easy on you this time. But trust me.  
Things will go much differently if you  
approach either me or them ever again.  
  
**Noble：**  
Now it all makes sense. You're the one they've been talking about!  
And you're telling me she'd pick someone  
as bland and boring as you over me?!  
  
**Rei：**  
\"The one they've been talking about\"?  
Are you referring to [[him]]?  
  
**Noble：**  
I have eyes and ears all over the country!  
And you can be sure I make use of them!  
  
**Noble：**  
One of your fanclub members spilled the beans!  
She said that you already have a partner you've settled on!  
  
**Rei：**  
My fanclub...?  
  
**Noble：**  
Even she treated me like I was just a dirty bug.  
What do they see in a brute like you?!  
  
**Noble：**  
Whatever! I don't want anything to do with you either!  
But I'll certainly be telling Daddy about this! Hmph!  
  
**Rei：**  
And off he goes.  
A brute, though? Now that's one way to offend me.  
  
**Man：**  
U-umm!  
Thank you so much!  
I never dreamed that nobles like you existed!  
  
**Woman：**  
We won't forget this, no matter what!  
  
**Rei：**  
No, I'd rather you forget it.  
Wipe today from your memory,  
and live the quiet, comfortable life that you want.  
  
**Woman：**  
...Okay! Thank you!  
We swear we'll live a happy life together!  
  
**Rei：**  
We're definitely going to be found out soon after all that.  
Let's get moving, quick.  
  
**Rei：**  
...  
  
**Rei：**  
Hey. Am I really like him?  
Am I just another horrible person trying to  
make the world bend to my own selfish desires?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  You're definitely not horrible.  
**Choice: (9)**  The selfish part might be true.  
`Tag 8`  
**Rei：**  
Really?  
Okay. Thanks.  
If there's anyone I can trust on that matter, it's you.  
  
**Rei：**  
I do think I'm selfish, though.  
I mean. I basically forced you to tag along with me today.  
Sorry. That was a bad joke.  
  
Jump to tag 10  
`Tag 9`  
**Rei：**  
Me? Selfish? Surely not...  
Oh, sorry. I'm not doubting you or anything.  
  
**Rei：**  
Am I really that selfish?  
Maybe he was just joking...  
  
`Tag 10`  
**Rei：**  
Thanks. My mind feels a bit more clear now.  
  
**Rei：**  
Well. Now that we know I'm selfish,  
do you mind tagging along with me a bit more?  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} couldn't help but feel a genuine sense  
of happiness emanating from Rei's smile in that moment.
