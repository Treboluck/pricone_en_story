# Pecorine (Summer) Episode 3
Pecorine, exhausted from all the fun she's been having, falls asleep by {player}'s side. Karyl and Kokkoro arrive soon after, taking note of how Pecorine seems to be acting differently than usual, only for her to wake up as her usual perpetually peckish self.

**Narration：**  
A few hours later...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Phew... Time for a break, I think.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hehe. I went a bit too wild.  
My body's aching all over.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm not my usual self today, so I need to be more careful.  
Getting a cramp while I'm swimming would be terrible.  
I might even drown!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But well. Restraining myself when it's this fun is so hard.

Are you taking a break too, {player}?  
Do you mind moving over a bit? I wanna join!

Ohhh?  
Now that I didn't expect!  
Getting rebellious now, are we?

**Pecorine：**  
Haha.  
Don't worry. You don't need to move.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll just use you as my bed.  
And throw all my weight onto you while I'm at it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let'sss dive!  
Hug, hug. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Phew...  
This is a lot comfier than expected. Isn't that crazy. ♪

**Pecorine：**  
Whoa...?  
You sure got up quick!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Sorry about that.  
I guess getting up close and personal  
in the middle of this heat wasn't a good idea. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I can't deny it, though. I really like this type of interaction.  
It just gives me that sense of reality. That I'm actually with  
someone else. That I'm alive. It's just so comforting.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahh. Now I feel nice and tired... ♪  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You're welcome to sleep.  
`Tag 4`  
**Pecorine：**  
Hm?  
Hee hee. I might just do that.  
Today's left me so exhausted that  
I'll probably fall asleep the second I close my eyes.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The sun might just make me shrivel up if I sleep here, though.  
That, plus it feels like a waste.  
Don't let me sleep too long, okay?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Promise me, okay?  
Pinky promise.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And a broken promise means a broken fi— Zzz... ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Zzz... Zzz... ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Phew, finally back. The wind started affecting the waves, so we  
decided to call it quits for the day.  
Especially because even a slight  
change in the ocean means I need to recalibrate my spell.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Guess that's something I need to work on in the future.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed.  
Miss Karyl's magic is essential to me while I still can't swim.  
And I'd much rather not drown and cause issues for everyone.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A shame as it is, though,  
taking a stroll through the ocean was quite the delight.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's cool. I'll work on the spell while taking a break.  
You've had enough of a break as it is, though,  
so join us after this. Pecorine too—  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Zzz... Zzz... ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well, this is a surprise.  
She's fast asleep.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh, didn't realize she'd come back here.  
She spent the whole time swimming all over the place on her own.  
The usual, you know? Always getting ahead of herself.  
  
**Karyl：**  
And now here she is, sleeping away.  
I have a right mind to draw some stuff on her face.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Zzz... Zzz... *munch* ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Holy crap!  
She bit me! She almost bit my finger clean off!  
It hurts! It really hurts!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
Take it as a little bit of punishment for your thoughts.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Urgh... I can't deny it.  
It's my fault for putting my hand near that black hole she calls  
a mouth. She'll treat anything near it like foo—  
Owww?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hm.  
That said, Miss Pecorine didn't seem quite as peckish today.  
Usually she complains about being hungry every few minutes.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ohhh. You're right, huh? Is she trying to be  
considerate or something? I guess being too selfish  
on a group vacation like this would just ruin the mood.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
And yet there's nothing she can do at this point that would  
surprise us. We're more than used to it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Mmm...  
Phew! That was a nice nap.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Good morning.  
Also, don't you dare try to eat my finger again.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhh!  
That explains the delightful taste in my mouth!  
Sorry, but also thanks! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh. So this is what Karyl tastes like... *drool*  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well. Now I've made myself hungry.  
This seems like a good time for lunch, too,  
so how about we get to that?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll take a little dip in the ocean and  
scoop up some seafood for us! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahaha.  
Figures. She's went right back to her usual self.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
Though I must admit, I do prefer it this way.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hm? Are you two keeping secrets from me now?  
No fair! You can't start bonding while I'm asleep!  
Let me in on the fun!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
There's no better time to bond than  
doing so over food! And no one's  
better at doing that than the Gourmet Guild. ☆
