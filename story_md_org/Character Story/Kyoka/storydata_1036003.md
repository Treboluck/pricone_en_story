## Subtitle: The Path of a Gymnast
  
**Narration：**  
One day, when {player} is out on a walk,  
he spots Kyoka heaving a terribly deep sigh.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
*sigh*... This is no good...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Oh, {player}. Hello...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Why was I sighing?  
 Well, actually...  
We have a horizontal bar test coming up soon in gym class, but...  
W-well...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I... can't seem to do the back hip circle.  
I'm the only one in my class who hasn't managed it,  
so it's a little depressing...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'll help you!  
`Tag 1`  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh, no need for that, really.  
This is my problem—it would be wrong of me to waste  
your valuable time.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Besides... {player}, you're not all that reliable.  
Are you even any good at the horizontal bars?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...What?! You don't even know what a horizontal bar is?!  
And to think you wanted to help me...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Listen, all right? The back hip circle technique  
is where you hold a bar like this, and spin your body around it.  
That's right, you grip the top of the bar and...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...You don't get it, so you want me to show you?  
I just told you! I can't actually do it!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
That's right. You grip the bar, kick your legs up,  
pull your chest towards the bar, and...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahh!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Y-you actually did it...  
Yes, that's right. That's the back hip circle.  
Y-you made it look simple... Now I'm even more depressed...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll help you do it!  
`Tag 2`  
**Kyoka：**  
L-like I said, I can practice perfectly well on my own!  
You just hurry along home!  
Aaahh!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wh-why are you picking me up?!  
All right, all right! If you insist, I'll let you help!  
You just stand there and give me advice, okay?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
*pant*... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
*pant*... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*...  *pant*... *pant*...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I... I can't do it...  
Even after... you made it look so easy...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
N-now listen up, {player}!  
You have a bigger body, with stronger muscles...  
So it's only natural that you can do this!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I-I'm a lot shorter, and still a growing child...  
So it's a lot more difficult for me!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Huh? Then why can the rest of my class do it?  
W-well... That's, um...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I... I... I have to catch my carriage back to the forest,  
so I should get going now!  
 Goodbye!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Let's try again tomorrow!  
`Tag 3`  
**Kyoka：**  
T-tomorrow?!  
I think we've done enough practicing...  
I can't waste even more of your time...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...A-All right, all right.  
If you're going to be that insistent...  
Well then, I'll meet you here tomorrow.  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
*sigh* I don't want to do any more practice...  
I can't see how I'm ever going to manage it...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Good morning, Mom.  
Huh? What's gotten you so flustered?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Huh?  
The carriages to Landosol aren't running?  
There's a terrible rainstorm flooding the roads, so nobody can get there?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I had no idea...  
 Oh!  
I suppose that means today's practice is off!  
I mean, if I can't go to Landosol...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
There's no helping it. Yep.  
I'd better let {player} know I can't make it today!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Hey, Mom, I need to get in contact with someone.  
Could you give me a bit of magical support?  
Long-distance communication is tricky, so I can't do it on my own...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ah, {player}, can you hear me?  
It's me, Kyoka.  
I'm contacting you using communication magic.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Yes, it does sound like it's raining hard there.  
I can hear it even through this connection.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Listen... I know I said I'd practice with you again today,  
but it looks like I can't make it.  
The carriages aren't traveling  
because of the rain, so I can't get to Landosol.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
It really is an awful shame. I really wanted to practice with you.  
But with the carriages unable to travel,  
there's nothing I can do. Well then, I'll...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Huh? You'll meet me in the Elven Forest?  
Weren't you listening? None of the carriages are running.  
You won't be able to get here from Lando—  
  

---  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Huh? {player}, are you listening?  
Hello?  
 I-  
I've totally lost the connection...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Long-distance communication is advanced magic,  
so if the recipient moves, the connection breaks quite easily...  
I suppose {player} must have wandered off and...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Wandered off?!  
C-could he have actually set out for the forest?! On foot?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
But it's a long way here from Landosol! And there's pouring rain!  
The roads are supposed to be flooded!  
Surely even he wouldn't...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
B-but... This is {player} we're talking about, so...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
He's a weird guy, but he's pretty kind...  
He has no common sense, but he's very kind...  
He's always spacing out, but he's so kind...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
He is awfully kind...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I... I think...!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...*sigh* I can't believe you really walked all the way here.  
Just how many hours did you spend walking?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...\"Right, let's get to practicing\"?  
Listen, {player}, the truth is...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Huh? You'll show me how it's done?  
L-listen, all right?! {player}!  
The truth is, I don't need...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
{player}, you can't do the technique anymore?  
What's the matter?  
Are you tired from—  
  
**Kyoka：**  
H-how did you get all those scratches?!  
You fell over on the muddy roads?  
Honestly! You're such an idiot...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
You really are a total idiot...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
But...  
 Thank you for coming.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Now watch, {player}.  
This is how you do a back hip circle!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
How's that?! A perfect back hip circle!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Haha... You're surprised, aren't you?  
I already managed to master the technique by myself!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
When I realized you were planning to come all this way,  
I couldn't bear to sit around and do nothing...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
So I thought about what I could do to show my appreciation,  
and this was all I could think of...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Eheheh. I practiced all day, and just managed it a few minutes ago.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Thank you.  
**Choice: (5)**  That's amazing.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kyoka：**  
Wh-what do you mean, \"thank you\"?!  
I'm the one who should be grateful in this situation!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Kyoka：**  
Y-you think so?  
W-well, thank you. I couldn't have done it without you.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Kyoka：**  
Listen, for now, you should come to my place.  
I'll treat your scrapes and bruises.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh... but it's getting pretty late,  
so you'd be mad to head back to Landosol at this point.  
Especially with the carriages stopped...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I-I suppose there's really no choice  
but to let you stay the night at my place.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Although... elves aren't very welcoming to outsiders,  
so you might be in trouble if my mom finds you...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I-I suppose I'll have to sneak you in, a-and you can  
sleep secretly in my room...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
U-urghh... B-but... Th-that's very...  
But it's not like there's any other...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Aaaargh...!  
  
**Narration：**  
In the end, Kyoka's mother discovered {player}  
in a matter of seconds, and happily allowed him  
to stay in the guest room.
