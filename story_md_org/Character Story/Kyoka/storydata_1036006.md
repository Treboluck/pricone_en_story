**Narration：**  
{player} happens across Kyoka doing some shopping.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
*sigh*...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh, hello there.  
Are you out on one of your walks?  
...Yes, as you can see, I'm shopping.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...D-did I really look all that terribly depressed?  
Ahh... that's a little embarrassing.  
*sigh*...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
The thing is, one of the items my mom asked me to buy  
was my least favorite food, bell peppers...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You don't like peppers?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kyoka：**  
No, I can't stand them!  
I'm not fond of carrots either, but bell peppers are the worst of all...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Huh? We should train so I can eat them?  
N-no way! This isn't like my gymnastics problem!  
It's not like I have a test to pass or anything!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wh-why are you grabbing my arm?!  
Wh-where are you taking me?!  
D-don't tell me you really are a suspicious creep after all?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
L-let me gooooo!  
  
**Innkeeper：**  
All righty, one full course of pepper dishes coming up!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
What the heck do you think you're ordering?!  
I really can't stand the taste of peppers, you know?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  What's so bad about them?  
`Tag 2`  
**Kyoka：**  
Everything!  
They smell freaky, they taste all bitter, they're all crunchy yet slimy,  
their name's confusing, they're bulbous and ugly, they're not cute at all...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
If I clip my nose shut, the smell won't bother me?  
...Why do you even have a nose clip?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
All right, all right. I'll try using it.  
I just close it over my nose like this...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Anhhh! You're righd! I can'd sbell adythigg!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You sound funny.  
**Choice: (4)**  You look hilarious.  
`Tag 3`  
**Kyoka：**  
Unggh... I... I'b godda dake id off...  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Kyoka：**  
You're de one dat dold be do pud id on in de firsd place!  
Oh, forged id!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Kyoka：**  
...Maybe I could eat them if they weren't bitter?  
Well, I suppose... But how would you do that?  
  
**Innkeeper：**  
There! One bell-pepper cake, fresh out the oven!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh! If you make them into a cake, they'll be sweet and cute,  
so I might be able to eat them...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...But... This cake...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
It's just a normal sponge cake with peppers on top instead of fruit!  
That's no different from just eating peppers normally!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
This is useless! I'm not eating those things!  
I'm going home!  
  
**Narration：**  
A few days later...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
*sigh*... I haven't seen {player} around lately...  
Usually when I come to Landosol, I find him around here...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I... I mean, not that I need to see him...  
But it feels a little lonely...  
J-just a tiny little bit...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Hi there.  
`Tag 6`  
**Kyoka：**  
{player}!  
I hadn't seen you around for a while, so I was...  
...j-just a little curious where you were!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
W-wait... You look kind of beaten up...  
What the heck have you been doing?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Huh?  
You went hunting for the \"Legendary Pepper\"?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
You read in a book that there's a bell pepper tastier than any other,  
so you went all the way to the top of a volcano to find it?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...But the legendary Pepper Knight and lots of Pepper Zombies  
and even a Pepperdragon appeared to protect it?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...*sigh*  
  
**Kyoka：**  
{player}!  
I might be just a kid, but that doesn't mean I'll believe any old nonsense!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Some things are just too out-there and ridiculous  
for anyone to believe, even if it's coming from you!  
Honestly!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Even if... it's coming... from...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
H-hold on. {player}'s got amnesia, and never tells lies...  
He's kind to everyone, and always ridiculously straightforward...  
But... that must mean...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
All of that was true?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...This is the Legendary Pepper?  
 F-forget about that for now!  
Did you really go to the top of a volcano and fight all those monsters?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Dummy! You dumb, dumb, dummy!  
You're such a massive idiot sometimes!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Promise me you'll never do anything like that again!  
What if you'd gotten yourself killed?!  
If you died, I...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
*sniff*... Waahhhh...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Apologize.  
`Tag 7`  
**Kyoka：**  
N-no, that's... I know you only did it for my sake...  
But... please try not to put yourself in danger.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Huh? You want me to eat the Legendary Pepper?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
J-just like this? Raw? It'll be tasty?  
I-I'm not sure... that's a... Ahh...  
I mean, it basically looks just like an ordinary pepper...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Urghh... A-all right, then...  
Since you went to all that trouble to find it for me...  
I-I'll try a bite...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
*munch*...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ueerghh... I-it's still just bitter and stinky...  
I think it tastes even more pepper-y than a normal bell pepper...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahh... I-it's extremely delicious!  
I'm so glad you brought it for me, {player}!  
Thank you for the treat!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
E-eat some more?!  
Um... But... that's, ahh... Maybe not...  
  
**Narration：**  
Though genuinely touched by {player}'s efforts,  
Kyoka struggled to eat a few bites of the legendary vegetable...
