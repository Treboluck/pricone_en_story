**Narration：**  
Misato finds herself in Landosol  
for another picture book reading session.  
  
**Misato：**  
I hope everyone enjoys today's book.  
Oh?  
  
**Boy：**  
Hmhmhmhmmm~! ♪  
  
**Misato：**  
Hello there.  
You're in an awfully good mood.  
Did something happen?  
  
**Boy：**  
Whoa! I-it's Miss Misato!  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. I didn't mean to give you a fright.  
  
**Boy：**  
Errr, uhhh...  
C-catch you later!  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my.  
He must be busy.  
  
**Misato：**  
Hm...?  
  
**Girl：**  
I'm gonna be late at this rate!  
  
**Misato：**  
Hello!  
You should slow down a bit, otherwise you might get hurt.  
  
**Girl：**  
Ahh! M-Miss Misato!  
H-hello!  
  
**Misato：**  
What's got you in a rush?  
Feel free to rely on me if you—  
  
**Girl：**  
I-I'm fine!  
Bye-bye!  
  
**Misato：**  
Wow. That's some speed.  
She'll do well in the upcoming athletic meet.  
  
**Misato：**  
Something feels off, though.  
Almost like they're avoiding me...  
Did I do something to upset them?  
  
**Misato：**  
Hm...  
Nothing in particular comes to mind.  
But that just might be a case of me not realizing...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hello there.  
**Choice: (2)**  I finally found you.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misato：**  
Oh, {player}! Good day.  
  
**Misato：**  
Glad to see that you're still  
the same as ever, at the very least.  
  
**Misato：**  
It's nothing. Don't mind me.  
More importantly, what are you—  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Misato：**  
Well, if it isn't {player}.  
I'm glad to see that you're still the same as ever, at the very least.  
  
**Misato：**  
It's nothing. Don't mind me.  
More importantly, were you looking for—  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Misato：**  
Oh my! Is today one of those days  
where you feel like holding hands?  
  
**Misato：**  
Where are you planning on taking me?  
Be careful, though. I wouldn't want you to fall over.  
  
**Misato：**  
A restaurant, is it?  
Are you feeling peckish?  
  
**Misato：**  
Not really? Hmm...  
Then why are we here?  
  
**Misato：**  
I can't think of many other reasons to—  
  
**Boy & Girl：**  
Miss Misato!  
Thank you so much for everything!  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh... Oh my!  
Wh-what's this all about?  
  
**Boy：**  
Ehehe! We did it! The surprise worked!  
  
**Girl：**  
It's a surprise party!  
Our way of saying thanks for everything!  
  
**Misato：**  
Your way of saying thanks?  
I don't remember doing anything worth being thanked for.  
  
**Girl：**  
You're always taking good care of us and stuff!  
So we decided we oughtta give back!  
  
**Boy：**  
He helped us out, too!  
We'd have gotten busted if we tried to do this back at the village!  
  
**Misato：**  
{player} did?  
  
**Girl：**  
He got in touch with the restaurant,  
and even got all the food ordered!  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my... I...  
I honestly don't know how to react...  
This is the first time anyone's ever done this for me...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  We all wanted to give something back.  
`Tag 4`  
**Misato：**  
I'm just doing what I enjoy...  
I don't deserve to be thanked like this...  
  
**Misato：**  
But thank you, everyone. From the bottom of my heart.  
You've all grown up so much.  
  
**Misato：**  
And nothing brings me greater joy  
than seeing that you're all the kinder for it.  
  
**Misato：**  
The same applies to him, too. It's hard to believe that  
he's the same person that was eating poisonous  
mushrooms and throwing himself headfirst at monsters.  
  
**Misato：**  
He really has come so far.  
  
**Misato：**  
I'd always been the one taking care of others before.  
But then you came along. You showed me what it's like  
to have others support you. To have people care for you.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  What's wrong?  
`Tag 5`  
**Misato：**  
I always thought of you the same way as I did  
the rest of the children. You were someone to take care of.  
Someone I had to protect.  
  
**Misato：**  
But it turns out that you're far, far,  
stronger and kinder than I had imagined.  
  
**Misato：**  
I've come to experience all sorts of  
new emotions thanks to our time together.  
  
**Misato：**  
I'm supposed to be your teacher.  
And yet I... I...  
  
**Boy：**  
Come on, Miss Misato!  
Let's chow down before the food's all gone!  
  
**Misato：**  
O-oh, yes! I'll be right there!  
Sorry about that.  
Now then. Let's enjoy this feast together.  
  
**Girl：**  
Miss Misato! Read me a picture book after we're done!  
  
**Boy：**  
Hey! Same here, same here!  
I wanna hear you read too!  
  
**Misato：**  
Hehe. I really am blessed, aren't I?  
  
**Narration：**  
Other children around the city joined the festivities afterward,  
turning it into a much bigger gathering than anyone anticipated.  
Needless to say, it became a day that Misato would never forget.
