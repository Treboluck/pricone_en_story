# Misato Episode 8
Misato and {player} are shown another dream by Ameth, wherein {player} helps Misato make picture books at her nursery. The children there talk about their ideal image of a prince, but Misato chimes in to mention that there's much more to a person than their appearance and stature.
  
## Subtitle: Misato's Prince
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is helping make  
picture books at Misato's behest.  
  
**Misato：**  
Hm...  
What sort of story would be best?  
Something adventure related, maybe?  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh! {player}!  
You've gotten all shiny again!  
  
**Misato：**  
That never stops being amazing.  
How in the world do you do it—

**Misato：**  
Okay, everyone!  
Line yourselves up for me!  
  
**Children：**  
Okay!  
  
**Misato：**  
Hehe. The expedition isn't over until we get back home.  
Hm? Well, if it isn't {player}. Good day!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Good day to you too.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misato：**  
What a coincidence.  
Are you on a stroll as well?  
  
**Misato：**  
We're all going to make picture books after this.  
Would you be interested in joining?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  \"Free\" is my middle name.  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm not that good at drawing...  
`Tag 2`  
**Misato：**  
Well then! Let's be on our way.  
The more the merrier, as they say. ♪

`Tag 3`  
**Misato：**  
Don't worry.  
There's no right or wrong when it comes to picture books.  
If anything, one drawn by you should feel very unique. ♪

**Misato：**  
Now then.  
Let's jot down some ideas and drawings on this piece of paper.  
  
**Misato：**  
What sort of story do you all want to read?  
  
**Girl 1：**  
One about a prince and a princess!  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Me too, me too! And the prince has to be super handsome, too!  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. What else about him stands out?  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Umm...  
He's rich, right? And super fashionable?  
  
**Girl 2：**  
And tall, too!  
Plus he'll buy anything he's asked for!  
  
**Misato：**  
My, my. I appreciate everyone's input,  
but it's worth saying that a person's appearance and  
stature doesn't determine their worth.  
  
**Girl 2：**  
What sort of person do you like, then?  
  
**Misato：**  
Hm. Let's see...  
  
**Misato：**  
Someone who's pure and honest, plus cares for other people?  
  
**Girl 1：**  
That's too complicated!  
  
**Misato：**  
Hehe. You'll understand soon enough.  
Especially when you come to know someone just like that. ♪  
  
**Misato：**  
That's enough about me, though.  
Let's focus on making a story you want to hear.

**Ameth：**  
And there we have it. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
There's nothing surprising about a girl  
having their ideal of a special prince.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It can differ wildly between people, of course,  
but Misato's take on the matter shows how mature she is.  
  
**Ameth：**  
All the superficial stuff doesn't matter to her.  
She's much more interested in a kind, caring prince.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's enough for today, though.  
Catch you later. ♪

**Misato：**  
Mmm...  
H-huh? When did I fall asleep...?  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh my. Looks like I wasn't the only sleepyhead.  
That's twice now that we've fallen asleep together. Hehe.  
  
**Misato：**  
I had quite the peculiar dream, too.  
We were all making picture books together—  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh? You had the same dream as well?  
That happened last time, too, didn't it?  
  
**Misato：**  
What's that? You want to know who my ideal prince is?  
  
**Misato：**  
Well... That's a good question.  
Maybe I'll get to meet him soon.  
  
**Misato：**  
Very soon, even. Hehe. ♪  
  
**Misato：**  
Oh, I have an idea!  
How about we make a story based on the  
ideal prince I talked about in that dream?  
  
**Misato：**  
I shouldn't have much trouble making one like that. ♪  
I mean...  
  
**Misato：**  
I happen to know someone precisely like that. ♪  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus the two of them got to work,  
Misato oddly giddy the entire time.
