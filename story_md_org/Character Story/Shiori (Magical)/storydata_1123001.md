## Subtitle: Despite Becoming a Magical Girl...
  
**Narration：**  
By chance, Shiori has become a magical girl.  
One day, she goes to the city of Landosol with {player}  
to buy the equipment that she needs for her new line of work.  
  
**Shiori：**  
*sigh*...  
  
**Shiori：**  
I became a magical girl...  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm really happy that it happened.  
But...  
  
**Shiori：**  
*sigh*...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are you not feeling well?  
**Choice: (2)**  Do you wanna go home?  
`Tag 1`  
**Shiori：**  
...Huh?  
No, I'm fine!  
See, same as always.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Shiori：**  
...Huh?  
*shake* I wasn't thinking about going home at all...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shiori：**  
...It's important that I buy the magical goods I need today.  
So let's continue shopping... okay?  
  
**Shiori：**  
*sigh* He must be thinking I'm a strange girl...  
Continually sighing in front of him can't be giving off the best  
impression.  
  
**Shiori：**  
But to think that he saw me dressed up like that─  
  
**Woman：**  
Help us!  
  
**Shiori：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Woman：**  
Somebody, please help!  
There's a monster... A monster...!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Let's hurry!  
`Tag 4`  
**Shiori：**  
...R-right!  
  
**Woman：**  
Somebody...!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh no... The monster's already in this part of town!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Enchanted... Arrow!  
  
**???：**  
GRRRRRRRHHH...  
  
**Shiori：**  
My attack had no effect...?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Huh?  
The townsfolk are acting strange...  
  
**Man：**  
Wh-what the...? My body won't do what I tell it to...  
  
**Woman：**  
What on earth are you doing?  
You can't go over there! That's where the monster is!  
  
**Man：**  
No, it's not me... My body's moving on its own...  
Ngh...  
Wahhh!  
  
**???：**  
GRRRRROOHHH...  
  
**Woman：**  
S-somebody!  
Please save my darling!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Only men are being pulled toward the monster...?  
It must have some special ability to lure them in.  
  
**Shiori：**  
{player}, what should we do?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Maybe a different type of attack would work.  
`Tag 5`  
**Shiori：**  
A different type...  
...  
That's right, I'm a magical girl! Maybe my magical girl powers could...  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's almost certainly a type of Antibeast.  
If that's the case...  
Okay, I'll transform right away!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Pu—...  
*cough*  
  
**Shiori：**  
Pure Heart, Lock On.  
Magical Arrow: Critical!  
  
**Shiori：**  
............  
  
**Shiori：**  
...H-huh?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Pure Heart... Lock On!  
Magical Arrow: Critical!  
  
**Shiori：**  
...I can't transform?!  
Why not...?  
  
**Man：**  
S-somebody... help...  
  
**Shiori：**  
What to do? At this rate, everyone in the city will...  
  
**Shiori：**  
{player}, what should we do?  
I can't transform─  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I-I'm being pulled away...!  
`Tag 6`  
**Shiori：**  
You too?!  
No, that can't happen...!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Please, wait... Don't go!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Nooooo!

**Purely★Shiori：**  
............  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...H-huh? This outfit...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...I did it! I can't believe it!  
I became a magical girl!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
But how was I able to all of a sudden?  
I couldn't transform at all before,  
but I was so desperate to help him...  
  
![112300102.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/112300102.webp)  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
...Now's not the time. I've got to hurry!  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
This shot is filled with love!  
Purely Arrow!  
  
**Antibeast：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!

`image display end`  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
I'm so glad everyone's okay.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  It's all thanks to you, Shiori.  
`Tag 7`  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Oh, not really.  
I just acted without thinking...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
But why was I suddenly able to transform when I did?  
I just kept failing before...  
  
**Old Man：**  
You're absolutely amazing!  
The city is greatly indebted to you.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Woman：**  
I'm so grateful to you for saving my husband.  
I really can't thank you enough.  
  
**Old Man：**  
You might be dressed quite strangely,  
but wow,  
you really are something.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
S-strange...  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
I see... I was so embarrassed by my outfit that I had mixed feelings when  
I went to transform. But because I wholeheartedly wanted to help  
{player}, I finally managed to pull it off.  
  
**Purely★Shiori：**  
It seems I'm unable to fulfill my duties as a magical girl if I feel  
embarrassed.  
I've decided... I'm going to work harder to be more like  
Hatsune and help as many people as I possibly can!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so, Magical Huntress Purely★Shiori  
resolved to continue her magical girl journey.
