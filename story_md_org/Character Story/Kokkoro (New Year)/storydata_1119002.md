{player} and Kokkoro make their way to the city center, where they take part in an event that involves eating noodles in the ninin-baori style—two people in one coat. Kokkoro, taking the front position, consumes her dish happily while basking in her lord's warmth.
  
## Subtitle: Two Bodies as One
  
**Narration：**  
Having completed their New Year's prayers at the temple,  
{player} and Kokkoro proceed into the city  
to enjoy the ongoing festivities.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. I'm afraid I cannot share the wish I made.  
That must remain a secret even from you, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If a wish is revealed,  
tradition dictates that it will no longer be granted, you see.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So, my lord, be careful not to share your wish either.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I must say, for the tail end of the New Year's season,  
the city is still very lively.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Now, my lord, are you feeling hungry?  
There are many food stalls,  
so do let me know if any tasty morsels catch your eye.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Do not concern yourself with the cost.  
I received plenty of New Year's pocket money at my village.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh? I hear many excited voices from over in that direction.  
If you are interested, perhaps we should take a look.  
  
**Boyfriend：**  
Is your mouth... here?  
  
**Girlfriend：**  
Yes, that's right!  
Slowly... Take it slowly!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Why, is this... a ninin-baori contest?  
These hunchbacked individuals seem to be couples in disguise.  
  
**Organizer：**  
Oh—you two over there, wanna give it a try? The goal is to feed  
your partner noodles from underneath their coat!  
 If you succeed,  
it proves your bonds are true, and you win some food coupons!  
  
**Girlfriend：**  
Aughh! That's not even close!  
Aim properly, will you?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh... That poor girl is being fed noodles into her nose!  
What a distressing sight...  
  
**Organizer：**  
Haha. Those two won't stay together long.  
We see pairs like that every year, but it's painful just watching 'em.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This event allows you to predict their relationship's outcome?  
  
**Organizer：**  
Yeah, when you've done this long enough,  
you get a feel for these things.  
'Course, for a couple with strong bonds, it's not even a challenge.  
  
**Organizer：**  
Oops, am I scaring you off now?  
Still... I've got a strong hunch  
you two might be able to finish the whole bowl.  
  
**Organizer：**  
So, what'll it be? Wanna put your bonds to the test for us?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Test the bonds we share?  
Hmm... it does look rather challenging...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  There's nothing to worry about.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm interested in that prize...  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Such remarkable confidence.  
The certainty in your eyes sets my heart alight.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Then the challenge itself does not daunt you in the slightest?  
Even my New Year's money is not limitless,  
so food bargains do sound rather tempting...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Very well. The bond my lord and I share will surely not fail us.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We would like to enter ourselves into this contest.  
And you can be certain of our victory.  
  
**Organizer：**  
All right! That's what I like to hear!  
Okay, here's your giant coat.  
  
**Organizer：**  
While you wait your turn, decide who's going in front and who's behind.  
I'll call you when you're up!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As your guide, I will endeavor to deliver each noodle  
safely to your mouth, my lord.  
It seems there is still time before we begin, so shall we practice?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
First, let me slip behind you...  
 Mmhh...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, my lord's sturdy back...  
It feels as though he has grown so much lately.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Back at the altar, I wished for my lord and I to stay close together.  
But... I did not expect to see it granted so soon,  
or in such a literal form.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...No, it is nothing, my lord.  
Well then, let us begin our practice session.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Oh?  
My arms are so short, they cannot seem to reach your mouth?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The size of my body is sadly beyond my control.  
Well, this is quite unfortunate...  
  
**Organizer：**  
Hey! You two, your turn's up next!  
C'mon, take your seat at the table!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh dear. It seems our turn has arrived already.  
Whatever shall we do?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...What? You will sit behind me, my lord?  
B-but... my role is to support you in all things...  
  
**Organizer：**  
Hm? Something wrong? Gonna back out after all?  
Well, not like I can force you.  
Even if I'd've liked to see how strong your bonds really are...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah—my lord! Please do not tug so strongly on my arm...

**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, that was very forceful of you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Is it because the coat traps our heat...?  
Even amidst the winter cold, my body feels strangely warm.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Through my kimono, I can feel my lord's body heat.  
And even the beating of his heart...  
Ah, my lord... This is your life's rhythm... ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Does my lord feel my heartbeat too, I wonder?  
The more I think about it, the more it begins to race.  
How oddly embarrassing. If I were able, I would like to conceal it...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wahhh?  
My lord? The noodles are on my face...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It seems that I was so preoccupied,  
I failed to provide you with the guidance you require.  
I must apologize.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Even if I am in front, my duty as your guide remains.  
I will do all I can to aid you.  
 Now, let us complete this meal.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, can you move the chopsticks a little lower?  
...Yes, that is the position.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Now you need only move them closer.  
The noodles are just beside my mouth.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Slowly... slowly... *munch*  
Mm... mmh... *gulp*  
  
![111900202.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/111900202.webp)  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, these are delicious, my lord!  
I feel sure the fact that you are feeding them to me  
only serves to heighten the taste.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh—but we do not have time to savor them.  
I must continue to guide your movements.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, do you still remember that arm position?  
Most impressive. Well then, let us attempt a second mouthful.

**Kokkoro：**  
...*gulp*  
My lord, we have finished the bowl!  
  
**Organizer：**  
Congrats! I knew you two were a cert!  
You should be proud—you're our first winners this year!  
  
**Organizer：**  
Here, these coupons are your prize.  
 Enjoy the rest of the festival!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  That was easy.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes. For the two of us, it posed no challenge whatsoever.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But it was over all too quickly.  
I would have liked to enjoy my lord's warmth a little longer...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
N-no, I said nothing at all!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Now, my lord, let us continue to explore the festival.  
Allow me to guide you around the stalls.  
  
**Narration：**  
Her heart filled with the same warmth she had felt upon her back,  
Kokkoro set out to ensure her lord's continued enjoyment.
