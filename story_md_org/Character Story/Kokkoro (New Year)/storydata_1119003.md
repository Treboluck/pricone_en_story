**Narration：**  
Using the coupons they won in the ninin-baori eating contest,  
{player} and Kokkoro are enjoying  
all the flavors of the festival.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh! My lord, you have food on your face.  
Allow me to wipe that for you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wipe, wipe... ♪  
There. You look perfectly clean now.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Though these coupons give us large discounts at every stall,  
we may have eaten a little *too* much.  
My stomach feels very full indeed.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Sampling festival food is a fine way to enjoy the new year,  
but I would not wish to put on too much weight.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
How is your own stomach right now, my lord?  
May I trust you are also feeling satisfied?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I still have yet to use up all of my New Year's money,  
so if you are still hungry, do not hesitate to ask for more.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  New Year's is so much fun when I'm with you.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
The year has barely started, yet you flatter me already.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Still, it remains my sworn duty to support you however I can.  
I would be remiss if I did *not* ensure your enjoyment.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Did you have fun at your home village?  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
I told the elder and my childhood acquaintances  
many tales of your exploits this past year, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Conversing with my old fellows calmed my spirit,  
letting me enjoy a peaceful respite.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
However, since meeting you, my lord, and learning  
the depths of your kindness,  
 I have come to treasure  
my second home, here by your side, just as deeply.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Of course, as well as conversing, I took part in the local ceremonies  
and enjoyed the traditions of the new year to the fullest.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Although... There is still one last tradition that I have yet to perform.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Not from my village, but a lucky tradition that I learned  
from the temple staff right here in Landosol.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Usually, it is carried out on New Year's Day,  
so the time for it may already be past...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  If you want to do it, let's do it.  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, but I must not.  
Today, my task is to serve as your guide,  
so I cannot let my own wishes intrude.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm, but considering the nature of this tradition...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes... May I have a moment of your time after all?  
This may prove to be a meaningful act for both of us.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank you, my lord.  
Well then, please follow me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Right this way, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I see you are looking around in confusion...  
It's true that this area has few New Year's festivities.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But please do not worry.  
Just down by this lake...  
 Yes! I knew it would still be here!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This stage, prepared by the temple staff for New Year's Day,  
has not yet been dismantled.  
I am sure nobody will mind if we briefly borrow it.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I confess I have never done this for an audience,  
and I am unsure how well I will manage it...  
So, my lord, please try to watch without expecting too much.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh... Well, thank you.  
It lightens my heart to hear your words of enthusiasm, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*breathe*... Now, I shall begin.  
  

---  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
First I slowly raise my hands,  
and then I believe I must turn my waist like so...  
 Oh?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, my lord, please do not watch my movements so intently...  
I still feel uncertain of myself, so it is embarrassing...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And yet this is a prayer for your sake.  
I do wish for you to see it in full, so this feels complicated.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In order not to spoil your enjoyment of the new year,  
I must do my very best  
 to make this ceremony pleasant for you...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I cannot claim my dancing is anywhere near perfect.  
But my feelings for you that I express in these motions...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Those are, beyond any doubt,  
as pure a wish as I could possibly muster.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, please keep me by your side in the year ahead.  
  

---  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Phew...  
I must apologize for my ungainly performance.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This was a traditional dance performed  
at New Year's ceremonies in Landosol.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
When I visited the temple at the end of last year,  
one of the staff members there taught me of this tradition.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
By dancing on New Year's Day for the one you care for most deeply,  
it is said to bring you closer in the year that is to come.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If the tradition's effects are true, my wish will be granted,  
and you will be able to benefit from my continued support, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So you see, to me at least,  
this may be the finest of all New Year's traditions.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Still, while I had hoped to show this dance to you someday,  
I never expected to perform it this year...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I practiced it a little during free moments in my village,  
but I am afraid my technique is still far from perfect.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
How did it look, my lord...?  
I do hope it did not bore you too terribly, at least...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You worked so hard!  
**Choice: (5)**  You're way too good at this for a beginner!  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes. I thought only of you,  
and devoted all my heart to the ceremony, my lord.  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Kokkoro：**  
M-my lord?!  
 Such high praise makes me struggle to believe you.  
And yet I know you would not lie,  
so I suppose I will accept those happy words for now.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am most relieved that you were not dissatisfied.  
You are far too kind to a mere amateur such as myself...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
All of my wishes and my prayers  
are devoted to my goal of staying close and supporting you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As such, I hope to perform this special dance for both our sakes  
once again when the next new year comes around.  
  
**Narration：**  
As the setting sun painted the winter sky in warm colors,  
Kokkoro's gaze, fixed upon the one she cared for most,  
was also aglow with warm kindness.
