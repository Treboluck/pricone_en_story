# Hiyori Episode 12
While accompanying a convoy escorting former bandits who they previously saved, Hiyori and {player} are attacked by a horde of monsters. In order to protect the now-convicts who are abandoned by the convoy's knights, Hiyori turns the throbbing she feels deep in her heart into strength, and fiercely fights off the assailing monsters.

**Narration：**  
{player} and Hiyori  
are suddenly summoned to the palace.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
We've already come this far, but...  
Wh-wh-what should we do, Mr. Knight?!  
I've never been called to the palace so suddenly like this before...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Do you think we did something wrong?!  
I can't think of anything though...  
If there is something, let's apologize together!  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
Thank you for waiting. Apologies for making you come all the way out here.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Y-yes, sir!  
I haven't done anything bad!  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
Hahah, you don't have to be so tense.  
We asked you here today because of a job request.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Huh? A request...?  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
Correct. Remember that group of bandits that you  
apprehended in the forest not so long ago?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, that incident the other day.  
I remember!  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
It's been decided that those bandits are to be exiled to an island a little  
off the continent.  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
To carry out the sentence, they have to be escorted to the harbor,  
but they specifically asked if you two could be the ones to accompany  
them instead of us.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Us? Accompany them?  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
They're deeply sorry for what they did, and will properly submit to their  
sentencing. They said you two were the reason for this, so they want to  
see you one last time.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Is that so...?  
Understood!  
We accept their request!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
There's no way I can turn down people who're honestly trying to reform  
themselves!  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
I'm glad you say that, as I'm sure they will be.  
You'll be departing tomorrow. Please prepare appropriately.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Wow... There are so many knights here.  
I'm getting a little nervous...  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Oh, you guys actually came.  
Thanks for accepting our request for your escort.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
No problem. We're just here to do what we can.  
Right, Mr. Knight?  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
It's all thanks to meeting you that we were able to reflect on our  
mistakes like this.  
Honestly, words can't describe our gratitude.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Eheheh... Keep talking like that and you're gonna make me blush...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
But I couldn't have done it by myself.  
Mr. Knight deserves your gratitude too.  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Of course we're grateful to you as well.  
  
Thanks to you both, we vowed to atone for our sins, and from now on  
we're gonna live honest lives.  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Yeah, what he said. We really appreciate everything.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I didn't really...  
`Tag 1`  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh? Are you by any chance feeling a little bashful?  
No biggie!  
I'm getting embarrassed too.  
I totally get how you feel.  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
Sorry for interrupting, but it's time to go. You guys get in the carriage.  
And you two will ride with us. It's going to be a bit of a lengthy trip,  
but we're counting on you.  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
We've reached the valley! There's been a series of reports of monster  
sightings in the area.  
Stay alert, everyone!  
  
**Knight 1：**  
Yes, sir!  
  
**Knight 2：**  
Understood!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I wonder how far we are from Landosol now.  
I guess it's getting easier to find monsters out here too...  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Yeah, and if any of them dare to attack,  
there's nowhere for us to run...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Don't worry! No matter what happens, we'll keep you safe!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Little lady... You ain't a reincarnated goddess, are you...?  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That's the roar of a monster!  
It's over there!  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
Knights, draw your swords!  
  
**Knights：**  
To arms!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Mr. Knight, we should go fight too!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's protect these people!  
**Choice: (3)**  We have to help the knights!  
`Tag 2`  
**Hiyori：**  
Yeah, let's!  
They're trying to atone for their sins,  
so we can't just let them die here!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Hiyori：**  
Yeah!  
Let's go help the other knights  
so that we can all make it outta here alive!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Monsters：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Knight 1：**  
Commander! Enemies incoming from the rear!  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
What?! Circle formation! Now!  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Look, they're coming from over there too!  
I can't believe there were so many hiding around here...!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
We're screwed...  
They don't bother small parties, and only go for large groups instead...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Why would they do such a thing...?  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
It's just what they do.  
They wanna catch as much prey as possible in one attack.  
They're probably acting according to instinct...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
No way...  
Regardless, we've gotta take out as many as we can!  
Let's gooo! Yahhh!  
  
**Monsters：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
One down!  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
Ngh! So much power in a single attack...!  
Hyaaa!  
  
**Monsters：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
Each wave is getting stronger...!  
At this rate...!  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Hey, you, are you okay?!  
  
**Knight 1：**  
Commander! We can't hold out much longer!  
Thirty percent of our forces have already been wounded!  
We're at our limit!  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
...Is that so? Convicts.  
There's something I must tell you.  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
...We already know what you're gonna say.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
*pant pant*...  
I-is everyone all right?!  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
...The two of you have done us a service.  
But I'm sorry to say that for us to make it out alive,  
we've no choice but to leave the convicts behind.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
What now...?  
What are you talking about?  
  
**Knight 1：**  
Preparations have been made! We're ready to withdraw!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
We're just gonna leave these people behind?!  
That's awful!  
There's no way I can do something like that!  
I just, I just...!  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
I understand exactly how you feel! As a soldier of Nightmare trained by  
the captain herself, I wish to complete my mission. But at the same time,  
I must not let any of the troops that she entrusted me with die!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
But...!  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
Moreover, before we left Landosol,  
they already gave their consent should something like this happen.  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
It's okay, little lady.  
We've been prepared for this eventuality for a long time.  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
If we lose our lives in exchange for saving yours, then it'll be a  
transaction well worth the price.  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
I wish there was... some other way.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Not a chance... I'm not gonna turn tail and run!  
I mean, there are people right in front of us who need help!  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
I hate to say this, but we're not in the position to be saying such naive  
things.  
Knights! Withdraw immediately!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
No... How did it end up like this...?  
  

---  
  
**Escort：**  
Eventually there'll come a day when you pushovers will start to regret  
being so naive.  
  

---  
  
**Hiyori：**  
\"Start to regret\"... Is this what he meant...?  
I guess I am a soft touch after all...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...You know what? I don't care if I'm a pushover!  
If someone's gonna get hurt, I'll be there for them!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...I beg you, Mr. Knight. Please lend me your strength!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...To be honest, I want you to escape too.  
But I don't think I'll be able to help everyone all by myself.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I know it's dumb and reckless...  
But please! I wanna save everyone, and I need your help!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Let's rip those monsters to pieces, together!  
**Choice: (6)**  I scratch your back, you scratch mine!  
`Tag 5`  
**Hiyori：**  
Mr. Knight...!  
Yeah! If it's both of us together, I'm sure we'll manage!  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Hiyori：**  
Eheheh... That's usually my catchphrase,  
but you've been saying it to me a lot lately.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Hiyori：**  
...Thank you, Mr. Knight.  
I'm so glad that you're here with me right now.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
My heart's pounding so hard my ribs are gonna break...  
Am I scared?  
...Or is it 'cause Mr. Knight's here with me?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
But it's 'cause both of us are alive and here that my heart can pound so  
much. I wanna... feel more of this excitement!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
All right!  
Energy and courage, fully charged!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Let's do this!  
Mr. Knight, lend me your power!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...My body is overflowing with strength!  
Have a taste of my full power! Hrraaagghh!  
  

---  
  
**Monsters：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Taaake thaaat!  
  
**Monsters：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Aaaahhh!  
  
**Monsters：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I will protect everyoooone!  
  

---  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
They really should go...!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Dammit...! Why? Why us...?!  
  
**Knight 1：**  
What're they...?! Commander, look!  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
Those whelps...?!  
They're taking on that many monsters alone?!  
  
**Knight 1：**  
...Commander, we have to fight with them!  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
Stop with the nonsense!  
How would I justify myself to the captain if I lost you all here?!  
  
**Knight 2：**  
But if we abandon those kids,  
we'll never be able to even face the  
captain ever again!  
  
**Knight 1：**  
Commander! I beseech you!  
It's our duty as royal knights to protect each and every one of the  
people! Am I wrong?!  
  
**Knight 2：**  
Commander!  
  
**Knights：**  
Commander!  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
...Captain, please forgive me. Knights, it looks like you're already  
prepared! Now is the time to show them the power of Nightmare!  
Soldiers, chaaarge!  
  
**Knights：**  
Yaaahhhh!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It's the knights!  
They've come back for us!  
Eheheh, that's reassuring!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Even the power you're giving me feels stronger than ever before!  
I think we might be able to win!  
Eat my claws! Mya-mya-mya-mya-mya!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
You guys!  
So you didn't abandon those kids after all!  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
Affirmative! We can't abandon you criminals, let alone those children!  
Stay put while we—  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Please! Let us fight with you!  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
What are you saying?! I cannot allow that!  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
We'll take over for your injured knights!  
Come on... Please let us help those kids...!  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
...Oh no, it seems your handcuffs just fell off. I suppose there's nothing  
we can do to stop you jumping out of the carriage.  
...Make sure you come back after the battle's over.  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Heheh... Straitlaced knights sure do make for terrible liars!  
I owe you! We'll be borrowing weapons from your wounded!  
  
Meat's back on the menu, boys!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
You don't have to tell me twice!  
Hey! Little lady! We're joining the fray!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
You guys are?! How come?!  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
They offered to assist you!  
With our current strength, it's doubtful that we can win,  
so we've no choice but to cooperate!  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
If we let you two die here,  
we'd regret it for the rest of our lives.  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
We wanna live honest lives,  
and that starts with saving the two of you!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Oh man, that's so sweet!  
Mr. Knight! Let's work with everyone to see this battle through to  
the end!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
*pant*... *pant*...!  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
The monster you killed just now was the very last one!  
You young'uns are amazing! Well done, everyone! Victory is ours!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Are you serious...?  
We did it, Mr. Knight!  
We really routed all of the monsters!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
This is all thanks to you being here with me!  
Squeeze! One more time! Squeeze!  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
...Ah, ahem.  
I know you're just sharing your excitement, but please keep it to  
a minimum.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Huh?! I-I'm sorry...  
I was so happy that I got carried away...  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
Well, putting that aside...  
We would like to extend words of apology and gratitude to you both.  
We're truly sorry. And thank you for saving everyone.  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
You've gone out of your way to save our necks twice already.  
We honestly can't thank you enough.  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Yeah, what he said.  
We really wanna live our lives the way you two do...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
No way! We won 'cause we were all fighting together!  
After all, I scratch your back, you scratch mine, right?  
  
**Knight Commander：**  
Yes, it is as you say.  
Come, we must make haste! It's still a long way to the harbor!  
Convicts, return to the carriage at once.  
  
**Bandits：**  
Yes, sir!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Well, there goes the ship.  
I hope their sentences end soon so they can come home.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It's all thanks to you that we were able to see them off in one piece!  
As long as we're together, I feel like we can help absolutely anyone.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Mr. Knight, thanks for helping me out back there.  
Next time it's my turn to help you, right?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey, hey, Mr. Knight. Do you need help with anything?  
Like work or something? Or is there anything you don't understand?  
  
Anything at all?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Man, I guess your ears are gonna fall off if I keep asking you.  
Eheheh...  
Well, if you're ever in trouble, let me be the first to know! Promise me!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
From now until forever, I hope we can keep helping each other,  
and anyone else we find who might be in trouble...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
The thrill of my heart pounding in my chest that I felt before—  
I want  
more of that. Much, much more.  
  
**Narration：**  
Hiyori secretly whispered inside her heart,  
while regarding {player}'s troubled smile.
