# Hiyori Episode 9
Hiyori has recently noticed that her heart aches whenever she gets close to {player}, and a mysterious power wells up inside her. She tries to find the reason behind it by fighting a powerful monster, but after an unintentional post-battle hug, the ache turns into an intense throb.
  
## Subtitle: A Secret Ache
  
**Narration：**  
One day, {player} is helping Hiyori  
fulfil a request to exterminate some monsters.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
As if I'd let you get away! Take this!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Whew...  
All right!  
Monster massacre complete!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh no, Mr. Knight, why are you down in the dirt?!  
You okay? Lemme give you a hand!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Give Hiyori a high-five.  
`Tag 1`  
**Hiyori：**  
Whaaa! S-sorry! Did I startle you?!  
You caught me off guard, so I guess I overreacted...  
Hahaha...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ughh... I bet he thinks I'm strange...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ever since I won the tournament, I get an ache in my heart  
whenever I'm with Mr. Knight.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Are you all right?  
`Tag 2`  
**Hiyori：**  
Y-yeah!  
I'm okay!  
Look! Even after fighting all those monsters, I'm still full of energy! See?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...It's actually true.  
When my heart aches, the energy wells up inside my body,  
along with power.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
'Cause of that, I don't need Mr. Knight's power.  
Like today, I managed to take down some pretty tough monsters  
without him powering me up at all.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Is it 'cause my heart aches that I get stronger?  
Or is it the opposite...?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
But I dunno how I'm supposed to figure it out...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Ohhh. But I would like to know though...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  What are you talking about?  
**Choice: (4)**  You'd like to know what?  
`Tag 3`  
**Hiyori：**  
You see, my heart is...  
A-actually, ignore me!  
Pretend I never said anything!

`Tag 4`  
**Hiyori：**  
I'd like to know...  
what, I wonder?!  
Ahahah...  
  
Phew, that was close...  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Hiyori：**  
More importantly, we should report to the client that we've taken care  
of the monster problem!  
  
**Man 1：**  
All right, here you go!  
The reward for all your hard work.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Thank you!  
  
**Man 1：**  
No, thank *you*!  
Why, those monsters have been a huge bother for  
everyone recently,  
so I'm glad you kids were up to the job.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Eheheh. We're happy to hear it!  
Right, Mr. Knight?  
  
**Man 2：**  
Ohh, Hiyori. Just the girl I was looking for.  
I'd actually also like to make a monster-hunting request. May I?  
  
**Man 1：**  
Gramps! You too?!  
So there *has* been an increase in monster activity lately.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, really...?  
Well, I guess I have been getting a ton of extermination requests  
recently...  
  
**Man 2：**  
Of late, I've been hearing that monsters are showing up in places they  
never did before. We're still in the middle of reconstruction, so we can't  
afford to let them get close to the city...  
  
  
**Man 2：**  
But this one's apparently so tough, no one's able to stand up to it.  
Sorry for asking this of you when you've just come back, but could you  
go handle it?  
Please, I'm begging you.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
A really tough monster...  
There's no way I can ignore something like that!  
Don't worry, pops.  
You scratch my back, I scratch yours!  
Right, Mr. Knight?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I'll crush that monster with you!  
`Tag 6`  
**Man 2：**  
Oh, fantastic! Much appreciated!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
All right, Mr. Knight!  
Let's go bash that monster!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Make sure you each come back in one piece!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...This could be my chance to test  
whether or not I've become stronger.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
The best way to test your strength  
is to fight a strong opponent!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Lemme see. According to the old man,  
it should be somewhere around here...  
Ohhh, but where?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Heyyy! Mr. Monster!  
Growl if you can hear me!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Whoa! I can't believe that worked!  
Stay back, Mr. Knight!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
The old man wasn't lying—this monster does look pretty tough!  
Can I defeat it alone? Let's start the challenge!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
First-move advantage! Hiyaaa!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Whoaaa! It knocked me back?!  
O-one more time! Hiyaaa!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It's no use! I can't defeat it!  
I didn't get stronger after all!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Let me help!  
**Choice: (8)**  Hiyori, together!  
`Tag 7`  
**Hiyori：**  
Mr. Knight!  
Thanks!  
Let's do it together!

`Tag 8`  
**Hiyori：**  
Okay! Give it to me, Mr. Knight!  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Hiyori：**  
Yeah, that's it! I can feel the power welling up inside me!  
I've got this now...! Here I gooo!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Take this, this, this and this!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Waaah! That was close!  
But now you're full of openings!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Take this!  
Hiyori Rush!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I did it, I did it! Did you see, Mr. Knight?! Ahahah!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It was all 'cause you were here with me!  
Thank you! Thank you so much!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Wahhh! S-sorry!  
I was so happy...  
I-I accidentally hugged you... Ahah, ahahahahah...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
The ache in my heart is starting to feel more like a throb!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Huh? What's this intense feeling in my body...?!  
It's like I'm overflowing with a power much stronger than when my  
heart was aching...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
But why?! How come?!  
Argh, what's happening to me?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Could it be that I can only get stronger when I'm so close to Mr. Knight  
that I can hug him?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
But if I have to stay that close to him all the time,  
my heart will throb so much that it'll definitely explode...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I'm in such a pickle. What am I supposed to do...?  
I can't just keep my arms wrapped around him forever...  
  
**Choice: (10)**  You can if you want.  
**Choice: (11)**  I scratch your back, you scratch mine.  
`Tag 10`  
**Hiyori：**  
Huh?! Huhhh?! No, no, no!  
You might be okay with it, but I'm not!

**Hiyori：**  
Huh?! Well, I am in a predicament...  
But this time, I can't rely on you for help!  
  
`Tag 12`  
**Hiyori：**  
Argh! I'm so confused!  
My head's all a mess! I have to do better...!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That's it! I just need to become stronger on my own!  
Done! Solved! That's what I'll do!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Mr. Knight! Once we've returned to the city and reported our success,  
I want you to be my training partner!  
I need to get muuuch stronger!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
All riiight, I've got this!  
  
**Narration：**  
Determined to become even stronger,  
Hiyori devoted herself to her training.
