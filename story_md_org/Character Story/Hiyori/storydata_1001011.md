**Narration：**  
While taking a stroll, {player}  
bumps into Hiyori, who is carrying a heavy package.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Mr. Knight! Hey there!  
Hiya!  
What're you...  
ngh...

Me? Umm...  
Actually, I'm...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Old Woman：**  
Oh, young lad, are you this girl's friend?  
Could you carry that for her?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ahahah...  
Actually, it belongs to this lady.  
She was struggling 'cause of how heavy it is, so I couldn't just  
ignore her!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Let me help.  
`Tag 4`  
**Hiyori：**  
Really?  
Thank you!  
Let's carry it together!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Well, this is me.  
Thank you so, so much.  
It wasn't too heavy now, was it?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It wasn't heavy at all!  
I scratch your back, you scratch mine!  
Right, Mr. Knight?  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Thank you. Then next time, let me scratch your back.  
Bye for now. Take care on your way home.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I always feel invigorated after helping someone!  
Mr. Knight, thanks for your help!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Speaking of which,  
why am I so eager to help people?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Mr. Knight! Don't be so surprised!  
I wonder when it started?  
When I see someone in need, I act without thinking.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Umm...  
Wh-what's this light?!  
Go away! Huh? I can't hit it...  
I'm getting... sleepy... again...

**Hiyori：**  
Hey there! How's it going?!  
Are you going home now too?  
Ah,  
I guess you're taking a detour, right?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
My injury  
from the other day has healed,  
but I'm playing it safe by taking a break from extracurricular activities.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
'Cause of that, I haven't got a lot to do,  
so I was just killing time in the park.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
But I'm one lucky girl,  
'cause I got to bump into you here.  
  
**Girl：**  
*sob* *sob*... Mommy...  
Where are you?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...That girl looks like she's lost.  
I think we should go help her!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey there!  
What's the matter, sweetie?  
Don't you know where your mommy is?  
  
**Girl：**  
*sob*... *sob*...  
Wahhh...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ahhh, please don't cry!  
Hmm, is there anything around here that can help calm her down?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ah, I've got it! I'm sure it's in here somewhere...  
Yeah, here it is!

You're such a brave little girl trying to find your meowmy all by yourself!  
This little kitty wants you to cheer up!  
  
**Girl：**  
*sob*... *sob* It's a kitty cat...  
But miss, this little kitty is all scruffy and worn out.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
This kitty  
is actually a very special friend of mine.  
Whenever she sees someone in trouble, she'll do whatever she can to  
help.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
So little kitty cat is gonna help us look for your mommy,  
and she won't stop until we find her!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
See, you won't feel so lonely with kitty keeping you company, right?  
So please don't cry anymore. Let's find your mommy together,  
okay?  
  
**Girl：**  
...Okay. I'll stop crying.  
Thank you, kitty. And you, miss.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, what a good girl!  
I'm glad you got your smile back!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
You know, this kitty was given to me by a very special person.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
If I ever meet that person again, I wanna thank him.  
So I always keep kitty with me.

**Hiyori：**  
Don't tell me, you were the boy who helped me back then...?  
  
**Girl：**  
Ah! It's Mommy!  
Mommy! I'm over here!  
  
**Girl's Mother：**  
Thank goodness! So you've been here all along...?!  
I was looking for you!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I'm so glad you your mommy found you!  
What a relief!  
  
**Girl's Mother：**  
I really appreciate you looking after my daughter.  
I honestly can't thank you enough...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It was no problem at all!  
I scratch your back, you scratch mine!  
  
**Girl：**  
Thank you miss,  
mister!  
Bye-bye!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Bye-bye!  
...I'm so glad that the girl and her mom are finally reunited!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Um, by the way, I just remembered how I got this kitty key chain.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
When you're around that little girl's age and you get separated from  
your mom, it feels like you're the only person left in the world...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...It was you, wasn't it?  
You were the one who helped me that time when I was alone and crying.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Did that happen...?  
`Tag 9`  
**Hiyori：**  
Well, if you can't remember, you can't remember.  
But I'm certain you've helped out lots of people since then, right?

**Hiyori：**  
...I'll always be grateful.  
And I know it's taken a while, but I'm finally returning kitty to you.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It's always been with me.  
It's thanks to you helping me the way you did that I became the person  
I am today.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I know for you I'm just one of many people you've helped out over the  
years. But to me, at that time, you were my hero.  
...So again, I thank you with all my heart.

Thank you!  
If I ever get lonely or have a hard time like I did back then,  
I'll count on kitty to save me!  
  
`Tag 12`  
**Hiyori：**  
...You know, I really looked up to you back then,  
so it made me want to help others in need, just like you do.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I was really happy about what happened that day,  
so I want other people to feel the way I did.

So I'm gonna get good at all sorts of things!

**Ameth：**  
Aaaand welcome back.  
Hiyori is so admirable. Or rather, she's the definition of pure itself.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Who'd have thought that the actions you took when you were a child  
would have such a profound effect on her? I was actually surprised.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It would be great if your future conduct  
continued to connect you both with many new people.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But Hiyori has a tendency to act on intuition and impulse,  
so you have to give her the proper support.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Because she loves you, right? Heheh!  
And that's all we have time for today. Until we meet again. ♪

**Hiyori：**  
Urgh...  
Ah! Did I fall asleep again?  
I feel like I was having a very nostalgic, very important dream...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...I only vaguely remember it,  
but it's as if something I saw in my dream  
really happened to me in the past.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Do you think I actually met you a very long time ago, Mr. Knight?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Nah, there's no way!  
I guess half my brain's still sleeping!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...But it would've been real nice if I actually had met you  
a long time ago.  
  
**Narration：**  
Hiyori secretly wished that the events of her dream had been true.
