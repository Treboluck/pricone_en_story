**Narrator：**  
Having taken on a request,  
Hiyori finds herself out of town on her own.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Take this!  
  
**Monster：**  
Rrrrghhhhh!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Phew...  
That's one down!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Weird, though. Monsters shouldn't be appearing in a busy area like this...  
Either way, I gotta wipe them out before someone gets hurt!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Another one?!  
I'm pretty sure it came from over there.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, shoot! It's attacking someone!  
 I gotta act quick!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Are you okay?!  
Don't worry, I'll—  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Wait, Mr. Knight?!  
 Heyo!  
Didn't think I'd bump into you here!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Mind if I ask what—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Whoops!  
Ehehe, guess now isn't the time for chat.  
Lemme take care of this thing first!  
Punchy punchy punch!  
  
**Monster：**  
Rrrrghhhhh!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Phew...  
At least it was pretty weak.  
Now we've got plenty of time to catch up!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, don't worry. No need to thank me.  
I'm out on a monster-hunting request today,  
so I was just doing my job.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
So anyway, what're you doing here?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, you're out on a delivery? And it's just past here?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Well that makes sense, but this place is full of monsters right now.  
It's way too dangerous on your own.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hmm... Well this is tricky.  
You can't just ditch your work, either.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, how about this?  
If you're in a pickle,  
then I can just help you out!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Or... maybe not, actually.  
I'm in the middle of work myself.  
These monsters won't wipe themselves out.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
These woods normally aren't that bad, but today's a special case.  
Honestly, there's enough that I might not even be able to handle them all myself!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
So yeah. Much as I want to help you out, I dunno if I can.  
Wouldn't mind some help myself, if I'm being honest!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hmm... I'm seriously stumped here.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Wait, no I'm not!  
My brain juices just got flowing!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I wanna help you out. That's just a fact.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
So... How about you help me out too, in exchange?  
You're the perfect pair of hands I need for these monsters!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
With the two of us together, we'll clean them out in no time!  
Once that's done,  
I'll help you out with your delivery.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
A perfect plan, if you ask me! And with that settled,  
let's get to it!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Huh?  
C-come on, no need to thank me.  
We're both helping each other out here!  
I scratch your back, you scratch mine!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
And with that said,  
let's get to hunting!  
  
**Monster：**  
Rrrrghhhhh!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Down it goes! Nice and easy, too.  
Fighting along with you really makes things go smoother!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Man though, the leader of the pack sure isn't showing up.  
If we took that down, then all the others would probably scatter.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
According to the info I got,  
it's the sort of monster that goes into hiding at night.  
So we gotta find it fast, or else!  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Whoa! Th-that sure was a roar...!  
Chances are the leader's near by, so let's go check!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Bingo!  
That's it over there! We finally found it!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
No time to waste, though.  
Let's take it down nice and quick!  
Hahhh!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
For real?!  
It just brushed me off like nothing!  
  
**Monster：**  
Graaaaarghhhh!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
And now we're surrounded!  
Don't tell me... Did they actually lure me in?  
  
**Monster：**  
Graaaaarghhhh!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Urgh!  
I-I think I'm done for!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Make the save.  
`Tag 1`  
**Hiyori：**  
Mr. Knight?!  
Thanks, I appreciate it!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I can't believe I let that happen...  
Thanks, though!  
Do me a favor and keep them busy! I'll take the leader down quick!  
Round two,  
here we go!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Let's see...  
According to the map, your delivery spot should be just up ahead.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Think you can make it there on your own?  
Cool,  
good to hear! I'll head back to town first, then.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Also, while I'm here. Thanks again for the help earlier.  
Things might've turned out real bad if it hadn't been for you.  
And hey,  
we managed to take down the leader of the pack as well!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Thanks alone doesn't feel like enough, though.  
Is there anything you'd like, by chance?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm not that sure, actually.  
**Choice: (3)**  No need to repay me. I just helped out on instinct.  
`Tag 2`  
**Hiyori：**  
Let's have a think together, then.  
Hmm...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, how about this?  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Hiyori：**  
Heh, you're just like me then!  
It just doesn't feel right to ignore people in need, does it?  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Hiyori：**  
This can be a little deal between us.  
If you're ever in a bind, then pay me a visit.  
Who knows, I might just be able to help you out!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Right back at you.  
`Tag 5`  
**Hiyori：**  
Huh...? So basically, you wanna help me out as well?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Okay,  
then. Guess I'll take you up on that!  
I'm the one who went on about scratching each other's backs and all that,  
so yeah. Makes sense. Thanks again!
