## Subtitle: An Earnest Desire for Happiness
  
**Narration：**  
{player} and Hiyori,  
having finished up a job together, are on their way back to town.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Mmm! That sure was exhausting! But hey, at least it went well.  
Having you around sure helped!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
We finished with time to spare as well, so let's hurry home and chill out.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, there's the Tower of Sol.  
Guess we're not too far off!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That reminds me.  
We first met under the tower, didn't we?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It's funny, really. I could never get those dreams out my head,  
then before I knew it,  
the three of us were gathered under the tower.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I always figured those legends about the tower were just that.  
Legends with no real basis.  
But well, those dreams changed that.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I'm not really sure why,  
but they made me believe. They're not just legends. They're real.  
I'm not alone, either. Yui and Rei must think the same as well.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That's why I decided to start taking things seriously.  
If I can have my wish granted, then it's more than worth it.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What is your wish, anyway?  
`Tag 1`  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, I guess I never told you.  
Well...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Truth is, I just want a world where everyone can be happy.  
A bit cliché, but hey.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
You, Yui and Rei. All the people I care for.  
And everyone else in the world, too! I want them all to be happy!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  How about you? Will that make you happy?  
`Tag 2`  
**Hiyori：**  
Me?  
Well, uh... Probably?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Huh... That's weird. Why did I have to pause for a minute there?  
It should've been an easy answer...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, that's it. I do want \"everyone\" to be happy.  
It's just, I never included myself in that for some reason.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That's why you asked, isn't it? 'Cause you're worried about me.  
Even still, though. It won't change how I feel.  
So long as everyone else is happy, then I'm more than okay with that!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Then it's up to me to make you happy.  
`Tag 3`  
**Hiyori：**  
It's up to you...?  
Is that a declaration of intent?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Well then.  
I guess I've got nothing to worry about,  
do I?  
Thanks! *squeeze*  
  
**Choice: (4)**  So soft...  
`Tag 4`  
**Hiyori：**  
Really?  
You're...  
surprisingly built, if I'm being honest.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh, shoot! I didn't squeeze too hard, did I?  
Ehehe, sorry. I was so happy that I got carried away a bit.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I mean it, too.  
No one's ever said something like that to me before,  
so I couldn't contain my emotions.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
You won't need to do much,  
though. Just knowing you're by my side is enough to keep me happy!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
But wait, why do I feel like that in the first place?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...! W-what's with me?  
The second I looked at him, I started feeling all weird...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
It's kind of a suffocating feeling...  
But... there's something nice and warm to it, too.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
What's going on? This is the first time I've ever felt like this...  
  
**Narration：**  
Ever so curious about these newfound feelings,  
Hiyori wracked her brain trying to get to the bottom of them. Needless  
to say, however, the answer she sought was not to be found that day.
