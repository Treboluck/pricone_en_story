## Subtitle: I'm Trying to Save a Life Here!
  
**Narration：**  
The same night...  
  
**Manager：**  
...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Well, no one else came in the end...  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm still not sure why, either.  
Though it did give me a chance to learn the ropes,  
so technically that worked out for me.  
  
**Suzume：**  
This *is* a business, though.  
I can't imagine that having no customers is a good thing...  
  
**Manager：**  
Yeah...  
Me and my family might have to genuinely consider ending it all...  
  
**Suzume：**  
D-don't let it get to you!  
It's still too early to give in!  
I'll do everything I can, too, so please cheer up!  
  
**Manager：**  
Thanks. I appreciate it.  
The more I think about it, though, the stranger it seems  
that no one's around at this time of the year.  
  
**Manager：**  
The sun's already set for today, so I'll close up shop.  
Tomorrow, though, I think I'll go ask around town  
and do some advertising before we open.  
  
**Manager：**  
I'll get to the bottom of this situation.  
And I'll bring in customers while I'm at it.  
  
**Manager：**  
Like you said, it's too early to give in.  
Summer's just begun, after all.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Y-yeah!  
That's the spirit!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hehe.  
I guess that means tomorrow could potentially be a busy day.  
  
**Suzume：**  
And if that's the case,  
then I should take this chance to rest up in preparation.  
  
**Manager：**  
You do that.  
And thanks. Here's your pay for the day.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh...  
No, I think I'll pass on that for now.  
I barely did anything worth being paid for today!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Let's leave it until the last day.  
Then you can draw a figure up from your sales  
and pay based on that. Does that sound okay?  
  
**Manager：**  
That won't do, I'm afraid.  
You read the listing, right?  
I specifically noted that you'd get paid everyday.  
  
**Suzume：**  
No, it's fine. Really.  
If anything, I don't think I could live with the reality that  
you and your family ended it all thanks to me accepting a wage.  
  
**Manager：**  
Urgh. I'm so sorry...  
I'll be sure to bring in a bunch of customers to make up  
for today. Then I'll pay you properly.  
  
**Manager：**  
So please don't abandon me here.  
If things take off, I'll even make sure you get a suitable bonus!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Well, just try not to push yourself too hard.  
This has been a valuable experience for me as it is,  
so I'm incredibly thankful for the opportunity!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Well then! Thank you for today  
See you again tomorrow!  
  
**Manager：**  
Man. She's too precious for this world...  
I gotta do everything I can tomorrow to repay her.  
  
**Suzume：**  
*sigh*  
It sure got dark quick. I should hurry home,  
otherwise everyone will get worried about me again.  
  
**Suzume：**  
This feels kind of... nice, though.  
Normally I'm the one waiting for milady  
and everyone else to get home.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I don't think the owner will understand just how much I meant it  
when I said this was a valuable experience for me.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hm...?  
{player}!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hello there! I didn't think you were still here.  
You might want to change into regular clothes, though.  
You're bound to catch a cold at this time of night like that.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Waugh?!  
Wh-why are you shining?! What's going on?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Whoa! Not good!  
I tripped on the sand! I'll fall over at this rate!  
  

---  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh?  
Hello there, {player}! ♪  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hehe.  
I take it you're here for a swim?  
  
**Suzume：**  
It's been really warm lately, so I understand.  
Meanwhile, milady hates using the air conditioning,  
so it's been a struggle to sleep at night.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm pretty tired as a result, in all honesty.  
And a maid has to be on top form at all times,  
so that's not quite ideal.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You really are a model maid.  
**Choice: (2)**  I take it you won't be swimming today?  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzume：**  
Not at all! I'm just stating the obvious!  
Though whether I'm living up to those statements or not  
might be up for debate. ♪  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzume：**  
That's right.  
I'm just an escort today, so no swimming for me.  
Not that I have a swimsuit to begin with, of course.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Suzume：**  
Hehe. I should probably mention that milady and her  
school friends are here today. Which is  
why I'm here as an escort.  
  
**Suzume：**  
This happens now and then, you see.  
Milady usually tries to get me involved in some shape or form.  
  
**Suzume：**  
But, well. Milady and her friends are all older than me.  
That makes it a bit... difficult to accept,  
if you get what I mean.  
  
**Suzume：**  
That said...  
I do want to be by her side, just in case something happens.  
  
**Suzume：**  
It's a bit of a difficult situation,  
which is why I'm just here keeping my distance.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Doing so lets me watch milady have plenty of fun.  
And that's enough to leave me feeling satisfied.  
Truly, nothing tops seeing her living a fulfilling life.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hehe. Though one could argue  
that not swimming is a waste in and of itself.  
  
**Suzume：**  
But it's a known fact that I'm a major klutz.  
I'd hate to start drowning and cause issues for everyone...  
Waugh?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wh-whoa!  
I had to go and open my big mouth!  
I forgot how slippery the floor would be... I'm gonna fall!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Even worse, I'm going right into the pool— Aaaaaahhhhh!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Brrbrr...  
Argh, I went and did it again!  
I-I hate this! My clothes are making it hard to move, too!  
  
**Suzume：**  
M-maybe I should have worn a swimsuit after all?  
But it's too late for that!  
  
**Suzume：**  
First off, I need to get back to the surface before I drown...  
Huh?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wait, that's {player} diving in!  
Is he... Is he trying to save me, maybe?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Whoa?!  
Did he just crash his head into the bottom of the pool?  
  
**Suzume：**  
He dived in with too much force!  
Oh no. I think he passed out...  
  
**Suzume：**  
{player}!  
Are you okay?! Don't worry! I'll save you!  
  
**Narration：**  
A few minutes later...  
  
**Suzume：**  
*huff, huff*  
Are you okay, {player}?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh no! He really has passed out!  
What should I do in a situation like this? Think, Suzume!  
Remember the CPR procedure!  
  
**Suzume：**  
First I need to clear the airway! Then a cardiac massage!  
Press, press! Please come back to life for me!

**Suzume：**  
If all else fails, then go for mouth-to-mouth!  
  
**Suzume：**  
...

**Suzume：**  
Urgh... Now isn't the time for hesitation! I'm trying to  
save a life here!It's not a proper kiss, so I...  
I have no reason to feel embarrassed about it!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Forgive me, {player}!  
I feel terrible for possibly stealing your first experience,  
but the situation desperately calls for it!  
  
![107700403.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/107700403.webp)  
**Suzume：**  
Berate me all you want!  
I'll accept whatever you have to say!  
As for now, though, your life takes precedence!  
  
**Suzume：**

**Choice: (4)**  Thought I was a goner there.  
`Tag 4`  
**Suzume：**  
Waugh?!  
Now that surprised me!  
I didn't expect you to regain your breath like that!  
  
**Suzume：**  
What a relief, though!  
You really were almost a goner!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Honestly... I'd rather not say too much considering  
it *is* my fault this happened in the first place,  
but who lets themself almost drown while trying to save someone?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I hope you learned a valuable lesson here.  
...  
But really. I'm so glad you're okay.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oops.  
Milady seems to have noticed what's going on.  
Which means I need to explain the particulars to her.  
  
**Suzume：**  
As for you, please get some rest.  
And try not to move around too much.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Don't worry.  
I'll be back to apologize and thank you in a bit.

**Ameth：**  
And there we have it. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Think of what you just saw as something of a dream.  
Chances are you'll forget about it the second you wake up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What is it with you and all these near-death experiences,  
anyway? Almost feels like you're a magnet designed specifically for  
them.  
You even give Suzume a run for her money sometimes.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Do us all a favor and be careful, okay?  
Especially over on this side. It's much,  
much more bloody and brutal than over there.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Take your eye off the ball for even a second, and bam.  
You're done for.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway. I left you lying on the beach,  
so it's about time for you to wake up.  
Otherwise the waves might whisk you away.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Make sure to praise everyone's favorite  
hard-working maid when you wake up, too. ♪

**Suzume：**  
Zzz... Zzz... ♪  
  
**Suzume：**  
...Huh?  
When did I fall asleep?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hmm... I *do* remember falling flat on my face.  
I must have lost consciousness briefly after that.  
Oh, how embarrassing. I'm such a klutz. ♪  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh no. My outfit's all covered in sand...  
I'll have to wash it when I get home.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wait. That's {player} sleeping right beside me!  
What's going on here?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I know I fell over, so maybe he tried to help me?  
Then he slipped, we both fell over,  
and I knocked him unconscious by landing on top of him?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm not really sure, to be honest.  
What I *am* sure about is that his face is far too close to mine!  
  
**Suzume：**  
We're practically kissing at this range!  
And that's no good. Only adults are allowed to do that!  
  
**Suzume：**  
{player}!  
Wake up, {player}!  
  
**Suzume：**  
If you don't, then...  
I-I'll perform mouth-to-mouth on you!  
  
**Suzume：**  
W-waaahhh?! Don't bounce up like that, please!  
Wait. Did you hear that? Forget about it if you did!  
You caught me in a moment of weakness!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Urgh...  
More importantly, it's gotten rather late.  
Please take care on your way back to your lodging.  
  
**Suzume：**  
We are outside the city walls, so monsters could show up  
at any time. Keep an eye out, and absolutely make sure  
you don't fall asleep on the way.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Right back at you. Want me to walk you home?  
`Tag 5`  
**Suzume：**  
Ahaha.  
I appreciate the gesture, but I should be fine.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Have a look over there.  
Milady seems to have come to find me  
since I'm still not home yet.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Honestly. She really is a worrywart.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Milady!  
I'm over here! Sorry for making you come all this way!  
  
**Suzume：**  
But don't worry!  
I'll always return to your side, no matter what!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hehe.  
I should be on my way.  
See you again, {player}.  
  
**Suzume：**  
You're all here for three nights and four days, correct?  
If so, then we can see each other tomorrow.  
Please feel free to come along to the cafe again.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Now then. Good night.  
I look forward to seeing you here again. ♪
