# Suzume (Summer) Episode 2
The manager of the beachside cafe asks Suzume to wear a swimsuit while working, which she reluctantly agrees to. To make matters worse, {player} comes along, leading to a stressful first day at work.
  
## Subtitle: That's Far Too Much Pressure!
  
**Narration：**  
A few days later, on the Marjan Coast,  
Suzume finds herself most confused.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wait, what...?  
No, no. I can't do that!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Th-this wasn't mentioned anywhere in the listing!  
Being the only staff member is one thing,  
but you also expect me to work in a sw-swimsuit?  
  
**Suzume：**  
I've never done this sort of work before, so I very much doubt  
I can handle it all on my own. A-as for the swimsuit...  
Showing off that much skin is too embarrassing...  
  
**Manager：**  
Come on, don't be like that!  
Help a guy out here! I'm begging you!  
  
**Manager：**  
I can cook and stuff, but I kind of busted my hip  
when transporting goods and building the cafe.  
I'm in no condition to serve people, so I gotta leave it to you!  
  
**Suzume：**  
O-okay, but...  
Is there any need to wear a swimsuit  
if I'm only serving people?  
  
**Manager：**  
Technically no, but we're not talking technicalities!  
You need to think about what people  
who come to the beach want!  
  
**Manager：**  
They want unforgettable summer memories! Cute girls in  
swimsuits serving them! That's what a beachside cafe  
is all about! So let's give it to them!  
  
**Manager：**  
Besides, think about it. You're gonna get major  
heatstroke if you're running around in those clothes.  
I've got a swimsuit all ready for you, so go get changed!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh?  
Why do you know what size fits me?  
  
**Manager：**  
You sent in a resume when you applied for the job, right?  
That had all your details written on it.  
  
**Manager：**  
We do swimsuit rentals here as well,  
so there's plenty of sizes available.  
  
**Manager：**  
That, plus all sorts of leisure items like swim rings and water guns!  
We've even got changing rooms and showers,  
not to mention delicious food! What more could people want?  
  
**Manager：**  
A lot more, apparently!  
We're smack-dab in the  
middle of beach season, but no one's coming along!  
  
**Manager：**  
And as if that wasn't bad enough, the other girls I hired  
all quit on their first day for some reason...  
You're the only one I can count on at this point, Suzume.  
  
**Manager：**  
See, I got this place built almost entirely out of my own pocket,  
fully expecting it to be overflowing with customers.  
But so much for that! I'm gonna be in the red for life at this rate!  
  
**Manager：**  
I gotta catch even just a few people, at the very least!  
And that's where the swimsuit comes in!  
Tell me you understand my plea!  
  
**Manager：**  
It's all over if you decide to call it quits.  
Me, my wife and my son will lose our entire livelihood.  
Worst case scenario, we may have to end it all...  
  
**Manager：**  
I'm begging you!  
You're my last hope! My only savior!  
Help me get through this!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Th-that's far too much pressure!  
  
**Suzume：**  
But, well...  
I would feel terrible for abandoning him.  
Assuming that's all true, of course.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Plus, I made such a big deal about working to everyone.  
I'd feel pretty terrible trudging back after that  
without having accomplished anything of note.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Okay. I'll do it.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I can't guarantee that it'll go as well as you're hoping.  
But I'll give it my all, regardless.  
  
**Manager：**  
F-for real?!  
Thank you so much!  
You're a true goddess in the flesh! Maid outfit included!  
  
**Manager：**  
Now go get yourself changed!  
  
**Suzume：**  
O-okay...  
I'll go use one of the changing rooms.  
  
**Suzume：**  
H-here I am...  
  
**Manager：**  
...  
  
**Suzume：**  
U-umm...  
Could you not stare at me like that? It's embarrassing...  
  
**Manager：**  
I *knew* it! You look even better in that than I imagined!  
Which means you really are this cafe's savior!  
  
**Manager：**  
Everything's gonna be all right now! I can feel it in my bones!  
I'll start whipping up some food, so you get  
to cleaning and calling in customers!  
  
**Manager：**  
Just try and get the hang of things as you go along.  
It'll be tough, but I'm counting on you. You'll get double pay, too!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Okay.  
I-I'll do what I can...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ahhh...  
This is so embarrassing.  
My face feels like it's about to burst into flame.  
  
**Suzume：**  
He did talk about increasing my pay, though.  
Which means more funds to put towards the orphanage!  
Watch me, milady! I'll work as hard as I can!  
  
**Suzume：**  
First up, cleaning! That's my specialty!  
Then I can start calling people in once it's all spick and span...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Or... can I? Will people even come?  
As far as I can tell, there's hardly anyone at the beach.  
  
**Suzume：**  
On the bright side,  
that means not many people will see me in this swimsuit.  
But that's probably not good for the cafe itself...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Right. I'll go call people over once I'm done cleaning!  
Embarrassing as it is, I'm sure no one  
will pay that much attention to me!  
  
**Suzume：**  
We're strangers, so they'll forget about me right away!  
It's not like I'll be dealing with people I know!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hello there.  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzume：**  
...  
Waugh?!  
W-w-  
welcome!  
Wait. {player}?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
No way, why are you here?  
I-I didn't expect someone I know to come along!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm here with the rest of the Gourmet Guild.  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzume：**  
You won tickets through a lottery? Oh.  
I do remember Kokkoro mentioning that.  
Which led to us shopping around for a swimsuit for her.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I-I can't believe that brought you here, though!  
Especially when she mentioned a tropical islands tour!  
We're not even that far from Landosol!  
  
**Manager：**  
What's wrong, Suzume?  
Don't just chat away to our customers.  
Take their order!  
  
**Suzume：**  
O-okay!  
Errr, uhhh...  
How do I go about doing that?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Waaahhh! This is too much to deal with!
