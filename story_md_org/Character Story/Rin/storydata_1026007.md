**Rin：**  
Siiiiiix, seeeveeen...  
E-eight...  
  
**Rin：**  
Nine...  
Urgh. A hundred spear thrusts is too much.  
  
**Rin：**  
My arms already feel like they're gonna fall off.  
Cut me some slack, Caon...  
  
**Rin：**  
I wanna go home and jump into my nice, cozy bed.

**Rin：**  
Huh?  
Oh, it's you!  
Howdy! ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
What am I doing at Caon's guildhouse?  
Pretty obvious, isn't it?  
Just suffering through hellish training.  
  
**Rin：**  
Yup.  
Seems like they're serious about not  
letting me go back to Elizabeth Park if I don't go through this.  
  
**Rin：**  
Basically I've just gotta live with it until they deem me fit enough.  
  
**Rin：**  
Not exactly doing well, either.  
I've already been coming for a whole week...  
  
**Rin：**  
The bright side is I can stay  
at my parents' house here in Landosol.  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh yeah.  
Apparently Caon members go through the same training here every day.  
  
**Rin：**  
Wild, right?  
Meanwhile I'm about ready to throw in the towel for good over here.  
  
**Rin：**  
That said, Caon's pretty much the combat rep  
when it comes to guilds aligned under the Menagerie.  
This sorta training must be a light warm-up for them.  
  
**Rin：**  
I don't think I'm cut out for it, to be honest.  
Physical prowess is a trait for most beastfolk,  
but I don't really fit in that category in the first place.  
  
**Rin：**  
I'm just a regular old squirrel.  
Cute herbivores like us aren't built for fighting.  
  
**Rin：**  
Which makes it even weirder that I ended up in Caon.  
Basically, you take a compatibility test when you join the Menagerie,  
and they decide where you go from there.  
  
**Rin：**  
I was happy at the time 'cause it's close to home.  
The less time spent commuting to work, the better.  
  
**Rin：**  
Now, though?  
You bet that I regret it.  
I should have half-assed the test.  
  
**Rin：**  
But I couldn't.  
Not when Mama promised to make me  
a super delicious acorn-based meal.  
  
**Rin：**  
I kinda went wild after hearing that.  
Promise me a good reward,  
and I'll have all the motivation in the world.  
  
**Rin：**  
I'd probably be done with this training already if I had one waiting.  
Heh. You agree, don't you?  
  
**Rin：**  
So hey.  
How about giving me one?  
I'll do real good, I swear.  
  
**Rin：**  
No?  
Aww, come on.  
Give me a reason to go all out.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Work hard and I'll get you some sweet buns.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll bring your mom along.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rin：**  
Wait, really?  
Well, now I'm down. ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Actually. Sweet buns come in all types, you know?  
  
**Rin：**  
There's this bread store I used to love when I was a kid.  
I could go for the special sweet buns they sell there.  
  
**Rin：**  
There's just something about them  
compared to other stores.  
  
**Rin：**  
They're delicious, but kinda leave you always wanting more?  
I don't really get it myself, but yeah.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Rin：**  
Huh? Why?  
I mean, that *would* motivate me...  
  
**Rin：**  
Don't, though.  
She'd get worried sick if she  
saw me all exhausted and looking pitiful...  
  
**Rin：**  
Plus, I don't want her to find out  
that I'm at risk of expulsion.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hm?  
So you'll just bring her along if I *don't* put in the effort?  
  
**Rin：**  
That's just a regular old threat!  
You bully!  
  
**Rin：**  
Make it feel more like... I dunno, a negotiation?  
Something'll that get me motivated *and* make me feel good!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rin：**  
*huff, huff*  
Dealing with you and these thrusts  
at the same time sure is exhausting...  
  
**Rin：**  
Honestly.  
You're just being a nuisance right now, you know?  
  
**Rin：**  
It's kinda hard to focus,  
so do me a favor and be quiet.

**Rin：**  
Teeen, eleeeveeen...  
Phew...  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh...  
My spear sure feels a lot lighter all of a sudden.  
  
**Rin：**  
Am I tired enough that  
my hands gave out and dropped it?  
  
**Rin：**  
Nope, it's still there.  
So how come I'm having a way easier time swinging it now?  
  
**Rin：**  
It's not just the spear. My whole body feels lighter.  
A hundred thrusts should be easy-peasy now. ♪

**Rin：**  
Twelve!  
Thirteen!  
Fourteen! ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Hm?  
What's he doing over there?  
He's got his sword drawn, too.  
  
**Rin：**  
Did he get a stomachache or something?  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh.  
That reminds me of something I heard back at Elizabeth Park.  
  
**Rin：**  
He has some unique ability  
that lets him power up anyone he considers an ally.  
  
**Rin：**  
Is that what's going on here?  
It'd make sense, at least.  
  
**Rin：**  
But if it's an ability to power up his allies,  
then that means he considers me one.  
He considers me someone worth being close to.  
  
**Rin：**  
Ehehe. That's kinda nice to know. ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
I've only ever caused issues for him, too.  
Forced him to deal with me. Pamper me. Help me out.  
  
**Rin：**  
But here you are.  
Still sticking by my side, supporting me with all you've got.  
  
**Rin：**  
Thanks. That means a lot.  
  
**Rin：**  
But you mean even more to me.  
Probably just as much as Mama does.
