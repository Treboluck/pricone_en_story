# Rin Episode 5
Caon, worried about Rin's lack of a response to their summons, dispatches some members to Elizabeth Park to check on her. Rin flees on instinct, bumping into {player} in the process, who suggests they go apologize together.
  
## Subtitle: The Squirrel Takes Flight
  
**Rin：**  
Ph-phew.  
Talk about being exhausted.  
  
**Rin：**  
I *should* be in the clear now, I hope...  
Though it'd be smarter to hide somewhere now.  
I can't run forever.  
  
**Rin：**  
Only issue is it's easy to get a clear view of the whole farm.  
Which means I might have to venture into the mountains.  
  
**Rin：**  
Whoa?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Come on! Why you gotta pop out of the bushes like that?!  
You scared the life out of me!  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh?  
It's a shortcut?  
So you pretty much go right through the mountains when you come here?  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh.  
Isn't that actually *more* effort, all things considered?  
Guess your legs must be pretty sturdy.  
  
**Rin：**  
Wait. Now's not the time for chitchat!  
I'm a wanted squirrel! Save me!  
Grab my hand and take me somewhere far, far away!  
  
**Rin：**  
Eeek!  
They're getting closer!  
  
**Rin：**  
Don't ask any questions!  
Just listen and do as I say!  
I'm begging you!  
  
**Rin：**  
Waugh?!  
Wh-what's with the hug out of nowhere?!  
A-are you gonna whisk me off my feet and flee the country?!  
  
**Rin：**  
No?  
Oh... You're here to catch me  
on behalf of Caon?  
  
**Rin：**  
Argh!  
Et tu, {player}?  
You got me hook, line and sinker!  
  
**Rin：**  
This is too much! I trusted you!  
If anyone was gonna be on my side, it was you!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Forgive me, my friend.  
**Choice: (2)**  Don't struggle.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rin：**  
Urgh...  
We're far beyond the point of apologies.  
  
**Rin：**  
You big, dumb, dummy!  
I was a fool for thinking you were a nice guy...  
  
**Rin：**  
You pretended to be an ally to gain my trust,  
but in reality you're just another evildoer  
looking to drag me outside.  
  
**Rin：**  
*sob*  
My last bastion of hope is gone.  
I dunno what to believe in anymore...  
  
**Rin：**  
Everyone else in Elizabeth Park's thrown me to my pursuers, too.  
I've got nowhere to turn now.  
  
**Rin：**  
Alone I stand in this cruel world.  
What a sad story.  
*sob*  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Rin：**  
Urgh...  
Let go of me, you traitor!  
Dummy! I can't believe I trusted you!  
  
**Rin：**  
*sniff*  
I'm not strong enough to break free, either...  
  
**Rin：**  
Fine.  
I'm done. I give in.  
  
**Rin：**  
So do me a favor and let me go already.  
It kinda hurts. And, uh, you're making me feel all weird...  
You gotta treat girls more gently, you know.  
  
**Rin：**  
Heh! ♪  
You fell for my trap, dummy!  
Now I can escape!  
  
**Rin：**  
Gyurgh?!  
H-hold up! Hands off the neck!  
You're gonna choke me out!  
  
**Rin：**  
O-okay, okay!  
I give in for real! I swear!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rin：**  
Hm...?  
What's with that look on your face?  
Are you taking pity on me now?  
  
**Rin：**  
It's only right to let me off  
if you feel sorry for me.  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh? You don't?  
Whatever. I figured that was the case.  
  
**Rin：**  
Yeah... Caon wanted me to make a report to them, but that  
meant trekking down the mountain to go to their headquarters.  
So I just kept putting it off 'cause it'd be a pain.  
  
**Rin：**  
And well.  
I guess that kinda got them a bit worried.  
  
**Rin：**  
I wasn't submitting any written reports either,  
so they started to think that something might've happened to me.  
  
**Rin：**  
And then they geared themselves up and came to check on me,  
only to find me lazing about in my room.  
So they got real mad and start chasing me around.  
  
**Rin：**  
Maaan.  
They're gonna grill me so hard if I get caught.  
We're talking a serious earful.  
  
**Rin：**  
Caon's not exactly the strictest guild around,  
but that just makes personal judgment  
a big factor when it comes to punishments.  
  
**Rin：**  
And they're all super angry,  
so I'm gonna get the scolding of a lifetime.  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh man. What if they decide to boil me alive?  
I haven't done anything *that* bad, have I?  
I don't wanna die!  
  
**Rin：**  
*sob*  
I just wanted to live a peaceful, easy life.  
  
**Rin：**  
It's only normal to want to  
avoid anything stressful, right?  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh...?  
How come you're patting my head now?  
  
**Rin：**  
{player}.  
What'd I tell you about treating me like a kid?  
  
**Rin：**  
I mean, sure.  
I've never done anything worth  
being treated like an adult in the first place, but still.  
  
**Rin：**  
Mmm...  
You'll go apologize with me, so I should stop crying?  
I'm not crying. You're crying!  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh well.  
The more I run, the worse things'll get.  
  
**Rin：**  
And I feel pretty bad about making everyone worry.  
  
**Rin：**  
So yeah. I'll go apologize.  
  
**Rin：**  
If anything, I should be thinking about how  
Caon personally came all the way up here.  
  
**Rin：**  
Pretty lucky, considering I don't need to go to them now.  
I'll just get my scolding and do my reports after.  
Done and done.  
  
**Rin：**  
Heh. Good things come to all who laze about. ♪
