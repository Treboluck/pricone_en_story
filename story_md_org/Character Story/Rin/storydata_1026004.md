## Subtitle: Rehearsing for School
  
**Rin：**  
No way! No way!  
  
**Rin：**  
Th-this can't be happening!  
It's too much! No one could be this cruel!  
  
**Rin：**  
Right, {player}?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Hm? What's with that look?  
D-don't tell me you can't actually  
fathom why I'm so distressed right now...  
  
**Rin：**  
Urgh...  
You know that package you delivered for me?  
The one with the new video game and sweet buns?  
  
**Rin：**  
It felt pretty light considering the contents, didn't it?  
  
**Rin：**  
Yeah.  
Software itself is a type of magic tool made from special materials,  
so they end up being pretty heavy.  
  
**Rin：**  
Kinda wish they'd find a way to make them smaller.  
Just carrying them around can be a pain.  
  
**Rin：**  
Back on topic. There was also supposed to be  
a pack of twenty sweet buns in there as well.  
Put that all together and it'd be pretty big, right?  
  
**Rin：**  
But check it out.  
I can lug this around pretty easily.  
  
**Rin：**  
It should've clicked the  
second you handed it over to me.  
  
**Rin：**  
Ugh. I even signed off on it already, too.  
Guessing I can't return it anymore, huh? Figures.  
  
**Rin：**  
You probably won't get paid either if I make  
a big fuss and refuse to accept it,  
so I'll just deal with it.  
  
**Rin：**  
*sigh* Look at this.  
The game got delayed,  
so they threw something in as an apology.  
  
**Rin：**  
Looks like a plushie based on one of the characters.  
  
**Rin：**  
Which is nice in and of itself.  
But I also had plans to stay up all night playing it!  
  
**Rin：**  
And that's not easy.  
I had to manage and adjust my body clock around it!  
  
**Rin：**  
It wouldn't be as bad  
if I could at least munch on some sweet buns  
to relieve a bit of the stress, but...  
  
**Rin：**  
I just had to go and flub my order, didn't I?  
  
**Rin：**  
I dunno how, but I ended up ordering a set  
to *make* high-grade buns... There's a bunch  
of ingredients, beans and the recipe stuffed in here.  
  
**Rin：**  
Much as I love sweet buns,  
making them myself is way too much of a pain.  
  
**Rin：**  
Mind making them for me, {player}?  
Pretty please?  
  
**Rin：**  
Aww...  
Actually, they didn't even include all the ingredients.  
I'd still need to buy flower, milk and stuff.  
  
**Rin：**  
Which means I can kiss any sweet bun dreams  
goodbye unless I wanna put the effort in to buy extra stuff.  
  
**Rin：**  
C-can this day get any worse...?  
  
**Rin：**  
I mean. It is my fault that I flubbed the order...  
And well, it's a good thing if the game ends up  
being better thanks to them delaying it.  
  
**Rin：**  
But it still sucks to have pretty much  
everything you were looking forward to  
get pushed back.  
  
**Rin：**  
*sob*  
Cheer me up, {player}...  
  
**Rin：**  
Let's play something I already have.  
Ideally something exciting.  
Maybe that'll help me forget this painful loss.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey, {player}.  
Are you... Are you asleep?  
  
**Rin：**  
N-no way!  
Who passes out while someone's  
grieving over unforeseen misfortune?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Eeek?!  
Wh-what's going here?!  
{player}'s all shiny...!  
  

---  
  
**Rin：**  
Urgh...  
I am the embodiment of exhaustion.  
  
**Rin：**  
My body won't move an inch.  
So get me something to drink, {player}.  
  
**Rin：**  
I'll take some sweets too, while you're at it.  
I worked hard today, so treat me well.  
Spoil me as much as you can. Heh. ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh, a sweet bun!  
Thanks! *munch* ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Now that's the good stuff. ♪  
Nothing like something nice and sweet  
to replenish those energy levels.  
  
**Rin：**  
Mmm...  
It'll take a while before they're full, though,  
so lemme go lie down until then.  
  
**Rin：**  
Now that's more like it.  
Nothing better than getting nice and comfy.  
  
**Rin：**  
Honestly feels like I've done three months' worth of exercise.  
My legs are about ready to stage a coup against me.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You did well today, Rin.  
**Choice: (2)**  How come you're so tired?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rin：**  
Wahey.  
Keep it coming. Praise and spoil me more. ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Actually. Since when were we close enough for you  
to start calling me by my first name? Not that I mind too much.  
  
**Rin：**  
It does kinda feels like you're treating me like a kid,  
so just stick with \"Morichika.\"  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Rin：**  
Really?  
*You're* gonna ask that question?  
Even though you're the one responsible?  
  
**Rin：**  
It's one hundred percent, without a doubt,  
your fault that I had to go through all that.  
  
**Rin：**  
So take responsibility and  
carry me all the way home.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rin：**  
Waugh?  
Hey, what's the deal here?  
Quit pulling on my cheeks!  
  
**Rin：**  
Hm? I shouldn't eat while lying down  
'cause I'll get crumbs all over the bed?  
  
**Rin：**  
Your point is taken.  
But also ignored, 'cause moving is a struggle,  
and my body needs sweet buns.  
  
**Rin：**  
Urgh...  
Okay, fine.  
I'll scoop up and eat the crumbs.

**Rin：**  
Ahh, man.  
I'm so, so exhausted.  
Can't believe I worked myself to the bone on a precious day off.  
  
**Rin：**  
Getting over my shut-in tendencies is important,  
but walking all the way to school from home  
as practice might not have been the best idea.  
  
**Rin：**  
Sure didn't figure that my body  
would just give up halfway there.  
  
**Rin：**  
Didn't help that it's a furnace out there, either.  
I'm lucky you ended up  
carrying me home to stop me from getting heatstroke or something.  
  
**Rin：**  
Not gonna lie.  
I'd be a goner already if you weren't there.  
  
**Rin：**  
Gotta hand it to everyone else.  
Forcing themselves through that hell  
each and every day just to go to school is impressive.  
  
**Rin：**  
I mean. I know I gotta do the same.  
But I can't. I'm not built for it.  
  
**Rin：**  
Like. How am I supposed to get through a whole day of school  
if I'm already dying before I even reach the building?  
  
**Rin：**  
Just the idea of it's killing me.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hm?  
You'll stick with me until I get used to it,  
so I shouldn't give up just yet?  
  
**Rin：**  
Hmm.  
I'd rather not put that much  
of a burden on you, to be honest.  
  
**Rin：**  
You've already done enough  
for me as it is.  
  
**Rin：**  
But I'd just be putting all that to waste if I gave in now.  
And that'd make me feel pretty bad.  
  
**Rin：**  
So yeah. I'll keep at it.  
As for today, though, I rest.  
No need to rush it. We'll take it nice and easy. ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Ehehe.  
The bed kinda smells like you, {player}.  
  
**Rin：**  
It's making me all sleepy.

`image display end`  
**Ameth：**  
And that's that. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Think of what you just saw as something of a dream.  
Chances are you'll forget about it the second you wake up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm basically just replaying memories  
involving you and people who you'd  
gotten close to on the \"other side.\"  
  
**Ameth：**  
Gotta admit, though.  
I had no idea which scenario to go with this time.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You two just keep doing the same stuff over and over.  
It's almost impressive just how repetitive events between you are.  
  
**Ameth：**  
This probably makes no sense to you, so lemme explain.  
You and Rin... Morichika Rin, that is,  
are both students at Tsubakigaoka High.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You're in the same class, even.  
So your teacher decided to have you  
go tell her to stop being a shut-in and come to school.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's how things between the two of you kicked off.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You do pretty much everything  
in your power to make her start going to school again.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Stuff like baiting her with sweet buns  
and even forcibly carrying her there.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She wasn't happy with it at first,  
but she eventually finds herself able to leave the house.  
And thus one step closer to going back to school.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The memories I showed you there  
take place a little bit after she's reached that stage.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's a weekend,  
so you decided to walk to school from her house  
as a practice session of sorts.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Chances are that you two would have  
succeeded if you kept things up at that rate.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It'd only get easier the more her legs developed  
and got used to walking that distance, too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But, well.  
Things were never able to  
reach that stage in the end.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Your story over on the \"other side\"  
got cut short thanks to what happened to the world at large here.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That must be so frustrating, right?  
To be so close, yet so far.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You can't give up just yet, though.  
That story of yours is bound to make a comeback. I just know it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You'll get to go to school and enjoy  
the prime of your life together with her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So yeah.  
Keep it up. You're almost there.  
  
**Ameth：**  
At the end of the day,  
you're the only one that's ever been  
willing to show her the world beyond her room.

**Rin：**  
Zzz... Zzz...  
  
**Rin：**  
Mmm... Guess I fell asleep.  
Urgh. Pretty sure I had a weird dream, too.  
  
**Rin：**  
Man. I gotta stop falling asleep outside.  
The farm's nice and peaceful, sure,  
but I'd be a goner if one of the cows or horses trampled over me.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hmm? Hold up.  
Why's it warm and cozy?  
  
**Rin：**  
Whoa...  
How come I'm sleeping with my head in your lap?  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh?  
You thought it'd be a good idea since I looked pretty uncomfortable?  
That, plus the fact that I'd worked hard today?  
  
**Rin：**  
Err. I'm pretty sure I *didn't* work hard.  
If anything, I spent the day lazing about in my room again.  
  
**Rin：**  
So much for being in charge of security.  
  
**Rin：**  
So yeah. I don't deserve any reward.  
Lemme get myself up.  
  
**Rin：**  
Ehehe.  
I'm feeling pretty great, not gonna lie.  
  
**Rin：**  
Which is funny, considering I ended up missing out  
on both the new game and the sweet buns.  
Normally I'd be in despair right about now.  
  
**Rin：**  
Probably thanks to you, now that I think about it.  
So thanks. You really are a nice guy, you know that?
