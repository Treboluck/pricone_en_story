## Subtitle: Baking Together
  
**Rin：**  
Phew... That training sure was tough.  
  
**Rin：**  
I ended up going at it the whole day.  
My arms feel like they're gonna fall off.  
  
**Rin：**  
No doubt I'm gonna be  
in for some mega pain tomorrow.  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh?  
I must feel great after all that exercise?  
  
**Rin：**  
As if.  
Sorry, but that sorta sports tryhard mentality isn't for me.  
  
**Rin：**  
It *does* feel good to know I'm mostly free from annoying stuff,  
though. I never wanna go through that ever again.  
  
**Rin：**  
Caon's happy with my efforts,  
so the training part's over with, at least.  
  
**Rin：**  
I still gotta come back next month to report in, though.  
Otherwise they'll hit me with double the training.  
  
**Rin：**  
Double would be 200 thrusts, right?  
My arms might literally fall off...  
  
**Rin：**  
They told me it'd get super easy  
if I just did a bit of exercise every day...  
  
**Rin：**  
I don't have the energy for that, though...  
Hey, {player}.  
What're you laughing at?  
  
**Rin：**  
Can't believe you'd laugh at me after all I've been through...  
Hm?  
It's 'cause I'm talking more than usual?  
  
**Rin：**  
Which proves that I *am*  
feeling great after all?  
  
**Rin：**  
I mean.  
There's a sense of satisfaction after overcoming hell itself.  
  
**Rin：**  
It wasn't the least bit fun, though.  
In fact, it was just outright painful.  
  
**Rin：**  
But well.  
Here I am,  
walking home with you after a hard day.  
  
**Rin：**  
That part's pretty nice.  
In fact, it's kinda something I've always wanted to do.  
  
**Rin：**  
Whoa?!  
{player}, you're all shiny again!  
You gotta stop doing that out of nowhere!

**Rin：**  
Aaand...  
there we go.  
Phew. Oof.

**Rin：**  
Gotta admit, this is way tougher than expected.  
Never figured my arms would end up  
this sore just from making sweet buns.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hm?  
What's that?  
You think I'm doing a solid job?  
  
**Rin：**  
Less feedback, more helping.  
Also, go buy me some sweet buns.  
I've got some stress eating to do.  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh...  
Yeah, I guess going out to buy some now  
would kinda ruin the point of us making them.  
  
**Rin：**  
I need them right now, though.  
Sweet buns for my tum-tums.  
Uh-oh. Now I'm getting withdrawal symptoms.

**Rin：**  
Okay. Let's just eat them right now.  
You know how pancakes and stuff taste best before  
they're fully baked? I bet it's the same here.  
  
**Rin：**  
This'll be the next big trend.  
Eat your heart out, chocolate and caramel. ☆  
  
**Rin：**  
Heh.  
We won't even need to bother baking it  
next time if this ends up as delicious as I'm expecting.  
  
**Rin：**  
Two birds, one stone.  
Genius idea, don't you think?  
  
**Rin：**  
Right!  
Let's dig in to this bad boy. ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
*munch, munch*  
  
**Rin：**  
Eww. It's all sticky and gross.  
  
**Rin：**  
So much for that.  
Guess we *do* need to bake it properly.  
Life could do with some more shortcuts, if you ask me.  
  
**Rin：**  
Let's see here...  
First I put  
the bean paste inside the dough...  
  
**Rin：**  
Zzz... ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  She fell asleep on the spot?!  
**Choice: (2)**  I wanna eat some as well.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rin：**  
Zzz... Zzz... ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Mmm...?  
Huh, when did I fall asleep?  
  
**Rin：**  
I must have blanked out.  
All that hard work today's  
starting to take its toll.  
  
**Rin：**  
This isn't the time for sleep, though.  
I gotta keep on until this is baked up all nice.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Rin：**  
Mmm...?  
Waugh?!  
Why're you shaking me?!  
  
**Rin：**  
I fell asleep on the spot? For real?  
Urgh... I must have blanked out due to exhaustion.  
Thanks for waking me up.  
  
**Rin：**  
Also, let's bake the buns properly.  
They taste pretty bad like this.  
  
**Rin：**  
Would be a waste if we ate it all like this, really.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rin：**  
There we go.  
Now to let it bake away.  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh man, that smells great. ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Is it ready yet?  
How about now?  
Whatever! I'm opening this bad boy up!

**Rin：**  
Yaaay!  
Oh, beloved sweet buns. Where have you been my whole life?  
  
**Rin：**  
Ouch! Gotta let them cool off first, huh.  
  
**Rin：**  
Wow, though.  
I actually made sweet buns for the first time in my life.  
Thanks a lot for the help, {player}.  
  
**Rin：**  
And well...  
I promised I'd do as you asked if you helped,  
so it's only fair I hold up my end of the bargain.  
  
**Rin：**  
So yeah. I'll start going to school again tomorrow.  
No guarantee it'll go well, but the least I can do is try.  
  
**Rin：**  
Ehehe.  
More importantly, though. Let's try these bad boys out.  
*munch* ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh, wow! They're good! ☆  
Never thought freshly baked sweets buns could be this delicious.  
  
**Rin：**  
*munch, munch*  
How are they this good?!  
  
**Rin：**  
I can't believe I've been running around calling  
myself a sweet bun lover when I've never  
tasted them at their absolute best!  
  
**Rin：**  
{player}! You have some, too!  
I'd rather not share any of this greatness,  
but I'm making an exception for you!  
  
**Rin：**  
Let's share in this bliss together... ♪  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
And there we have it. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well. Now you've got me all hungry.  
Which is funny, considering I was never programmed to eat.  
I'm almost jealous of you two.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That aside.  
It sure seems like there's a unique relationship blooming here.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Two people baking sweet buns together on a day off.  
If anything, I'd liken that more to a family  
rather than just regular friends or lovers.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That gets a thumbs up from me.  
And being with her is probably  
having a positive impact on you, too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I mean.  
You're seeming more and more pleasant as the days go on.  
  
**Ameth：**  
There's no denying that  
the world's full of harsh realities.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But that doesn't make your life itself harsh.  
Not when you've got people to  
walk through it with and experience all sorts of joys together.  
  
**Ameth：**  
If anything, I'm kind of jealous.  
I was your first partner, yet here I am now...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh well.  
Let's wrap things up for today.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Don't stay up too late after you get home, okay?  
The two of you are still kids,  
so you need all the sleep you can get.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'll see you again in your dreams.

**Rin：**  
Zzz... Zzz... ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Hmm...?  
Oh! A sweet bun!  
Chow time!  
  
**Rin：**  
Guh?!  
Wait, that's no sweet bun.  
It's {player}'s head!  
  
**Rin：**  
Oww... Hope I still have all my teeth...  
Sorry for almost taking a chunk out of your head, {player}.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey...  
How come you're giving me a piggyback ride?  
Oh. I ended up falling asleep on the way home 'cause I was so tired?  
  
**Rin：**  
Well then.  
Thanks.  
  
**Rin：**  
I assume you fell asleep as well after you got all shiny?  
Then that might've been a dream...  
Sorry, my brain isn't working right now.  
  
**Rin：**  
...Hey.  
Don't hesitate to come to me if there's anything on your mind.  
Not that I'm the most reliable person in the world.  
  
**Rin：**  
We're the same age, though,  
so I'd rather not be leeching off you all the time.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hm?  
I've already given you plenty back?  
Huh. Don't remember ever doing anything worthwhile.  
  
**Rin：**  
Man.  
You sure do have a habit of saying weird stuff, don't you?  
  
**Rin：**  
Ehehe.  
I dunno why, but I'm super in the mood for some sweet buns.  
Wanna stop by somewhere and get some?  
  
**Rin：**  
A good dose of sugar should wake me up.  
Plus, I'm hungry.  
  
**Rin：**  
I kinda remember us eating some super delicious  
sweet buns in that dream. And now I wanna taste them again.  
  
**Rin：**  
Not just that.  
It'd be great if we could make them together for real, too.
