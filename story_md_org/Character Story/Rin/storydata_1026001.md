# Rin Episode 1
Rin has been living the slow, peaceful life ever since Caon dispatched her to Elizabeth Park. One day, {player} brings a letter to her containing a summons from Caon, which she wholeheartedly rejects.

**Rin：**  
Ahh. Another day of perfect weather. ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Can't think of anything better to do on  
an afternoon like this other than laze about.  
  
**Rin：**  
Talk about living the life.  
I'd jump so, so hard at the opportunity  
to live at Elizabeth Park forever if I could.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hm?  
  
**Rin：**  
What's your problem?  
You're blocking my precious sunrays, you know.  
How about you get outta the way for me?  
  
**Rin：**  
Kinda trying to make the most of them, you know.  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh?  
Yeah, my name's Rin.  
  
**Rin：**  
I'm a member of a guild called Caon,  
but right now they've got me working out here at Elizabeth Park.  
  
**Rin：**  
Something to do with a pact between them, I think?  
I dunno much about the details.  
  
**Rin：**  
Anyway. Elizabeth Park wanted some security,  
so Caon shipped me off to handle it.  
  
**Rin：**  
I can't be bothered with that, though, so I've just been chilling.  
Not like I need to do anything when it's so peaceful here.  
  
**Rin：**  
Why put the effort into  
doing something that doesn't even need to be done?  
  
**Rin：**  
More importantly.  
 You're here to see me, right?  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh.  
You're a mailman, huh?  
  
**Rin：**  
Just a regular old mailman  
dragging himself up a mountain  
to deliver some mail to us.  
  
**Rin：**  
Good on you, I guess.  
Definitely wouldn't catch me doing that.  
Regular old work is hard enough.  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh.  
You've got mail for me as well, huh?  
  
**Rin：**  
Well then.  
That'd explain why you were asking for me.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hmm...  
Heading down to town's too much of a pain,  
so I normally just order a bunch of stuff instead.  
  
**Rin：**  
Don't even remember what I got this time.  
A whole bunch of acorns, maybe?  
  
**Rin：**  
Yup.  
I love them acorns. ♪  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh?  
You're just here to deliver a letter?  
  
**Rin：**  
I wonder who it's from.  
Definitely not any friends,  
considering I was a full-time shut-in.  
  
**Rin：**  
Might be from my mama?  
Wouldn't be surprised, considering she's always checking in on me.  
Lemme see it.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hand it over.  
**Choice: (2)**  Mama...?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rin：**  
Thanks.  
Good job on the delivery.  
  
**Rin：**  
Right, then.  
Let's see what this is all about.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Rin：**  
Uh, what's with that reaction?  
Is it weird to still use \"mama\"  
at my age or something?  
  
**Rin：**  
I mean, it *does* make me sound a bit like a kid,  
but I just call her that 'cause I love her a lot.  
  
**Rin：**  
She lives in town, too, so I haven't seen her for a while.  
That's probably the worst part about living here.  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh well.  
Mind handing the letter over?  
  
**Rin：**  
Thanks.  
Now then, let's see what the deal is here.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rin：**  
Ughhh. Of course it's from Caon.  
Now I've got a real bad feeling about this.  
  
**Rin：**  
I really don't wanna read this.  
What if they're trying to make me give up  
my perfect life here and go back to town?  
  
**Rin：**  
That's a big fat nope from me.  
I'm staying here until I kick the bucket.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey, you. Uhh... What was your name again?  
{player}?  
  
**Rin：**  
Well, {player}.  
Sorry, but do you mind ditching this letter somewhere?  
  
**Rin：**  
You do?  
Urgh... How about reading it for me, then?  
  
**Rin：**  
The contents might be fatal,  
but I should survive the blow if I've got a nice cushion for it.  
  
**Rin：**  
Huh?  
You can't read 'cause you've got amnesia?  
  
**Rin：**  
You're not pulling my leg, are you?  
Whew. Guess you've got a tough life.  
  
**Rin：**  
Well, whatever.  
Guess I'll just read it with my eyes half-closed.  
  
**Rin：**  
Ugh...  
They want me to head back to town  
so I can make an official report at headquarters.  
  
**Rin：**  
That's only the biggest pain in the world.  
Surely a letter's good enough for a basic report, right?  
  
**Rin：**  
You agree as well, don't you?  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh well.  
Doesn't seem like an emergency summons,  
so I'm just gonna ignore it until they start pressing me.  
  
**Rin：**  
And hey.  
Caon can feel free to fire me if they want.  
  
**Rin：**  
Then I'll just become an official member of Elizabeth Park, instead.  
That'll solve everything.  
  
**Rin：**  
Good luck getting me to  
leave this peaceful paradise.
