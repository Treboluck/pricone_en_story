**Narration：**  
One day, {player} heads into town  
in response to a sudden invitation from Eriko.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ah... My love...  
You came just as I asked.  
How I've longed... to see your face...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Huh...? Is something wrong, you ask?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee... No, of course not.  
I am perfectly fine... The same Eriko you know and love.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I think you're shaking.  
**Choice: (2)**  You look kind of pale.  
`Tag 1`  
**Eriko：**  
Oh, um...  
 My body is quivering with joy at your arrival.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Well... I suppose there's also a possibility that my body is cold  
from waiting here for three hours...  
 Achoo!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Eriko：**  
Ahh, your gaze upon me is so intense...  
It feels as though my body might burn up!  
  
**Eriko：**  
I knew it was worth waiting here  
for the three long hours it took you to arrive...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Eriko：**  
At any rate, the reason why I invited you here today is...  
  
**Eriko：**  
...Huh? My love?! ...Aaahh!  
Suddenly grasping my hand like that...  
What has come over you today?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Could it be... you are trying to warm my hands?  
But no... This will only make your own hands colder!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ahh, this feels wonderful...  
Like the warmth of his heart itself...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Um, listen... I invited you out here today to...  
No, ah... Would you come for a little walk with me, please?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh, thank you so much!  
How very kind of you...  
You truly are my soulmate...  
 Teeheehee.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh, to think he would agree so easily!  
The first step of my date plan is a success!  
  
**Eriko：**  
If that magazine article was accurate...  
Visiting all of these date spots together  
will ensure that our future is filled with romance.  
  
**Eriko：**  
But calling this a date might make him nervous,  
so I'll refrain from using that particular word.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Well then, shall we go and do a little shopping?  
There's something I simply have to buy.  
  
**Shop Clerk：**  
How can I help you?  
  
**Eriko：**  
This is the right store, isn't it?  
I hope they have the brooch that the magazine mentioned...  
  
**Eriko：**  
I must obtain it and give it to him without delay...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Well, ah... I'm looking for a brooch...  
  
**Shop Clerk：**  
Ah, the brooch from the magazine article?  
  
**Shop Clerk：**  
I'm terribly sorry.  
That's a very popular item right now,  
so I'm afraid we're out of stock.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Is... that so...?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You wanted the brooch in this picture?  
`Tag 4`  
**Eriko：**  
Y-yes.  
 But not for any particular reason, you understand.  
You need not worry yourself, my love.  
  
**Eriko：**  
The article said that giving this brooch as a gift  
will capture the recipient's heart...  
But it would be silly to explain that.  
  
**Eriko：**  
*pant*... *pant*... *pant*...  
  
**Eriko：**  
What is... coming over me...?  
My body feels sluggish, like it has a mind of its own...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Did I inhale one of my own concoctions?  
No, I didn't bring any of them with me today.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Could someone have poisoned me for revenge?  
No, I would have noticed if anyone approached with the intent to kill...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Do you think you've caught a cold?  
`Tag 5`  
**Eriko：**  
A... cold...?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ah—my love!  
Where are you going, my love?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh... He ran off in such a hurry...  
He said he would be right back, but...  
Wherever could he have gone?  
  
**Eriko：**  
I really didn't expect you to go as far as buying me medicine...  
It's made me feel much better!  
  
**Eriko：**  
To think *you* would end up feeding *me* a potent concoction.  
Fate works in strange ways...  
 Teehee.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Actually, there was one last place I wanted to visit...  
Would you mind accompanying me there?  
  
**Eriko：**  
My love, look around us!  
There are fireflies flitting to and fro!  
I always dreamed of coming here together with you.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Huh? Well, there's no particular reason...  
  
**Eriko：**  
It's just... a very romantic location, that's all.  
  
**Eriko：**  
The article said that couples who kiss on this spot  
will be bound together for the rest of their lives...  
  
**Eriko：**  
But how should I approach him?  
I suppose subtlety is the key...  
  
**Eriko：**  
My dearest love, there is something on your nose.  
Let me wipe it off for you.  
  
**Eriko：**  
This will allow me to lean in close...  
 Huh?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ahh! There's no need to rub it so roughly yourself!  
  
**Eriko：**  
There's nothing left there now!  
  
**Eriko：**  
I can't let one failure stop me!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ahh... Oww! I think there's something in my eye.  
  
**Eriko：**  
This time, I'll surely be able to...  
 Aaahh?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
You're leaning in of your own accord?!  
What's this? Why are you blowing into my eyes?  
Huh? You're puffing the dirt away?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh, really! This is going nowhere!  
At this point, I'll just have to be bold!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Close your eyes for a moment, my love!  
Wait, why are you leaning—?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Can it be...  
 He's actually going to kiss me first?!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Cover Eriko's eyes.  
`Tag 6`  
**Eriko：**  
Um, my love...?  
Why are you suddenly plunging my world into darkness?  
  
**Eriko：**  
You have something for me?  
Ahh... This is...!

**Eriko：**  
It's the brooch I was looking for at the shop?!  
But how in the world...?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ah, I see... You remembered you'd seen it at a different store.  
But then, when did you have time to buy it?  
  
![109000202.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/109000202.webp)  
**Eriko：**  
Oh! You took the opportunity when you fetched me that medicine?  
Thank you for going to all that trouble for me...  
  
**Eriko：**  
But this brooch serves no purpose  
if I can't give it to you...  
  
**Eriko：**  
After all, even without the brooch's effects,  
I'm already head over heels in love with you...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Someday, I swear I will succeed  
at winning your heart with my very own charms.  
  
**Narration：**  
\"You'll see that we were always meant to be.\"  
So saying to herself, Eriko smiled in silent anticipation.
