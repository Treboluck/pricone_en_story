## Subtitle: The Most Secret Ingredient
  
**Narration：**  
Valentine's Day has arrived.  
The sweet scent of lovers' chocolates  
wafts through all corners of Landosol.  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is spending a lazy day at the guildhouse  
when he hears strange sounds coming from the kitchen.  
  
**Narration：**  
Ever so slowly, he tiptoes towards the source of the noise...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Peek through the kitchen door.  
**Choice: (2)**  Burst into the room.

Ah, hello there, my love.  
I hope you don't mind if I borrow your kitchen.

`Tag 2`

**Eriko：**  
Goodness, my love.  
You certainly are full of vigor today.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Eriko：**  
As it happens, I was hoping to treat you  
to some freshly made chocolates,  
so I decided to make them here.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Naturally, I ask for no thanks or praise in return...  
  
**Eriko：**  
After all, words are not necessary  
between lovers joined by fate...  
  
**Eriko：**  
All I wish is for you to be happy, my love...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Well then, I will work hard in the kitchen,  
so please rest a little longer, my love.  
  
**Eriko：**  
First, I must boil the water...  
Ah, these will form the secret ingredient,  
 so I should mix them together...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Once the color changes, I should stir until they become creamy,  
then add this last ingredient, and mix until a glossy sheen develops...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Now, if I melt the chocolate over the boiling water...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ahhh, once these are complete,  
{player} will be unable to resist me...  
No, he is already under my spell! Teehee...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Now, I need only measure out the mixture  
and add the extra-special concoction...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Need any help?  
**Choice: (5)**  What's that in the test tube?  
`Tag 4`  
**Eriko：**  
Ah, my love... You must not look.  
This test tube's contents are a secret recipe of mine.

`Tag 5`  
**Eriko：**  
Nothing that will cause your body any harm.  
Please trust me and wait with patience.  
These chocolates will be delicious, I promise.  
  
`Tag 6`

**Eriko：**  
Thank you for waiting, my love.  
These are the chocolates I made just for you.  
  
**Eriko：**  
What do you think?  
 Don't they seem perfectly normal?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee...  
 They look beautiful?  
 You'll like the flavor too.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Go on, eat up to your heart's content.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Hm? This will take some courage, you say?  
Aww. I know they are a special gift,  
but there's no need to be so shy!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Open your mouth and say...  
 \"Aaahh!\"  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee... How does it taste?  
Sweet, faintly bitter, and incredibly delicious?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Well, that's wonderful!  
 Teehee...  
  
**Eriko：**  
...You're worried that you'll experience strange effects?  
Oh no, nothing like that will happen.  
  
**Eriko：**  
After all, I didn't use a single medicinal ingredient.  
What was in the test tube, you ask?  
  
**Eriko：**  
That was just a concoction of fruit syrup, liqueur and the like.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Today, I really did simply want to treat you  
to a most delicious chocolate creation...  
  
**Eriko：**  
So, did you like it? How were the chocolates I made?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Tastier than anything I've ever eaten.  
**Choice: (8)**  So tasty I'm already craving more.  
`Tag 7`  
**Eriko：**  
Ahh! Those are just the words I hoped to hear.  
My love, I am filled with happiness right now.

`Tag 8`  
**Eriko：**  
Of course! If you so desire,  
I will gladly prepare as many as you like,  
whenever you ask for them!  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Eriko：**  
All this time, I've been plagued by a kind of jealousy,  
desperate to earn your genuine affection.  
And yet, today I'm filled with nothing but joy.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Perhaps it's because I truly earned those words of praise.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Huh? Am I sure I didn't add anything strange, you ask?  
Well, actually, there was one thing...  
  
**Eriko：**  
A generous helping of the drug known as love!  
  
**Narration：**  
And with those words, Eriko gave a beautiful, beaming smile.
