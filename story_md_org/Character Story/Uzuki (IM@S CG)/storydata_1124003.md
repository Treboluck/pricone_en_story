## Subtitle: Who I Want to Be
  
**Narration：**  
On the way to Musa,  
{player} and friends are staying at a village  
while the \"New Generations\" girls work hard at their lessons.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Whew... It's getting late, so let's call it a day.  
Thank you so much for helping us with our lessons as usual!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Uzuki, you're getting better and better!  
You looked more idol-y than ever to me just now! ☆  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Eheheh... I'm happy if that's how it looks.  
It proves that all my hard work is starting to pay off.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Today, it's our turn to make dinner, right?  
I'll make something we can eat together—  
  
**Man：**  
Someone! Anyone, please!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wh-whoa! What's this about?  
Could there have been a monster attack?  
  
**Man：**  
My wife and daughter haven't returned from gathering mountain herbs!  
They set out this morning, and said they'd be back just after noon...!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's all help search for them.  
`Tag 1`  
**Uzuki：**  
...I agree. We'll help out as well!  
Something might have happened to them in the mountains.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
They could have run into monsters,  
so let's ask Karyl and Kokkoro to help too!  
If we split up into groups, it'll be easier to find them.  
  
**Man：**  
Oh, thank you so much!  
Once you're ready, let's set out right away!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
He~y! Is anybody there~?  
Hmm... no sign of anyone here either, huh? Where could they be...?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
...Oh! Wait a moment!  
That basket lying over there... Could it be...?  
  
**Man：**  
This basket...!  
No doubt about it, it's ours!  
Then... they must be close by?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Good eye, Uzuki!  
Okay, let's search this area extra carefully!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Umm... Is anybody here?! Anyone... Waahh?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Look out!  
`Tag 2`  
**Uzuki：**  
S-stay back! You'll fall as well— Aaaahhhh!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
O-owieeee... I-I'm so sorry.  
I didn't see that hole through all the grass...  
Are you all right? You're not hurt, are you?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Phew—looks like you're OK. Thank goodness.  
But what shall we do now?  
I doubt we can climb all the way back up...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
...Huh? Hey, look! I think those are bloodstains!  
You don't think they could be...?  
 Let's take a look!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
The trail just keeps going...  
Umm... Hello~? Is anybody here?  
  
**Woman：**  
...re! Over here! Somebody help us, please...!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
That voice! It came from over... Ah! There they are!  
Are both of you all right?!  
  
**Girl：**  
My mommy's really hurt! Please help her!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Oh—that looks nasty...  
 Hold on a minute.  
I brought some medicinal herbs, so I'll apply those for now.  
  
**Woman：**  
Oww... Thank you so much.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Here... we... go...! I've bandaged the wound, so I think you should be OK for now.  
How is it? Do you think you can walk?  
  
**Woman：**  
Y-yes... I doubt I'd be able to run, but walking should be okay...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
I'll lend my shoulder if you need it, so try not to strain yourself.  
It's not just us looking for you, so first let's get somewhere—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRRRRHHH...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Huh? A monster...?!  
Everyone, try to hide behind me!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
That monster's a dangerous type that's not native to here, right?  
What's it doing in these parts...?!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  We've got to take care of it somehow.  
`Tag 3`  
**Uzuki：**  
But against such a strong monster, will I stand a chance...?  
  
**Woman：**  
No way... Just when we thought we were saved...  
  
**Girl：**  
I-I'm scared... I'm scared, Mommy...!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
It's OK. It's all fine. We'll buy some time for you.  
So while we do, run back to the hole where you fell down.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Just run straight that way, and you'll see it.  
Call for help near the hole, and I'm sure the others will find you soon!  
  
**Woman：**  
But then, what about you...?!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
I'm an adventurer, so I'm fine with a little danger.  
Now get ready to run as soon as we move. All right?  
  
**Mother & Child：**  
...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Everything will be OK. You have to trust me!  
Now, we'll go on the count of three. One, two, three!

E... eheheh... I put on a brave face,  
b-but my legs are shaking, and I'm so... so scared.  
There's nowhere to run or hide anymore, is there?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
But even so...  
I may be a normal girl, but I'll do my best to help those people!

Whew...  
 Guess we know what's for dinner tonight! ☆  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Pecorine...!  
Um, are the mother and daughter both all right?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yep! Thanks to all your hard work, they're totally fine!  
They both kept shouting so loud, we couldn't possibly miss them! ☆  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Ahh...  
 Thank goodness...  
  
**Man：**  
Oh... this is such a relief...!  
How can I ever thank you enough...?  
Thank you! From the bottom of my heart!  
  
**Woman：**  
Miss Uzuki, we're in your debt!  
Your words gave us the courage... the strength we needed to escape!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
I'm just happy that I could be of help!  
Take care on your way home!  
  
**Girl：**  
Miss Nice Girl, thank you! Bye-bye!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
...I think I've found what I want to do.  
I may be a normal girl without any real special talents...  
but I want to do my best  
 to make other people smile.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
So as an adventurer and as an idol...  
I'll become the kind of person who can work hard for others!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I know you can do it. I'll cheer you on.  
`Tag 6`  
**Pecorine：**  
Agreed! We can guarantee you've got what it takes! ☆  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Eheheh. Thank you so much! ♪  
I'll keep doing my very, very best!  
  
**Narration：**  
Having found a new goal to aim for in life,  
Uzuki gave a great beaming smile free of hesitation and uncertainty.
