# Uzuki (IM@S CG) Episode 1
Before meeting {player}, Uzuki lives her life as an adventurer with no clear goal in mind. She wonders when she will find something she really wants to do—something that will help her to change for the better.
  
## Subtitle: Ordinary Girl
  
**Narration：**  
A little while before the \"New Generations\" girls  
had their fateful encounter with {player}...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Um, Rin? I'm thinking of visiting the Guild Association today.  
Is there anything you need me to ask them?  
  
**Rin：**  
The Association... Oh, you're going to gather information.  
In that case, it would be good to hear about other guilds' activities.  
  
**Rin：**  
There could be interesting news we haven't heard.  
Well, if there isn't, just checking up on available jobs should do.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Other guilds' activities and available jobs.  
 Got it.  
Okay then! I'll get going now!  
  
**Association Clerk：**  
Oh, hello, Uzuki. Good to see you.  
Are you here to take on a new job?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Hello there!  
 I'm here to check what new jobs are available.  
Is there anything you'd recommend  
that hasn't been posted on the board yet?  
  
**Association Clerk：**  
Hmm, let's see.  
 The pending requests are right here...  
but these ones might be a bit difficult for you, I'm afraid.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Oh, is that right?  
 Hmmm...  
What if it's not me... Like, is there anything Rin could do?  
  
**Association Clerk：**  
Ah—that girl's a real fighter, so it's a possibility.  
I'll add this too, then... Here—a list of the latest jobs.  
Let me know if you want to accept any!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Okay! Thank you very much!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
A lot of these say \"seeking battle-hardened adventurers.\"  
I guess I wouldn't be much use for those...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
You're right—it's a tricky selection this time.  
I guess I can't do much to help, which is a shame.  
  
**Association Clerk：**  
Hmm...  
Oh, I know!  
 I could give you a little request of my own.  
We're short on supplies, so can I ask you to go and buy some?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
A job for me?  
But if it's just an errand, won't the staff here handle it?  
  
**Association Clerk：**  
Truth is, the girl I was hoping to ask called in sick today.  
And I can't leave my post right now, so how about it?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Oh, of course!  
If it'll really help, I'd be happy to accept!  
  
**Association Clerk：**  
Thank you. Here's the list of items we need.  
There's no big hurry, so feel free to take your time.  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Hello there! ...  
Oh, Uzuki!  
Are you taking on a new job?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Hi there!  
 Yes, I was just about to head out on an errand.  
Are you guys here to accept a new job too?  
  
**Male Adventurer：**  
We're here about something else.  
Here's the flyer I mentioned. Can you post it up somewhere for us?  
  
**Association Clerk：**  
Yes, of course.  
It's always a shame to see good adventurers fly the nest...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Huh? You're quitting adventuring?! Did something happen?  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
Ahaha, it's not like we're in any trouble.  
We've been talking about this together for a while.  
About what it is we really want to do as a guild.  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
It's not as though we hated adventuring, but... how do I put this?  
Life was starting to feel aimless.  
Something like that.  
  
**Male Adventurer：**  
So instead of sticking to the same old jobs,  
we thought we'd try setting up our own circus!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Wow, that's amazing!  
From adventuring to performing...  
That must feel like a really big change!  
  
**Male Adventurer：**  
Ahaha, you're not wrong.  
 We only tried performing in the first place  
for a job that we were assigned to by mistake.  
  
**Female Adventurer：**  
But thanks to that, we realized we enjoy making people laugh.  
It felt like a better fit for us than adventuring.  
  
**Male Adventurer：**  
Here—take this flyer for our next event.  
We'd love it if you could come and watch!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Oh yes, of course! Thank you so much!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Let's see... I think I've got everything she wanted.  
It took quite a while to find it all, so I should hurry back...  
  
**Man：**  
Oh—my bad!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Wahhh! I'm so sorry I bumped into you...  
Ahhh?! H-hey, that's my bag! Wait a moment!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Could he be a thief?!  
 O-oh no, what now?!  
He's running so fast... I don't think I can catch up...!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
H-help, please! That man is a thief!  
Can somebody... anybody catch him?!  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Say what?! You dumb brute... Take this!  
  
**Man：**  
Guahhh! G-get off me! Lemme go, dammit!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
I-I'm sorry... Thank you so much...  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Hey, no problem. This is what guys like me are for!  
Can't let a little thing like you get hurt fighting or nuthin'.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Urgh... I'm supposed to be an adventurer...  
But I'm weaker than a random merchant...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
...And so that's why I wound up running late. I'm so sorry!  
  
**Association Clerk：**  
No worries, no worries. I told you there was no hurry.  
And you did bring everything I asked of you!  
  
**Association Clerk：**  
Still, it's good that things worked out in the end,  
but wasn't it dangerous to chase after that thief?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Huh?  
 B-but...  
I couldn't just let him run off with all the things you needed...  
  
**Association Clerk：**  
This is only hypothetical, but what if he'd been leading you  
to a group of his cronies?  
 Doesn't that sound possible?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Oh...  
 Now that you mention it, that's true.  
I was so focused on catching him, I didn't think that far.  
  
**Association Clerk：**  
I'm glad you worked so hard to fulfill my request.  
But it's more important to keep yourself safe from harm.  
  
**Association Clerk：**  
You're just an ordinary girl, after all,  
so try not to push yourself too hard. All right?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Okay...  
  
**Uzuki：**  
An ordinary girl... She's right, of course.  
I can't do any impressive adventuring like Rin,  
and it's not like I have all kinds of skills like Mio, either.  
  
**Uzuki：**  
What do I really want to do with my life?  
Is there something out there for me too, like that other guild?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
I do love spending all this time together with Rin and Mio...  
But where do I want to go from here?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Will I find it someday?  
Something new that makes me want to do my best...?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Wait—it's this late already?!  
I-I have to get back quick! Mio and Rin will worry!  
  
**Narration：**  
Reflecting on the day's events,  
Uzuki found herself dwelling on what she truly wanted to do.  
The day when she would find her answer was still a little way off...
