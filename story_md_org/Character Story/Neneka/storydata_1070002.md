**Nice Lady：**  
...Next question. A bag contains three 100-rupie vegetables  
and two 300-rupie vegetables.  
How much would it cost to purchase two bags?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  ...1800 rupies!  
`Tag 1`  
**Nice Lady：**  
Correct. Very well done.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
Your calculations have been almost flawless lately.  
You have come a long way since we first began these lessons.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
...Perhaps the time is ripe to move on.  
I have taught him enough common sense.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
The light that sometimes envelops him and the girls around him...  
Some being beyond my perception is similarly assisting with his growth.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
Not only that, but his reunions with these familiar faces...  
...  
Yes, I think I will have to stake my bets on you.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
It is not my Princess Knight, Masaki,  
but you, boy, who will prove most critical to defeating Mana...  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
That is why I must avoid any further contact.  
If Mana were to detect my existence, all would be ruined.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  ...What's wrong, nice lady?  
`Tag 2`  
![107000102.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/107000102.webp)  
**Nice Lady：**  
Ah, {player}.  
Thank you for all your hard work.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
I will now give you a final exam. If you pass this test,  
it will prove that you can fend for yourself in this world.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
So, for the first question...  
What is 5 + 73 + 750?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Ummm... 828?  
`Tag 3`  
**Nice Lady：**  
Correct. You have even mastered advanced addition.  
An excellent start.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
Even outside my lessons, during your time with those various girls,  
it seems you have been growing splendidly.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
Question two, then.  
Rupies are only used to make purchases at shops. True or false?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  False!  
`Tag 4`  
**Nice Lady：**  
Correct.  
Rupies, in other words, money, can also be used  
to trade with fellow citizens or as payment for services rendered.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
If you can understand this much, you should be fine.  
I give you a passing grade.

**Nice Lady：**  
Now, allow me to give you a special reward.  
I'm sure you will find it useful.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
It may be that even she has forgotten all about this.  
So as her friend, I will do what she could not.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
Your unique power as a Princess Knight...  
I will teach you the correct way to use it.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
Until now, you have been using it subconsciously,  
but from now on, you will be able to use it freely.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
First, draw your blade. Focus your mind...  
Yes. That's very good.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
Now, wish most strongly. Wish to help me or your friends.  
To come to their aid. Send them your feelings.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  (I want to help this nice lady... and everyone!  
`Tag 5`  
**Nice Lady：**  
...Perfect.  
I never dreamed that the day would come  
when I would receive your power myself.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
At any rate, this concludes our lessons.  
As such, this is farewell. You must not come here in the future.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  But there's still more I want to learn!  
`Tag 6`  
**Nice Lady：**  
You cannot expect others to teach you everything.  
You are a human in your own right.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
From today forward, you must experience things firsthand,  
think carefully, and understand for yourself.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
No matter what challenges await you,  
you must foster the strength to find your own answers.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
I know you can do this.  
After all, you are my student.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
...Is that clear?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  ...Yes.  
`Tag 7`  
**Nice Lady：**  
Such a good boy.  
 Now, go forth.  
To the companions who await you.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  See you later, nice lady!  
`Tag 8`  
**Nice Lady：**  
...Yes. Someday, perhaps.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
Starting tomorrow, there will be no need  
to host any guests besides Masaki here...  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
So, in that case...  
Guard. Can you hear me?  
  
**Woman：**  
\"You called, my mistress?\"  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
We are abandoning this facility.  
Let us move to a new location.  
  
**Woman：**  
\"Understood, my mistress. I will inform Masaki.\"  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
I suppose I should destroy these teaching materials  
along with this place.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
...It couldn't be.  
 Am I really feeling  
a sense of loneliness at his departure?  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
In his current state, he has no need for my help.  
  
**Nice Lady：**  
We failed to defeat you once before...  
So there is nothing you cannot achieve.  
  
**Narration：**  
Though her words would not reach {player},  
Neneka could not help but murmur a message of hope and promise.
