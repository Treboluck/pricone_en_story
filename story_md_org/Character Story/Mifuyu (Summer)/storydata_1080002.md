# Mifuyu (Summer) Episode 2
Mifuyu struggles to think of a new service with a unique differentiating factor. Inspired by seeing small fish nibbling people at the beach, she invents a new form of fish-based foot therapy. The successful enterprise leaves her satisfied.

**Narration：**  
With the immediate problem taken care of,  
Mifuyu finds herself at a loss for how to improve the resort further.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hmmm... The resort's meals are appealing now,  
but I feel like that's still not enough...  
Hmmm... hmmm...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
We need something special...  
To make people want to come back...  
Hmmm... hmmm...! Something that can only be found here...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh, good morning, {player}.  
Up early too, are you?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh? You saw I looked worried about something?  
I see... Seems I've embarrassed myself in front of my student.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Listen—it's about this resort.  
I think it needs...  
 Ehm... How do I put it into words?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I know. It needs to provide a proper \"summer experience\"!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ahh, you know... As a resort... Understand?  
It needs to be able to offer something people can't get anywhere else.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
And it should be an experience that people will want to discuss,  
so that they'll spread word of this resort back home.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
But... I'm not coming up with any great ideas.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh? Why are you grabbing my hand?  
H-hey, where are you taking me?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Whew... This breeze feels good. It's helping to clear my head...  
So that's what you were after. Well, thank you. I appreciate it.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Dipping my feet in the water and listening to the waves is so calming.  
There's just something about the ocean...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
It was a good move letting you drag me out here.  
Just sitting around worrying wasn't going to get me anywhere.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
We want to find an experience that's both fun and relaxing.  
An outing at a resort needs to be stimulating!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
If only we could help people to appreciate  
the wonders of the ocean somehow...  
Surely there must be some way...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Probably not.  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's sleep until an idea comes to us.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mifuyu：**  
You're denying the whole idea just like that?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
There is a way! I know there is! There has to be something.  
I'm not going to just give up!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Mifuyu：**  
That might work if we were planning to stay here indefinitely...  
But you don't want to hang around with me forever, do you?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ah... I didn't mean it like that, you understand?!  
I'm saying we have to think about producing actual results!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mifuyu：**  
*sigh*... If only a bright idea was just lying around somewhere...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You really care about this, huh.  
`Tag 4`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Of course I do. I won't settle for any less than number one.  
I want to turn this hotel...  
 no, this whole seaside getaway...  
into the perfect resort.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ha... Ahaha... Ehe... heheh... Ahahahaha!  
H-hey, stop...!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Is this the time to play silly tricks?  
Eheheh... Please, that's enough tickli— Ahahaha!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh? Wh-what?  
You weren't the one tickling my feet?!  
But then, who could have been...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
What's wrong? Why are you getting into the water?  
Is there something by my feet?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh...! It was these little transparent fish. There are so many of them...  
I couldn't even see them from up there.  
  
**Girl：**  
Aahhh! They nibbled my foot again!  
  
**Boy：**  
Oh, the Lickilick Fish? There's a lot of them today...  
  
**Girl：**  
Uh-huh. It makes me jump when they do it out of nowhere!  
But it actually feels kind of nice...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh... So these little guys are called Lickilick Fish.  
And they like to tickle people? Talk about miniature pranksters.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
A surprising yet pleasant sensation...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Of course...  
 This is it! I've got it!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hold on a moment—I'll be right back!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I'm back! I borrowed a net from those fishermen!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
What am I planning, you ask?  
I'm going to catch a whole bunch of these Lickilick Fish!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
And then, I'll create the foundation for a true summer experience!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh, I'm not planning to eat them, of course.  
In fact, if anything, they'll be the ones eating us.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
At any rate, these Lickilick Fish  
are going to give us the special experience we need!  
  
**Narration：**  
A few days later...  
  
**Woman：**  
No way~! This is crazy!  
  
**Man：**  
Ahahaha! It really tickles, but it feels so good too!  
  
**Woman：**  
And it cleans our feet, as well? This is the best!  
  
**Man：**  
We've got to tell everyone back in Landosol about this!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
The spa we opened right next to the hotel is proving quite popular!  
I knew this \"Lickilick Therapy\" would be a big hit!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Customers get to enjoy the unique tickling sensation of the fish  
while their feet are revitalized!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Making these themed plushies was a bright idea, too.  
The \"Mr. Licky\" character is selling like hotcakes,  
so I think he'll make a fine mascot for the whole resort!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
We're set to get plenty of word-of-mouth promotion...  
Everything's going exactly as I hoped!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Heheh. Speed is everything when doing business!  
When you hit on an idea, put it straight into practice!  
Don't you think that's the key to success?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
That's \"so like me\"?  
Heheh. Just what I like to hear from my student.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I'll have to keep up the good work in the future,  
to make sure you maintain that image of me.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Well then, we've done everything we need to for now,  
so shall we try it ourselves? This Lickilick Therapy, I mean.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Just dip your bare feet into the pool we've prepared,  
to clear up your skin and enjoy a lovely massage  
that improves your circulation!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Eheh... heheh... Ahahaha!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ooh...  
 Heeheehee... I'm still not used to...  
Aaahh! ...this sensation... Ahahaha!  
  
**Narration：**  
Tickled pink by the new therapy she had invented,  
Mifuyu's squeals rang out through the seaside air.
