## Subtitle: The Treasure You Gave Me
  
**Mifuyu：**  
It feels as though all sorts of people have been approaching me lately.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
People from that big firm calling me the \"Octoking Hunter,\"  
or just silently handing me business cards...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
It's as though I've become a minor celebrity.  
I'll have to be more careful how I act in public.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh? You think it's like a reward for everything I've done?  
Sometimes it feels more like the price of fame... But I see your point.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
At any rate, I'd much rather have a more concrete reward.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
For instance, you could give me...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ahhhh! N-no, it's nothing!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh? Hey, what's that glow approaching from the sea?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Urnghh...  
 It's so bright, I can't see...!

**Mifuyu：**  
Whew! I finally got some time off work!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
When you're working as a live-in holiday helper at a resort,  
free time is a rarity. Though the pay's good to match.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
It's been quite a while since I've been able to kick back and relax...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I know. I should find some little presents for my family.  
Do you want to help me look?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I'm sure there are plenty of gifts of nature just lying around.  
See—isn't this shell beautiful?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I doubt my older siblings would be interested,  
but to the little ones, this is real treasure.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hmmm... there aren't many shells to speak of around here, though.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Let's go and search around the rock pools.  
You never know, we might find a rare beauty!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ohhh dear... It's tricky to get a good foothold around here.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Whoa—a crab...!  
 Waaahh?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Owwww... I think I sprained my ankle trying to avoid that crab...  
I might not be able to explore these rocks any more...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hey, I'm sorry to ask this, but...  
Could you have a look around for some shells in my place?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'll bring back a whole bag full!  
**Choice: (2)**  I might need some encouragement...  
`Tag 1`  
**Mifuyu：**  
I-I appreciate your enthusiasm,  
but I don't need quite that many!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I'd rather you just choose a select few.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Encouragement? A-all right. How's this...?  
Go {player}! Go {player}! You can do it!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Umm... Was that encouraging enough for you?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Choice: (4)**  Leave it to me!  
`Tag 4`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Thank you. I'm counting on you, all right?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
He's wandered a long way off across the rocks...  
I hope he's okay.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh—he finally came back!  
 Hey, are you all right?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh? You spotted a really pretty shell out where the waves are rough?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh, I see. Well, if you were so impressed,  
I don't doubt it must be beautiful...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
...Huh?! You'll go and get it?!  
Wait—{player}?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
H-he ran off again...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I-is he really going to be all right?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
He won't get washed away by the waves, will he...?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Urgh... I can't stand this waiting... Please come back soon!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ah...!  
 Honestly... You took way too long!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Are you OK? You're not hurt, are you?  
Wait... Hey! Your foot is bleeding—

**Mifuyu：**  
Aaahh!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
S-sorry! I tripped over my own sprained ankle...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ah... U-umm... I, ah... I'm sorry.  
But you were taking so long to come back... I was worried...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
More to the point, look at your foot!  
Did you cut it on the sharp rocks?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  It's just a scratch.  
`Tag 5`  
![108000402.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/108000402.webp)  
**Mifuyu：**  
Even if it is, a scratch is still a wound!  
Take it lightly, and you'll open yourself up to nasty infections!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Anyway, um, listen.  
 I'm just... glad you're all right, and...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
No, that's not what I wanted to say at all.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Um...  
 Thank you for doing all this for me.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I was worried, but...  
Just seeing your face again has blown all that away.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh, is this it? The pretty shell you spotted?  
It certainly is beautiful... Could it be a pearl oyster?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh—the shell is opening, and I see something gleaming...  
Ahh! It's so bright!

**Ameth：**  
How was that?  
 A little present from yours truly!  
Did you have a nice dream?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I made that dream based on your and Mifuyu's memories,  
but your actions this time were interesting.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I have to say,  
you sure did put yourself out there!  
You acted like it was no big deal, but were you really OK?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Did you want to see her smile that badly? I see, I see!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Heheh. Once you wake up, why don't you try  
to get a smile out of our Mifuyu, too?  
I'm sure the results will be dazzling.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I hope you'll keep on supporting her as her devoted student.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, I'll see you around!  
  

---  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Mnhh... Nhhh... Whatever was that strange dream...?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh, you had the same dream, {player}?  
Wait, but that means...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
...?! F-forget about it! Forget the whole thing this instant!  
Urgh, this is so embarrassing...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh—that shell... It's the one you picked up  
when we were searching for ingredients, right?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh? You're giving it to me?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Wow... It feels like there's something inside.  
Could it be a pearl?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Really, you're such a little charmer sometimes.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
...Thank you. I'll keep it as a special treasure.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh? It's not like me to say that? You think so?  
I mean, it's a present from you, {player}.  
Of course I want to treasure it.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Heheh. You'll always be my number one student!  
  
**Narration：**  
And with those words, Mifuyu gave a beaming smile.
