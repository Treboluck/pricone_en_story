Mifuyu works to set up a new resort accommodation business. In search of ingredients, she defeats a legendary gourmet creature, the Octoking. By offering it to the chairman of a major firm, she secures a lucrative supply deal.
  
## Subtitle: To Revitalize a Resort
  
**Mifuyu：**  
We've got a new project at the Mercurius Foundation.  
We purchase foundering resorts at a low price,  
improve their business models, and restore them to profitability.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I've been placed in charge of the project.  
It's a lot of work, but I have to do what I can.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
So, let's go and see the resort we've signed a contract with!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Nice to meet you. I'm Mifuyu from the Mercurius Foundation.  
  
**Staff：**  
Oh! We've been expecting you.  
I really don't know how to thank the Mercurius Foundation enough...  
W-we're all counting on you!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
No need for that. We're looking forward to working with you.  
Now, to begin, could you give us a tour of the facilities?  
  
**Staff：**  
Of course, most gladly! Come right this way!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Good... It's pleasant and well-maintained!  
The staff members are bright and welcoming, too...  
Honestly, it's hard to see why this resort is struggling.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I suppose the reason must lie elsewhere...  
 I know.  
Excuse me! Could I try some of the food you serve to customers?  
  
**Staff：**  
Of course—as you wish! We'll prepare a meal at once.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
What kind of dish will it be, I wonder? I can't wait.  
  
**Staff：**  
Your meal is served, ma'am. Please enjoy.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Thank you very much. Well then, I suppose I'll dig right in.  
*munch* *munch* *munch*  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Mmm...? Hmmm... It's not exactly bad or anything,  
but it feels a little lacking...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
For a meal at a resort, it might be best to offer  
a higher level of catering.  
  
**Staff：**  
My apologies. We're aware that our meals could use improvement,  
but a major firm is restricting our ingredient supply,  
so there's little we can do...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
A \"major firm\"?  
  
**Staff：**  
Yes. They control the great majority of trade in this region.  
Their chairman is a famed gourmet,  
 but he only supplies high-quality  
ingredients to those who pay him large monetary tributes...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I see...  
 In that case, shall we fetch ingredients for you ourselves?  
  
**Staff：**  
H-heavens, no!  
If the firm caught wind of such a thing, they'd ruin us...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I don't think so!  
We can't let this firm monopolize a whole market,  
and I'm not about to yield to pressure.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Right—this calls for swift action.  
Come with me, {player}.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
All right! Let's gather some shellfish in these rock pools!  
  
We're after high-quality clams!  
 Try to pick out ones that look tasty.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh? That's a very pretty shell...  
Wait, could it possibly be a pearl oyster?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Incredible... I don't think I've ever seen such a fine specimen.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
It will make a wonderful souvenir, but it's not edible,  
so let's stick to looking for other types of clams, shall we?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hmm? That fishing boat out there is heading this way...  
  
**Chairman：**  
Hey, you! What's the big idea, fishing in these waters  
without an official license?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I see... So this is the firm we heard about.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I'm not sure I like your attitude.  
The ocean and the resources it provides  
are nobody's exclusive property to claim.  
  
**Chairman：**  
What did you say?!  
 You must not be from around here.  
Somebody needs to teach you how things are done in these parts.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hmph. If that's how you want it, I'm quite prepared to—  
  
**Firm Employee：**  
I-it's here! It's the big one... The Octoking has appeared!  
  
**Chairman：**  
Are you sure?!  
 All right, men, let's take it down!  
Sorry, miss. We'll have to deal with you another time.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hey—wait!  
Th... they sailed right back out to sea.  
What was that all about? An \"Octoking\"?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh... I see it now.  
That does look like an octopus, but a monstrous one of incredible size.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ah—it's assaulting the boat!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I'm not sure I like their chances.  
We should sail out there and see if they need help!  
  
**Chairman：**  
Launch all weapons and offensive magic!  
Show the beast we've got firepower!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
They're equipped with an impressive array of weapons...  
But I don't think it's enough.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Chairman：**  
Wha—?! It deflected every shot?!  
  
**Firm Employee：**  
Waaaaghh! It's attacking in retaliation! Run for it!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRUOOOGGGHHH!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ahhh...! Their vessel is in tatters!  
Let's rescue them before they drown!  
  
**Chairman：**  
Dangitall! Who knew the beast was *this* powerful?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Here—grab on tight! You can leave the rest to us!  
  
**Chairman：**  
What are you saying?! You can't possibly fight that beast alone!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh, but I can. With a little help from my companion!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
{player}, can you use that power of yours  
to increase my strength for a moment?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Of course!  
**Choice: (2)**  How do I do that again...?  
`Tag 1`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Thank you! Give me as much as you can!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Wait, what?!  
 I know you're an amnesiac,  
but please don't forget that part!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I believe you were using your sword... You remember now?  
Then let's get back on track. I'm counting on you!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hahah, it's such a strange sensation...  
When you lend me a little of your strength,  
somehow I feel like I can defeat any foe!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Now, I'm coming for you! Octoking!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRUOOOOGGGHHH!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Aaahhh?!  
I guess its strength is as massive as its body!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Even so, it's no use if its attacks don't hit me!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRUOOOOGGGHHH!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Too slow! Is that really the best you can do?!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Haaahhh! You're mine!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRUOAAAOGGGHHH!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Whew... That's the end of that.  
It was a large monster, but its movements were slow,  
so it was no match for the two of our powers combined.  
  
**Chairman：**  
I can't believe it... You guys sure are tough.  
Thanks a whole bunch for protecting my crew.  
  
**Chairman：**  
That Octoking's been giving us hell for a long time.  
It eats up the fish before they can multiply,  
and attacks any fishing boats that stray too close.  
  
**Chairman：**  
We've made all sorts of attempts up until now  
to fish up the big brute, but to no avail. This time we stocked up  
on weapons to overpower it, but you saw how that went.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Could it be... All the tributes you've been demanding from the locals  
were actually to fund this operation?  
  
**Chairman：**  
Well, yeah. The ocean's a big place.  
Someone's gotta keep it in line, or chaos will rule the waves.  
  
**Chairman：**  
Still, this failure really hurt.  
Legendary ingredient or not, I never want to fight that thing again.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
\"Legendary ingredient\"?  
  
**Chairman：**  
Didn't you know? That's what they call the beast.  
I tasted a bite of Octoking meat once in my youth,  
  
and it was truly beyond belief...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I had no idea this creature was so sought-after.  
Perhaps we've actually found ourselves just the catch the resort needs...  
  
**Chairman：**  
H-hey... I've gotta ask. This octopus... could you let me have it?  
I'll apologize for all my rudeness! You can use these waters freely, too!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hmmmm... I don't know about that...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Heheh. Tell you what, Chairman—I *will* give you the octopus.  
But only if you agree to a few requests.  
  
**Chairman：**  
R-really?! Thank you kindly! Tell me, what is it you want?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I want you to become our business partner.  
For starters, can you guarantee you'll give us access  
to quality ingredients?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
And promise me that you won't levy any more excessive tributes.  
With the Octoking out of the picture,  
that should be no problem, right?  
  
**Chairman：**  
Of course! No trouble whatsoever!  
We're in your debt, young miss!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
And so we reached a rather lucrative agreement!  
You shouldn't have any trouble  
providing high-quality meals in the future.  
  
**Staff：**  
Wow, you had quite the adventure. Ah, but...  
If we'd kept the Octoking and used it to attract gourmet customers,  
our resort would have become popular in no time...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
You think so?  
In that scenario, once the octopus meat ran out,  
you'd be right back where you started.  
  
**Staff：**  
Ah... I see.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Why stake your fortune on a momentary opportunity  
when you could instead forge a business partnership  
that will benefit you for years to come?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Sounds like an efficient judgement!  
`Tag 4`  
**Mifuyu：**  
You think so too? I knew you would!  
Heheh... You always see right through me, {player}.  
It's a little embarrassing.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh? You only wish you could have tasted the octopus?  
Well, of course. It is known as a \"legendary ingredient,\" after all.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Heheh. I thought you might say that, so...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ta-da! I was rather curious to try it, too, so I kept a sample for myself!  
It's only a single tentacle, though.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Come on, let's cook it up, shall we?  
We can all dig in together!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so, together with all the resort's staff,  
Mifuyu and {player} enjoyed a celebratory banquet.
