# Kasumi Episode 5
A Shadow finally appears after what feels like an eternity, its appearance and voice identical to that of Kasumi's. Powered up by {player}, Kasumi is able to capture it, but it begins to talk what seems like nonsense.

**Kasumi：**  
Hm...  
This isn't exactly going as planned.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hanging around where Shadows spawn is all well and good,  
but it's been three whole days now.  
And here we are without any notable results.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Not a trace of a single Shadow.  
They really do live up to their name.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Either my theory was all wrong,  
or we're just having incredibly bad luck.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I guess it's about time to wrap things up here.  
If none appear by the end of today,  
then I'll have to rethink things.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Spending any more time here would just be a waste.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
So far the two of us have just been talking, playing games, and eating.  
That was fun in and of itself, of course.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But there's no denying that people are living in fear of  
Shadows right now.  
That's why I got this request in the first place.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
As such,  
it would be terrible of me to just keep dillydallying here.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'm a detective. A proud one, at that.  
It's my job to fulfill my client's desires.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Wait. Huh?  
Someone's standing over by the spawn point...  
Oh. It's just you.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I didn't think you'd be here this early.  
You sure must be motivated.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Didn't I tell you, though? Shadows are mostly spotted  
at night, so you only need to come by then.  
I'd rather not force the day shift on you as well.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I've been here the entire time, though,  
using that empty house over there as lodging.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Thankfully I've been able to get some sleep when you've been here,  
but it's admittedly not quite enough.  
I'm feeling a bit lightheaded.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I definitely won't last if this keeps up.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
So yeah. Let's make today the last...  
Huh? What's that?  
  
**Shadow：**  
...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Wait.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That's...  
That's a Shadow, isn't it?!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
At last!  
I knew it!  
My theory was on the mark!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Now to capture it, just as we planned!  
Get its attention for me!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You were targeted by one before, right?  
If we assume that they're targeting you,  
then there's no better bait.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Once it's distracted,  
I'll use one of my special tools to capture it!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Hello?  
Don't just stand there.  
Do you have a problem with the plan?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Do as she says.  
**Choice: (2)**  Keep standing there.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kasumi：**  
That's the spirit.  
Now then!  
Let's get this case solved!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kasumi：**  
Huh?  
What's wrong with you?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Shadows are generally said to not be that dangerous,  
but there are cases where they *have* attacked people!  
You can't afford to let your guard down!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kasumi：**  
All right!  
You stay here for now!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Actually,  
you realize it's dangerous to be standing  
that close to it in the first place, right?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I mean,  
we do know that they have no real will of their own...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And as such, I guess there's no issue in  
making it obvious that we were laying in wait, but still.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm?  
You actually mistook it for me?  
And you were about to call out to it?  
  
**Shadow：**  
...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You're right.  
It does bear a striking resemblance to me.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's almost like looking right into a mirror.  
And that's somewhat disturbing.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
However, we already knew that Shadows look like actual people.  
The reason itself is still a mystery,  
but this is something I already accounted for.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's sheer coincidence that this one resembles me.  
That's all there is to it.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Though we have spent the last few days here.  
That might have something to do with it.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's possible that they base their appearance on  
people who have been close to where they spawn.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Either way, now's not the time for that.  
We need to prioritize capturing it.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
So let's go!  
Power me up with that ability of yours!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
As you know, I'm more about brains than brawn!  
I can't fight as well as everyone else in Caon!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Mmm!  
Nice! I can feel power surging through me!  
Thanks a bunch! ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Now then, my shadowy friend!  
I hope you'll come quietly!  
  
**Shadow：**  
...  
  
**Shadow：**  
\"I'm sorry.\"  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...?!  
What was that?  
  
**Shadow：**  
\"I-I'm sorry.\"  
\"I'm sorry.\"  
\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\"  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Wh-what's it apologizing for?  
Actually, wait. This has to be what they meant  
about Shadows muttering nonsense, right?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Forget all that, though!  
Let's capture it! I'm sure that's the right choice!  
  
**Shadow：**  
\"I'm surprised. I figured I was the only detective here.\"  
\"Come now. Did you forget the rule we detectives live by?\"  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Sh-shut up!  
Don't use my voice!  
You're freaking me out!  
  
**Shadow：**  
\"I'm sorry.\"  
\"I'm so embarrassed.\"  
\"Please forget about that.\"  
  
**Shadow：**  
\"That's my ideal.\"
