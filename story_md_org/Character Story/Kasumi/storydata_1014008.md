## Subtitle: Dear Me
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hey!  
Sorry for calling you out so late,  
but we have an emergency on our hands!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'm kind of flustered,  
though,  
so I don't think I can explain it properly...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's about Kiri. Come on,  
it's probably better if I just show you.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Yeah.  
Something's wrong with her.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
She was gradually getting better at communicating,  
and seemed fine in general, so I let my guard down.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But she's still a Shadow.  
A being we know very little about.  
The way they function is still far beyond our grasp.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And I completely forgot about that.  
That was my mistake.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
This is something I could have accounted for, but didn't.  
I'm a failure as a detective.  
  
**Kiri：**  
...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Kiri!  
Are you okay?  
Do you recognize me?  
  
**Kiri：**  
\"De...ive...\"  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm.  
There's some sort of noise drowning out her voice.  
That's making it harder to make out what she says.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But that's not all. Look at her body.  
It's starting to fade away, isn't it?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Her outline is wavering, and her body's becoming dimmer.  
It's losing its mass in an attempt to disappear.  
Almost like an illusion, or the remnants of a dream.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But I'd like to avoid that, if at all possible.  
Our research can't stop here.  
Plus, I've started to become attached to her.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I don't want to let her go.  
I *can't* let her go.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hence why I brought you here.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I want you to use your ability on her.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I want you to power her up,  
like you've done for many before.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That ability of yours is special.  
Almost miracle-like. And only you can use it.  
Which means you're the only one I can rely on.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Shadows are an unstable existence.  
They can't hold their shape for too long after spawning.  
That's the conclusion I've reached by looking at the statistics.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And it explains why they're spotted so rarely.  
They disappear just as quickly as they appear.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Their existence is fickle.  
Much like the shadows they're named after.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But Kiri proved to be an exception to that rule.  
And I think I finally know the reason.  
It was you. Or that ability of yours, to be more specific.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You've been using it on her this entire time.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That's what's allowed her to remain in this world for so long.  
A miracle if there ever was one, truly.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Looking at it that way, everything adds up.  
Though it could just be wishful thinking on my part.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Meeting you, interacting with you, befriending you...  
That all had an effect on her, whether she knew it or not.  
And she received the effects of your ability in turn.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That's why she was able to live a long li—  
Well, that may not be the best way to put it. But her  
time here has been much longer in comparison to other Shadows.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That's what I want to believe. What I have to believe.  
Hence, I've no choice but to leave things in your hands.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Please.  
Save her.  
Save Kiri.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Urgh...  
It's that mysterious light again.  
Just what in the world is it?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I hate to sound sarcastic,  
but there's no end to these mysterious cases when you're involved.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Something unexpected is always going on.  
A detective just can't catch a break.

**Kasumi：**  
Hey, hey!  
Over here!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ehehe.  
Sorry about this.  
I feel a bit bad for calling you out so suddenly.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Knowing you, you probably had some other plans already.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Huh?  
Not really?  
You've got more free time than you know what to do with?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hehe...  
I guess the prime of your life turned out to be just as dull as mine.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The idea of finishing school for the day, then going out  
with friends is so nice though, isn't it? Shopping. Eating.  
Going to the arcade.  
All that good stuff.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But I don't have any friends to do that with,  
unfortunately.  
No one other than you.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
There's no one I can share my cool discoveries and whatnot with.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And that's, well...  
rather disheartening.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ehehe.  
Actually, one of those cool discoveries happened just today.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And I was just too excited to tell you about it.  
That's why I called you out. I was worried I'd be a nuisance,  
but thankfully that doesn't seem to be the case.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hee hee.  
Take a look.  
Do you remember who this is?  
  
**Kiri：**  
Meow! ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Whoa!  
Come on, Kiri. You can't just jump on him like that.  
You'll get his uniform covered in fur.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hehe.  
She seems as fond of you as ever, huh?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Hm?  
Wait. Don't tell me you can't remember.  
We solved a certain case the other day, didn't we?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
There was a huge commotion at school.  
The pet hut and flower bed were wrecked.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And thus we put on our detective caps, ready to investigate.  
After a while, we found out that a cat was responsible.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The climax was a bit... flat, to say the least.  
That was disappointing.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
They made a big fuss about the issues it caused and stuff,  
then tried to take it off to the animal shelter.  
In order to dispose of it, of course.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That caused us to panic, so we took it into our care.  
It'd be too sad to just let that happen,  
after all...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That's the kitty we have before us.  
You didn't forget, did you?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sorry. I don't recall any of that.  
**Choice: (2)**  And her name is... Kiri?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh, please.  
You're not going senile already, are you?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You need to keep your brain active, otherwise it'll just waste away.  
And there's no better way to do that than solving tough cases. That'll  
help build up your memory and reasoning skills in no time.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kasumi：**  
Indeed.  
It seems like her previous owner abandoned her.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
She had a collar on, and her name was written on it as well.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Huh?  
That's how I remember it at least,  
but there's no name written on the collar...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Weird...  
Am I just remembering wrong?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh well.  
If there's one thing I know for a fact, it's that her name is Kiri.  
That much is clear.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kasumi：**  
More importantly, though,  
I've made an incredible discovery.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Kiri's actually rather smart, you see.  
And if I hook her up to my mimi,  
she can even communicate a little bit.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Think of it like one of those toys that was popular a long time ago.  
You know, the ones that were advertised as a way  
of talking to cats and dogs.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It might sound like nonsense, but it's true.  
I experienced it firsthand.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Yeah.  
It's the same situation as that friend of yours.  
Lima, was it?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
She's an animal herself, but she can communicate by means  
of your mimi, right?  
Both cases are rather incredible.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
If she's tired, she'll say as such.  
If she's hungry, she'll ask for food.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's true. Really.  
Let me prove it to you.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Just listen. You'll be surprised.  
...Kiri? Say hello to him.  
  
**Kiri：**  
\"Hello.\"  
  
**Kiri：**  
\"It was an honor.\"  
\"I'm so glad to have been able to live.\"  
\"I never wanted to disappear.\"  
  
**Kiri：**  
\"I love the both of you a lot.\"  
\"That's why I didn't want to say goodbye.\"  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Huh?  
Th-that's not what I was expecting...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
This is weird.  
She really was talking properly earlier.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm...  
Or maybe the words just happened to line up?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Coincidences are bound to happen.  
Give a monkey a typewriter, and it may just end  
up replicating one of Shakespeare's works.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That's a common example, at the very least.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Well, that's embarrassing.  
Here I was all excited about a big discovery,  
but it turns out I was just getting ahead of myself.

**Kiri：**  
\"Detective.\"  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm?  
What is it?  
Waugh! Don't lick me on the cheek out of nowhere!  
  
**Kiri：**  
\"Thank you.\"  
\"Thank you for not wanting to part ways with me.\"  
\"Thank you for loving, caring about me.\"  
  
**Kiri：**  
\"Thank you acknowledging me as a person.\"  
  
**Kasumi：**  
H-Hm...  
I know I registered my voice data for her to use, but, well...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It almost feels like I'm being spoken to by myself.  
It's a pretty odd feeling, honestly.  
Especially considering she's not making much sense...  
  
![101400802.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/101400802.webp)  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh well, though.  
Kiri was on the verge of being disposed of.  
And through our actions, now she gets to live.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That makes the detective work all worth it.  
Doesn't it? ♪

`image display end`  
**Ameth：**  
And there we have it. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
First and foremost, let me apologize.  
I'm not exactly an omnipotent god.  
There are certain things I just can't do.  
  
**Ameth：**  
In this case, I'm talking about Kiri.  
She's going to disappear soon.  
Nothing I can do will change that.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Shadows are originally bugs brought  
about by the reconstruction of this world.  
  
**Ameth：**  
They're a flaw in the system that shouldn't exist,  
destined to be erased by said system's self-preservation process.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Maybe I should compare it to the human body.  
Think of them as a foreign substance that shouldn't be there.  
  
**Ameth：**  
A virus, if you will.  
One that the immune system works to fight off.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, I guess that still makes little sense to you right now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That said, though,  
all isn't lost.  
The sense of self that she began to develop won't disappear.  
I used my power to store it away in a safe place.  
  
**Ameth：**  
More specifically,  
I've stored it within myself.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You'll be able to meet her again.  
The condition is that you or Kasumi need to be dreaming,  
but I can bring her out during those times now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The two of you found her.  
Raised her. Loved her.  
Almost like a child of sorts.  
It'd be far too tragic if this was the end, wouldn't it?  
  
**Ameth：**  
And in all honesty, Kiri and I are somewhat similar.  
Both of us sprouted emotions through a sudden turn of events.  
I can't help but relate to her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's only natural to not want her to disappear.  
Especially taking that into consideration.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's why I took the liberty of doing what I did.  
Not that I expect any thanks in return.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It was out of pure self-satisfaction.  
Nothing more, nothing less.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Either way,  
your Princess Knight abilities won't help alleviate the situation.  
They'll just delay the inevitable.  
  
**Ameth：**  
No matter what you do,  
Kiri only has a few days left in her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Keep that in mind.  
I mean it.  
Give her a big smile and a proper farewell, at the very least.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I wanted to do the same for you back then.  
But I couldn't.  
I still regret that to this day, if I'm being honest.

**Kasumi：**  
M-mmm...  
H-huh?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I... I guess I fell asleep?  
I had a rather strange dream, too.  
It filled me with both happiness and sadness.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh. He's asleep as well.  
Hey. Wake up.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Do you know anything about that strange light just now?  
Fill me in if you do.  
  
**Kiri：**  
...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Kiri!  
A-are you okay?  
  
**Kiri：**  
...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Sh-she's not responding.  
And she's gradually fading away, too.  
Kiri... Are you going to disappear?  
  
**Kiri：**  
...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Kiri?  
You just smiled, didn't you?  
But why?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh, Kiri...  
Your existence has been nothing but a mystery to me,  
ever since we met...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The yin to my yang.  
My shadow, in more ways than one.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I've lived my life acting out the part of the detectives I admired.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But that was never an attempt to discard my weak, pathetic self.  
Not by any means.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You're me. And I'm you.  
So please, Kiri.  
Don't disappear. I'm begging you.
