The captured Shadow is given the name \"Kiri,\" and turns out to be awfully talkative around {player}. As Kasumi and {player} form all sorts of theories, they gradually draw closer to the truth behind Shadows.

**Kasumi：**  
Hey there.  
Sorry for making you come all this way.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I need your help today as well, though.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Shadows are even more baffling than I anticipated. Ashamed as  
I am to admit it, I'm not making much progress.  
Hence why I need some of your knowledge.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hehe.  
I guess being here must make you feel uncomfortable.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
This is a prison run by the government.  
But this ward is mostly reserved for  
major criminals and those charged with treason.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I helped solve a certain case during my solo days, you see.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I got to know one of the wardens during that time.  
Hence why I've been allowed to make use of it now.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
This *is* a public facility, though.  
I'd rather word not get out about me using it for private reasons.  
Don't forget that we detectives are sworn to secrecy.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Anyway,  
I've been using this place to keep watch  
on the Shadow we caught the other day.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Speaking of,  
thanks for your help back then.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Things went according to plan,  
which is all well and good.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But this is an opportunity we can't afford to waste.  
I've been taking extra care to make sure our Shadow friend doesn't escape.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Not only have I asked the warden I just mentioned to  
help keep watch,  
I've also deployed a barrier for good measure.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Of course, this is a prison.  
Security measures are already tight.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But Shadows are still beyond our comprehension.  
This one could slip away through some unknown means.  
Which is all the more reason to work as fast as possible.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Up until now, I've been relying on specialists introduced  
to me by certain acquaintances...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But no luck so far, alas.  
I'd be lying if I said I'm not starting to feel the pressure.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I was convinced that capturing a Shadow  
would lead us right to our goal.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But if anything, that was the easy part.  
The real struggle's only just begun.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That said,  
the harder a case is,  
the more satisfying it is to get to the bottom of it.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hehe.  
How about you go come see the Shadow for yourself?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Racking your brain is important, but it's difficult to reach a  
conclusion without witnessing the real thing first.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hey, Kiri!  
There's someone I'd like you to meet.  
  
**Kiri：**  
...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Good morning.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hehe.  
It took a while,  
but she finally started being aware of my presence.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
She even responds if I talk to her now.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Though we're still a long way from proper communication, of course.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh, right.  
\"Kiri\" is her name.  
It's kind of a pain if she doesn't have one, you know?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And she looks just like me,  
so I'd rather avoid anything weird.  
Like \"Kasumi Two\"  
or \"Shadow Kasumi\" or whatever.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Something resembling a name was among all  
the nonsense she's been muttering,  
so I just based hers off of that.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Yup.  
I'd appreciate it if you called her Kiri, too.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Try to be as nice to her as possible for me,  
okay?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Technically it doesn't really matter,  
considering Shadows don't have any will of their own.  
I doubt she'd get mad.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But, well, the fact is that she looks exactly like me.  
I'd rather not take any extreme measures against her.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Just having her locked up here makes me  
a bit uncomfortable, if I'm being honest.  
  
**Kiri：**  
\"Good morning.\"  
  
**Kiri：**  
\"Thank you for the concern.\"  
\"I'm fine.\"  
\"You're so kind.\"  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...?  
That's... odd.  
Why's she so talkative now?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You're definitely the cause, considering the timing.  
But I don't understand *why* that's the case...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh well.  
Talk to her some more, will you?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Be kind to her.  
**Choice: (2)**  Shout at her.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kiri：**  
\"Ehehe! ♪\"  
\"That's such a funny thing to say.\"  
\"Let's talk some more.\"  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Whoa. She actually replied?  
Hm. Or maybe some phrases just happened to  
line up and make it sound like a reply.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Either way, she's definitely reacting to what you say.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I still can't say why that is,  
but this is an incredible discovery nonetheless.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
This investigation might just start going places.  
That's the feeling I get right now.

`Tag 2`  
**Kasumi：**  
Eeek?!  
I'd appreciate it if you didn't just shout without warning.  
  
**Kiri：**  
...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And look!  
She's so frightened she ran off into the corner!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Wait. Frightened?  
That's odd in and of itself.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
As we've already established,  
Shadows shouldn't be capable of emotions like that.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
They're not \"alive,\" so to speak. Or so people say.  
If that's the case, then they wouldn't know fear.  
That's a natural instinct we living beings are born with.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Shadows don't flinch, even if you attack them.  
They just repeat the same motions over and over.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That was the general assumption, at least.  
But Kiri's different.  
She expressed fear over you shouting at her.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Or maybe it was just another coincidence?  
Let's experiment some more.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kasumi：**  
Hey, Kiri.That's it. Good girl.  
Come on over here.  
  
**Kiri：**  
...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hmm...  
She won't listen to me, I guess.  
Mind trying it yourself?  
  
**Kiri：**  
\"Do you need something?\"  
\"Hopefully I can be of assistance.\"  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Wow. She really did come back over.  
But why does she listen to what you say?  
  
  
**Kasumi：**  
She makes it sound like the two of you are acquainted, too.  
That's another mystery.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Either way,  
just getting this much out of her is a major step forward.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
We should be able to uncover more about  
Shadows at this rate, so let's keep it up.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
First we investigate, then we hypothesize, then we verify.  
Repeating those steps is the key to reaching the truth.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'm relying on you here, my faithful assistant.  
Let's get to the bottom of this,  
once and for all.
