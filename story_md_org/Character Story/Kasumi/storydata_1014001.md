# Kasumi Episode 1
A flyer asking for an assistant to help with detective work leads {player} to Caon's guildhouse. There he meets Kasumi, whose investigations are going slowly due to working solo, and thus she formally recruits him to help.
  
## Subtitle: Now Hiring: A Detective's Assistant
  
**Kasumi：**  
*sigh*  
This investigation is going absolutely nowhere.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Not only are Shadow-related incidents on the rise, this is the first  
request I've had in a while that lets me do proper detective work. I got  
myself all fired up, but maybe my intuition's not what it used to be.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That,  
or Shadows are just much more of an enigma than I had anticipated.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh no. I'm starting to scare myself here.  
Horror stories aren't quite my thing.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh well.  
No sense in complaining.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I owe Caon a lot,  
so I'd rather work hard for their sake than sit around being useless.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Which means getting to the bottom of this case, one way or another.  
Time to go back to basics and ask around town.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Most people involved in Shadow sightings are left confused  
by what happened. And I'm not exactly the best at human interaction,  
so getting worthwhile info out of them is a struggle.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But I'll just have to try.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
After I have a nice morning coffee,  
of course. ♪  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Whoa?!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
C-can you *not* just waltz in without saying a word?!  
You scared the life out of me!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Um...  
I don't believe we've met.  
Do you have some business with Caon, perhaps?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Actually, wait.  
I'm a detective.  
This is my time to shine.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
We may not be acquainted, but a little deduction will lead me to the answer.  
And help wake me up in the process. ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm ready to be deduced.  
**Choice: (2)**  You just woke up? It's already afternoon, you know.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kasumi：**  
Uh, okay.  
Your excitement makes it a little awkward, you know.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Let's see...  
Oh. I do recognize your face, now that I think about it.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It was in one of these documents, I think...  
Hm. Hm?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hey! No peeking, please.  
These documents are strictly confidential.  
Understood?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh, be quiet.  
Shadows mostly appear at night,  
so that's when the bulk of my investigations are done.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
In other words,  
I'm adjusting my sleep pattern to my work.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
A model detective, aren't I?  
Heh.  
You'd be silly to assume that I merely slept in.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kasumi：**  
That aside, though...  
I've got the general gist of what's going on.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You're {player}, correct?  
I do recall seeing you around here and there.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The other members of Caon talk about you often.  
Rather happily,  
in fact.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Quite the popular fellow, aren't we?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
A kind and all-around good guy. That's what I've heard about you.  
It's a detective's duty to approach everything from an  
objective standpoint, but you certainly don't strike me as a bad person.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hehe. At any rate,  
I should introduce myself, shouldn't I?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's a person's natural instinct to fear the unknown,  
after all.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'm Kasumi, a member of Caon.  
I used to work alone,  
but certain circumstances led to me joining this guild.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I previously worked as a detective, solving all manners  
of cases around town. Even as a member of Caon,  
though, I'm generally more of the brains over brawn type.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You'll find me doing investigative work out in town more often than not,  
which explains why we haven't bumped into each other before.  
Anyway,  
it's a pleasure.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm? Hm...  
That's a flyer you've got there, isn't it?  
It looks awfully familiar.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ahh.  
I knew it.  
I posted these over town when I was still working solo.  
My way of trying to recruit an assistant.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'm not sure where you found that,  
but it sure takes me back.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
There's only so much you can do when you're solo.  
If I was going to make more progress, I needed an assistant.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That's not an issue now that I'm a member of Caon, of course.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
H-huh?  
You look awfully crestfallen.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ahh. You're looking for part-time work, are you?  
And you saw that flyer and figured it  
was time to become a detective's assistant.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You asked around about where to find me,  
and that led you here to Caon's guildhouse.  
I see.  
Now it all makes sense.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
What should I do?  
It's not like the current investigation is going well anyway...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Not to mention,  
everyone else in Caon is busy right now.  
I could definitely do with an assistant.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
He doesn't seem like a bad person, either,  
so it might just be worth it.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Well, my friend,  
your timing couldn't have been better.  
I was just thinking about doing another recruiting drive.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
If you're serious about it,  
then what say we become partners?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh.  
As for your pay,  
I'll take it out of my own.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That said, I'm still a newcomer here myself.  
I can't promise you too much,  
especially compared to other jobs.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Are you still okay with that?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Thank you.  
I would very much appreciate it if you started immediately.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
How about some coffee first, though?  
I need some time to explain everything, after all.  
About this dreadful case that we'll be solving together.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hehe.  
I really look forward to working with you,  
my faithful assistant. ♪
