## Subtitle: In Search of a Shadow
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hehe.  
Let's begin the investigation, shall we?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Indeed. We've been asked to look into the mysterious happenings  
around town lately.  
Those involving Shadows, to be precise.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It was none other than the Sarendia Orphanage  
that requested us to do so.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The children there are terrified, so ideally we'll be able to solve the case.  
But if that's not possible, then they at least want to  
understand the cause behind the Shadows' sudden appearance.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Working to protect the smiles of children.  
Now that's truly a job worth doing.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
There's a little issue, however, though it pains me to admit it.  
You see, we know next to nothing about Shadows at the moment.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And that's after countless hours of investigating,  
each and every day.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
There are no similar cases in the past to refer to,  
either.  
It's entirely unprecedented. Beyond comprehension, even.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You might not be familiar with the details, though, so allow me to explain.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Shadows are mysterious entities that have been appearing lately. But  
only in Landosol, oddly enough.Though they're being labeled as a type  
of monster,  
there's much room for doubt about the truth behind that.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
What's more, they tend to appear and be spotted at night,  
leading others to speculate that they're a form of ghost.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Some brave souls even engaged them in combat,  
but the Shadows barely put up a fight.  
Their presence feels exactly as their name implies.

**Kasumi：**  
To top it all off,  
they take the form of other people.  
Namely acquaintances of those who spot them.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The resemblance is striking, too.  
Enough so that you wouldn't notice they're imposters at a glance.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But if you look close enough, you'll see that something's off.  
The uncanny gleam in their eyes, the strange fog surrounding them...  
Not to mention their blurry outline.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Plus, they repeat the same actions over and over,  
all while muttering nonsense.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
As it stands,  
we can assume they possess no real intellect.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Which renders them harmless,  
if you ask me.

**Kasumi：**  
No denying that they're eerie, at least.  
And some of them have attacked other people.  
Leaving them be is a bit too dangerous.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ah, yes.  
You've come face to face with one before.  
You even fought with it, correct?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That's one of the reasons I chose you as my assistant.  
Among other things,  
of course.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Unlike you, I haven't come into close contact with one myself.  
I've only caught a glimpse from a distance.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Could you share the details of your experience with me?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
This is a rather vague question,  
but what were your impressions of it?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm not that sure.  
**Choice: (2)**  I was terrified.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm.  
That doesn't help much,  
but I appreciate the honesty.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh, don't worry. I'm not holding it against you.  
If anything, I don't expect anyone to  
remain composed after being attacked by a Shadow.

`Tag 2`  
**Kasumi：**  
I can't blame you.  
Almost everyone that's come across a Shadow has said the same.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
They seem to cause innate fear in those who see them,  
though the details as to why are still a mystery.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
If I were to make an assumption,  
I would say that their presence alone eats away at people's minds.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's possible that a special type of magic permeates from them.  
One designed to disturb and instill fear.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kasumi：**  
Anyway,  
there are very few cases of Shadows attacking people.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
As we've established, they have no real will of their own.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But you just happen to be one of those few cases.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
We've yet to uncover the logic behind why they attack,  
but there's every chance that you'll be targeted again.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hehe.  
I'll admit, I do feel a tad remorseful about using you as bait...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But at the same time,  
part of me is hoping it'll happen again.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
There's little for us to do without encountering the real thing, after all.  
I can create all the theories I want, but as it stands,  
they're going to remain as just that.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
At any rate,  
catching one would be ideal.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I realize that's not the easiest task,  
considering they fade away when attacked.  
But I've thought that through.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You see this bottle here?  
I've imbued some of my magic into it,  
which should allow us to trap a Shadow within it.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That'll allow me to do some proper research on them.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Of course, this entire plan rides on a Shadow actually appearing.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Until then, it's back to basics.  
Let's scout around town for information.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Together, of course.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ehehe.  
Almost feels like we're going on a date. ♪
