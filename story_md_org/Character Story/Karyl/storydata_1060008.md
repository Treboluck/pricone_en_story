**Karyl：**  
There, there... ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, quit moving about!  
Obey my orders, you little...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Uwhoa!  
How about *not* sneaking up on me for once?!  
Almost jumped outta my skin there!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Doesn't help that you've got the presence of a plastic bag, either!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?  
You called out to me first?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh...  
Sorry.  
Probably didn't hear you 'cause  
I was focusing so much.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I shouldn't have lashed out at you for that.  
  
**Karyl：**  
What's up, anyway?  
Did you need something from me?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm kinda in the middle of work here,  
so I don't have the time to entertain you.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh ho.  
Has our little knight gotten himself addicted to gambling?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I wouldn't be surprised, either. These monster races are  
proving to be super popular.  
They're held almost every day,  
but more and more people keep pouring in.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I guess the general entertainment business drought  
in Landosol helps. Which is part of Her Majesty's strict policies.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Far as I can tell, everyone's always feeling down  
'cause they don't have a way to relieve any stress.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I just hope that doesn't end up  
leading to an outbreak of riots or something.  
  
**Karyl：**  
If there's one thing Her Majesty sucks at,  
it's being able to understand the concerns of her subject.  
She always ignores any warnings about it, too.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh well.  
She can do as she pleases, for all I care.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Dunno why I'm bringing this up with you, actually.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Anyway. You might wanna keep your distance for now.  
I'm still in the middle of taming here,  
so you could end up getting hurt if I lose control of it.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yup!  
The boss was able to capture a new monster,  
so I'm in charge of taming it.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Part of the job and all that.  
  
**Karyl：**  
My main gig is still with the palace,  
but work's been sort of dry recently.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Seems like Her Majesty's planning something big,  
so she's in the preparation phase for that right now.  
  
**Karyl：**  
So yeah.  
If I've got the free time, then I might as well spend it here.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That said.  
I'm still a ways off from being able to control more advanced monsters.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Not for long, though.  
I'll work as hard as I need to make this work on any and all monsters.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Waugh?!  
H-hey, what's with the sudden headpats?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're moved by how of a hard worker I am?  
Urgh. I know you're older than me,  
but don't go treating me like a kid!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?  
Mushussus have a good sense of smell,  
so I can make it happy by exposing it to a nice fragrance?  
  
**Karyl：**  
When'd you become an expert  
on rare monsters?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh. So you've just been remembering  
that sorta unimportant info spontaneously, huh?  
Particularly about monsters and magic.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well.  
At least your memories are coming back.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You do have a point, actually.  
Other monsters get easier to control  
if I feed them something they like...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I think I know a spell or two  
that can generate a nice fragrance.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Lemme try it out.  
Thanks a lot for the advice, {player}. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm?  
Is that sandwich for me?  
Why?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey...  
Did you come all the way here just to bring me food and stuff?  
  
**Karyl：**  
W-why're you always so nice to me?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Like, I'm happy you are.  
It's just... I really don't deserve to be treated like that.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's even kind of cruel, in a way.  
Though you might not understand why.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Whoa?!  
Y-you're glowing again!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Urgh... Her Majesty told me to keep a close eye  
on {player} whenever this happens.  
  
**Karyl：**  
No way I can just sit by and watch when  
he's going through something like this, though!  
  

---  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Hm...  
Oh, there it is! ♪  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Man, though. That sure took some searching.  
Ain't gonna find niche magazines like this  
around where I live.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Only had to go check about every  
single store that's ever existed.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
How come none of the regular bookstores had it, though?  
Never figured I'd hit the jackpot in a store for anime-related stuff.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Good thing I decided to check, though.  
I almost skipped it entirely.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
I guess it makes sense,  
considering she's Astrum's developer...  
  
**Kiruya：**  
If anyone's going to be interested in her, it's people playing the game.  
That'd explain why the magazine's  
bundled with a strategy guide and stuff, too.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
How's the price looking...  
Oof. That's expensive.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
It's not really a magazine for the general public,  
so I guess they bumped up the price  
to make up for lower sales.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Ugh.  
Nothing worse in this world than capitalist scum.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
One, two, three...  
Awesome. I can barely just afford it.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Actually, wait.  
Then I won't have enough money to get home.  
And walking it from here isn't exactly an option...

**Kiruya：**  
Waugh?!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Holy crap, dude!  
T-tap me out of the blue like that again and I'm gonna kill you!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
What's the deal?  
You better not accuse me of shoplifting,  
'cause I was gonna pay for that!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Wait, you're not a staff member.  
You're, uhhh...  
{player}, was it?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Wh-what gives?  
I already paid you back the other day!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Which means we're back to being strangers.  
So get lost!  
Pronto!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Actually.  
Were you looking for this magazine as well?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
If you were, then tough luck.  
Finders keepers! I ain't handing it over!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Oh, you weren't?  
You just thought you'd say hi since we're acquainted?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Look. We haven't even met a handful of times,  
so don't act like we're all buddy-buddy!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Hm?  
I've been hogging up all the space in the magazine section?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Sorry. I'm outta here, anyway.  
Don't have any reason to hang around  
now that I've got my hands on this.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Oh. You're looking for Astrum Monthly?  
It's right here, so might as well grab it for you.  
There you go!

`image display end`  
**Kiruya：**  
Hmph...  
Surprised you're still playing that, to be honest.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
High-schoolers shouldn't be wasting  
their time on kiddy stuff like games.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
That's rich, coming from me?  
I quit playing it ages ago, my dude.  
Not like I was that invested in the first place, either.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It'd be nice if we could play together again, Karyl.  
**Choice: (2)**  Sure seemed like you were enjoying it.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kiruya：**  
Karyl?  
Ohh, right.  
That's the name I was using in Astrum.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Not by choice, though.  
I just typo'd my own name by accident.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Kiruya Momochi. That's my actual name.  
Kind of a wild typo, but well...  
  
**Kiruya：**  
I didn't want my mom to find me, so I typed it up in a panic.  
And that's how it ended up as Karyl.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
I was pretty fond of it though, not gonna lie.  
Not like my real name's that cute in the first place.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kiruya：**  
Urgh...  
Okay. It *was* fun.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Main issue was how much time those kinds of  
online games expect you to put into them, though.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Time I don't have,  
considering I've got studying and work as well.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
And the more time passed, the more stuff changed.  
It just got too hard to keep up with,  
so I kinda ended up dropping it in the end.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kiruya：**  
I'm not even a gamer or whatever in the first place.  
The fact that I picked it up at all is special.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
And even then,  
I only did it 'cause it's developed by the one and only Mana.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Wait, you don't know who that is?  
Hmm... I guess she *does* keep herself out of the public eye most of the time.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Take a look at this interview here.  
You see that photo attached? That's her.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
I was so desperate to read this interview that  
I searched high and low to find this bad boy.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
She's about as mysterious as they come.  
Getting info on her is a real struggle.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
This interview's one of the very few times  
she's actually allowed photos to be attached, too.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
What's that?  
Am I a fan of hers?  
Hmm... I dunno if that's the right word.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
...Take a look at her face, then at mine. Notice anything?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
They're kinda similar, right?  
No?  
Say they are, dammit!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Truth is, she might be a distant sibling of mine.  
Well, assuming all that nonsense by mom spouted is true.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
I want to believe it is, though.  
It'd mean a lot to me.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
She's the one shining ray of hope  
in this crappy life of mine.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Simplest way to put it is like,  
the excitement of knowing you're related to someone so above humanity.  
Does that make sense?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
...Hmph.  
Why am I even blurting this  
out to you in the first place?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Whatever.  
We're done here, so I'm gonna buy this magazine and head off.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Bye-bye, {player}.  
Probably for good, too.  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
And that's that. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hehe.  
Looks like she warmed up to you a little.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I genuinely thought she was going to give you  
blunt trauma to the head when the two of you first met.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Appearances aside,  
she's probably just like any other girl her age at heart.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The Karyl on \"this side\" sure gives  
me that impression, at least.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That aside, though.  
\"Mana\" is the last name I expected to hear in this context.  
Now I'm curious how the pieces connect.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I've got a few guesses,  
but they all leave me with a really bad feeling.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I mean... This is Mana Senri we're talking about.  
The one person whose existence you can't ignore.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The person responsible for destroying and rebuilding this world.  
Otherwise known as the Omniscient Kaiser of the Seven Crowns.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Now I'm really curious.  
I'm going to do some digging, so that's enough for today's dream.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'll make sure to let you  
know if I happen upon anything worthwhile.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Not like you'll remember much after waking up, though.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But something's bound to remain.  
Something that can help you  
out if things take a turn for the worse.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That said,  
we might be starting to run out of time.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'd get ready to say goodbye  
to my peaceful life, if I were you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Take care, {player}  
If I could do more than just warn you,  
then I absolutely would.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Don't forget, though.  
I'm on your side. I always have been, and always will be.  
  

---  
  
**Karyl：**  
There we go!  
Did you see that, {player}?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Mushussus are pretty advanced monsters,  
but it's obeying me without any issues!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I knew I could do it if I tried!  
I bet Her Majesty'll praise me as well... ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
{player}...?  
You okay?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Her Majesty told me that there's no harm  
done to you when you're having those weird dreams, but...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Want me to cast a healing spell on you, just in case?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Okay, for real. What's wrong with you?  
You're looking real intimidating right now.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't worry.  
I'm not sure what the deal is,  
but I *do* know that you're a good guy.  
  
**Karyl：**  
People like you can and should be happy.  
So yeah. It'll be fine.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hard work and effort will be rewarded.  
Even the most distant dreams can come true.  
I have and always will believe that.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I went through a lot of tough times, myself...  
But now I'm happy. For real.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That's just how the world works. I'm sure of it.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Anyone can grasp their own happiness  
if they work towards it and never give up.  
  
**Karyl：**  
And I mean anyone.  
Whether it be me, or whether it be you.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Right?  
Come on. Tell me you agree, {player}.  
Please.
