# Karyl Episode 10
Karyl picks up a lottery ticket with some massive winnings. Though she fantasizes about the luxurious life awaiting her, said ticket turns out to be counterfeit. She accepts that the happiness she desires can't be bought with money, but also realizes that Her Highness wasn't involved in her brief fantasies.

**Narration：**  
Having finished up her work at the palace,  
Karyl takes a stroll through Landosol.  
  
**Karyl：**  
There's still plenty of time left until the sun sets.  
Maybe I'll go do some monster taming. Not like I've got anything else to do.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Except, well... I kind of blew the race course to bits.  
It'd feel really awkward to go back after that.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But that's {player}'s fault in the first place.  
He's the one that broke free from my control...  
Actually, guess that was my fault.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hi there.  
`Tag 1`  
**Karyl：**  
Eeek?! You again, {player}?!  
I swear to Ameth, you really need to quit doing that.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm? You didn't mean to?  
Whatever you say. I was in the middle of thinking myself,  
so I guess I'll forgive you.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Man, you still look as clueless as ever.  
Seems like you really don't remember anything from last time we met.  
  
**Karyl：**  
?  
Hey, {player}.  
There's something on your back.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Looks like a scrap of paper. The wind must have blown it onto you.  
Lemme take it off for you.  
  
**Karyl：**  
What is this, anyway?  
A lottery ticket?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It might be a winning ticket.  
`Tag 2`  
**Karyl：**  
As if, dumbo.  
That'd be way too convenient.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's a dud for sure.  
Think about it. Would anyone really throw away their winning ticket?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait up! Where are you going?  
You're gonna check the board?  
Argh. You really don't need to bother with tha—  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait. I-it really is a winning ticket?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
No way... You gotta be kidding me?! For real?!  
One billion rupies for first prize?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
.........  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oops. That's no good.  
I spaced out trying to figure out how many zeroes are in a billion.  
  
**Karyl：**  
{player}! You've hit the jackpot, sure!  
But I'm the one who found that ticket,  
so I think I have a right to the money, too!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You can have all of it.  
**Choice: (4)**  I want my share, too.  
`Tag 3`  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-whoa! You're way too nice!  
I'm not pure evil, though.  
I'm willing to split it, so you better thank me.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Karyl：**  
You sure love money a lot for someone with amnesia.  
Sure. We can split the winnings!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Karyl：**  
Ahh, man! Who'd have thunk it?  
You pick up a piece of paper, then suddenly you're a billionaire!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Forget going to work!  
Let's go get this exchanged!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, hey! Look at those clothes!  
They're part of one of Landosol's famous luxury brands.  
Totally superior to regular old clothes. ♪  
  
**Staff：**  
Welcome. That's quite the keen eye you have.  
Please take your time.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Sorry. We don't really have that much time to spare.  
I'm gonna buy all the clothes lined up over there  
once we come back,  
so keep them on hold for me!  
  
**Staff：**  
Huh? U-understood!  
Thank you very much!  
We look forward to you returning!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahaha. That's pretty much chump change for us now.  
It's great!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh. This is a restaurant specifically for nobles.  
The food smells delicious!  
Way better than monster dishes. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Adhering to what they consider proper manners is a pain,  
but getting used to eating at places like this might be fun.  
No doubt it'll taste great, at least.  
  
**Karyl：**  
And then... Oh, right! I want my own house!  
Proper shelter is one of life's biggest necessities, after all!  
  
**Karyl：**  
But where should I live?  
Nearby the palace sounds good!  
Waking up early in the morning is such a pain.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Buying a mansion and living there  
on my own sounds kind of boring, though.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I've got it! I'll let you, Pecorine and Koro  
live there too.  
We'll all have our own rooms.  
Sounds great, right?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'll even get a famous chef to work in the kitchen  
and have them fill Pecorine up until she's satisfied.  
We could all cook together sometimes as well.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  That sounds really fun.  
`Tag 6`  
**Karyl：**  
Right?  
Ahaha. We're on the same wavelength right now.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Spending a full day just having fun with big, stupid smiles on our faces.  
It's pretty trivial when you think about it...  
But I really like the idea.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You'll have to do everything I say, though. Owner's rights and all that.  
That means no monster food. None at all! Heh. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
All right! With that decided, let's get this ticket exchanged  
then go buy us a house right after. It's gonna be a party!  
  
**Woman：**  
My sincerest apologies. This ticket is counterfeit, you see.  
Thus your winnings are invalid.  
  
**Karyl：**  
C-counterfeit?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
No way... You gotta be kidding me?! For real?!  
The one billion rupies dream is dead?!  
  
**Woman：**  
Alas, the lottery itself was cancelled due to the number of  
counterfeit tickets spread by a certain crime syndicate.  
  
**Woman：**  
We've prepared a thousand rupies for those affected, however.  
Here you go.  
  
**Karyl：**  
A-a thousand rupies?  
That's, uh...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Argh!  
I can't even figure out the percentage of that compared to a billion rupies!  
  
**Karyl：**  
*siiigh*  
Talk about misfortune...  
  
**Karyl：**  
What the heck am I even doing?  
I should've just gone to work.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? You're sorry for not noticing?  
Not like it's you're fault or anything.  
I'm the one that got carried away.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Phew... Oh well, I guess.  
I had my fun while it lasted.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Just being able to think about the possibilities  
and how happy they would make me was nice.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahaha. Sorry.  
You probably don't even get what I'm going on about, do you?  
I've got my circumstances.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Besides, it's not like my real wish  
is something that can be granted with money...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I... I just realized something important.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I didn't even consider living together with Her Majesty.  
Why—  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Karyl?  
`Tag 7`  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? O-oh. I kind of spaced out there.  
...  
I was just thinking about how great it'd be to be rich.  
  
**Karyl：**  
All right. Here's the plan!  
We've got a thousand rupies, so let's go buy some grub!  
We'll eat the pain away!  
  
**Karyl：**  
There's no deep meaning to it.  
None at all.  
  
**Karyl：**  
There's nothing I desire more than Her Majesty, after all.  
  
**Narration：**  
Karyl took {player} off to the business district,  
a solemn look on her face.
