**Narration：**  
Having finished up her work at the palace, Karyl takes a stroll through Landosol.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Her Majesty seems a lot more interested in {player}  
than Pecorine these days.  
He was pretty much  
all she talked about just now, too.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I wasn't gonna track him today,  
but it might be a good idea to go for it now.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Who knows?  
Her Majesty might even praise me for a job well done.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Welcome!  
`Tag 1`  
**Karyl：**  
Eeek?!  
O-oh, it's just you!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I swear.  
Are you into making people jump or something?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Also, what're you even doing here?  
Huh? You're working part-time at this store?  
You really are a jack-of-all-trades, aren't you?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Boy, talk about lucky.  
Couldn't have wished  
for a better scenario.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh ho? You've got spellbooks and ancient tomes here...  
Pretty shifty ones, at that.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm. What's this?  
It says it's a magical crystal used for manipulation—  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait, what?! Manipulation?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
If that's the case,  
then it might be able to power up my Princess Knight ability!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm... It looks like any old magical crystal, though.  
I assume it's mainly used as a catalyst.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm sure Her Majesty will be overjoyed  
if my ability to control monsters improves!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Welp, I bought it.  
Kind of a big hit to my wallet, but it'll be worth it if it works.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm? Don't you still have work?  
Oh, right. The store's closing up for the day.  
  
**Karyl：**  
In that case, mind coming along with me for a bit?  
  
**Karyl：**  
There are plenty of monsters ready to be tamed at this race venue,  
so it's a pretty ideal place to test this crystal out.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey. You've seen me tame monsters before,  
so you should be able to tell ifthe crystal's having any effect or not.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Sit back and watch, okay?  
Here I go—  
  
**Karyl：**  
Now then! Give yourself up to me!  
Do my each and every bidding!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? Did I just hear a crack...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
AHHHHHH! It broke?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
No way! No freaking WAY!  
Piece of crap's just gonna break on me like that?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, you!  
You've got a lotta guts to sell me that junk!  
  
**Karyl：**  
{player}? Are you even listening?!  
Quit spacing out!  
You think you can dodge this bullet that easily?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I await your orders, Lady Karyl.  
`Tag 2`  
**Karyl：**  
Uh, Lady Karyl?  
You're gonna make me barf...  
Wait. D-don't tell me...?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, {player}.  
Praise me.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You're the cutest in all the land, Lady Karyl.  
**Choice: (4)**  You're the greatest mage in all the land, Lady Karyl.  
`Tag 3`  
**Karyl：**  
Th-the cutest? That's the best you can say about me?!  
Oh well. It does feel kind of nice...  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Karyl：**  
Heh. Of course I am. ♪  
Glad you finally realized!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Karyl：**  
I knew it.  
My Princess Knight ability got powered up.  
Now I'm controlling him... Not a mindless monster, but a person!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I can't believe it!  
This is amazing! I might just be a genius!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh!  
I can probably get all sorts of info out of him now!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, {player},  
What's your relationship with Her Majesty?  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're as plain as can be. You wouldn't hurt a fly.  
Why is she so wary of you?  
  
**Karyl：**  
He went silent.  
Which means he really doesn't know.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Actually, I guess he just doesn't remember anything at all.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yet somehow he's super popular with the ladies.  
Probably not as good as it sounds though.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm... No real point in controlling him if that's the case.  
Maybe I can get some interesting info out of him instead?  
For example...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I know {player}'s involved  with all sorts of girls,  
but what's his opinion on that whole situation?  
  
**Karyl：**  
He wouldn't happen to like one of them specifically, would he?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahaha. This'll be good for killing some time.  
Hey, {player}. Who do you—  
  
**Karyl：**  
...U-uh.  
Who do you...  
  
**Karyl：**  
What's the deal?  
Part of me doesn't want to ask him.  
  
**Karyl：**  
What if he says it's someone other than me?  
I think that's the issue...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait. Wh-why do I even care?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Sure, he's a good guy,  
but there's no special feelings between us or anything.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That goes without saying.  
After all, I...  
I don't deserve that in the first place...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah! That's right!  
Who cares if he doesn't like me!  
It won't get me down. Not one bit!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  What're you talking about?  
`Tag 6`  
**Karyl：**  
What am I talking about? Were you even...  
Whoa?! Hold up!  
S-since when did you go back to normal?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, right!  
I lost my concentration, which affected my control over you!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Your face is bright red.  
`Tag 7`  
**Karyl：**  
...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, {player}.  
Take a seat over there for me, will you?  
That's perfect. Now sit still.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Great. Now then. Allow me the pleasure of killing you dead, okay? ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'll eradicate every trace of your existence with my magic.  
Haaahhh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey! {player}!  
I told you to sit still!  
Sit still and drop dead for me! Double dead!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Aaaaaaghhh!  
  
**Narration：**  
Karyl launched an endless barrage of magic at {player},  
who could only flee in a panic.
