**Narration：**  
Karyl makes her way out of Landosol in order  
to avoid {player}.  
  
**Karyl：**  
*sigh* What am I even doing?  
I'm just wandering around pointlessly.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh well. There's no one else around,  
and it's handy for practicing my monster taming.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I don't want to see {player} right now.  
I'm not even sure how I should interact with him.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Speaking of which, here's the perfect target.  
Let's hope you make for some good practice.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Now then! Give yourself up to me!  
Do my each and every bidding!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? What's going on?  
My Princess Knight ability won't work on it!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Why?!  
Her Majesty'll scold me if she learns I can't control it properly!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Karyl!  
`Tag 1`  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?! {player}?!  
Wh-why are you here?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Mmm! This feeling... You powered me up, didn't you?  
I'll fire off some offensive magic, then! Haaahhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GREEOOOUGHHHH  
  
**Karyl：**  
Phew. That took me by surprise.  
What're you even doing here, anyway?  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're gathering magical crystals for work?  
I-is that so. You sure take on some weird jobs.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Argh! I came all the way out here because I  
didn't want to see you, but so much for that!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? Magical energy from a monster fossil around here  
cause other monsters in the area to become even nastier?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I see.  
That'd explain why I couldn't control that thing, then.  
What a relief.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Really, though. Monsters being affected by magical energy from fossils?  
That's as wild as it gets.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Mind explaining why you're working in such a dangerous area?  
...Because you were asked to?  
*sigh* I swear...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Fine, fine. I'll help you out.  
Let's gather up some magical crystals quick and get back to Landosol.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Phew. We've come pretty far up.  
Hey, look. There's a bunch of crystals here...  
Wh-what the?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
{player}! Look!  
That huge statue-like thing over there  
has to be the monster fossil you were talking about.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I can feel wicked energy pouring out from it.  
Only makes sense that it'd drive monsters wild.  
It even turns regular stones into magical crystals.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Here we go again.  
Guess we don't have time to be picking up those crystals.  
  
**Karyl：**  
{player}! Power me up!  
I'll finish this in a jiffy!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Mmm!  
Right, I'll end this in one go!  
Take this!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Karyl：**  
These things really are so pitiful!  
Imagine getting all twisted and controlled without even realizing it.  
  
**Karyl：**  
In fact, I think I might just help them out.  
Blowing that fossil to pieces should solve things!  
Haaahhh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Heh. ♪ Easy-peasy...  
Or... not?!  
How does a fossil manage to come out unscathed after I blast it with magic?!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Tch! You're just a dumb puppet!  
Are your master's orders that important?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh...  
A puppet...  
  
**Karyl：**  
What's even the difference between me and them?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I've been tracking {player} all this time.  
And why? Because Her Majesty said so.  
  
**Karyl：**  
He's pretty much the nicest,  
least dangerous guy ever, though...  
I don't want to become his enemy,  
but I don't have any choice in the end...  
  
**Karyl：**  
My feelings aren't important.  
There's no difference between me and these monsters.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But... But it's not like it's my fault!  
Her Majesty means everything to me!  
I can't survive if even she abandons me!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Karyl：**  
?!  
Shoot! I let my guard down!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Watch out!  
`Tag 2`  
**Karyl：**  
Eeeeee?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
O-ouch...  
Huh? I only fell over?  
How'd you fare, {player}—  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahhh?! H-hey! You're bleeding!  
Did you take the hit in my stead?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I swear! Every single time!  
How much of an idiot are you?!  
Why do you keep going so far for my sake?!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  That's what friends do.  
**Choice: (4)**  My body moved on its own.  
`Tag 3`  
**Karyl：**  
Friends?!  
Don't go risking your life for such a flimsy reason!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Karyl：**  
On its own? At least do that for someone who deserves it!  
Someone who isn't me...  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Karyl：**  
You really are an idiot, aren't you?  
Always honest, always trusting people.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Meanwhile I'm always lying, always bitter.  
Being with you really makes me feel pathetic.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But at the same time, I get the feeling that  
I might just be able to change.  
I know it's impossible, but I can't help but imagine it!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Argh! I'm pissed!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Pissed at those being controlled! Those doing the controlling!  
Pissed at myself for being no different!  
I'm gonna obliterate it all!  
  
**Karyl：**  
{player}!  
Power me up again!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You can't even imagine how pissed I am right now!  
So I'm gonna take it all out on this thing!  
Together with you!  
  

---  
  
**Karyl：**  
Mmm! I can feel it!  
You power's flowing right through me!  
  
**Karyl：**  
More than it ever has before, even!  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's not just that. Your feelings are, too!  
I can tell how much you're cheering me on!  
  
**Karyl：**  
The two of us are enemies.  
We shouldn't be allowed to be together.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But here, in this moment!  
I want to be with him!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Let me be with him!  
  
**Karyl：**  
This is my...  
No—this is our real power!  
And you're gonna eat all of it!  
  
**Karyl：**  
HAAAAAAHHHHHH!  
  

---  
  
**Karyl：**  
Welp. We kind of blew the entire area to bits.  
Even the monsters became collateral damage.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Heh. Hehe.  
Haha... Ahaha!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Man, that was awesome!  
I can't even remember the last time I felt this refreshed!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hahaha...  
Hah...  
Haha...  
  
**Karyl：**  
The fun's over, though.  
The next time I see him, it'll be as enemies.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I managed to make some good memories before that, though.  
That's more than enough for a useless tool like me—  
  
**Karyl：**  
Whoa?!Why're you getting so close all of a sudden?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? You were wondering why I went silent?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahaha. Honestly now.  
I really can't tell if you're sharp or dumb as bricks sometimes.  
  
**Karyl：**  
{player}.  
You're a good guy.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That side of you is...  
Well, um.  
It's not bad.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Your amnesia and stuff must make things real tough.  
And things'll probably get tougher from here on out, but...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Promise me that you'll make it through.  
Okay?  
  
**Karyl：**  
That, and...  
Someday... Whenever that may be.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Let's have ourselves another little adventure like this.  
  
**Narration：**  
Saying that, Karyl sped down the mountain,  
making sure she wasn't being followed.
