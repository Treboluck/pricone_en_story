## Subtitle: A Thrilling First Date
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey! How much longer are you gonna make me walk?  
My feet are getting sore here!  
  
**Karyl：**  
This place is super creepy, too...  
Mind explaining why you'd bring me somewhere this suspicious?  
Hey, are you listening?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Mm... That mega pervo from the other day  
made me never want to go back to Mysterion Woods.  
Which means I had to search for a new place instead.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Then {player} came along, telling me he had somewhere  
in mind. I kinda went along without thinking about it,  
but that might've been a mistake…  
  
**Karyl：**  
What if he's got me all figured out?  
And now he's planning on killing me  
off in a nice, secluded area?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Fair enough.  
All things said and done, we're enemies.  
  
**Karyl：**  
If that's how you wanna dance, then bring it on.  
This day was gonna come sooner or later!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...As if.  
This is {player} we're talking about, here.  
  
**Karyl：**  
If anything, I'm more worried about him being too kind  
for his own good.  
Only real issue is he doesn't talk much,  
so it's hard to tell what he's thinking.  
  
**Monster：**  
Welcome, welcome!  
The 24th edition of our monster racing competition will soon be underway! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Eeek...!  
Hey, you're that mega pervo from the other day!  
  
**Monster：**  
Ohhh! And you're the magician of verbal abuse!  
Please, cast another delightful spell on me!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Err, no?  
Seriously, how come you're walking about scot-free?  
Pervos like you should be locked up tight! Or even better, dead!  
  
**Monster：**  
Thank you for your services! ☆  
  
**Monster：**  
Anyway!  
I was indeed arrested,  
but they let me off quick since it was my first offense!  
  
**Monster：**  
And now I'm a changed man,  
making an honest living with an honest business!  
  
**Karyl：**  
They shoulda kept you locked up forever. And what's this  
\"honest business\" nonsense? I know for a fact it's a pervy living  
with a pervy business! How about I tie you up myself?  
  
**Monster：**  
Not at all! We're as honest as they come!  
We let monsters race and split the winnings between betters.  
Think of it like horse racing, but with monsters.  
  
**Monster：**  
It's a family-run and government-approved business. The only issue  
is that the monsters around here have become much more violent.  
Catching and training is proving to be difficult.  
  
**Monster：**  
But you, my queen. You have the ability to control monsters.  
That's why I called you here.  
To employ those fantastic services of yours!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait. Did you just call me \"my queen?\"  
A-and how come you know about my Princess Knight ability?  
Where'd you get that info?  
  
**Monster：**  
From him, of course!  
  
**Karyl：**  
And why are *you* best buds with the giga pervo?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ah, crap.  
I'm the one that spilled the beans, aren't I?  
Hmm... So you want me to catch and train monsters, basically?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I mean, that *would* be pretty ideal for training, yeah.  
I can barely move myself when I'm controlling them, though.  
Don't expect me to do riding duty as well.  
  
**Monster：**  
Worry not. We have professionals for that.  
Our business is rather profitable, you know.  
  
**Monster：**  
Everyone loves to bet, after all.  
But, well, that won't continue for long at this rate.  
  
**Monster：**  
So please!  
We would very much love to employ your services!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm. I'd rather not work with the hyper pervo... But this saves me  
the effort of finding somewhere new, so every now and then  
should be fine.  
Makes up for the allowance I never get, too.  
  
**Monster：**  
That sounds like a deal to me!  
For your first task, please abuse me as you see fit! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're not a monster!  
Just a hyper pervo in a suit!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Man, what am I getting myself into?  
Well, either way. Thanks.  
Not only did you find me a new place, you also got me a job.  
  
**Karyl：**  
How come you're so nice to me, anyway?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  If someone's struggling, then I'll help.  
**Choice: (2)**  Because we're friends.  
`Tag 1`  
**Karyl：**  
Huh.  
You sure are a nice dude, aren't you?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Why would Her Majesty even target someone as harmless as him...?  
Can't say for sure, but I'll obey her orders regardless.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's just... he's been so kind to me.  
And I'm gonna thank him by stabbing him in the back?  
Ugh... Just thinking about it's making me feel awful.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Karyl：**  
Since when?  
You're way too buddy-buddy for your own good.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Not that I mind...  
I always wanted friends closer to my own age.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Monster：**  
Oh! The next race is about to start!  
I'll explain the particulars about your work later,  
so feel free to enjoy the races for now. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well then.  
What do you wanna do?  
Should we go watch them?  
  
**Karyl：**  
You *did* put the time aside to come with me.  
And I'd prefer it if you didn't leave thinking that time spent with me  
was a waste, so might as well make the most out of it.

**Karyl：**  
Hey, they've even got food stalls.  
Lemme get you something as thanks for all the help.  
Then we'll be nice and even.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Come on, let's go!  
Wow. There's a lot more people than I thought there'd be.  
  
**Karyl：**  
How about we hold hands, just in case?  
Or, uh, I guess we're not close enough for that...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, look!  
Those monsters really are racing!  
This might actually be a lot of fun! Nice and thrilling! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
My feet are still dying after all that walking,  
Let's go sit down somewhere.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh. You bought some taiyaki already?  
You're quick on your feet, aren'tcha?  
  
**Karyl：**  
And hey. I *love* taiyaki.  
So give me a little bite.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahaha.  
It almost feel likes we're on a date... ♪
