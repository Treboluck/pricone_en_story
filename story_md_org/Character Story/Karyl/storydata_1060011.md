## Subtitle: A Helping Hand and a Delicious Burger
  
**Narration：**  
Karyl and {player} are  
enjoying food in the business district.  
  
**Karyl：**  
*munch, munch*  
Ahhh. That's the stuff. ♪  
Cheap, delicious and they don't hold back. This stall really is the best!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You have some, too.  
It'll be a waste if you let it get cold.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Phew. I'm feeling a lot calmer now that I've eaten.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I dunno why, but I've really been letting myself  
get caught up in his pace lately.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?  
Why're you so bright all of a sudden?  
Feels like I've seen this bef— Whoa?!  
  

---  
  
**Kiruya：**  
*sigh*  
God. I really don't wanna go to cram school.  
I just wanna skip it.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Mom'll flip her lid if they contact her about me  
not being there, though.  
She'll scream all sorts of nasty stuff at me.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
What's worse is that she'll start crying after she's done, too.  
She'll give me all sorts of crap about pouring money into my future,  
pretending it makes her a good person!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
All you care about is yourself and how society perceives you!  
You don't give a damn about my future!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Just thinking about it makes me sick!  
Dammit! Dammit all!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Ahh, man. I can't wait to be an adult. Then I'll finally be free.  
Once I'm free, I can get close to Mana as well.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hi there.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kiruya：**  
Waugh?!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Y-you again?!  
I'm seriously gonna kill you dead!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Huh? Did I drop my purse again?  
Get real, dude. As if I'd let that become a common occurrence.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
I've got it right... here...  
Huh? Wait.  
No way! Where is it?!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Oh, come on...  
Talk about misfortune...  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Uh...!  
Wh-what?! You want me to apologize for being hungry or something?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's get some burgers.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kiruya：**  
Yeah, no way. I'm not going for grub with you.  
Plus, you know I don't have my purse.  
I get the feeling you really want me to obliterate you.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Huh? It's your treat?  
I don't need your pity!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Waugh?!  
I-I said I don't need your pity!

**Kiruya：**  
*munch* *munch, munch*  
Mmm! Delish! ♪  
  
**Kiruya：**  
The hamburgers here really are better than the rest of the chain stores!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
The calories might be off the charts, but I can't get enough of them!  
*munch, munch* ♪  
  
**Kiruya：**  
...Oops. That's no good.  
Feels like I'm being treated like I'm some stray cat.

**Kiruya：**  
Oh, that reminds me.  
You're still playing Astrum, aren't you?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Do you ever get the chance to meet Mana while playing?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
I talked about how she might be a distant relative, right?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
I thought about it afterwards,  
but I dunno how I'd even get the opportunity to meet her in person.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
If it was in-game, though...  
Astrum might be my ticket. Or so I thought,  
but there's no way the developer would interact with regular players.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  It's not impossible.  
**Choice: (4)**  I'll tell you if I ever meet someone called Mana.  
`Tag 3`  
**Kiruya：**  
Huh?! Really?!  
Then do me a favor and tell me if you ever meet her, okay?!  
Promise!  
  
**Kiruya：**  
...Yeah, as if that'd ever happen.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Kiruya：**  
Fantastic. That's a promise, okay?  
Not that I'm expecting much.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Kiruya：**  
Hey.  
Mind if I ask why you even bother with me?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
I mean, you could have just not spoken to me today.  
Did I drop my purse? Sure.  
But that doesn't affect you in any way.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Hm? You couldn't just ignore me?  
Hmph. What a hypocrite.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
I know your deal.  
You're just being nice to others to make yourself feel good.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Uh, mind not making that expression at me?  
It makes you look real dumb.  
Surely you know what \"hypocrite\" means.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I'll help you as much as you need.  
`Tag 6`  
**Kiruya：**  
...!  
Y-you're just a regular old student.  
There's nothing special you can do.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Especially compared to Mana. You've got nothing,  
so quit acting like you're hot stuff.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
How do you you even expect me to respond when  
you go on and on about helping me, anyway?  
  
**Kiruya：**  
You don't know a thing about me.  
You really don't...  
  
**Kiruya：**  
So quit forcing yourself into my life...

`image display end`  
**Kiruya：**  
*sigh*  
I've stopped caring now that I'm full.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
I'm gonna go to cram school.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
I was gonna just skip it today,  
but I don't want Mom going off on me.  
Catch you later.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Oh, right.  
Before I go.  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Um. Well, I...  
  
**Kiruya：**  
Thanks,  
{player}.

**Ameth：**  
I-it happened!  
Karyl showed you her soft side!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Impressive stuff, my friend.  
Sometimes you really just need to keep hitting against that brick wall. ♪  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ahh, man! Even I got a little bit excited after seeing that.  
Good stuff all around.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hey.  
This is a simple assumption of mine, but...  
  
**Ameth：**  
I think that Karyl realizes her feelings  
towards Mana Senri won't ever yield anything.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Yet she has no choice but to remain attached to her.  
That's just how people are.  
  
**Ameth：**  
On the other hand, though, I also feel that  
the side of her you were able to draw out is real as can be.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It would be great if you could break  
her free from the cage she's imprisoned herself in.  
  
**Ameth：**  
If anyone can do that, it's you.

**Karyl：**  
Mn... mnhhh  
Huh? What just happened?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I remember a weird light...  
Oh. Looks like we were both dreaming.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I don't remember what the dream was about too well, but...  
I get the feeling {player} helped me...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah. Now I remember. He...  
He said he'd help me as much as I needed.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  You okay, Karyl?  
`Tag 7`  
**Karyl：**  
Wah?! L-looks like you came to as well.  
We both kind of spaced out.  
  
**Karyl：**  
......  
  
**Karyl：**  
Um... I, uh, have stuff to do, so...  
I'm gonna head off.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You should go home, too. Just don't get lost.  
Catch you later.  
  
**Karyl：**  
At least let me dream about Her Highness.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Why did that line have to come from him?  
Why couldn't it come from Her Highness instead?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Why does he have to keep tugging  
so relentlessly at my heartstrings?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Whenever he's kind to me, I...  
I just lose sight of everything...  
  
**Narration：**  
Karyl turned her back to {player}  
and set off, her each and every step conveying the weight on her heart.
