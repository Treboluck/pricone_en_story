# Karyl Episode 6
Karyl, having gained newfound confidence in her power, attempts to control a new breed of monster that {player} took on a search request for. This \"monster\" turns out to be a simple pervert in a suit, however, leading a furious Karyl to obliterate \"it\" with magic.

**Karyl：**  
Heh! ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
I've gotten a pretty good handle  
on this Princess Knight power now.  
All that practice and hard work paid off!  
  
**Karyl：**  
No surprise, though.  
I knew I could do it if I tried. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well. A handful of weaker monsters is still my limit,  
but at this rate I'll be able to handle a bunch of  
strong ones at the same time real soon.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yup! One step at a time and all that.  
Trying to control a bunch of strong monsters  
right from the get-go was my biggest mistake.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That just ended up making them go wild and ignore my orders.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Even worse, the sheer magic and life power needed to  
control something strong over a long period is enough  
to make me collapse.  
Gotta take it nice and slow. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
I should get way more efficient the more used to it I get, too!  
No more collapsing, no more losing control of a target!  
I'll be the veritable queen of monsters... ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
And then even Her Majesty will praise me...  
Which means I gotta practice even harder.  
No one cares about hard work if it doesn't leave good results.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm...?  
Hey, it's you!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Didn't I tell you not to come here anymore?  
What gives? Back on the hunt for dinner?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm. There've been rumors of a strange monster  
appearing in this forest, so you came to investigate?  
Well then. Didn't know you were taking on that sort of work too.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm... Rumors of a strange monster, huh?  
Wait a minute. What if it's one of the monsters I've been controlling?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Their movements *do* get pretty unnatural.  
A passerby might've noticed and got a real fright.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm gonna have to start training elsewhere if that's the case.  
Which sucks, considering the Mysterion Woods have such a  
good distribution of strong and weak monsters.  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRRRUOOOOOOGGGHHH...!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wha—! Aaaaaaghhh!  
H-huh?!  
A-a monster?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I was too caught in my own thoughts to notice!  
I've never seen a monster like this, either!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I-is it a new breed?  
It might be the one {player} was talking about!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Draw your sword.  
**Choice: (2)**  Run for the hills.  
`Tag 1`  
**Karyl：**  
{player}?!  
You're gonna fight that thing?  
It'll whoop your tail in two seconds flat!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait a minute...  
Don't tell me you're doing this to protect me?  
Oh, please! There's nothing cool about being an idiot!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Karyl：**  
Whoa! Don't run off without me!  
M-my legs legs've went all jelly on me!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wah!  
I never said you could hug me!  
You're, uh, surprisingly strong though.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm...  
Actually, this is the perfect time for me to shine!  
Now you're in for it. I'm gonna make you into my obedient little monster!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh?  
Err, uh. It's...  
magic.  
Yeah. I can use that sorta magic! Cool, right?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Just, uh, keep it between us.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Now then! Give yourself up to me!  
Do my each and every bidding!  
And call me Queen, while you're at it... ☆  
  
**Monster：**  
My queen!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Holy crap! It spoke?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hold up, hold up. It's advanced enough to speak our language?  
There's no way I can control something like that!  
Now what? Should I just spam magic until it dies?  
  
**Monster：**  
W-wait a minute!  
I'm no monster! I'm human!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You what? Oh...  
It *does* look like you're in costume.  
What's with you? Anyone could mistake you for the real deal  
considering how dark this forest gets!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Seriously. You scared one of the nine lives outta me.  
What's your deal, you freak?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ohh. I get it. You're some sorta bandit, aren't you?  
You dress up like that, scare people,  
then steal whatever they drop!  
  
**Monster：**  
Oh, please! Don't liken me to one of those lowlifes!  
I just... I get *really* excited whenever cute girls start  
screaming and panicking over seeing a monster!  
  
**Karyl：**  
So you're just a new breed of *pervo!*  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're even worse than a bandit!  
You creep! Wacko! Straight-up criminal!  
  
**Monster：**  
Harder! Stronger!  
If there's one thing I like more than screaming,  
it's being screamed at... ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
Eek?! How can one guy be way freakier  
than any bandit or monster?!  
I'm gonna send you into orbit! Nutjob!

**Monster：**  
The pleasure's all miiine...! ☆  
  
**Karyl：**  
*huff, huff*  
Wh-what the *heck* was with that?!  
I hope I never go through that again!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Urgh.  
I might be best off switching locations  
if turbo creeps like that're gonna keep popping up.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, {player}...  
Looks like that request of yours is all done and dusted.  
  
**Karyl：**  
No new breed of monsters here. Just a big old creep.  
Might as well report back to your boss or whatever.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's all thanks to me, too, so you better show some gratitude!  
Man, though.  
How come everything I do always ends up benefitting you?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I don't mean for it to, either!  
Really. Don't start telling yourself that I love helping you out.  
Or that I like you! 'Cause I definitely don't!
