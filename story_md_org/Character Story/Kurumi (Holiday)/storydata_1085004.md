**Narration：**  
On the morning of the play,  
everyone from the Sarendia Orphanage is  
making their way to the party venue.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ehehe! ♪  
Let's get goooiiing!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yesterday was a party! Today's a party!  
Every day's a party! I love this time of the year! ☆  
  
**Saren：**  
Hey now.  
There's still snow left over from yesterday.  
You'll fall over if you run around like that.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Don't worry, Mama Saren!  
I'm not as clumsy as Suzume! ♪  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wow! No need to go that far, Ayane.  
Do be careful though, okay?  
You don't want that lovely outfit getting dirty.  
  
**Saren：**  
She's right. There's no need to rush, so just pay attention  
while you're walking. We can't get there too early, otherwise we'll just  
get in the way while they're trying to prepare everything.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm? You're walking a bit too slow, Kurumi.  
Try not to get separated from us. The streets are really busy  
thanks to all the people traveling for New Year's.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
...  
  
**Saren：**  
Hey. You okay?  
You seem pretty out of it.  
  
**Saren：**  
Don't force yourself to take part in the play if you don't want to.  
We can ask someone else from the troupe to  
take your place if it comes to it.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh... N-no, I'm fine!  
It'd be a waste to give up the leading role!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I just... couldn't get much sleep last night, so I'm really tired.  
Just walking is a struggle. Sorry...  
  
**Saren：**  
Well then.  
How about we have {player}  
carry you to the venue?  
  
**Saren：**  
You're playing the role of a princess today, right?  
Then I can't think of a better way to arrive than  
being carried there like one.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Waugh?!  
Ehehe. That would be a big help, actually.  
I'm really, really tired. ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hey, no fair! I wanna be carried too!  
But he can't manage two of us,  
so I'll let Suzume carry me! ♪  
  
**Suzume：**  
Whoa! Don't just jump on me like that, Ayane.  
Pukichi's too heavy to carry with you, too!  
Ahhh! I-I'm gonna fall!  
  
**Saren：**  
Ahaha. You girls are a handful, you know that?  
I get that it's the holidays, but let's not get too excited here.  
That's how accidents happen.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh... {player}?  
Why are you shining like that?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wait. Why are the others not reacting?  
Am I the only one that can see it?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh no...  
It's making me even more tired... I can't stay awake anymore...  
  

---  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh, hello! ♪  
It's been a while!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Waugh?! Wh-why are you covering my mouth?  
Please don't touch me out of nowhere!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh. It's because we're in a library?  
Sorry.  
I didn't expect to see you here,  
so I got a little excited. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hm... We can't really talk here,  
but I'd like to chat some more. So, uhhh...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  How about we go to a cafe?  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's write notes to each other.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh...  
B-but that's more or less a date, isn't it?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Th-that's too much for me. I can't do it...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh? Notes?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh. You have a friend who doesn't like talking much, do you?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
And that's why you've been trying all sorts of things  
out to communicate with her?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
She uses ventriloquism and stuff,  
but it's hard to understand how she really feels...  
V-ventriloquism? She's rather... quirky, isn't she?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But I get it. She's the shy type, isn't she?  
Ehehe. We're kind of similar, then. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
What's her name?  
Ayane Hojo, huh?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I've never met her before.  
You really do know a lot of people, don't you?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehe. That reminds me, actually.  
We're allowed to talk in that room over there,  
so long as we keep it at a low volume.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh, but you probably aren't here to talk, are you?  
I won't force you to join me, then.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ahhh. You're here to study for a test?  
High school seems so tough. Especially when it's not compulsory.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
And you'll trail behind everyone if you don't put the effort in.  
That much I understand. It's the same at my theater troupe.  
You won't get any roles if you can't prove you're worth it.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
There's just so much competition. I couldn't get the  
lead role for our next play. I'd have been  
a princess, too, so I really wanted to do it.

**Kurumi：**  
It seemed like such a wonderful role. She meets a charming  
prince at a ball, where they whisper sweet nothings to each  
other and spend the night together. Dancing, of course. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
That's something I've always dreamed of,  
so I really wanted to play the role...  
But it's not just me. Plenty of other girls feel the same.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
That would have been motivation to do my best, though.  
I'd feel terrible if I got a role everyone wanted and  
didn't give it all I had.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ehehe.  
That said, I did get picked as an understudy for the role,  
just in case anything happens.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I figured I'd come here and read the original novel, just to  
prepare myself. If there's even a slight chance of me  
being able to perform, then I'd prefer to give it everything I have.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I'm always letting fear get the most of me in life.  
Always running, always crying.  
But I don't want to do that when I'm on stage.

**Kurumi：**  
Oh. Listen to me rambling on.  
Sorry about that. I'll get going now.  
I'm glad we got to talk, though. It was fun. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I'll be sure to get you a ticket the next time I'm performing,  
so please come and watch. You won't regret it.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Thank you again. Bye-bye.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh, right. It's still a little while off,  
but I don't know when I'll see you again,  
so I might as well say it now.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Happy holidays. From me to you. ♪  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Aaaand... that's all for now.  
Let me say it as well.  
Happy holidays, {player}. ♪  
  
**Ameth：**  
Think of what you just saw as something of a dream.  
Chances are you'll forget about it the second you wake up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ah, whatever. Let's forget the usual exposition.  
Not like I can be bothered with it today.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Look. I'd appreciate a break during the holidays too, you know.  
But there's no rest for the deities.  
Not that I'm a proper one or anything.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That, plus this felt like a good chance to help Kurumi out.  
She'd just fallen asleep, so showing her a dream that  
could cheer her up seemed like the right thing to do.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's already making strides \"over there\" when it comes to  
her theater work, but the same can't be said for  
\"over here.\" Though she also started a bit later here.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You've got a rising star with a number of leading roles  
under her belt on one side, and someone with barely  
any stage experience on the other side.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But they're two sides of the same coin.  
Kurumi can do it.  
She can be the star she wants to be.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She has the talent and the passion.  
And most importantly,  
she has the determination to work hard for it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
All she needs over here is a little push.  
Something that'll bring out her hidden potential.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's a future superstar, no doubt about it.  
So give her the support she needs, okay?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oops. She probably needs to rehearse before the show,  
so let's wrap things up here for today.  
Wouldn't want to oversleep on such an important day, would we?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hehe. I can't join in on the fun itself,  
but just watching you all enjoy the holidays is enough.  
So make sure you go all out for me, okay?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Just kidding. Do it at your own pace.  
It's all about making great memories together. ♪

**Kurumi：**  
...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wah?  
H-huh? When did I fall asleep?  
  
**Saren：**  
Hey!  
What're you two trailing behind for?  
Is something wrong?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Waugh! Sorry!  
Let's hurry up, otherwise we'll get left behind!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wah?  
You don't need to carry me, you know.  
I can walk on my own!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh...?  
You want me to save my energy for the play?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
E-ehehe...  
Thank you. I really appreciate your support.  
It'd be terrible of me to let you down, wouldn't it?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
So I won't.  
I'll give it everything I have.  
I'll make everyone proud.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I won't run. I won't cry.  
I'll face my role head-on,  
and play it to the best of my ability.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But for now... Can I ask you to spoil me, just a bit more? ♪
