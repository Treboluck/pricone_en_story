## Subtitle: A Little Selfish
  
**Ayane：**  
...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh!  
{player}!  
  
**Ayane：**  
What are you doing here? Out for a walk?  
Ooh, you're just wandering around?  
  
**Ayane：**  
So you can remember where things are?  
Yeah, I guess you just came to this town,  
so you wouldn't have the lay of the land yet!  
  
**Ayane：**  
I totally get it!  
When I first came to the Sarendia Orphanage,  
I spent a whole day just roaming around!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Going exploring  
is pretty fun, huh?  
  
**Ayane：**  
It can be a little nerve-wracking  
not knowing where anything is.  
I feel you.  
  
**Ayane：**  
If you want,  
I could show you around.  
Heh heh! I know this town better than you do, after all!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Hold on now, Ayane...  
Are you sure about this?  
Do you really have the time to be doing extra stuff?\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hmph.  
You be quiet, Pukichi.  
  
**Ayane：**  
It's completely okay.  
Mama Saren's the one who told me  
that I should help people in need!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Oh, did she?  
Fine, then.  
Do what you want, Ayane.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yup, I will!  
So, {player}, let's go  
for a walk together!  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'll show you all kinds of stuff!  
Although I don't have to  
if you think it'll be annoying...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  No way it'll be annoying.  
**Choice: (2)**  You don't have errands you need to do?  
`Tag 1`  
**Ayane：**  
Oh yeah?  
Yay, I'm glad.  
I'm not exactly the best at being considerate...  
  
**Ayane：**  
I tend to just do what I want  
without thinking about if it's going to annoy other people.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Because of that,  
I end up making Kurumi, my friend back at the Orphanage, cry a lot.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Mama Saren scolds me a lot about it too.  
I guess you could call it my bad habit.  
  
**Ayane：**  
But I really can't help it.  
I was raised spoiled.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Ayane：**  
Mmm...  
Not just yet.  
I still have some time.  
  
**Ayane：**  
It's all right.  
I'll definitely do what I've been told.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Don't worry.  
Let's go for a walk, {player}!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Ayane：**  
Hee hee.  
Do you  
wanna hold hands as we walk?  
  
**Ayane：**  
{player},  
is there anywhere you want to go?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh? Me? Um...  
Uh,  
so there's a fancy neighborhood just up ahead.  
And in the evening, I have an errand to run there.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Until then,  
I've got some time to kill.  
  
**Ayane：**  
See, we've just set off a bug bomb at the Orphanage.  
So I can't stay in my room, 'cause it's all smoky.  
It's an old building, so we have a lot of bugs to deal with.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I guess I'm still not great with bugs, after all.  
They're just so gross.  
  
**Ayane：**  
{player}, you don't mind bugs?  
Wow, that's amazing.  
  
**Ayane：**  
In that case, next time  
there's a bug in my room, would you squish it for me?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh wait...  
You don't live with me,  
so I guess that'd be kinda tough.  
  
**Ayane：**  
But you know, when a bug appears in the room,  
both me and Kurumi go into total panic mode.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I end up swinging my hammer blindly and hitting the wall,  
and it turns into a whole mess.  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Ayane,  
I really wish you'd stop using me as a flyswatter...\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"And besides,  
if you're too rambunctious,  
you'll get kicked out of the Orphanage.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'm always a good girl, so it's all right.  
It's all the bugs' fault anyway,  
for being so gross.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hmm?  
{player}, look! Look!  
They're selling sponge cakes at that stall over there!  
  
**Ayane：**  
They're shaped just like Pukichi!  
I wanna try one! {player}, would you buy me some?  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Hey now.  
Don't cause too much trouble for the kid.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"And you're supposed to be  
eating lunch at the mansion.  
You can't fill up on snacks, got it?\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
It's fine, it's fine.  
I just have to stop by  
the mansion for a bit in the evening.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'd rather eat sponge cakes now!  
Right now!  
  
**Ayane：**  
This'll be the last thing I ask,  
so please buy me some!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Pleaaase,  
{player}?
