**Ayane：**  
La la laaaa! ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Let's go, Pukichi! ♪  
We can go anywhere! La la laaaa! ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
{player}!  
Come here quick, I need you with me!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Why are you keeping a tiny bit of distance between us?  
I won't Pukichi Fullswing you again,  
so you don't need to be scared!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yeah, that's it, come here!  
Let's hold hands as we walk, hee hee!  
  
**Ayane：**  
But you know, I'm glad you're here.  
I had Pukichi with me and all,  
but I was still worried.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Everyone told me that  
it's dangerous outside the town,  
especially in the forest, so I shouldn't go near it.  
  
**Ayane：**  
But if I have you with me,  
I feel super reassured!  
La la laaaa! ♪  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Yeah.  
You've gotta protect Ayane with your life. Got it,  
kid?\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Look,  
even Pukichi says so!  
  
**Ayane：**  
You have to do what Pukichi says,  
'cause he's a bear!  
He's a scary, scary carnivore!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Hey now, don't scare the kid too much.  
I won't attack one of your friends.  
I'm a bear with a great sense of morality.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"But tell me, kid.  
Why were you in the forest?\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"It was kinda suspicious.  
This isn't  
the kinda place you just go to take a stroll, you know?\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yeah!  
There's beasts roaming all over outside town.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Especially in the forest!  
It's much scarier and riskier than other places!  
Which is why kids shouldn't go near it.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Me?  
I'm out here  
collecting ingredients for medicine!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Umm, see,  
I live at a place called  
the Sarendia Orphanage.  
  
**Ayane：**  
And I've got a friend there.  
Her name's Kurumi.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Kurumi just came to the Orphanage...  
She's not really used to living there yet, and she ended up getting sick.  
I think she caught a cold, so she needs medicine.  
  
**Ayane：**  
As for me, I guess I'm kind of a runaway...  
And my mom and dad never gave me any allowance,  
so I have no money to buy medicine.  
  
**Ayane：**  
But I'm really worried about Kurumi.  
So I snuck into Mama Saren's study  
and read a bunch of books on making medicine.  
  
**Ayane：**  
If I gather up the ingredients for a cold cure and process them,  
I can make the medicine myself!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Apparently, the plants I'll need grow in this forest.  
I'm going to pick them and take them home.  
That's why I came here, even though I know I shouldn't have.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Kurumi only has a cold,  
so she'll recover if she just rests...  
That's what Mama Saren said.  
  
**Ayane：**  
But she looks like she's really suffering,  
so I couldn't just sit by and watch.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'm older than her, so I'm like her big sis.  
And since we're living in the same orphanage... We're basically family.  
Family is really important to me.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hmm?  
What is it, {player}?  
Do you have something to say about that?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're amazing, Ayane.  
**Choice: (2)**  But what if you get hurt? The end doesn't justify the means.  
`Tag 1`  
**Ayane：**  
Heheh!  
Yeah, that's right, go ahead and praise me!  
I'm a good girl, aren't I?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Actually,  
Kurumi's mom and dad are \"Lost\" or something...  
That's what Mama Saren said.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I don't really know what that means.  
But basically, she doesn't have a family anymore.  
  
**Ayane：**  
So, that's why  
I'm gonna  
be her very own big sister.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Ayane：**  
The means...?  
Huh? Are you calling me mean?  
Don't say confusing things!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Were you trying to  
scold me or something?  
  
**Ayane：**  
I hate getting lectured!  
I'm not even in the wrong here!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Hey, hush for a moment.  
Aren't those bushes over there  
rustling?\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hmm?  
What's going on?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Wait... Is it a monster?  
Nooo, that's so scary!  
  
**Ayane：**  
But why?  
We haven't seen  
a single monster up 'til now...  
  
**Ayane：**  
A-anyway!  
Let's get out of here before it finds us, {player}!
