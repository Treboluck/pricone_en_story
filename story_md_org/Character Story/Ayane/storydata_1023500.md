Oh—there you are!  
Geez, how can you call yourself a gentleman  
if you keep a lady waiting all day?!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"...Uh, you were the one who showed up way too early  
'cause you couldn't wait to see him, Ayane.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
I-I could've waited easily!  
I'm just a good girl who makes extra sure to show up on time!  
...So anyway, what did you actually call me for?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Happy birthday!  
**Choice: (2)**  I brought a new outfit for Pukichi.  
**Choice: (3)**  Let's play together all day!

Huh...?!  
Wow, so you actually remembered...  
 Well, thanks!

What? You've been preparing a party for me at the Orphanage?

It must be one of your birthday presents for Ayane, huh?\"

But why would you suddenly want to...  
Huh? 'Cause it's my birthday today?

We should get everyone together

`Tag 4`  
**Ayane：**  
With that decided, you'd better carry me home on your shoulders!
