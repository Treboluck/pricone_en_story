**Ayane：**  
...  
*sigh*  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hmm?  
Oh, {player}!  
Good evening!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hee hee, I feel like I run into you all the time lately!  
Is your house around here?  
Or were you just out for a walk again?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Me?  
Oh, I just...  
had a little errand to run.  
  
**Ayane：**  
That's right.  
I had an errand like the one I was on when we met the other day,  
so I came out into town.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Normally,  
I don't really stray far from the Sarendia Orphanage.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I don't actually like  
to go wandering around outside that much.  
I like playing inside my room and stuff.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Mama Saren said, \"You have a lot of introverted hobbies.\"  
She often gets onto me  
and says that kids should play outside.  
  
**Ayane：**  
But I can't help it.  
Ever since I was little,  
I've spent a lot of time inside the house.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I don't even know  
how to play outside.  
  
**Ayane：**  
What about you?  
How do you play outside?  
Show me, please!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh, well,  
you just seemed a little bored,  
so I thought we could play together!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hmm?  
Oh,  
I'm already done with my errand...  
So I'm free to play.  
  
**Ayane：**  
You see,  
twice a week  
I have to go back home and visit my mom and dad.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Although  
I don't really want to see them.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You don't live with your parents?  
**Choice: (2)**  You don't get along with your parents?  
`Tag 1`  
**Ayane：**  
Nope.  
Didn't I tell you?  
I live at a place called the Sarendia Orphanage.  
  
**Ayane：**  
See,  
it's pretty much a place for kids with no families.  
  
**Ayane：**  
That said,  
it's not like  
my family's Lost like Kurumi's or anything...  
  
**Ayane：**  
I have a home,  
and I have parents.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Ayane：**  
It's not really like that...  
I love my mom and dad a whole lot.  
  
**Ayane：**  
But...  
There's something weird about them.  
It's hard to explain.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Ayane：**  
Hmm?  
Wait, {player}...  
Why do you look so concerned for me?  
  
**Ayane：**  
I-I'm fine, really!  
It's not like  
my home life is bad or anything!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Mom and Dad are really nice.  
They give me way more attention than before, too.  
I know they really care about me!  
  
**Ayane：**  
It's just that...  
When I see them,  
I get this weird feeling.  
  
**Ayane：**  
It feels like something's... off.  
Sometimes I just get so scared.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hee hee.  
I went to see the doctor,  
and apparently this happens a lot during puberty.  
  
**Ayane：**  
It feels like  
everyone around you is just... fake.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Like everyone's putting on an act,  
a performance to deceive you...  
  
**Ayane：**  
They said it happens a lot once you hit puberty  
and start feeling more independent.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I just have a bit of a strong case of that...  
That's what the doctor said.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Mom and Dad did nothing wrong.  
I'm just a little weird.  
  
**Ayane：**  
But  
no matter what I do,  
I end up getting the feeling that they aren't real...  
  
**Ayane：**  
It makes me scared, and I lash out at them.  
I shout at them, I throw fits...  
And I've run away from home lots of times.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I feel awful for treating Mom and Dad like that...  
which is why  
I'm living at the Sarendia Orphanage until I can calm down.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Kind of like I'm being hospitalized, I guess.  
Or more like I'm in rehab.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yeah. I come from a pretty high-class family,  
and they have ties to Mama Saren since she's  
part of the nobility too, apparently...  
  
**Ayane：**  
That's why  
Mama Saren's looking after me.  
  
**Ayane：**  
But  
if I stay at the Orphanage forever,  
I feel like I'll be imposing on Mama Saren, and on Mom and Dad too.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I've gotta get better.  
But it's pretty hard.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Sorry...  
This has nothing to do with you.  
  
**Ayane：**  
The sun's about to set,  
and if I'm late, Mama Saren'll be worried...  
So I'm going home now, 'kay?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hee hee.  
I feel kinda guilty when I think of Mom and Dad,  
but lately I've...  
  
**Ayane：**  
I've felt more at home  
at the Sarendia Orphanage than I ever did in my real home.
