**Ayane：**  
La la laaaa! ♪  
Let's go, Pukichi! ♪  
We can go anywhere! La la laaaa! ♪  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hee hee.  
{player}'s giving me a ride on his shoulders!  
That makes traveling easy peasy!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Landosol's just too big.  
It takes so much out of you just to get to where you wanna go.  
  
**Ayane：**  
And it's hard to navigate,  
so I get lost easily.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'm so glad I have you with me,  
{player}!  
Hee hee!  
  
**Ayane：**  
But  
{player}...  
Aren't we heavy?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Apart from me,  
Pukichi's a pretty hefty guy, isn't he?  
If he's too heavy, I can drag him along the ground.  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Hey, hey, hey.  
That treatment would be way too rough for me.  
Handle me with a little more care.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
I know, I know! I was just joking.  
Pukichi's my friend, and my family, too.  
He's like an extension of myself, so I always treat him carefully.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hmm?  
What is it, {player}?  
Do you have something you want to say?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Am I really too heavy?  
Should I walk on my own?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're not heavy.  
**Choice: (2)**  Don't worry. I'm big and strong.  
`Tag 1`  
**Ayane：**  
Really?  
Hang on, aren't you staggering a little?  
  
**Ayane：**  
If it's too hard on you,  
you really don't have to push yourself to carry us...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Ayane：**  
Wow, that's so cool!  
You're soooo strong and manly, {player}!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Heheh.  
In that case, you've gotta be a perfect gentleman!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Ayane：**  
Hmmm?  
What's wrong, {player}?  
You still look like you've got something on your mind.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh...  
You're wondering about Pukichi?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yeah.  
I get it—everyone reacts like that.  
When I'm talking to Pukichi, they make a weird face.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Do you  
think I'm weird too...?  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'm not weird? Really?  
Hee hee, I'm glad to hear that!  
Thanks, {player}!  
  
**Ayane：**  
You see,  
my mom and dad  
were always really busy with work.  
  
**Ayane：**  
So I was  
always left all alone  
in the house ever since I was little.  
  
**Ayane：**  
As for the other kids my age,  
I couldn't really fit in with them...  
  
**Ayane：**  
All I did was sit at home  
by myself and cry because of how lonely I was.  
  
**Ayane：**  
My dad was worried about me,  
so he got me Pukichi.  
  
**Ayane：**  
He bought him as a souvenir from some  
far-off country he went to on a business trip.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Thanks to that,  
I stopped feeling so lonely.  
Because I always had Pukichi there with me.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I finally had a friend who'd talk to me and  
play with me. I had a family.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Other people don't believe me...  
No, they make fun of me.  
  
**Ayane：**  
But Pukichi  
can really talk.  
He's alive and has a heart.  
  
**Ayane：**  
My dad told me  
he has a slightly unusual enchantment on him.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Which is why even though he's a super heavy weapon,  
Pukichi feels light as a feather to me.  
  
**Ayane：**  
That's not all.  
I'm the only one  
who can hear Pukichi's voice.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Although I normally speak what he's saying for him  
using a kind of ventriloquism.  
  
**Ayane：**  
He really talks...  
I can hear it.  
Do you believe me, {player}?  
  
**Ayane：**  
You won't make fun of me, or say I'm a weirdo  
who talks to the bear decoration on her weapon...  
and really just mutters to herself?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Sorry...  
I've just heard  
all that stuff so much.  
  
**Ayane：**  
But I want someone else besides me  
to believe that Pukichi has a soul.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Otherwise,  
I'm just a sad little girl who's so lonely  
she makes up imaginary friends...  
  
**Ayane：**  
And it feels like  
that would make Pukichi's soul disappear.  
  
**Ayane：**  
And I  
really don't want that.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh, whoops...  
It's already evening.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I've gotta get going.  
I have an errand to run.  
  
**Ayane：**  
{player}.  
Thanks for playing with me, chatting with me...  
No, just being my companion today.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I feel  
really, really warm all over now.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hm?  
Don't worry,  
you don't have to walk me home.  
  
**Ayane：**  
You already let me ride on your shoulders,  
which made things much easier for me.  
I'm not tired at all, so I can walk home on my own two feet.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yeah.  
So anyway,  
let's say goodbye here for today.  
  
**Ayane：**  
{player}.  
Whenever I feel lonely again,  
will you come and play with me?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Will you talk with me,  
and look at me,  
and make time for me?  
  
**Ayane：**  
You see,  
that's all I've ever wanted.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Yeah, it's a promise.  
Pinky swear, can't break it!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hee hee.  
Okay, I'm gonna go now.  
Thank you for today!  
  
**Ayane：**  
You're the sweetest.  
See you again, {player}!
