**Ayane：**  
Taaaaake that!  
Pukichi Fullswing!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Huh?  
I felt some sort of weird resistance just now!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Whoa! Someone's lying on the ground!  
I-I'm so sorry!  
Oh no, did my Pukichi Fullswing hit them?!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Oooh...  
You've gone and done it now, Ayane.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"A murderer at your young age. Things look bleak indeed.  
Poor you.  
I'll come visit you in prison every day.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
D-don't even joke about that!  
Pukichi, you're so mean sometimes!  
  
**Ayane：**  
A-are you all right?  
Wait, what?  
Is that... {player}?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Um, thank you...  
for bringing me back home the other day.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Thanks in part to you,  
Kurumi's cold is all better now,  
no need to worry!  
  
**Ayane：**  
But really, are you okay?  
Did my Pukichi Fullswing  
hit you?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Huh? You tried to dodge it and lost your balance and fell over?  
Really?  
You're not just lying to make me feel better?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Oh no, you skinned your knee.  
I've got some ointment, so I'll treat it for you.  
I'm really sorry, {player}...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hee hee.  
After what happened the other day, Mama Saren  
agreed to teach me about medicinal herbs.  
  
**Ayane：**  
See this ointment here?  
It was hard, but I made it myself.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'm still really bad at it,  
so it might not be all that effective...  
But maybe it'll make you feel better, at least?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Pain, pain,  
go away!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Gah?!  
W-why are you glowing?  
You're shiny all over!

**Ayane：**  
Waaaahhhh,  
waaaahhhh!  
  
**Ayane：**  
...*hic*  
  
**Ayane：**  
...  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Hey there, kid.  
You need something?  
Ayane's gonna be fine, so don't worry.\"  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are you okay? What's wrong?  
**Choice: (2)**  Ayane, you seem really different.  
`Tag 1`  
**Pukichi：**  
\"I told you, she's fine.  
Right, Ayane?\"  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Really?  
Ayane's always like this, though.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"You're the one  
who's acting different here, kiddo.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"  
Aren't you usually more cheerful,  
overly friendly,  
and full of too much energy?\"  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pukichi：**  
\"There we go.  
Looks like Ayane's  
calmed down a lot.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Sorry for worrying ya.  
She didn't fall and get hurt or anything like that, so rest at ease.  
She wasn't bullied by anyone either.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"You see,  
a wasp  
flew right in front of Ayane.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Oh, but it didn't sting her or anything. She's fine.  
It just startled her, and she got scared and burst into tears.  
She's not hurt anywhere, so relax.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"A long time ago,  
she got stung by a bee.  
I guess she still has some lingering trauma from that...\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"She really can't  
handle bugs. She's terrified of them.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"If a bug gets closer to her, she panics.  
We're talking a complete meltdown.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Pukichi Fullswing  
was originally a technique designed to drive bugs away, you know.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"She'd swing the bag she was carrying in a wide arc,  
chasing off the bug.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"That said, it does end up hitting anyone who happens to be nearby,  
causing all kinds of trouble...  
It's not a great habit to have, so I wish she'd fix it.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Actually,  
if she doesn't learn to conquer her fear of bugs,  
the situation will never be resolved.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"I think she knows that too.  
But even so, she just can't handle bugs.  
Although she likes butterflies because they're cute.\"  
  
**Ayane：**  
Aha!  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Oh? Ayane...  
When did she stop crying?  
She's just innocently chasing after that white butterfly over there.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Wow.  
It's like she has no memory at all of why she burst into tears.\"  
  
**Pukichi：**  
\"Thanks, kid.  
Whenever she's with you, Ayane gets in a real cheerful mood...  
It's like she forgets all about feeling sad or lonely.\"  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Wow,  
I can't believe that's the origin story behind Ayane's Pukichi Fullswing...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Wait. Now I know why she was always  
shooting me down whenever I flew next to her.  
So it's because she doesn't like bugs, huh.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Er, not that I'm calling myself a bug!  
Ayane's even complimented me,  
saying, \"Upon closer look, you're cute like a butterfly\"!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ah, sorry, sorry.  
I guess there's a lot I should explain.  
This is so annoying to do every time! But oh well. It's just part of the job.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just saw, I suppose you could call it a dream.  
You'll forget it once you wake up,  
so no need to think too hard about it now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That said, the Ayane you just saw...  
She's very shy and withdrawn.  
Actually, she doesn't speak at all.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And you don't say much because you've lost your memories,  
so I didn't think the conversation would go very far.  
Pukichi being here was a big help.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I have to be careful  
when picking out what scenes to flash back to...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ah, just talking to myself.  
No use blabbering on and on,  
so I'll leave you with that for now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Goodbye, {player}.  
I'll see you again in your dreams.  
  

---  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hey, {player}?  
What's wrong, are you not feeling well?  
You were spacing out!  
  
**Ayane：**  
I knew it,  
my Pukichi Fullswing really did hit you...  
Did you take some damage and now you're all worn out?  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry!  
I'm apologizing, so will you forgive me?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Huh? That's not what's wrong?  
You were just dreaming...?  
  
**Ayane：**  
You can fall asleep standing up, huh?  
That's so handy!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hee hee, you're so weird, {player}...  
Wait, hold on.  
There's a bug on your shoulder.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'll get it for you.  
There we go!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hmm?  
Aren't I supposed to be afraid of bugs...?  
How come you know that, {player}?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hmm... I used to be afraid of them.  
But they pop up pretty often at the Sarendia Orphanage,  
since the building's so old.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Getting scared and freaking out over each one  
gets so exhausting.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'm a big sister now.  
I can't be scared of bugs.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Kurumi doesn't like them either, so she gets scared when she finds one.  
I end up taking care of them for her.  
  
**Ayane：**  
So that's why  
I've been out here  
practicing my Pukichi Fullswing, as you can see.  
  
**Ayane：**  
I'll be the one to protect Kurumi and the others  
from whatever they're scared of.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Although I can't be super good  
at everything right off the bat...  
  
**Ayane：**  
Praise me, {player}!  
I'm growing up more and more!  
  
**Ayane：**  
Hee hee...  
\"You're amazing\"? Really?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Tell me more!  
I'm the type who gets bigger and stronger with each compliment!
