## Subtitle: Birth of Magical Girl Misaki!
  
**Narration：**  
A few days remain before Halloween.  
{player} has arranged to meet up with Misaki  
to learn more about the joys of the holiday.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Sorry for the wait!  
I got caught up chatting with my friends after class ended. ♪  
A nice little bit of girl talk!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Now then.  
It's time to learn more about the joys of Halloween!  
  
**Misaki：**  
And arguably the main part of Halloween is...  
Yup! Dressing up!  
  
**Misaki：**  
And you know me. I need to show off my ladylike charms.  
So let's look for something that fits that image!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hehe. A kid wouldn't go clothes shopping together with a guy.  
Which makes me a proper adult! ♪  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Welcome!  
We've got some special Halloween deals going on today!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Wow, now this is a good selection!  
Whole outfits, accessories...  
Deciding on something might be tricky!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Oh! Look at this black cat costume!  
It's so cute!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I guess you're supposed to say \"Trick or treat, meow! ♪\",  
or something along those lines?  
Wh-what's with that look?  
I'm just going with the flow,  
so quit staring at me!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hm. But wait. These ears do look a bit childish.  
I need something more elegant. Something more me...  
  
**Misaki：**  
How about this?  
I'd say the antique doll look suits me!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Shall it be a trick, or shall it be a treat?  
Hm... I guess that doesn't really fit my personality.  
  
**Misaki：**  
That, plus the dress itself has lots of layers and accessories.  
Elegant for sure, but maybe a bit too heavy on the body.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Ohhh! Look!  
This thing shoots out strings from your hands!  
Kind of like a spider!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I'd *love* to see how the boys  
in class would react if I got them with this!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Someone's having fun.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misaki：**  
Ah...!  
M-me? Having fun with a child's toy?  
Absolutely not!  
  
**Misaki：**  
That aside...  
Come on. We need to find you an outfit as well!  
  
**Misaki：**  
This might be good.  
How about you go try it on?  
  
**Monster ({player})：**  
Grrrrrrrr!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Ahaha! Perfect!  
You'd pass for a real monster.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Lucky you, though, being able to find something that suits you  
so quickly.  
Oh! Here's an idea! I'll leave it to you.  
You can pick out something that fits me.  
  
**Misaki：**  
It's a man's duty to pick out a lady's dress, you know.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's both be monsters.  
`Tag 2`  
**Misaki：**  
Absolutely not!  
You won't catch me walking around with you  
in matching monster outfits!  
  
**Misaki：**  
H-hey, what're you doing?!  
Don't touch me there! Ahn...!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I-I can't believe you!  
There's nothing fashionable about this!  
  
**Misaki：**  
You want me to imitate a monster? Think again!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Y-you don't need to look that upset...  
Argh! Fine, fine! Just this once!  
  
**Misaki：**  
G-gruoooghhhh...  
  
**Misaki：**  
*sob* This is mortifying...  
Okay, that's enough!  
I need something more stimulating!  
Something that gets my adult appeal across!  
  
**Misaki：**  
H-how about that?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Wow! A witch costume!  
Let me try this on!  
  
**Misaki：**  
And don't go peeping on me, okay?  
Hard as might be to resist.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hm... This goes under here...  
What's this part for, though?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Th-the slit's kind of risque... I gotta be careful.  
As for the hat, it should be fine like this.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Ta-da! How do I look?  
Like a proper witch, I assume!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Heheh.  
Don't try to resist. You can fall for me.  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Wow. You look so cute, miss.  
You're like a real magical girl.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Who are you calling a magical girl?  
Can't you see? I'm a witch!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Good grief, talk about rude.  
No need to treat me like a kid, you know!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  It's a very attractive outfit.  
**Choice: (4)**  It gives you that adult appeal for sure.  
`Tag 3`  
**Misaki：**  
R-right?! I'm glad you understand!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Misaki：**  
Right? I wouldn't doubt it. ♪  
Feels like I took the fast track to adulthood!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Misaki：**  
Well anyway...  
You seem into it, so maybe I'll settle on this.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Or, uh, not... I-I don't have enough money.  
Urgh. I didn't think it'd be this expensive.  
I'd have saved up more if I knew...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Huh? You'll pay for part of it?  
  
**Misaki：**  
That's your way of thanking me  
for teaching you about Halloween?  
  
**Misaki：**  
W-well, if you insist, then I've got no reason to say no!  
Oh... It's still not enough...  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Oh? You two got some money problems?  
Well, it's your lucky day!  
I was just in the mood to give a discount!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Really?! You mean it?!  
Woo! Thank you so much!  
  
**Misaki：**  
A-and you too, for chipping in.  
I'll take good care of this costume.  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Man. Nothing warms the heart like  
a good brother helping out his sister.  
  
**Narration：**  
Misaki, elated by the turn of events,  
had little clue that she was in fact being treated like a child.
