**Narration：**  
On the morning of Halloween, a certain someone knocks on Misaki's door.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hello! Who is it?  
  
**Monster：**  
Grrrrrrrr!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Aaaaaahhhhhh!  
Wh-why's there a monster right by my house?!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Get away! Don't come any closer!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You got me!  
**Choice: (2)**  Your feeble attacks will never fell me...  
`Tag 1`  
**Misaki：**  
Did I do it?  
I did! I really did!  
I took down a monster all on my own!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I gotta brag about this to the boys in cla—  
Hey! Monsters don't speak!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Misaki：**  
Eeek! I-it's too much for a kid like me to handle...  
But I can't give up! Otherwise my family'll be in danger!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Wait.  
Since when do monsters... speak?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Misaki：**  
Ahhhhhh!  
You're {player}, aren't you?!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Don't try to pretend otherwise!  
That's the same outfit I picked out for you the other day!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Who pulls something like this first thing in the morning?!  
You had me terrif—  
Errr, you really caught me off guard!  
  
**Misaki：**  
You wanted to give me a Halloween trick?  
Oh, you're so silly. It's trick *or* treat.  
The trick only comes when the treat doesn't!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hang on, did you wake up early just for this?  
*sigh* You really are just a big kid, aren't you?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Oh well. I don't mind playing along now and then.  
That's what makes a true lady.  
  
**Girl：**  
Misaki! Good morning!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Good morning to you, too. Did you need something?  
  
**Girl：**  
Yeah!  
We're gonna have a Halloween party at the academy!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Wow, at the academy?  
That's amazing!  
  
**Boy：**  
We asked Miss Io, and she said it's okay!  
  
**Girl：**  
So then we thought, we need to invite Misaki as well!  
Let's go together!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Well...  
If you say so, then...  
  
**Boy：**  
No point in inviting her!  
She'll just say it's for kids and not come!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Excuse me?!  
Wh-what gives?!  
  
**Boy：**  
You do it all the time!  
Always butting in and calling us kids  
and stuff when we're having fun!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Wha—?  
W-well, I'm right!  
You're all a bunch of kids!  
You don't see me getting overly excited about everything!  
  
**Misaki：**  
No way I'm going to your stupid party!  
  
**Girl：**  
It'd be a lot more fun if you did, though...  
  
**Boy：**  
Whatever.  
She's not coming, so let's just go.  
  
**Girl：**  
O-okay... See you later, Misaki...  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hmph.  
I'm not jealous.  
I'm not jealous at all!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I never even liked Halloween, anyway!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I think you should go.  
`Tag 4`  
**Misaki：**  
No way!  
It won't even be that fun...  
I'm better off hanging out with you!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I'm not some silly little kid like them.  
I don't need their party!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Huh?  
I need to think back to when they were giving out candy?  
  
**Misaki：**  
I was too stubborn back then?  
Even though I wanted some, I couldn't bring myself to say it?  
  
**Misaki：**  
I mean... You're not wrong.  
I said I didn't need any, but there was one I really wanted...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  You taught me all about how fun Halloween can be.  
`Tag 5`  
**Misaki：**  
D-don't put it so bluntly, dummy.  
You're making me blush.  
  
**Misaki：**  
*sigh*  
You're honest to a fault, aren't you?  
Though I guess that's part of being an adult.  
  
**Misaki：**  
I need to learn to take a step back and think.  
That's what a proper lady would do.  
So yeah. Let me be honest, too.  
  
**Misaki：**  
I really, really want to go to that party!  
It'll be super fun!  
  
**Misaki：**  
And with that said, it's time to take action!  
We're going to make our presence known. Together!  
  
**Girl：**  
I really wish Misaki came...  
  
**Boy：**  
Whatever! Who cares about her?  
  
**Girl：**  
I mean. She knows so much stuff.  
It'd have been super fun if she was here.  
  
**Boy：**  
Hm? Wonder who that is...  
Gimme a sec!  
  

---  
  
**Misaki：**  
Trick or treat!  
Get that candy ready, or prepare for the repercussions!  
  
**Boy：**  
Whoa?! You scared the heck outta me!  
  
**Girl：**  
Oh! I didn't think you'd come. Misaki!  
  
**Misaki：**  
You thought wrong! What's a party without me?  
Also, I'm sorry for being mean earlier.  
  
**Girl：**  
Don't worry! I'm just really happy you came!  
That outfit is really cute, too!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Right?  
Heh! No one can resist my charm! ♪  
  
**Boy：**  
Sh-shut it! I can resist!  
Can't believe you actually came after all that!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Oh, please!  
You'll never be a real gentleman  
if you can't see the bigger picture.  
  
**Girl：**  
She's right!  
And I know you're actually happy that she came!  
  
**Boy：**  
N-no way!  
But, well... You're here now.  
So we'll let you join!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Ehehe! ♪  
You were right, {player}.  
Being honest paid off.  
  
**Misaki：**  
I'm having so, so much fun!  
So I guess you were the one that ended up  
teaching me about the real joys of Halloween.  
  
**Narration：**  
With a newfound honest heart, Misaki took one step  
towards becoming an adult. And thus  
she was able to enjoy Halloween to its fullest extent.
