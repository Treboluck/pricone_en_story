**Narration：**  
{player} is out on a walk, when suddenly...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hey, it's whiz-boy!  
Whatcha up to? Just out on a walk?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I'm on my way to work!  
I've got a modeling gig I've gotta get to.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh? You think I'm super cool for working so hard?  
Aw, you're just saying that.  
I just really like my job, that's all!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
And since I like it so much, it's like, super fun!  
All my coworkers are like my besties too,  
so it doesn't feel  
like work at all!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hey, I know! Why don't you come watch─  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Whoa, what's with this light?!  
It's so bright!

**Suzuna：**  
Whattup, whiz-boy?  
You're as punctual as always!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
So like, as much as I wanna say let's get a move on and all...  
I kinda can't.  
Sorz! Could you wait like, just a teensy bit  
for me?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
See, I was doing a magazine shoot, but like, they couldn't get  
the pictures to come out right, so it's running later than we  
thought it would.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I think I'm just like, off or something today.  
Idk, like, maybe I'm just too tense, y'know?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
We've had to take so many pictures, it's taken ages...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
The photographer and the magazine staff are all like,  
\"wow, those are some great photos!\"  
But I'm like, uh, no they're not!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I'm modeling 'cause I like doing it, so I'm not gonna put on  
some half-baked performance.  
I'm just thinking it might take a  
bit longer to get a decent pic.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
You're cool with waiting?  
You're the best, whiz-boy!  
I'll be done in a jiffy, so just sit tight!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I've gotta finish this quick! My little whiz-boy's waiting!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh hey! There he is! And he's looking right at me!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Wave at her.  
**Choice: (2)**  Call her name.  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzuna：**  
Ahaha! Look at that big ol' wave! Whiz-boy, you're hilarious!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzuna：**  
Omigosh, what a little dorkus!  
There's like, so many people  
around him, and he's just screaming his head off.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Suzuna：**  
Well, that just shows how hardcore he's cheering for me!  
I've gotta put in 110 percent!  
  
**Cameraman：**  
Looking good, Suzuna! If you keep this up, we'll be done in no  
time.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
For real?  
Hellaaa!  
  
**Model Friend：**  
Oh, I see what's going on here. You're going all out because  
your boyfriend's watching!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Wha?! No?!  
H-he's not my boyfriend!  
  
**Model Friend：**  
You suuure? 'Cause I mean, it sure looks like he is!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
W-well, he's not! He's just a friend!  
  
**Cameraman：**  
Hmm? Hey, Suzuna, you're looking a little tense again.  
Actually, your face is pretty red, too. We're gonna have to  
redo these shots.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Ugh, it's you guys' fault for embarrassing me...  
I can't concentrate when my heart's pounding like this...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Man, and I was so close to being done too! Now it's gonna take  
even longer...

**Ameth：**  
Oh dear. Looks like you caused some  
delays in her photo shoot.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I have to say, it's really incredible how professional Suzuna  
gets when she's working.  
She's just amazing!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hm? You want to know what this was?  
Riiight. I guess I haven't told you yet.  
What you saw just now was a dream I made for you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Though really, I just put it together from Suzuna's and your  
memory fragments.  
I bet it felt pretty familiar, didn't it?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'll show you another dream once you've gathered enough  
memory fragments.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You'll be having dreams with lots of different girls here,  
and that's how you're going to learn the truth of this world.  
So do your best, okay?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, that's it for now! ♪

**Suzuna：**  
Nnngh... Hm?  
Huh? Wait, was I sleeping?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
You too, whiz-boy?  
Who the heck falls asleep in the middle of  
the road? Talk about a bruh moment, amirite?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I had like, the weirdest dream.  
I was planning on hanging out  
with you, but then I got held up with work...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh? You had the same dream?  
That's like,  
totally scarindipitous! What the heck!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh, dangit! I gotta get to my photo shoot!  
I gotta go, like, pronto!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh, I know! You wanna come too? That way, you can see me  
modeling up close and personal!  
Just like in our dream!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
But wait...  
In that dream...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh geez, I almost forgot!  
All my coworkers thought he was my  
boyfriend!  
  
**Suzuna：**

**Suzuna：**  
Y-you know what? Forget I said anything!  
Catch ya later, whiz-boy!  
  
**Narration：**  
Suzuna took off with her face as red as a tomato.
