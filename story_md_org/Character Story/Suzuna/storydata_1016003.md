## Subtitle: The Perfect Perfume
  
**Narration：**  
Suzuna has called {player} to meet up with her.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hey, whiz-boy!  
Whattup?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
And look at the time! Right on the nose!  
If you're ready, then let's mosey!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh? You wanna know where?  
Wait, did I forget to tell you?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I wanna take you on a shopping spree.  
See, I've got a fashion show coming up,  
and I wanna bring my A-game!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I can definitely pick stuff out on my own and all,  
but like,  
you gotta get other people's opinions and stuff, right?  
So I  
was kinda hoping you'd gimme a couple of pointers.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I mean, you're like, super pliable and all!  
Anyway, less talky, more shoppy! Let's go!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
And we're here!  
This is like, my fav perfume place in the whole  
WORLD.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh? You wanna know why I'm getting perfume?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
You thought I was just gonna be buying clothes or something?  
Geez, you're like, painfully outta the loop sometimes.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Perfume gets people's attention, which means they'll be looking  
at me and my clothes even more than before.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
So anyway, you get to be my sniffer dog today!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
What's up? You don't know anything about perfume?  
Oh, you'll be fine! This is one of those things  
you just go  
with your gut on, my guy!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
This shop lets you sample the perfume and stuff.  
I'm gonna give myself a li'l spritz, so just tell me whatcha  
think, 'kay?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh, bee tee dubs, did you know  
some perfumes have like,  
secondary effects to them?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Like, uh...  
Lemme see... Aha! Here, check it out!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
This one's got like, uh... \"Notes of citrus that will make you  
feel refreshed.\"  
Oh, and it's good for weight loss too!  
How crazy is that?!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Whatcha think? Do I look any thinner?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Whaddya mean it's not gonna kick in that fast?  
Ugh, lame.  
Well, in that case, let's go for something else.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
How about this one?  
This one's supposed to make you seem more sophisticated!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
So? Am I looking more sophisticated yet?!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
You don't think so?  
Aww... Are you sure?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh, I know!  
Just you wait! I'm pulling out the big guns now!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
How's that? Notice anything different about me?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Not really?  
**Choice: (2)**  You've gotten cuter, I think?  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzuna：**  
Wait, really?  
You don't think I look like, *any* cuter?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh, c'mon! That is like, *such* a cop-out!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Suzuna：**  
What's going on here? They said this perfume was s'posed to  
make men go nutso for you.  
You're not like, THAT oblivious, are  
you?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Man, I was really hoping you'd be all over me, too...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh well, I guess it doesn't matter.  
Let's just get our shop on!  
I'm just gonna try a bunch on, so you just tell me which ones  
you like best.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
We've tried out a whole bunch, but nothing's really like...  
*popped* or anything.  
Um, lessee... Maybe this guy?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hm?! This one...  
Whiz-boy, you gotta smell this one!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  It suits you perfectly.  
**Choice: (5)**  I love this smell.  
`Tag 4`  
**Suzuna：**  
Inorite?! It's like, it's my perfume! And they made it for me!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Suzuna：**  
Omigosh, you too?!  
I'm like, totally in love with this one!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Suzuna：**  
You and I were totally thinking the same thing, huh?  
It's like we're on the same brain-lengths or something!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Yeah, there's no ifs, ands, or buts about it! This is the one!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Uh, hey. You're not looking too hot!  
You okay there?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
You're feeling sick?! Like, from the perfume?!  
Yeah, okay,  
that's serious! We gotta get you outta here!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
You all right, whiz-boy? I guess perfume can make you pretty  
sick if you're not used to it.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
So hey, I think we should give up on the perfume for now and  
go get you some tea.  
We'll hold off on the shopping 'til you're  
feeling better.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hm? You want me to just go on without you?  
Well...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hmm...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Nah, I'm good. You're not good with perfume, so like,  
I think I'm gonna pass on it, tbh.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
And you know what? I think I'm gonna go  
without it at my show too!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
So without further adieu, let's get you to a cafe!  
We've got plenty of time to hang, so let's make the most of it!  
  
**Narration：**  
After this meeting with {player}, Suzuna decided  
that she would no longer wear perfume anymore.
