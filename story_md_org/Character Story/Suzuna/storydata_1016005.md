Lessee... nine's the biggest number on the times  
table, and seven times nine is forty-six...

**Suzuna：**  
...I'm so sorry. We were doing so good, but then...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
We lost everything... Now we definitely can't go  
shopping. I never should've let myself get  
so greedy...  
  
**Choice: (10)**  It was pretty fun, though.  
`Tag 10`  
**Suzuna：**  
You mean it?  
'Cause actually, I thought it was  
pretty fun too!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Like, it was a *blast* when we started hitting it big,  
but having it all come crashing down at the end...  
Ahaha! It was totally hilarious!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
But, uh... You gonna be okay? What about your errands?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh? You can just get a refund?  
Oh, right! You can  
just give some of the apples back! Doy!  
Whiz-boy,  
you are a genius!  
  
**Narration：**  
The two of them apologized profusely to the shopkeep,  
returned the apples, and went back to their shopping.
