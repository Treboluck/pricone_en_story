**Narration：**  
Today, {player} is helping Kuka out  
with her usual dance practice.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Mr. Sadist, what have you got there?  
It looks like some kind of flyer...  
...Huh? You'd like me to take a look at it?  
  
**Kuka：**  
This is... an advertisement for a dance contest?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Whaaaa?!  
You think I should try entering this contest?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Oh, I could never...  
I still don't have any confidence in my dancing...  
I... I... I'd be so embarrassed...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ahhh! I see your game...  
You're trying to put me through a terrible ordeal  
so you can bask in my humiliation!  
  
**Kuka：**  
And yet through all the torturous shame,  
I'll find myself powerless to resist your orders... *drool*  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I don't want to force you into anything...  
**Choice: (2)**  I need you to do this for me.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kuka：**  
Playing the bad cop *and* the good cop...?  
Mr. Sadist... you're on a whole different level!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kuka：**  
Eheh.... Gueheheh...  
When you get so insistent,  
there's nothing I can do but accept my fate...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kuka：**  
If you want this so much...  
All right, then!  
I'll try entering this dance contest!  
  
**Kuka：**  
...Huh? We'll need lots of practice before the big day?  
Gueheheh... So you're going to train me even more roughly...  
*drool*  
  
**Kuka：**  
Y-yes, I'm looking forward to...  
I-I mean, I'll do my best!  
  
**Narration：**  
On the day of the contest...  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-i-i-is it time already?!  
I still don't feel ready at all...!  
  
**Announcer：**  
Time for our next contestant!  
Miss Kuka, you're up!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Did he say it's my turn?!  
Mr. Sadist... I think I should probably back out...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Waaahhh?!  
N-n-no pushing! If you push me that hard, I'll—!  
  
**Announcer：**  
Here she comes! Miss Kuka is on the stage!  
Let's see what she's got for us!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Aaahhhhh!  
Mr. Sadist pushed me all the way out onto the stage!  
There's nowhere left to run...!  
  
**Kuka：**  
A-aaaahhh...  
Am I really going to do it in front of all these staring faces?!  
I'm so embarrassed, my head is about to explode!  
  
**Bartender：**  
Kuka!  
You can do it!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ahhh... My colleagues from work are cheering me on...  
Oh no... Everyone I know is watching...  
Everyone's going to see me expose my inadequacy!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ohh! Could this all be part of Mr. Sadist's plans...?!  
He set this all up to drive me crazy... Gueheh...  
\"I know you love to do it while people watch...\"  
 You monster!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Gueheheh... Mr. Sadist... You trained me like an animal...  
Encouraged me to dance... until I could barely stand...  
Made me keep trying long after I wanted to give up...  
  
**Kuka：**  
And all through the torment, you were drinking up my pain!  
I knew you were a scoundrel!  
Eheh... Gueheheheh...  
  
**Bar Customer 1：**  
Wh-what's all this stuff she's muttering while dancing?  
What kind of training has that man been putting her through?  
  
**Bar Customer 2：**  
But look!  
Her steps are on point... She's improved so much!  
  
**Spectators：**  
Whoaaaaa!!  
Now that's what I call a passionate dance!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ahhh! Aaaahhhh!  
When I think back to how Mr. Sadist disciplined me,  
my whole body writhes in pleasure!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Aahhh...  
I really tried my best, but all I got was a consolation prize...  
After all that training you helped me with, too...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Your dancing was beautiful.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kuka：**  
Ehh? B-b-b-beautiful?!  
I wasn't ready for a compliment like that...  
  
**Kuka：**  
If you're calling me beautiful, doesn't that mean...  
It means... It has to mean...  
You have f-f-f-feelings for...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Waaaaaghhhhh!  
I-it's too embarrassing to say!!!  
  
**Narration：**  
As Kuka ran away with her face bright red,  
{player} gazed after her with a bewildered expression.
