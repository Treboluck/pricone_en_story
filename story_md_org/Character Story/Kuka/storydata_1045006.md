# Kuka Episode 6
One day, Kuka seems more out of it than usual. Her colleagues are worried that she might be using the \"hallucination grass\" that's been going around town. But in reality, she's just been sneaking out to read erotic novels every night.
  
## Subtitle: A Dangerous Addiction
  
**Narration：**  
{player} drops by the tavern where Kuka works  
to help her with her usual dance practice, but...  
  
**Kuka：**  
...  
  
**Kuka：**  
...Huh?  
Oh, Mr. Sadist... Did you want something?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Dance practice...?  
Oh, right... I asked you to come over, didn't I?  
I'm sorry... I'm a bit out of it today...  
  
**Bartender：**  
Kuka? It's your turn to clean the changing rooms today!  
Have you still not taken care of it?  
  
**Kuka：**  
...  
  
**Bartender：**  
Kuka!  
Are you listening to me?!  
There's cleaning to be done!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Eh...?  
 I-I'm so sorry!  
I'll take care of it at once!  
  
**Bartender：**  
*sigh*...What's gotten into her?  
These past few days, she's been spacing out all the time.  
Keeps talking about weird feelings in her chest, too...  
  
**Bartender：**  
C'mon... Do you know what might be up?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Kuka being weird is nothing new...  
**Choice: (2)**  Maybe she has a cold?  
`Tag 1`  
**Bartender：**  
W-well...  
I suppose you're not wrong there...

`Tag 2`  
**Bartender：**  
Well, I hope that's all it is...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Bartender：**  
But something's been really off with her lately.  
You don't think she's gotten mixed up in anything nasty, do you?  
  
**Bartender：**  
Tell me... Have you heard about the rare grass  
that Caon and Nightmare have been looking into recently?  
  
**Bartender：**  
They're saying this grass can make you see hallucinations  
and give you sensations of pleasure.  
But in exchange, it damages your body and mind...  
  
**Bartender：**  
And you know, Kuka's been acting strange.  
She's been spotted sneaking out late at night,  
after everyone else has gone to sleep.  
  
**Bartender：**  
You don't think she could have been seeing a dealer  
to buy some of that rare grass?  
  
**Bartender：**  
...You think I'm overthinking it?  
But I heard the side effects of using the grass include  
spacing out and a strange sensation in the chest...  
  
**Bartender：**  
You see? It sounds just like how Kuka's been acting!  
I'm worried about her, I really am.  
What do you say? Could you look into what she's been up to?  
  
**Kuka：**  
...Good...There's nobody around...  
This is my chance...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Let's see... Nobody here either.  
W-well, then... Here I go!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ahhhhh! I can't wait another second!  
All day long, I've been craving it!  
I want it... I need it... I can't live without it anymore!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Hurry and give me those sweet sensations!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Confront her.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kuka：**  
A-aaaahhhh! Mr. Sadist?!  
But how... Why are you here?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-I-I-I'm not doing anything!  
There's nothing suspicious here!  
See, I'm definitely not hiding any—  
  
**Kuka：**  
Wahhh! No, you mustn't look!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Are these... books?  
`Tag 5`  
**Kuka：**  
M-my secret's been found out...  
Everyone will know I've been reading steamy novels...  
  
**Kuka：**  
N-no, wait! You don't understand!  
This mountain of forbidden carnal knowledge  
doesn't belong to me at all!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I think somebody must have discarded it all here...  
There are so many outrageous books, the likes of which  
you'd never find in respectable shops, so I... I couldn't resist...  
  
**Kuka：**  
...I-I mean... After all the torment you've put me through,  
normal stuff isn't enough to satisfy me anymore...  
The kind of books you can buy in shops aren't intense enough...  
  
**Kuka：**  
That's why this place is my new paradise!  
Surely you can understand why I'd come here every night?!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Uh-huh. Let's burn them.  
**Choice: (7)**  I'll tear them up.  
`Tag 6`  
**Kuka：**  
W-wait! Don't do that!  
You can't set fire to this mountain of treasure!  
  
Jump to tag 8  
`Tag 7`  
**Kuka：**  
N-n-n-no, stooop!  
If you tear them, they'll be harder to reeeead!  
  
`Tag 8`  
**Kuka：**  
I can't go on without these books anymore!  
I'll do anything! Please, don't touch them!  
  
**Narration：**  
Ignoring the desperate pleas of an addict,  
{player} calmly disposed of the dangerous material.
