**Narration：**  
Today, {player} and Kuka have met up  
to go on a little trip.  
  
**Kuka：**  
Landosol Central Gardens...? Why there?  
  
**Kuka：**  
I... I see...  
You must be planning to feed me  
to all the park's wildlife!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Y-you just want to go for a stroll?  
  
**Kuka：**  
W-wauahhh?!  
A stroll in the park with Mr. Sadist?!  
Th-that sounds almost like…  
  
**Kuka：**  
Aaahhh! Th-this bright light...  
It's just like... that time before?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Awaaaaahhhhh!

**Kuka：**  
I-I-I-I actually came  
to the theme park with Mr. Sadist...  
What am I going to do...?!  
  
**Kuka：**  
I-I never dreamed I would ever  
come to a place like this with a boy...

**Kuka：**  
Ahhh...  
Th-these things... spin a bit faster than I expected...  
  
**Kuka：**  
M-Mr. Sadist... C-could you try...  
to s-spin us... a little more... slowly than that...?!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Spin more slowly.  
**Choice: (5)**  Faster! Faster!  
`Tag 4`  
**Kuka：**  
Waaahhh!  
Even spinning slowly... makes me dizzy...  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Kuka：**  
Waaaahhhh?!  
M-Mr. Sadist... You're making my head spin!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Kuka：**  
Ahhh... Th-this must be an adult theme park...  
filled with clever traps...  
t-to break my body and sooooul!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Ahh... Oooohhh...  
C-could this be like those famous scenes in samurai dramas?!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Y-you're speeding up?!  
`Tag 7`  
**Kuka：**  
That's right!  
 Th-the sadistic evil magistrate  
pretends to admire the girl's kimono belt...  
but then grabs it to pull her towards him, as she protests!  
  
**Kuka：**  
\"What a fine belt you have... Heheheh... Come a little closer...\"  
Yes... With a vile and sordid chuckle...  
  
**Kuka：**  
He keeps pulling on the belt until she spins...!  
...Eheh... Gueheheh!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Th-that's... enough spinning...!  
`Tag 8`  
**Kuka：**  
P-please spare me, Mr. Magistrate!  
Ohhhhh myyyy...!  
 *drool*  
  
**Kuka：**  
\"You know you like it, you know you like it!\"  
Until finally... He pulls on the hem of her kimono...  
 Gueheh...  
  
**Kuka：**  
N-no, Mr. Magistrate!  
Please, not in front of all these people!  
  
**Kuka：**  
Eheh... Gueheheh... *drool*  
  
**Choice: (9)**  ...Farewell, sweet world...  
`Tag 9`

**Ameth：**  
Aaaaand welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
...Wow, you look like a total mess.  
Are teacup rides supposed to be that intense?  
  
**Ameth：**  
That Kuka, though...  
She looks like such a sweet girl when she keeps her mouth shut,  
but once her fantasies get going, there's no stopping her!  
  
**Ameth：**  
But that's all part of her charm!  
She has all these wild fantasies,  
 but the first sign of real-life flirtation,  
and she gets all nervous and embarrassed! Isn't that the cutest?!  
  
**Ameth：**  
...Well, not that you know the first thing about flirting.  
Maybe she realizes that, and that's why she feels like  
she can fantasize so freely around you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Or could it be that she has all these fantasies about you  
because she's really hoping you'll make them come true?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'll leave you to figure the answer to that one out for yourself.  
Anyway, it's about time for you to wake up.  
 Bye-bye!

**Kuka：**  
Gueheheh... Mr. Magistrate...  
...Wait, huh? Where am I?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Oh dear... Did I fall fast asleep again?  
...What? You only just woke up as well?  
  
**Kuka：**  
Both of us nodding off when we're on our way to the park...  
Actually, maybe that's why.  
I had this strange dream about spinning around with you at a park...  
  
**Kuka：**  
You had the same dream...?!  
How mysterious... This is the second time it's happened, too...  
  
**Kuka：**  
W-well, it would be a shame  
to only go to the park in our dreams...  
Let's hurry along to the real thing!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  ...I'm gonna throw up...  
`Tag 10`  
**Kuka：**  
Huh? C-  
could it be  
you got dizzy from all that spinning in the dream and...  
  
**Kuka：**  
Waaahhh?!  
M-Mr. Sadist collapsed on the ground?!  
Are you okay?! Tell me you're okaaaay!  
  
**Narration：**  
Thanks to {player}'s sudden ailment,  
the two of them decided to go to the park another time...
