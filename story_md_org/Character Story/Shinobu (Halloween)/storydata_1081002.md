## Subtitle: A Ghostly Date
  
**Narration：**  
With the help of a couple of friendly spirits,  
Shinobu and {player} were able to save the children  
from a dangerous monster.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Huh? What's that, now?  
 You have one final wish?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh... I'm sorry, {player}.  
The spirits who helped us to defeat the monster just now  
seem to have a request of their own.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Right. So what is it you want from us? I see, I see...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...Whaaa?!  
 I-I-I'm not sure that's very...  
Urghhh...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
S-so, um. These spirits—apparently they're a married couple—  
were hoping to have a...  
 a d-date together,  
before finally saying goodbye to the living world on this special day.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
The wife wants to possess me while her husband in turn  
possesses you,  
 so that we can go on a date together in their stead...  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Oh, hell no! Not a chance!  
I wouldn't allow it if the gods themselves begged me!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Hmm? What's that? You'll introduce me to some cute girls,  
so don't be so uptight?  
  
**Skullfather：**  
What kinda guy... uh, skull... do you ghosts take me for?!  
As if I'd be swayed by such transparent cajolery... Nghhhh...  
I-I suppose I could consider it...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
F-Father... Do you have no pride at all...?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Um... Personally, since these spirits helped us to save the children,  
I would like to do whatever I can for them in return,  
but a date is a little much...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I mean, I'm sure {player} doesn't want to...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's grant their wish.  
`Tag 1`  
**Shinobu：**  
A-are you sure?!  
 B-but... But I—I'm not...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Urghh... All right, then.  
I've never been on an actual date, so I'm not sure if  
I'll do a very good job...  
But I... I'll do my best.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Huh?  
 V-very well. First, we need to walk around town...  
wh-while h-holding hands...  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Brat! Did you scrub those hands clean?!  
One speck of your filth on my daughter's hands,  
and I'll bite your fingers clean off!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father, there's really no need for that.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Well then, ah...  
 shall we do this?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Ahh...  
 I never realized how warm people's hands really are.  
My father is quite cold to the touch, you see.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Aaahh... Somehow even my face is feeling warmer...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Huh?  
 Now you want us to whisper sweet nothings to each other?  
  
**Skullfather：**  
A-are these ghosts still not satisfied?! Grrrnnngghhh...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...M-my dear...  
 I love you... very much.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Sh-Shinobu... You'll never be an actress! But you're so cute!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
You always... look so... wonderful...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You look lovely as well.  
**Choice: (3)**  Stare at her passionately.  
`Tag 2`  
**Shinobu：**  
Wha...?  
 U-um, this is just an act, right?  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Shinobu：**  
U-um... When you stare like that, I'm not sure how to react... Urghh...  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Skullfather：**  
What am I watching? What is this, what is this, what is this,  
what, what, what, what, what, what, what—  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father. Please stop shaking so violently.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
The rage is almost tearing me apart,  
but this is for the sake of meeting cute babes...  
Stay strong... Gotta stay strong...!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Umm... So what should we do next...?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Huh?  
 We're not holding hands in the right way?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
It makes us feel too distant?  
Honestly, I think we're awfully close together...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Not physically distant, but emotionally?  
 I... I see.  
The world of romance is a very mysterious place...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Y-you think we should intertwine our fingers together?  
I-is that necessary?  
This isn't some sort of magical ritual, you know—  
  
**Shinobu：**  
A-at any rate. I suppose we can try.  
First, our thumbs... Then our pointer fingers...  
 A-aahh...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Our middle fingers...  
 A-ahh...  
I can feel your fingers against the very base of my own...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
S-somehow this makes me feel very warm and unsteady.  
I didn't know people could hold hands like this...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Our ring fingers must be next.M-mmhh...!  
S-somehow I do feel like  
this is bringing us much closer together.

**Shinobu：**  
Now if we link our little fingers... Ahhhh...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
U-um...  
Am I doing this right, do you think?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
It feels very warm?  
Y-yes, it does... All we are doing is holding hands,  
yet it seems to warm my whole body...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Ahh... Aaahhh... Ohh...  
Now all of my fingers  
are entwined with yours.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
So this is how lovers hold hands...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
It's amazing. I can't believe the world's lovers  
walk around like this every day...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Just a few moments is already making me feel quite lightheaded...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Ahh... Ahh... I'm so sorry.  
I'm not sure if I can take this heat much longer...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
What? You're both ready to pass on now?  
Th-that's, ah... good to hear...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
You wish us a happy life together, too?  
 Well, thank you...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Wait, what do you mean by \"together\"?!

**Shinobu：**  
Ah... They're gone from this plane...  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Honestly, what a troublesome pair they were! ...Hmm?  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Hold on a minute!  
How're they gonna introduce me to any babes if they've passed on?!  
Curse those spirits! They played me for a fool!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father, there's no use throwing a tantrum.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
At any rate, I'm glad they managed to find happiness.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
It was quite an overwhelming experience for me,  
but as long as it helped them...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Um, I'm sorry I had to make you go through all of that.  
Let's forget all about it and...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
W-wait, no, forgetting it entirely would be... Aaahhh...  
  
**Skullfather：**  
No! Forget it! Forget it right now! Scrub your brains clean!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father! I think that's enough from you!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Aaargh! My daughter's a demon!  
  
**Narration：**  
Massaging the base of her fingers embarrassedly,  
Shinobu blushed and looked away.
