**Narration：**  
One day, {player} finds himself suddenly attacked by a monster.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**???：**  
Get down, {player}...  
Phantom Terror!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Phew... That was close.  
Are you quite all right?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Thank goodness.  
There's no telling what might happen at this time of year, you know.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Dumb brat!  
Why didn't you kick the bucket while you had the chance?  
Pah! Pah!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father... That's enough open hostility.  
Besides, you can say \"Pah!\" all you like,  
but you don't have any saliva to spit, do you?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Listen... Around Halloween, the spirit world draws close to  
that of the living, so evil spirits and monsters under their influence  
become more active than usual.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
As such, it would be better for you to avoid traveling alone...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh... You were on your way back to Landosol?  
In that case, we can travel together.  
I have business there myself.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Since monster attacks are more common during this season,  
I decided to buy some new battle gear.  
I was just on my way to pick up the items I ordered.  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Whoaaaa! Check out those babes in Halloween costumes!  
They're not holding anything back!  
Those thighs are candy to my eye sockets!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
And their chests, practically bursting from their blouses!  
Simply obscene! Guaahhh! I'd love to bury my face in 'em!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father. If you must say these things, do so quietly.  
You're a terrible embarrassment to everyone in earshot.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
What's that? I don't seem to be in very good spirits?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
... To tell the truth, I'm not very fond of Halloween.  
Crowds and excitement are not my strong point.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Ah, this is the place.  
I'll pick up the items now, so wait here a moment.  
  
**Weapon Merchant：**  
Oh! The young lady with the special order! Good to see ya!  
Our artisan was pretty dang proud of how this one turned out!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
That's good to hear...  
 Huh?  
  
Um, this isn't quite what I—  
  
**Weapon Merchant：**  
I'll fix it up to fit you perfectly, so try it on now!  
C'mon, the fitting room's right over here!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
S-sorry to keep you waiting.Urghh...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
I'm sure this gear is extremely effective, but the design is so, well...  
I look like some kind of great Halloween lover.  
It's so embarrassing...  
  
**Skullfather：**  
You kiddin' me, Shinobu?! That costume looks too cute on you!  
Atta girl!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father... This is battle gear. Not some kind of costume.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You look super cute.  
**Choice: (2)**  You look super stylish.  
`Tag 1`  
**Shinobu：**  
Wha...?  
 D-did you just say \"cute\"?  
Oh no... I don't know what to say...!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Shinobu... You didn't react like that when *I* said it!  
Curse you, brat! I'll smash your skull in two!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Shinobu：**  
Stylish, you say? I'm afraid I don't know much about fashion,  
but if you think it looks nice, I'm glad...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
N-no, wait. That's not what I...  
O-of course I'm not glad!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Hey, brat. You've got some nerve making eyes at my Shinobu!  
Want me to bite through your throat?!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Weapon Merchant：**  
Wh-what's going on?! An earthquake?!  
My wares are flying around...  
 Aaargh!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh... It seems the spirits are fond of this gear too...?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
All right, then.  
If you all like it so much, I suppose I can wear this.  
  
**Girl：**  
Hey! Let's do that lady over there next!  
  
**Boy：**  
Trick or treat!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Huh? Oh—you mean me?  
 Well, ah...  
  
**Boy：**  
C'mon, what's the holdup? Do it right!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Ahh... I'm very sorry. I'm not sure what you mean...  
  
**Boy：**  
All you gotta do is say \"Happy Halloween\" back!  
And then you give us candy!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Candy?  
 Actually, um...  
I think there was some included with the gear I just bought...  
  
**Weapon Merchant：**  
M... Monsteeeers!  
  
**Skullfather：**  
What?! In the middle of the city?!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Father, that monster! It's possessed by an evil spirit!  
  
**Boy：**  
Aahh! It's coming this way!  
  
**Girl：**  
Waaahhh! Get awaaaay!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Leave that monster to me. The rest of you should run!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Oh? {player}, are you lending me your power?  
Thank you very much!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Yes... With this energy behind me,  
I'll protect those who need it.  
 Haaah!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
There! Now, is that all the—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Ahh! There's still one monster left!  
Oh no, it's headed right for the children!  
  
**Girl：**  
Aaaaahhhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Boy：**  
H-huh? The monster suddenly stopped moving?  
  
**Skullfather：**  
Shinobu! The spirits are holding the monster back!  
Do your thing!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Haaaahhhhhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Phew. Thank goodness... Everyone's safe...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Thank you, {player}.  
And to the spirits,  
 thank you as well.  
Because of you, we were able to avoid any casualties.  
  
**Girl：**  
W-waaahhh... *sniff* That was too scary...  
  
**Girl：**  
Uunhh...? What was that?  
There's no wind, but those weapons moved...  
Could it be... a ghost?  
  
**Boy：**  
I dunno, but...  
 Trick or treat?  
  
**Girl：**  
Whoaaa! Awesome! It's the real thing!  
  
**Boy：**  
But if it's a ghost, I guess it won't have any candy...  
What a shame.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Are those children not afraid of the spirits?  
I thought the weapon merchant's response  
was the more usual reaction...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Must be because it's Halloween.  
`Tag 4`  
**Shinobu：**  
I see... So Halloween is a time when the spirits can frolic  
without causing too much concern.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
How surprising. I never expected to meet others  
who accept the spirits like we do...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Huh? I should give the children some candy?  
  
**Shinobu：**  
All right, then. I'll do that now.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Sorry, it's all right now...  
Um... Happy Halloween.  
  
**Boy：**  
Whoaa! Candy treats! Thanks, nice lady!  
  
**Girl：**  
Thank you too, Mr. Ghost!  
  
**Boy：**  
Ahahah! They're moving again!  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Um, {player}...  
  
**Shinobu：**  
If this season allows us all to be closer to the spirits...  
I think I might be able to enjoy Halloween after all.  
  
**Shinobu：**  
Haha. Somehow today seems like a day full of promise.  
  
**Narration：**  
As she gazed at the happy children and the spirits,  
a faint smile came over Shinobu's face.
