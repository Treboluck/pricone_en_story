# Maho (Summer) Episode 3
Maho and {player} take part in the festival's spirit boat procession, which involves writing wishes on a piece of paper and sending them off to sea on small boats. The boats are attacked by monsters, however, causing Maho to come close to drowning in an attempt to protect them, but the holy beast appears to save her and grant her wish.

**Narration：**  
With their dance performance over, Maho and  
{player} are taking a stroll along the beach.  
  
**Maho：**  
Mmm. The sea breeze feels mighty good.  
Taking a stroll after a job well done  
always feels great.  
  
**Maho：**  
You feel the same way, right?  
A prince and a princess taking a stroll together after a national event...  
  
**Maho：**  
*sigh* It's so romantic. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
Might as well take a li'l detour along the beach, too,  
now that we're here.  
  
**Maho：**  
Yeah. The sunlight's still a bit strong,  
but the water's real  
shiny and pretty.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hm? There's a fair amount of people gathered over there,  
ain't there?  
Let's go see what's happening.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hello!  
What are y'all doing here?  
  
**Woman：**  
Oh, hello!  
We're actually getting ready to perform  
the spirit boat procession.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  The spirit boat procession?  
`Tag 1`  
**Woman：**  
It's a special ritual, you see. You write down a wish or  
thoughts about your ancestors on some paper,  
then send it out to sea on one of these boats.  
  
**Maho：**  
Wow!  
That sure is a cute li'l boat.  
  
**Woman：**  
Hehe.  
Legends say that the boats reaches the holy beast  
following the end of their journey, which channels the  
thoughts and wishes on each piece of paper.  
  
**Maho：**  
Sending thoughts on a journey along with a little boat...  
That's such a lovely idea.  
Don't you agree, my prince?  
  
**Woman：**  
How about you give it a try, then?  
Here. You can use this.  
  
**Maho：**  
Thanks a million. ♪  
Here, this one's yours.  
Hehe. It's hard to pick what to write. ♪  
  
**Maho：**  
What are you going to write?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I wish that Maho's wish comes true.  
**Choice: (3)**  I wish that everyone will be happy.  
`Tag 2`  
**Maho：**  
M-my prince! You'd use your wish on me?  
You really don't hafta, though.  
Please write somethin' for yourself.

`Tag 3`  
**Maho：**  
Hehe. Still thinkin' of everyone else, even at times like this.  
That kindness'll definitely make your wish come true. ♪  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Maho：**  
Huh? What about me?  
I'll be wishing that the two of us can remain  
as prince and princess forever and ever, of course.  
  
**Maho：**  
Here's hopin' that  
our feelings reach the holy beast.  
  
**Woman：**  
Did you finish writing down your wish?  
In that case, let's all send the boats out to sea together.  
  
**Maho：**  
Yes'm. ♪  
Okay, put the paper on the boat...  
And off it goes.  
  
**Maho：**  
Boats containing everyone's wishes,  
sailing softly on the waves...  
  
**Maho：**  
It's a scene right out of a fairy tale.  
Look. Our boat's getting smaller and smaller  
as it drifts off into the distance.  
  
**Maho：**  
Make sure you reach the holy beast, now.  
  
**Maho：**  
Hm? What's the matter, my prince?  
Huh? Something doesn't seem right?

I don't want that to happen!

**Maho：**  
My prince?!  
  
**Maho：**  
Are you planning on swimming all the way to the boat?!  
But you said you still can't swim that well!  
  
**Maho：**  
You want my wish to be granted?  
  
**Maho：**  
Okay. This ain't the time to be standin' by.  
I ain't much of a swimmer myself, but...!

Oh... He's extending his hand out to me...  
It's just a shame that I don't have the energy to reach out...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Use your power.  
`Tag 7`  
**Maho：**  
Huh? He's... shining?  
It's that power of his... But he's not using it on me?  
Then who is he using it on?
