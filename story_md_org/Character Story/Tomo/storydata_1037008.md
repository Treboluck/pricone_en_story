# Tomo Episode 8
In another world, Tomo's grandfather sees the makings of a kendo master in {player}, and has him do a lot of housework in the name of \"training.\" Secretly, it was all a ruse to test if he would make a good husband for Tomo.
  
## Subtitle: Hidden Talents?!
  
**Tomo：**  
Thanks for the meal!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Whew, I feel kind of bad, actually.  
Having you feed me like this...  
  
**Tomo：**  
You're a better cook than I expected, {player}.  
You'll make someone a fine husband someday!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh yes, it was delicious.  
Lately I've been having all my meals  
at the Nightmare guard station...  
  
**Tomo：**  
And as you'd expect of military types, flavor isn't their strong point.  
So it was a really nice change,  
eating a meal that tastes like home for once.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha.  
 Since the Sarendia Orphanage's guildmaster, Saren,  
isn't here right now, I can't actually do the mission I came for...  
  
**Tomo：**  
But it would've been a shame to leave so soon,  
so it made me pretty happy when you invited me to stay for a meal!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hahaha.  
You really scratched my back today!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Of course...  
I'm sure you didn't mean it that way or anything.  
  
**Tomo：**  
A lot of people would try to curry favor with their inspector...  
But for better or for worse, you don't have the shrewdness  
to even consider that.  
  
**Tomo：**  
You were just genuinely trying to be nice.  
And frankly, that's the finest reception I could ask for.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hang on—  
I'll help you wash the dishes, {player}.  
It's the least I can do after that lovely meal.  
  
**Tomo：**  
As one of the newer recruits at Nightmare,  
I get stuck with this kind of work a lot, so I'm used to it.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Eheheh.  
And washing the dishes side by side  
makes us look almost like newlyweds!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Huh?  
You never knew I was good at housework?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh, you bet I am.  
I can cook, wash, sew—you name it!  
I've always been pretty good with my hands.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Heheh.  
Just the kind of girl you'd love to marry, right? ♪  
  
**Tomo：**  
Kidding, kidding...  
Sorry, I'm in weirdly high spirits today.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmm, I see. So it's your turn today  
to take care of the housework at the Orphanage.  
  
**Tomo：**  
But it's an awful lot of work  
cleaning the whole building on your own,  
so you'd appreciate a helping hand?  
  
**Tomo：**  
All right, then!  
I don't have much to attend to today,  
so I'd be happy to help out.  
  
**Tomo：**  
You do look a little tired, though.  
You're even stumbling a little...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Maybe you haven't had enough rest lately.  
Would explain why I found you asleep in the middle of the day.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh? You were up late last night for a part-time job?  
Guard duty, on the night watch?  
Well, that would wear anyone out.  
  
**Tomo：**  
So you got home in the wee hours of the morning,  
and slept right through to midday, huh?  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'm sure that kind of late-night work pays well,  
but it really messes with your daily rhythm.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Gotta be careful, {player}.  
Irregular sleeping patterns are pretty bad for your health.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Maybe you should leave the housework to me  
and go catch up on a little more shut-eye.  
  
**Tomo：**  
If you can just tell me  
where to find all the cleaning equipment...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Wait, huh?  
{player}?  
Did you fall asleep standing up?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Urgh?!  
Oh no... Not this mysterious light again!  
  
**Tomo：**  
It's too bright!  
Oh, crap, I'm gonna drop this plate if I'm not careful!

**Tomo：**  
Head!  
Body!  
Gauntlet!  
  
**Tomo：**  
And match!  
Haha. That was a pretty good workout! ♪  
  
**Tomo：**  
Thanks for training with me today, {player}.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Most of the dojo's members are real pros,  
so I usually get totally creamed...  
  
**Tomo：**  
I really needed to spar with a beginner  
to prop up my confidence a little.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Wait, huh?  
What's up, {player}?  
Why are you staring like that?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ohhhh... The sweat's making my kendo uniform go see-through.  
So, low-key perv that you are, you were sneaking yourself an eyeful?  
  
**Tomo：**  
No need to be so covert, you know...  
If you want to see a little skin, all you need to do is ask! ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I-I'll pass on that one.  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's see what you've got, then.  
`Tag 1`  
**Tomo：**  
Ahaha.  
Look at you panicking and stuttering.  
You're so much fun to mess with! ♪  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Tomo：**  
Huh...?  
Um, look, I was joking around.  
  
**Tomo：**  
You weren't supposed to actually take me up on it.  
  
**Tomo：**  
A-are you really that interested in my skin?  
I mean, with all the training I do, it's covered in scratches...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ah! You smirked!  
I see, I see... You joker.  
Got one over on me this time, didn't you?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tomo：**  
...Hmm?  
What's that? I think my grandfather's saying something.  
  
**Tomo：**  
What is it, Grandfather?  
Huh? I should call you \"Master\" when we're in the dojo?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Yes, yes... \"Master.\"  
So, was there something you actually wanted to say?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmmm...  
Could you be angry that I brought  
an outsider like {player} into the dojo?  
  
**Tomo：**  
That's not it?  
Oh...  
 Looks like this is your lucky day, {player}!  
  
**Tomo：**  
According to our master, you're a natural with the sword.  
You've got once-in-a-decade levels of potential!  
  
**Tomo：**  
So he wants to have you complete a special training course  
passed down in this dojo.  
  
**Tomo：**  
If you work hard, apparently you could even become  
the world's finest swordsman!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Pretty incredible, right?!  
I feel as proud as a parent right now!  
  
**Tomo：**  
What do you think? Want to try it out?  
Great! I knew you wouldn't let me down!  
  
**Tomo：**  
We can start right now!  
My grandfather's got a bad back and can't move around much,  
so I'll do most of the teaching!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Let's get down to some training! ♪  
  
**Tomo：**  
First up, let's see you clean the dojo!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Pick up the pace! But be nice and thorough!  
You can do it!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Once that's done, it's time to wash the uniforms!  
Then you're making lunch!  
  
**Tomo：**  
What's wrong? You're slowing down!  
You gotta give this your all!  
  
`image display end`  
**Tomo：**  
Right, now massage my shoulders!  
Be firm but gentle!  
Mmmm, that feels just right!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Your next task is picking weeds!  
After that, you'll be taking the dog for a walk!  
  
**Tomo：**  
...Hmm?  
Is something the matter, {player}?  
You look a little dissatisfied.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Don't get the wrong idea.  
This is just like those classic kung fu movies...  
  
**Tomo：**  
It's one of those cunningly disguised training regimens  
where seemingly mundane activities are actually honing your skills!  
  
**Tomo：**  
We're not just tricking you into taking care of  
all the chores we've been putting off!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ah... You don't believe me, do you?  
It's the truth, honest!  
 When have I ever lied to you? ♪  
  
**Tomo：**  
Don't think—feel!  
You can do it!  
  
**Tomo：**  
If you do a good job,  
I might even give you a special reward! ♪

**Ameth：**  
...And welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I know you go through a lot in these dreams,  
but this one really put you through the grinder, huh?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I've got to say, the Tomo over \"there\"  
really has you wrapped around her little finger.  
  
**Ameth：**  
If you end up marrying her,  
I think we know who'll be wearing the pants in that relationship.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hmm?  
 Oh, right. We cut things off a little early this time,  
so you don't know how it ended...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Truth is, that little training session you did with Tomo  
turned out to have an ulterior motive behind it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Though he claimed it was kendo training,  
that sly old fox was actually testing your housework skills  
to see if you'd make a good husband for his granddaughter.  
  
**Ameth：**  
For better or worse, you passed with flying colors,  
and he officially declared you Tomo's fiancé.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So believe it or not, the two of you actually started dating.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But I can't tell you how that goes.  
Because while you were still struggling  
to wrap your head around the whole situation...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Your life \"there\" was put on hold, and your futures cut short.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Even so, {player}...  
I know Tomo likes to joke around,  
but she did seem genuinely happy.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Maybe she's been having little dreams of her own  
about a happy life with you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's still in middle school, after all.  
Most girls that age fantasize about romance.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I know she's a little boyish, and doesn't seem the type to be into all that,  
but you can't always trust appearances.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You might have set her heart aflutter  
without even realizing it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And yet... those little seeds of romance  
were nipped in the bud before they could bloom.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's why it would be nice if you could try  
to make a little progress with Tomo on \"this\" side.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Nobody's forcing you together this time,  
so you're free to find your own way.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But ah well...  
I guess there's not much point telling you this now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Even so, I'm rooting for you,  
and I want you to find happiness.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's the truth. I'm not joking around.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So I hope you'll try your best out there to reach a brighter future.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Remember, {player}, I'm always on your side.

**Tomo：**  
Zzz... Zzz... ♪  
  
**Tomo：**  
Mnhh...  
Uh... unhhh?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Huh...?  
Was I asleep just now?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Wait, whaaaaa?!  
Why am I sleeping on top of {player}?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh... Right, yeah.  
{player} seemed to fall asleep on his feet,  
so I tried to lead him back to bed...  
  
**Tomo：**  
But halfway there, I was hit by a sudden wave of drowsiness myself.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I quickly tried to lay him down on the sofa,  
and that's the last thing I remember...  
  
**Tomo：**  
I must've collapsed right on top of him,  
and passed out completely...  
  
**Tomo：**  
I-I can't believe myself.  
Getting all cozy on top of a guy's chest like that...  
  
**Tomo：**  
If Grandfather caught wind of this,  
 he'd be all  
\"Make him take responsibility and marry you!\"  
I know he would...  
  
**Tomo：**  
As if any of this is actually {player}'s fault...  
Hardly the time for old-fashioned notions of \"responsibility.\"  
  
**Tomo：**  
...  
  
**Tomo：**  
{player}'s body is surprisingly sturdy...  
For all his sweet and innocent looks, I guess he's still a man.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Wait, why am I even thinking about that?  
Aghh, now my heart's started racing...  
  
**Tomo：**  
B-before I start getting any funny ideas,  
I should sit up and get some distance from him.  
  
**Tomo：**  
It looks like he still needs his beauty sleep,  
so I'd rather not wake him up now...  
Better get up nice and gently.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'll move slowly, and avoid making any noise...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Up we go...  
Aww, geez...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Why is it that when I'm around {player}  
my brain just turns to mush?  
It's so weird. I've never felt anything like it.  
  
**Tomo：**  
And yet...  
I can't bring myself to think  
that meeting him was a bad thing.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I mean, he's so fun to be around.  
Even as he drives me crazy, it sends happy shivers down my spine.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I don't know what's waiting for us in the future...  
But I hope you'll find out with me, {player}.  
  
**Tomo：**  
For the moment, you should get some rest...  
And when you wake up, let's talk about all sorts of things.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Chatting with you is my favorite pastime...  
I love it.
