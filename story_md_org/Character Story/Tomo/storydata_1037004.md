**Tomo：**  
One, two! Three, four!  
Go, go, Nightmare!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Whew...  
Today's training is pretty tough.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Patrolling the city at a run while shouting at the top of our voices?  
Talk about old-fashioned...  
I'm used to this kind of training from the dojo...  
  
**Tomo：**  
But when I see other girls my age  
strolling around in cute outfits  
and enjoying their day shopping with friends...  
  
**Tomo：**  
It does make me wonder.  
Am I wasting these precious years of my life?  
What am I even doing, you know?  
  
**Tomo：**  
I mean, it was me who chose this path, of course.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Even so, sometimes...  
I can't help but dwell on the things I've tossed aside,  
and feel a little depressed.  
  
**Tomo：**  
*sigh*... How stupid.  
I'm so worn out from all this running,  
it's gotten me into a real funk.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Gotta clear my mind.  
Focus on the task at hand.  
  
**Tomo：**  
...Hm?

**Royal Knight：**  
Eyes on the road, recruit!  
Letting yourself get distracted already?  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
If this is so easy for you,  
how does an extra three laps around the city sound?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahhh?!  
No, um, excuse me!  
I just need to attend to something!  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
Hey! Hold it!  
Where are you going?! Get back here, recruit!  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'm really sorry!  
When I get back, I'll do an extra three laps, or ten if you like!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Urgh...  
Why's it that nothing is going my way lately?  
  
**Tomo：**  
The plan was to be a good little recruit who follows orders,  
so I can work my way up the ranks of Nightmare...  
  
**Tomo：**  
But oh well.  
 Right now, I'm more worried  
about the guy collapsed over there.  
  
**Tomo：**  
That's gotta be {player}, right?  
What's he doing conked out in the street?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Doesn't look like he's just taking a nap...  
Was he attacked by a thug or a monster that got into the city?  
  
**Tomo：**  
After the weird things I ended up saying to him last time,  
it feels a little awkward to face him...  
  
**Tomo：**  
But this isn't the time to hesitate.  
He could be in real trouble.  
  
**Tomo：**  
{player}!  
Hey, what's wrong?  
Are you all right?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmm...?  
It looks like he's just fast asleep...  
In a place like this, though?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh—come to think of it... I think I saw a note about this  
in the intel documents covering {player}'s background.  
  
**Tomo：**  
It said he seems to be  
in contact with some kind of supernatural entity.  
  
**Tomo：**  
And sometimes that entity's influence  
causes him to display a sudden loss of consciousness.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Urgh...?!  
Wh-what's this light? Huh?  
It's so bright... I can't keep my eyes open!  
  

---  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hm?  
Hey there, {player}!  
Fancy seeing you in a place like this!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Better think fast!  
Rock, paper, scissors! ♪  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hahaha. Looks like I win!  
You've never been great with ambushes, have you?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Heheh. Well, since I beat you, you know you have a duty  
to do anything I say for the rest of the day, right?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Say what now?  
**Choice: (2)**  Your wish is my command.  
`Tag 1`  
**Tomo：**  
Ahaha.  
Slow on the uptake, aren't you?  
  
**Tomo：**  
I grew up in a kendo school, you know?  
When I challenge someone, I always play for keeps.  
  
**Tomo：**  
With my life on the line!  
The Mikuma school teaches that defeat means death.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Even the simplest of games counts as a challenge.  
It's winner take all. No exceptions.  
  
**Tomo：**  
And so, as the victor, it's no exaggeration to say  
that your very life is now mine to do with as I please.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Naturally, if you'd defeated me instead,  
I was prepared to submit myself to your every whim.  
  
**Tomo：**  
With a little luck, you could've had your way with me.  
But sadly for you,  
 this victory was mine!  
  
**Tomo：**  
So it falls to you to fulfill whatever mission I task you with.  
All clear? Any more questions?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Tomo：**  
Good, good.  
That's the {player} I know. Never a sore loser.  
  
**Tomo：**  
...Though it's actually a little off-putting  
if you don't protest in the slightest.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tomo：**  
At any rate.  
No need to worry—I don't have any unreasonable requests in mind.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Since we were lucky enough to run into each other,  
I was hoping you could help me beat a certain game.  
  
**Tomo：**  
As I recall, you're pretty hot stuff at video games, aren't you?  
  
**Tomo：**  
I've always looked up to your gaming prowess.  
Yes, unto each man a gift from the heavens is granted.  
And yours is a mastery of gaming!  
  
**Tomo：**  
You are no less than a gaming genius.  
That is what I truly believe.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'm *definitely* not just trying to butter you up  
so you'll be willing to go along with my idea!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Heheh.  
 Come on, see that machine over there?  
It's similar to those gun-shooting games that are all the rage lately...  
  
**Tomo：**  
But in this one, you actually play with a controller  
shaped like a sword!  
  
**Tomo：**  
The idea is to swing your blade this way and that,  
striking down an onslaught of ninja and samurai enemies.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I kind of promised  
I'd play this game with some friends from school.  
  
**Tomo：**  
And you see, since I'm from a kendo family,  
they all expect I'll master it flawlessly.  
They can't wait to see me demonstrate my swordsmanship.  
  
**Tomo：**  
But video games are quite different from reality.  
So I thought I'd better practice in advance  
before the pressure starts getting to me.  
  
**Tomo：**  
If possible, I'd rather not betray everyone's expectations.  
  
**Tomo：**  
But alas, this game's harder than I thought...  
So it'd be great if you could watch and give me some pointers.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ideally, I want to get good enough  
to reach the final stage without taking any hits.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Or if you prefer, we could play against each other instead.  
I could use a little break from this grueling solo training...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Going it alone has never been a strong point of mine.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha.  
Does that sound OK?  
Thank you. You really are as kind as they come!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Boy, am I glad to have a guy like you around!  
I'm so lucky to have met you.  
That's not another one of my jokes—I mean it!

**Ameth：**  
Aaaand welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just saw was basically a sort of dream.  
You'll forget it all as soon as you wake up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I put it together myself, based on the memories you two share.  
To use a weird metaphor, it's like an indie movie of mine.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Her more important memories seem to be buried pretty deep...  
I couldn't reach them this time, so you'll have to  
make do with this mundane scene for now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Of course, you probably don't understand a word I'm saying.  
But at any rate, you should be careful.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You see, the Nightmare guild that your new friend belongs to  
seems to have actually detected my presence somehow.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And since I'm in no state to defend myself right now,  
I'd really rather avoid attention.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So if possible, I'd appreciate it if you could try to avoid  
giving away anything about me.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I know when you wake up, you'll forget most of this conversation,  
but all the same, try to be careful if you can.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm counting on you, {player}.  
If Tomo gets too curious, try to change the topic for me.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Although... I don't think I've ever seen you  
outplay Tomo in the conversation game.  
She's got a real way with words, that one.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm sure you don't want to let a younger girl  
get the better of you forever, though...  
  
**Ameth：**  
So, well, just do your best.  
I'm rooting for you, {player}.  
  

---  
  
**Tomo：**  
Um, {player}...?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh, thank goodness! You're awake?  
Are you OK? You don't feel sick or anything?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Huh?  
Why are you backing away from me like that?  
  
**Tomo：**  
How awkward...  
Did I do something to make you dislike me?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh no, could it be...  
That love confession from the other day backfired?  
Is he getting embarrassed, or seeing me differently?  
  
**Tomo：**  
I... I didn't mean it!  
I just had to make something up  
so he wouldn't realize what I was really up to!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Wh-what do I do now...?  
I mean, it's not like I can come clean with him at this point...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Aahhh!  
Huh? Why are you touching my forehead like that?  
  
**Tomo：**  
M-my face was bright red, so you thought I might have a fever?  
N-no, I'm fine! But thank you for the concern!  
  
**Tomo：**  
W-well then, I should get back to my training!  
Next time you feel like taking a nap,  
try to do it at home in bed!  
  
**Tomo：**  
B-bye-bye!  
See you around, {player}!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahhhh...  
What's gotten into me?  
  
**Tomo：**  
When I think that {player} might be looking at me  
in a romantic light...  
 it makes my heart pound like crazy!
