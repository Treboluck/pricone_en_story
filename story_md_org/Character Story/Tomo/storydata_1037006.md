# Tomo Episode 6
Tomo and {player} discuss why they came to the forest, but Tomo realizes the plant she's collecting is melting her equipment with its secretions. Just before her shorts fall down, {player} steps in to help.
  
## Subtitle: Melting at the Seams
  
**Tomo：**  
Hey, {player}! Over here!  
I found some fruit!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Heheh.  
I'm pretty eagle-eyed, aren't I?  
  
**Tomo：**  
In swordfights, too, I rely less on strength  
and more on observing my opponent's motions,  
in order to strike when they're vulnerable.  
  
**Tomo：**  
So I'm proud of my eyesight.  
You can sing my praises if you like!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Whoa, don't pat my head and say \"Good girl\"!  
I'm not some kind of infant, you know,  
so try to treat me a little more like an adult!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Well, I suppose at thirteen, I am still pretty much  
a half-grown whelp in the eyes of society.  
  
**Tomo：**  
At any rate...  
This is going well, huh, {player}?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Me gathering my weapon-sharpening plants,  
and you filling your basket with fruits and mushrooms.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Since we're here for similar purposes,  
it's easy to help each other out.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I did wonder what could've brought you to the forest,  
but who'd have thought you were here to gather food!  
  
**Tomo：**  
These outskirt areas are relatively safe,  
but there are monsters living in this forest too, you know?  
  
**Tomo：**  
And foraging for food in the wild...  
Just how strapped for money are you, anyway?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmm.  
 So you've been doing a few odd jobs,  
but with all the supplies you needed to buy,  
most of your earnings vanished in a flash?  
  
**Tomo：**  
So you're putting in the effort  
to save cash by gathering your own food?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Well, that's, uh... pretty impressive.  
A fine attitude indeed!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh...? You've also got someone  
a bit like a little sister living with you?  
  
**Tomo：**  
So you need to make sure  
she's well provided for in addition to yourself?  
  
**Tomo：**  
She's still pretty young,  
so you'd rather not force her to work too hard, huh.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I get that. Kids should be kids.  
Playing the day away with fun and smiles.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmm? I'm still basically a kid,  
so I should play the day away too...?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Mind your own business!  
...Well, that might be putting it a bit harshly,  
but I'm fine. I chose this path for myself.  
  
**Tomo：**  
My family runs a swordfighting dojo, you know.  
For as long as I can remember, I've been training to become  
strong enough to make the world a better place.  
  
**Tomo：**  
If you don't use it to protect the things that matter,  
then swordsmanship is just a form of petty violence.  
  
**Tomo：**  
All I want is to be proud of the techniques  
passed down by my ancestors.  
  
**Tomo：**  
That's why I chose to join Nightmare,  
and defend peace and justice on the front lines.  
  
**Tomo：**  
So I can stand tall and say with confidence  
that I'm making a positive difference in the world.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That's amazing.  
**Choice: (2)**  What is justice, anyway?  
`Tag 1`  
**Tomo：**  
Haha.  
Not really. I'm still all bark and no bite.  
  
**Tomo：**  
No matter how admirable my goals may be,  
without the ability and achievements to back them up,  
there's no real weight behind them.  
  
**Tomo：**  
That's why I have to keep bettering myself  
until I can live up to my ideals.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I've been training, day in, day out, to achieve that.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Tomo：**  
Huh?  
Sheesh, {player}...  
You ask some tough questions sometimes.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I guess with your amnesia,  
there are lots of things you want to learn more about.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha.  
Well, sorry.  
 Much as I'd love to explain...  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'm still not grown-up enough  
to be able to pin down the true nature of justice myself.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Though I do hope someday I'll have the wisdom  
to answer that question with confidence.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tomo：**  
Eheheh... Even while we chat, our jobs are coming along  
pretty nicely with both of us working together.  
  
**Tomo：**  
That basket of yours is almost full of food.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Any more than that, and you'd probably struggle to carry it...  
So maybe it's about time we headed back home.  
  
**Tomo：**  
When the sun sets, the monsters get more active, too.  
I can handle a monster or two,  
but I'd rather not fight if we can avoid it.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahhhh?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh, don't worry!  
Sorry, I kind of squealed there!  
It's nothing, really!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh, crap! My shorts almost fell down!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Wh-why is this happening?  
Ahhh... Could it be these plants I'm collecting?  
  
**Tomo：**  
The potent liquid they secrete  
smoothens metal by eating away at it.  
  
**Tomo：**  
At the proper level of dilution,  
it's a valuable tool for sharpening weapons.  
But the stuff these plants are producing is pure and undiluted!  
  
**Tomo：**  
In no time at all, it's dissolved the fasteners holding my shorts in place!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Aaargh, I'm such an idiot!  
Why didn't I see this coming?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
I was having so much fun foraging with {player},  
I didn't even notice my own clothes melting!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Urghh...  
I guess I really am still a dumb kid...  
  
**Tomo：**  
No... It's fine.  
As long as I hold them in place,  
my shorts aren't going to slip off now.  
 I hope.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahhh, but then... I can't carry this basket with my hands occupied!  
Wh-what should I do?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmm?  
{player}, did you say something?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Me, I'm totally fine! No problems here!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Huh?  
You'd like to carry my basket for me, too?  
  
**Tomo：**  
You'd never have found all this fruit without my help,  
so you want to repay me?  
And carrying heavy baskets is good training, too?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Urgh...  
Honestly, that would be a huge help—more helpful than  
I can say, really—but it makes me feel kind of guilty.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Could he have noticed my predicament,  
and offered me an easy out?  
  
**Tomo：**  
He really is so kind...!  
  
**Tomo：**  
But no, he doesn't look like he's noticed.  
I think he must just be making a genuine offer.  
Is he just a natural charmer?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hee hee.  
But I guess that's all part of what I love about him.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Eheheh.  
All right, then—here's my basket.  
  
**Tomo：**  
For my part, I'll at least lead the way and clear the path.  
Let's keep working together, {player}.  
  
**Tomo：**  
If possible, for a long... long time.  
I'd love it if we could support each other for years to come.
