# Tomo Episode 7
Tomo pays a visit to the Sarendia Orphanage, and finds {player} asleep in his room. She explains that she came to conduct a routine inspection of the guild, but since Saren isn't around, she'll have to come back another day.
  
## Subtitle: Pure Yet Impure Feelings
  
**Tomo：**  
Show yourselves!  
...I mean, is anyone here?  
  
**Tomo：**  
As you should already be aware,  
my name is Tomo, and I was sent by Nightmare  
to conduct an inspection of the Sarendia Orphanage.  
  
**Tomo：**  
We're very thankful for your cooperation.  
  
**Tomo：**  
...Wait, huh?  
There's no one here?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh dear. I didn't get the wrong date, did I?  
Or is this another of the recent string of clerical errors?  
Maybe they never received the inspection notice?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmmm.  
The government certainly hasn't been on top of its game lately.  
It feels as though the palace is slacking on all its duties.  
  
**Tomo：**  
It's a pain for us at the bottom of the ladder,  
so I wish they'd get their act together.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ah well, though.  
Ehm... Hello there?  
I don't suppose there's anyone home?  
  
**Tomo：**  
No response, huh.  
I do sense someone's presence,  
so I don't think the whole place is empty...  
  
**Tomo：**  
But it doesn't feel like I'm being deliberately ignored, either,  
and I can't imagine why they'd do that anyway.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I suppose it's true that Nightmare and the Sarendia Orphanage  
have had a slightly strained relationship lately...  
  
**Tomo：**  
And thanks to that nasty incident Christina caused,  
I can forgive them for being wary of us.  
  
**Tomo：**  
But at the end of the day,  
we're both guilds under the Princess Knight banner.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I mean, that's why this kind of job—  
this official inspection—is our guild's responsibility in the first place.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Lately, I've been doing nothing but jobs like this...  
Aren't there any battles or skirmishes  
where I could put my swordsmanship to better use?  
  
**Tomo：**  
That said, though... The Sarendia Orphanage  
does happen to be where {player} is staying.  
  
**Tomo：**  
So just this once, I actually volunteered for the job  
in the hope that I might run into him.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Really, what am I playing at?  
Hmm... Maybe I'm not as capable as I thought I was.  
  
**Tomo：**  
At any rate... What now?  
I guess I'll have to look around and see who's actually home...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ummm...  
My instincts are telling me someone's over this way.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Excuse me!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh! Just as I thought.  
I knew I sensed someone in here!  
They're asleep in bed.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Is this their bedroom, then?  
It doesn't look especially lived-in...  
  
**Tomo：**  
But I can't just turn around and leave,  
so I guess I'll just have to see if I can awaken this poor soul.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ummm...  
Excuse me. Could you wake up?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Wait, huh?!  
I know that face... It's {player}!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Is this his bedroom I'm standing in?  
W-wooow... This feels weird!  
  
**Tomo：**  
So this is how he looks when he's asleep...  
Ahhhh, my heart's racing already!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Heheh. He's always had a youthful face,  
but he looks even younger at rest like this.  
  
**Tomo：**  
...Wait, I shouldn't just stare and smile!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hey, {player}! Wake up now!  
It's nearly lunchtime, you know! What a sleepyhead you are.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Honestly, what would you do without me?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Dutifully wake up.  
**Choice: (2)**  Blearily reach out and hug her.  
`Tag 1`  
**Tomo：**  
Oh, you're awake?  
Good morning, {player}! ♪  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Tomo：**  
Waaahhh?!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hey—{player}?!  
Are you still half asleep?  
Don't grab me like that!  
  
**Tomo：**  
H-honestly... You're such a handful.  
 Get those eyes wide open!  
It's morning! Rise and shine!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tomo：**  
Hmm?  
You look awfully surprised to see me, {player}.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh—I guess you're wondering why I'm here?  
That basically confirms my suspicions.  
The Orphanage really wasn't notified of my visit...  
  
**Tomo：**  
That's right. I came to the Sarendia Orphanage  
on an official mission today.  
  
**Tomo：**  
What you'd call a routine inspection.  
I'm here to check that the guild's finances are in order,  
and that kind of thing.  
  
**Tomo：**  
If I find any issues, I'm expected to give warnings,  
or even draw my sword if necessary.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahhh!  
Calm down—don't panic or anything!  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'm aware that the Orphanage's leader, Miss Saren,  
is a perfectly upstanding individual.  
  
**Tomo：**  
After all, she was even the previous vice-captain of Nightmare.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I've heard nothing but good things from the veterans who knew her.  
  
**Tomo：**  
So, well... This is really just a formality.  
I'll take a quick look around, confirm that nothing's wrong,  
and report back to my superiors.  
  
**Tomo：**  
To be honest, if they expected any trouble,  
they probably wouldn't have sent a lowly recruit like me.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Eheheh.  
With all their recent military investments,  
the palace finances are spread thin...  
  
**Tomo：**  
So I think they're hoping  
to identify a decent number of underperforming guilds  
so they can slash their budgets.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Even so... This is just my personal opinion, but...  
  
**Tomo：**  
The Sarendia Orphanage  
is a home and haven for children who have nowhere else to go.  
It deserves as much funding as we can give it.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I wouldn't dream of suggesting a budget cut here.  
That's my stance, so, well, try to relax a little.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'm no enemy to you or your friends, {player}.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha.  
That said, it looks like Saren isn't home right now...  
  
**Tomo：**  
And I wouldn't want to be a nuisance,  
so I'll come back another time.  
Maybe I'll see you again in a few days.  
  
**Tomo：**  
You can go back to sleep, {player}.  
Sorry for disturbing you today.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Heheh.  
I'm glad I at least got to see you and talk a little.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Well then, bye-bye.  
Sweet dreams, {player}.
