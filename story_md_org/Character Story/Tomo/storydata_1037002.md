**Tomo：**  
Hey, {player}! Over here!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha.  
I'm glad you could make it here today.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Though I'll have to dock you a few points for showing up late.  
It's bad manners to make a girl wait, you know?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh? It was your turn on cleaning duty today, was it?  
You're staying at a place called the Sarendia Orphanage,  
and helping out with chores in lieu of rent?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Well, if that's the reason, I can't judge you too harshly.  
But you did make me wait, so you'd better give me  
plenty of your time to make up for it!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Anyway.  
You don't mind if I speak casually with you, do you?  
  
**Tomo：**  
I've never been a big fan of stuffy formalities.  
I know you're older than I am, so I really ought to be polite, but...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I don't mind at all.  
**Choice: (2)**  How old are you, anyway?  
`Tag 1`  
**Tomo：**  
Thanks! I appreciate it.  
Well then, casual speech it is! ♪  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmm? You look like you're not sure  
what I even mean by \"casual speech\"...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Right, you're suffering from amnesia, aren't you?  
It's a bit tricky to actually explain, though...  
  
**Tomo：**  
Let's see.  
In this country, it's traditional to show respect to your elders  
by using more polite forms of speech.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Yes, I know...  
The world's just full of these irritating little rules, isn't it?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Tomo：**  
Oh, that's what caught your interest?  
I'm thirteen years old. Still just a kid, really.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha. I should warn you, though,  
it's usually considered bad manners to ask a girl her age.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Though I can't blame you for not knowing,  
since you're suffering from amnesia and everything.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Oh, no need to apologize!  
I'm actually quite enjoying the rare opportunity  
to teach someone these basic facts of life.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha.  
If you've got no memories,  
I guess you wouldn't even notice if I committed a faux pas.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Let's talk like equals, then!  
Trying to be polite to my elders only wears me out, anyway.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tomo：**  
At any rate.  
Sorry I made you come all the way out here today.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Yep. I did tell you the other day  
that I'd like to have a chance to talk properly.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I'm glad you remembered!  
You may be suffering from amnesia, but it looks like you're doing  
a better job with your more recent memories.  
  
**Tomo：**  
I see...  
So it's only your memories from before a specific point  
that have vanished completely.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Everything since then,  
from after you arrived here in the city,  
is as clear as day?  
  
**Tomo：**  
In that case...  
Do you recall that we actually met once  
before our meeting the other day?  
  
**Tomo：**  
That's right.  
We had a brief encounter at the job center, didn't we?  
  
**Tomo：**  
That must have been a few weeks ago now,  
so I'm touched that you remember our conversation.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha. Perhaps I'm just so cute  
that you couldn't forget my face after seeing it once?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahaha...  
I wasn't expecting you to say yes to that one.  
That's actually a little embarrassing...  
  
**Tomo：**  
I was only teasing!  
Now it's like you turned the tables on me...  
  
**Tomo：**  
How vexing. Usually, I'm pretty good at getting  
people who are older than me all embarrassed.  
  
**Tomo：**  
But you have this unique tempo of your own...  
It's hard to tell what you're thinking, which complicates things.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Though that's also fun in its own way! ♪  
  
**Tomo：**  
Haha. I was sent to investigate {player}  
as an official mission for Nightmare...  
  
**Tomo：**  
But I'm starting to feel kind of guilty about those motives,  
since he's such an innocent soul...  
  
**Tomo：**  
In the first place, why is everyone so wary of a harmless guy like him?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Well, if I get to know him better,  
maybe I'll be able to figure that out, too.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Sorry, {player}, but I have to do my duty as best I can.  
  
**Tomo：**  
...Hmm?  
Oh—I'm very sorry! Was I spacing out?  
  
**Tomo：**  
I mean, you're such a dreamboat,  
can you blame a girl for staring? ♪  
  
**Tomo：**  
Ahaha.  
You don't even know what \"dreamboat\" means?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Teasing a guy with amnesia really is a challenge.  
I was trying to distract you there with a sudden compliment!  
  
**Tomo：**  
But somehow you seem to manage to throw me off every time.  
Sheesh... This isn't like me at all.  
  
**Tomo：**  
What's wrong with me?  
When I'm talking to you, I feel...  
almost like I'm babysitting an infant! ♪  
  
**Tomo：**  
Eheheh.  
Well, we have lots of time, so let's enjoy our day together!  
  
**Tomo：**  
First, shall we order drinks and a meal?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Thing is, this morning, we had this training drill at Nightmare...  
It was a pretty rough workout. So I'm kind of starving!  
  
**Tomo：**  
If you haven't had lunch yet either,  
I'll treat you. Order as much as you like!  
  
**Tomo：**  
I've heard good things about this restaurant's food.  
Though the prices are high to match!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Heheh.  
This meal's technically part of the mission,  
so I can charge my expenses to the guild.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Chatting at length with an intriguing sort of guy,  
while enjoying a tasty meal together...  
As jobs go, this is a cushy deal!  
  
**Tomo：**  
When I signed up to join Nightmare,  
I was hoping to do battle with challenging foes...  
  
**Tomo：**  
But oh well!  
At least I'm having fun.  
  
**Tomo：**  
Hmm?  
You can't tell from the words on the menu  
what kind of dishes are available?  
  
**Tomo：**  
Amnesia strikes again, huh? Figures, I guess...  
All right, I'll explain them to you one by one!  
  
**Tomo：**  
Honestly, though...  
You can be such a handful, {player}! ♪
