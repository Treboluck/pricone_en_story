## Subtitle: New Beginnings, Together
  
**Narration：**  
{player} finds himself heading to a  
certain location to watch the first sunrise of the year  
alongside Yui, Rei and Hiyori.  
  
**Yui：**  
I'm really looking forward to seeing the  
first sunrise of the year together with everyone.  
  
**Yui：**  
You've been to the Affinity Plaza before, haven't you?  
  
**Yui：**  
You'd be hard-pressed to find somewhere with a better view  
in Landosol, so there's always a big crowd of people there  
at this time of the year.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are Rei and Hiyori not coming with us?  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
They are, but they had to stop by home first.  
They said they'll come join us later.  
  
**Yui：**  
Which is why we're going on ahead first.  
We won't be able to get a spot if we're too late.  
  
**Yui：**  
Okay. The lights are off, and the door's locked.  
Yup. We should be good to go now.  
  
**Yui：**  
Wow. I didn't expect such a big crowd at this time.  
Thank goodness we came early.  
  
**Yui：**  
Are there any good spots left, though?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  There's one over there.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
Huh? Where?  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh, you're right!  
Thanks!  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh!  
Sorry about that! I got a bit carried away!  
  
**Yui：**  
Let's see...  
Yup!  
There's enough space here for Rei and Hiyori as well!  
  
**Yui：**  
...  
  
**Yui：**  
This isn't good...  
Latching onto him like that's got my heart thumping like mad...  
  
**Yui：**  
It doesn't help that we're just coming off what happened  
during New Year's Eve, either...  
  
**Yui：**  
This should be a happy occasion.  
I'm spending New Year's Day with him.  
I need to calm down.  
  
**Yui：**  
I can't just sit here twiddling my thumbs, though.  
I need to make this fun for him! I need a topic!  
  
**Yui：**  
I-it's pretty cold, isn't it?!  
  
**Yui：**  
...  
  
**Yui：**  
Why am I bringing up the weather?!  
  
**Yui：**  
So much for having a nice, long conversation with him...  
*sob*  
  
**Yui：**  
I wonder how much longer Rei and Hiyori'll be...  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh?! It's already getting pretty bright!  
  
**Yui：**  
The sun'll rise before they arrive at this rate!  
  
**Yui：**  
I'm sorry, Mr. Knight.  
Rei and Hiyori might not get here on time...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm happy enough to see it with you.  
**Choice: (4)**  I was looking forward to seeing it with you anyway.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yui：**  
Huh?!  
U-um...!  
Same here!  
I'm really, really happy to see it with you!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Yui：**  
R-right!  
Same here! I was really, really looking forward to it!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Yui：**  
He must have noticed, right?  
That I was actually hoping we could all experience this together.  
  
**Yui：**  
It's amazing just how kind he is.  
  
**Yui：**  
Thank you,  
Mr. Knight.  
  
**Yui：**  
Hey, look! It's almost time!  
  

---  
  
**Yui：**  
Wow...  
It's even prettier than I imagined.  
  
**Yui：**  
It's getting brighter and brighter.  
The scenery ahead is so much clearer now.  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh. You're not afraid of heights, are you?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I'm fine here.  
`Tag 6`  
**Yui：**  
Well then. I'll leave this space for you,  
so feel free to come over if you feel like it.  
  
**Yui：**  
I'm not sure why, but it kind of feels like he's watching me as well.  
Or not. I'm probably just imagining it.  
  
**Yui：**  
He seems pretty pleased, though.  
That's a relief.  
  
**Yui：**  
...  
  
**Yui：**  
There's all sorts of other scenery like this that I want to see.  
Not by myself, but together with you.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Agreed.  
**Choice: (8)**  Guess we both feel the same way.  
`Tag 7`  
**Yui：**  
Did I let that slip?! Ahhh...  
I never realized that you felt the same way, though.  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Yui：**  
Huh? Wait. Did I just let that thought slip?!  
Do you really feel that way too, though?  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Yui：**  
Wow...  
I can't even begin to describe how happy that makes me.  
  
**Yui：**  
Here's to another great year, Mr. Knight.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yui! Mr. Knight!  
  
**Yui：**  
That sure sounded like Hiyori.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Woo, she heard us!  
They're over there, Rei! Let's hurry up!  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh, Rei's with her!  
They both made it on time!  
  
**Yui：**  
Thank goodness. We get to see this together with them.  
  
**Yui：**  
Though, well.  
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want a bit more alone time.  
  
**Yui：**  
Let's call out to them, Mr. Knight.  
  
**Yui：**  
Hiyori! Rei!  
  
**Narration：**  
Yui and {player} wave the two of them  
over together, a big smile on their faces.
