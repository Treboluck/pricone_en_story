**Narration：**  
Having finished up their mochi-pounding business,  
{player} tags along with Yui  
to visit a nearby temple.  
  
**Yui：**  
Sorry for all the trouble, Mr. Knight.  
Helping with the mochi was enough as it is,  
but you even agreed to come all the way here with me.  
  
**Yui：**  
It's normal for us to give out mochi to the people working here,  
so I'd have come along even if my parents didn't ask.  
But well...  
  
**Yui：**  
I was a bit anxious about coming on my own, if I'm being honest.  
So yeah. Thanks a lot.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I helped make it, so.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
Ah. Fair enough.  
You did do your fair share of the work.  
  
**Yui：**  
There's about as many people here as you'd expect  
on New Year's Day.  
Hopefully the priest is around...  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh, there he is!  
Hello!  
  
**Priest：**  
Well well, if it isn't Yui.  
I assume you were looking for me?  
  
**Yui：**  
I was. I've got fresh mochi for you.  
Feel free to eat it along with everyone else.  
  
**Priest：**  
Well now! That's quite the pleasant surprise.  
Thank you for coming all the way here.  
  
**Yui：**  
Not at all.  
You must be terribly busy today, though,  
so we'll take our leave.  
  
**Priest：**  
The consideration is appreciated.  
What say you offer up a prayer while you're here?  
  
**Yui：**  
Of course. That was the plan all along.  
Goodbye.  
  
**Yui：**  
Let's go line up, then.  
  
**Yui：**  
What're you going to wish for?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  That's my little secret.  
`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
Then I guess I'll keep my own little secret.  
  
**Yui：**  
Looks like it's our turn.  
Have you got a coin ready?  
  
**Yui：**  
Let's toss it in on three.  
One, two...  
  
**Yui：**  
Three!  
  
**Yui：**  
I hope I can become closer to Mr. Knight...  
  
**Yui：**  
Ouch!  
  
**Yui：**  
Something just hit my head...  
  
**Yui：**  
Eeek?!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You okay?  
`Tag 3`  
**Yui：**  
I-I'm fine!  
  
**Yui：**  
There's something small and cold pressing against my back!  
  
**Yui：**  
Wait. Is this someone else's coin?!  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight!  
Someone's coin landed inside my kimono!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'll get it out.  
**Choice: (5)**  Turn around for me.  
`Tag 4`  
**Yui：**  
Huh?! [[You]] will?!  
B-but...!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight?! Your hands are looking awfully suspicious there!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Yui：**  
L-let's slow down for a second, okay?!  
I'd, uh... Rather not let you do that here!  
  
**Yui：**  
How else can I get it out, though?  
I'll have to go somewhere else to take the kimono off  
if I don't let someone else do it for me.  
  
**Yui：**  
Undressing and redoing a kimono takes time, too...  
  
**Yui：**  
Which means... I don't have a choice.  
Now's not the time to be embarrassed! Yeah!  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight!  
Do you mind getting it out for me?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Leave it to me!  
`Tag 7`  
**Yui：**  
Th-thank you!  
  
**Yui：**  
Ah! His hand's making its way in...!  
  
**Yui：**  
Waugh! T-take it a little bit slower, please!  
I-it's really ticklish!  
  
**Yui：**  
W-wait! I'm really sensitive there!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  I've almost got it!  
`Tag 8`  
**Yui：**  
Huh?! Really?  
  
**Yui：**  
Mmm...! Hurry! I'm begging you!  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh... D-did you get it?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  I did.  
`Tag 9`  
**Yui：**  
Phew...  
Thanks.  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh? What's with all the ruckus around us?  
Did something, uh, happen while we were busy?  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Over here, officer! There's your criminal!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
I caught him dead in the act!  
He forced his hand into her kimono and did all sorts of things!  
  
**Yui：**  
Whaaat?! No, you've got it all wrong!  
He was trying his best to help me!  
  
**Man：**  
What say we have a friendly chat at the station?  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh no! He's really going to get arrested!  
  
**Yui：**  
Please, believe me! He's innocent!  
Don't lock him up!  
  
**Man：**  
Can I trust you on this, young lady?  
You're not being forced to say it?  
  
**Yui：**  
He absolutely, definitely would [[not]] do something like that!  
In fact, he was just helping me get a coin out of my kimono!  
That's how kind he is!  
  
**Man：**  
Very well. I'll take your word for it this time.  
Don't hesitate to come to the station if this happens again, though.  
Understood?  
  
**Yui：**  
Understood. I'm sorry for the trouble.  
  
**Yui：**  
Thank goodness...  
I honestly thought you'd earned a one-way trip to prison there.  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Huh. Well, guess it's no problem if it's her boyfriend.  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Bold of them to go at it so quick into the new year.  
And people wonder why I want all normies to go explode.  
Ahh... Guess I'll wish for a splendid boyfriend while I'm at it.  
  
**Yui：**  
W-wait, no! We're not like that!  
You've got it all wrong!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus Yui's passionate appeal both cleared  
{player}'s name and created a whole new misunderstanding.
