# Yui (New Year) Episode 2
A friend of Yui's passes by while she and {player} are pounding mochi together, immediately making the assumption that they're in a relationship. The sheer shock throws Yui's rhythm off, but she gets back on track after {player}'s kindness shines through once again.
  
## Subtitle: New Year's Teamwork
  
**Narration：**  
Having watched the first sunrise of the year together, {player} is helping Yui prepare mochi to be handed out by her family's store.  
  
**Yui：**  
That's the rice all nice and steamed.  
Perfect.  
  
**Yui：**  
Do you know what mochi is, Mr. Knight?  
I'm about to start making some.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Nope.  
**Choice: (2)**  I saw some at the temple.  
`Tag 1`  
**Yui：**  
Well. You see all this lumpy rice here?  
You shape it into individual mochi while pounding away at it.

`Tag 2`  
**Yui：**  
Yeah. The ones used as an offering there were  
made the same way.  
You shape this rice into  
individual mochi while pounding away at it.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Yui：**  
They were sitting there for a while,  
so you might think they'd become too hard to eat.But nope. Those offerings are meant to be eaten.  
  
**Yui：**  
Even if they go hard, they'll soften up if you steep them in  
water for a bit. They're easy to keep fresh,  
especially during this time of the year. Nice and handy.  
  
**Yui：**  
I'll do the pounding myself,  
so can you help mix it together for me?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You're doing the pounding yourself?  
`Tag 4`  
**Yui：**  
I am.  
Oh. Did you want to give it a shot?  
  
**Yui：**  
Normally we use a proper mallet for it,  
but this year I'm trying it with magic.  
It's a good way to train.  
  
**Yui：**  
A firm grasp on one's own magic makes it possible to use  
all sorts of spells.  
That's what I'm aiming for here.  
  
**Yui：**  
So... Do you mind helping me?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  It's my pleasure.  
`Tag 5`  
**Yui：**  
Thanks!  
  
**Yui：**  
I guess we can get started, then.  
First we toss out the water used to heat the mortar up.  
  
**Yui：**  
Then we wipe it down a bit, grab our rice...  
And throw it in!  
  
**Yui：**  
I need to pound it down so the rice all meshes together first.  
You can sit back and watch for now.

**Yui：**  
Right.  
Let's go!  
  
**Yui：**  
Off to a good start.  
This should go well,  
so long as I keep it precise and quick.  
  
**Yui：**  
Phew... That should be enough.  
  
**Yui：**  
It's your time to shine, Mr. Knight.  
Use your hands to mix the rice together  
each time I pound on it, okay?  
  
**Yui：**  
We need to be in sync, too, so try and keep that in mind.  
  
**Yui：**  
And with that said...  
Let's start!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Pound!  
`Tag 6`  
**Yui：**  
Pound!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Pound...!  
`Tag 7`  
**Yui：**  
I figured this would happen.  
He's adjusting himself to my pace...  
Whoa!  
  
**Yui：**  
That was close...  
  
**Yui：**  
I need to stay focused and make sure I'm extracting the  
right amount of magic. It'd be pretty dire if I messed this up.  
  
**Yui：**  
I-I might be a little bit in over my head...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Deep breaths, Yui.  
**Choice: (9)**  Don't pressure yourself. Stay relaxed.  
`Tag 8`  
**Yui：**  
O-okay.  
Got it!  
  
**Yui：**  
*inhale* *exhale*  
  
Jump to tag 10  
`Tag 9`  
**Yui：**  
Huh...  
I didn't even realize I was putting pressure on myself.  
  
**Yui：**  
Thanks for the advice. I appreciate it.  
  
`Tag 10`  
**Yui：**  
You're right, too.  
There's no need to strain my body when  
spellcasting is all about the psyche.  
  
**Yui：**  
I need to stay focused and converge my magic.  
  
**Yui：**  
Pound!  
  
**Yui：**  
Oh! That felt just right!  
  
**Yui：**  
The rest should go well if I can get myself used to this feeling!  
  
**Yui：**  
Hehe! You're getting better at this yourself.  
  
**Yui：**  
This reminds me, actually.  
Isn't this the first time we've worked together outside of combat?  
  
![108800202.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/108800202.webp)  
**Yui：**  
Wait. Really? The first time?  
We're having a first right here, right now?  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Oh, look at that. Yui's pounding mochi.  
It's always heartwarming seeing her  
help out with the family business.  
  
**Woman 2：**  
So she is.  
Look at the boy helping her out, too.  
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Positively so!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Nice going, Yui! You and your boyfriend are in perfect sync!  
  
**Yui：**  
Huh?! B-boyfriend?!  
  
**Yui：**  
No, no! You've got it all wrong!  
  
**Woman 1：**  
No need to hide it, dear. Heehee.  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Bold of you to start the year off with your lovey-dovey antics!  
  
![108800203.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/108800203.webp)  
**Yui：**  
Wait! I'm losing control of my magic!  
  
**Yui：**  
Eeeeeek!

**Woman 1：**  
Goodness!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Gracious!  
  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight?! A-are y-you okay?!  
  
**Yui：**  
Let me wipe that off quick!  
You might get burned!  
  
**Yui：**  
I'm so sorry...  
I shouldn't have let myself get all flustered...  
  
**Choice: (11)**  No problem. It was delicious.  
**Choice: (12)**  Don't worry. I was hoping for a little taste anyway.  
`Tag 11`  
**Yui：**  
Delicious? O-oh...  
I guess some of the mochi went right into your mouth.  
  
Jump to tag 13  
`Tag 12`  
**Yui：**  
Of course I'm worried!  
You might get hurt if I keep messing up like this!  
  
`Tag 13`  
**Yui：**  
I really, really appreciate your compliments.  
...  
But I also don't want to cause any more trouble for you.  
  
**Yui：**  
Let me do the rest on my own.  
I feel like I might just mess up again.  
  
**Choice: (14)**  I'll stick by you until the end.  
`Tag 14`  
**Yui：**  
Y-you can't!  
I don't want anything to happen to you!  
  
**Yui：**  
Are you sure? Really, [[really]] sure?  
  
**Yui：**  
I might mess up again. And again.  
  
**Choice: (15)**  Doesn't matter.  
`Tag 15`  
**Yui：**  
Mr. Knight...  
Thanks.  
  
**Yui：**  
Then let's give it another shot. I'll pull it off this time for sure.  
Then we can say we made some delicious mochi.  
Together, that is!  
  
**Narration：**  
With her spirits lifted once more,  
Yui returns to her mochi-pounding pursuits.
