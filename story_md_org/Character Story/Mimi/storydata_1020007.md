**Narration：**  
One day, when Mimi and {player} are out on a walk...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Going for a walk with Mr. Nice Guy is so much fun to do~♪  
Skippity-skipping along with a hoppity-hoppity-hop~♪  
  
**Mimi：**  
Hmm? I think my foot got caught on...  
...W-waaaahh!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Aahhh... I tripped right over...  
Waaaaahhh! My leg hurts!

`Tag 1`  
**Mimi：**  
Waahh...?  
M-mister? Are you patting me on the head?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Yayyy!  
Your hand's so big and warm, it makes me feel better!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Eheheh! Thanks for that, mister!  
I think I'm OK now!  
  
**Mimi：**  
...I guess this little tree root got caught around my foot,  
and that's what tripped me up!  
I should try to watch where I walk...  
  
**Mimi：**  
You know, I trip up all the time...  
And I always get lost, too...  
I wish I could be more grown-up and reliable...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Like, ummm...  
Like Misogi or Kyoka! I wanna be like them!  
They're both way more reliable than I am!  
  
**Mimi：**  
\"You need to pull yourself together, Mimi!\"  
That's what they'd always say...  
Eheheh.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Was that an impression of Kyoka?  
**Choice: (3)**  Was that an impression of Misogi?

`Tag 3`  
**Mimi：**  
N-no, of course not! I was trying to sound like Kyoka!  
Misogi would be more like... Um... ummm...  
  
**Mimi：**  
\"C'mon, Mimi! Hurry up or we're gonna leave you behind!\"  
Something like that!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Mimi：**  
You know, they're always there for me when I need help...  
They're my bestest friends!  
I love Misogi and Kyoka so much!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Huh? What do I like about them?  
Ummmm...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Well, Misogi is...  
She does play a lot of pranks...  
But she's always happy and full of energy! She's so much fun!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Full of energy like what?  
Umm... Ummmm... Oh!  
I know, I'll try doing another impression like before!  
  
**Mimi：**  
\"Hey, I'm Misogi! Ahahah!  
R-ready or not, I'm gonna play a prank on you, mister!\"  
  
**Mimi：**  
\"I'll put a ribbon on your head...  
And lace on all your clothes... Until you look all cute and girly!\"  
  
**Mimi：**  
...Huh? You think Misogi would play bigger pranks than that?  
What kind of pranks?  
  
**Mimi：**  
P-pitfall traps? Falling buckets?  
Aaahhh... I could never play pranks like that...  
Maybe I'll never be able to be like Misogi...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Huh?  
What about Kyoka?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Oh, well Kyoka is... She's super nice and really smart...  
She gets a bit angry sometimes,  
but only because she really wants to help! I love her!  
  
**Mimi：**  
What's she like exactly? Umm... Ummmm...  
  
**Mimi：**  
\"Hello, I'm Kyoka. Carrots are very delicious, aren't they?  
They're full of vitamins that are good for you.  
And... And...\"  
  
**Mimi：**  
Oh! \"Bunnies are very cute, aren't they?  
Cats and squirrels, too. They're all quite adorable.\"  
  
**Mimi：**  
...Wh-what do you think?  
Did I sound just like Kyoka?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  ...That's the cutest thing I've seen all day.  
**Choice: (6)**  What kind of vitamins do carrots have?  
`Tag 5`  
**Mimi：**  
Eheheh... Really?  
Thanks a bunch, mister!  
  
**Mimi：**  
W-wait... That's not right!  
I didn't ask if it was cute,  
I was asking if I sounded like Kyoka!

`Tag 6`  
**Mimi：**  
Huh...?!  
I-I don't know their names!  
  
**Mimi：**  
But... Kyoka would be able to answer that, wouldn't she?  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Mimi：**  
I wanted to sound  
all smart and stuff like Kyoka...  
But it's a lot harder than it looks...  
  
**Mimi：**  
Maybe becoming just like Kyoka  
is too hard for me, too...  
  
**Mimi：**  
...Huh?  
What's that, mister?  
I'm fine just the way I am? What do you mean?  
  
**Mimi：**  
No way! I'm no good if I stay like this!  
I don't have any good points at all!  
  
**Mimi：**  
You think I have... lots of good points too...?  
Really?! Like what, like what?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
I'm always kind...?  
And always smiling...?  
And I always look out for animals?  
  
**Mimi：**  
Wow, I see!  
Maybe I have good points after all!  
You're amazing, mister. How do you know me so well?!  
  
**Mimi：**  
When you say nice things about me,  
it makes me feel like maybe I don't need to change too much!  
  
**Mimi：**  
Eheheh... Thanks, mister!  
You know, I really love you too!
