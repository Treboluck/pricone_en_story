## Subtitle: The Treasure of the Marjan Coast
  
**Narration：**  
Today, {player} is helping Tamaki out  
with her beachside taiyaki stand.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Thanks for all your help, {player}!  
As a reward, I'll let you eat some of the crispiest bits of the taiyaki!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
C'mon, don't be shy! Say \"ahhhh\"...  
  
**Girl：**  
Nice taiyaki lady!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh, it's the girl I gave that shell to!  
Here to buy some taiyaki, are you?  
  
**Girl：**  
Yeah! I do want some, but also—look at this!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hmm? What's this sheet of paper?  
  
**Girl：**  
Eheheh... It's a treasure map!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
T-treasure?! An honest-to-goodness treasure map?!  
  
**Girl：**  
Yep! It's my thanks for the shell!  
You should go find it together with that nice guy!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Huh? Wh-why do you say that?  
  
**Girl：**  
'Cause! The two of you are girlfriend and boyfriend, right?  
So he can protect you when you go adventuring!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
B-b-b-boyfriend?! Him?! Don't be ridiculous!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
But... D-do we look like that?  
That makes my whiskers tingle...  
  
**Girl：**  
It's kinda dangerous, so make sure you go together!  
See you later!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
W-well then...  
Looks like we've got some treasure to find after work today!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hmm... It's a bit dark out,  
 but the map did say the treasure  
only appears at night, so let's get looking.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Isn't this kind of suspicious?  
**Choice: (2)**  Could that girl be playing tricks on us?  
`Tag 1`  
**Tamaki：**  
Hmmm... There is something fishy  
about a nighttime-only treasure...

`Tag 2`  
**Tamaki：**  
She didn't seem like the type of girl to play elaborate tricks...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tamaki：**  
But let's see for ourselves!  
You never knyow, it could be a really incredible treasure!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Lessee... First we have to head east.  
Looking at this landmark... I guess the treasure's on the beach.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hmmm... I don't see anything lying around here.  
And it wouldn't be buried under all that sand, right?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Let's walk along the coast and see what's around!  
It's worth going a bit further!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Well, we managed to find a hidden cave...  
But maybe this was a bad idea.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Is it just me, or are we totally lost?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I mean, this map doesn't say anything about the cave's layout...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Wh-wh-wh-what do we do now?!  
What if we nyever find our way out...?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
This cave's all gloomy and full of weird-shaped rocks, too...  
It's starting to creep me out...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Look, over there! Don't those holes look just like a face?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Kidding, kidding!

**Tamaki：**  
...Myearrrghh?!  
 Don't grab my tail all of a sudden!  
I was just messing with you, that's all!

**Tamaki：**  
Ehhh?! Did I hear a girl's voice wailing in the dark?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
And there's something down by our feet! I stepped on something!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hey! Why are you grabbing me like that, anyway?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Huh?  
 Oh... I was the one who grabbed you...  
I'm sorry... I guess I lost my cool a little...

**Tamaki：**  
Myaaaghh! I tripped over something!  
It's like a curse! This cave must be cursed!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Mysterious forces are attacking us at every turn  
to stop us taking their treasure!

**Tamaki：**  
Myahhh... Somehow I feel totally worn out...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hmm? I-is that the cave's exit?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Quick! Let's get out of this nyasty place!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Huh? This is... the Marjan Coast...  
So the cave led all the way here, huh?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hmm? What is it nyow? Why're you pointing up?  
  

---  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myahhh... What a beautiful starry sky!  
I've never seen the stars look so big and sparkly!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It feels like they might rain down on top of us...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myahh?! A shooting star really fell down!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I knyow it must be miles and miles away,  
but it feels almost like it landed right nearby...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It'd be like... Yeah... About the size of that rock...  
  

---  
  
**Tamaki：**  
W-wait, that rock?! It looks just like the one drawn on the map!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Let's try digging underneath the rock!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...Hmm? C-could this possibly be...?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It is! It's a treasure chest! We finally found it!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Let's see what's inside...  
 A pile of shells... and a letter?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ah! These shells... They're all cat-shaped!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
The letter says...  
 \"This is the prettiest spot on the beach.  
Have fun with your boyfriend!\" A message for me...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Then these shells...  
That little girl must have collected them as a present!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  What did the letter say?  
**Choice: (5)**  Did you find the treasure?  
`Tag 4`
