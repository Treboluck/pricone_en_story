**Narration：**  
Christina and {player} continue their seasonal date.  
Right now, they find themselves on the slopes of a frigid mountain.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah! ☆  
This silvery vista stretching out before us!  
Doesn't it strike you as magnificent?  
  
**Christina：**  
Simply strolling around the city would be the height of tedium.  
A special occasion calls for treacherous new locales, does it not?  
  
**Christina：**  
Only then can this date truly be festive!  
Well? Wouldn't you agree, lad?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Um, not really...  
`Tag 1`  
**Christina：**  
Oh? Then what? This isn't enough turmoil and danger for you yet?  
My, you're so difficult to please! ☆  
  
**Christina：**  
Very well—leave it to me!  
In deference to your suicidal cravings,  
I'll find a date spot that will overwhelm your entire body!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Stop her.  
`Tag 2`  
**Christina：**  
What? It's your turn to escort me now?  
  
An intriguing proposal.  
I'm fascinated to see what you have planned.  
  
**Christina：**  
...Of all the locations you could bring me, the lonely city outskirts?  
What do you plan to do to me in such a secluded locale?  
  
**Boy：**  
Sis, look at me!  
I'm skating! I'm really skating!  
  
**Girl：**  
Oh, well done!  
Hold on, I'll skate over too!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm... I see a gathering of people.  
But what could they possibly...  
 Oh?  
  
**Christina：**  
Is this a frozen layer on the ground?  
The surface is so smooth, it's almost like a mirror.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah, I see. So this place is an icy stage prepared by nature itself!  
The common folk have gathered to revel in its slippery delights!  
  
**Christina：**  
You wished to share with me  
an experience unique to this season...  
  
**Christina：**  
An insight born from your habitual wandering of these streets.  
Interesting, very interesting.  
  
**Local：**  
Whaddaya say, Miss Glamorous?  
Want to try on a pair of these for yourself?  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah... They're even offering rental skates.  
The locals here are so enterprising! ♪  
A prime business opportunity well seized!  
  
**Christina：**  
Very well, I'll take the lad up on his idea.  
Give me a pair of those skates, if you please!  
  
**Local：**  
Sure thing. My pleasure!  
Young man, don't let your lady slip and fall, now!  
  
**Christina：**  
That's right, lad!  
Don't forget to hold your beloved Christina tight! ♪  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'll show you the ropes.  
**Choice: (4)**  Nod silently.  
`Tag 3`  
**Christina：**  
Oh? What a manly response.  
Perhaps you won't be letting me call you a lad much longer! ♪  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Christina：**  
I like the look in your eyes.  
The lad I knew is growing into a fine man already! ♪  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Christina：**  
...  
  
**Christina：**  
...Lad?  
Um, young lad...  
  
**Christina：**  
Didn't you just make me a promise?  
That you wouldn't let me fall?  
And you seemed so confident about it, too.  
  
**Christina：**  
Yet since then, you've treated me to nothing  
but a series of your own icy pratfalls...  
  
**Christina：**  
At first, I took it for an attempt to entertain,  
but at this point...  
 I have to assume you're being serious.  
  
**Christina：**  
You're barely even succeeding to stand in place.  
Can it really be so difficult?  
  
**Christina：**  
All we need do is slide along the ice  
on the blades attached to these shoes, yes?  
  
**Christina：**  
Such a task should be child's play...!

**Christina：**  
There, you see?  
It's trivial! ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
Yes... I need only picture a firm core  
running from the blade through the top of my head.  
  
**Christina：**  
Far simpler than doing battle on a snare-strewn path.  
It doesn't even require practice.  
  
**Christina：**  
Now that I know the basics, I can crouch down and accelerate...  
  
**Christina：**  
...swivel while in motion to skate backwards...  
  
**Christina：**  
...or harness my momentum to twirl upon one foot!  
  
**Boy：**  
Hey, look!  
That lady's really good at this!  
  
**Girl：**  
She's beautiful!  
I wanna learn to skate like that...  
  
**Christina：**  
Hahah. With such an enraptured audience watching,  
I may have to show off a little!  
  
**Christina：**  
Lad, behold a master at work!  
How's this for a trick?!  
  
**Local：**  
Did she just leap clean into the air?!  
And then spin... four whole times?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hah. And a perfect landing! ☆  
This isn't a bad feeling—it sets my blood racing!  
 Hm?

`image display end`  
**Christina：**  
What's that? There's a spot of uneven ice ahead.  
This may be a problem—  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Leap out in front of her.  
`Tag 6`  
**Christina：**  
But I won't lose my footing—  
 Wait. Young lad?!  
Why are you rushing at me?!  
  
**Christina：**  
...Ahh, it seems I fell in the end.  
Though thanks to this handy human cushion, I'm largely unscathed.  
  
**Christina：**  
I must say, though, your actions were most unwarranted.  
Did you think I couldn't recover from a minor stumble?  
  
**Christina：**  
Still, in that one instant,  
it looked like you skated rather ably.  
  
**Christina：**  
Seeing me in danger  
allowed you to overcome your own struggles.  
  
**Christina：**  
Heh. Pushing yourself so far for me... I'm actually flattered.  
You've earned my respect, boy.  
  
**Christina：**  
Let's see... You've shown you can skate if you try.  
So while it's fresh in your mind,  
I'd better train you so hard that you'll never forget it! ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
Come, take my hand...  
No, wait. You're still the one escorting me.  
  
**Christina：**  
Don't just stand there.  
Hurry and offer me your hand, {player}.  
  
**Christina：**  
...Very good.  
Now, let us glide across the ice as one! ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
I won't let you rest until you've fully mastered the art!  
  
**Narration：**  
And true to her word,  
Christina gave {player} an extended skating lesson  
without so much as a moment's respite.
