**Narration：**  
While most citizens of Landosol are enjoying the festive season,  
Christina wanders the streets alone.  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah, how tedious.  
  
**Christina：**  
The common folk become so excitable at this time of year,  
but it's far too banal to provide me with stimulation.  
  
**Christina：**  
If only some manner of conflict were to arise, I could leap into the fray  
and take out some of this frustration...  
  
**Christina：**  
But this mood of jollity and goodwill  
only keeps the city more peaceful than ever.  
  
**Boyfriend：**  
Where shall we go next?  
  
**Girlfriend：**  
As long as I'm with you, anywhere sounds wonderful!  
  
**Boyfriend & Girlfriend：**  
Hee hee... Ahaha... ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh, all this amorous nonsense...!  
What possesses them to indulge in it?  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm... Would I enjoy it if I were in that position?  
  
**Christina：**  
...Perhaps it's worth a try! ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
At least if I drag someone along,  
their reactions will spice up this dreary scene! ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
...Coming in!  
  
**Christina：**  
Christina Morgan makes her grand entrance into your abode!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm. Security is as lax here as ever.  
I was able to enter your dwelling without any obstruction.  
What if someone like me were to take advantage, hmm? ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Good morning.  
`Tag 1`  
**Christina：**  
Good morning! ☆ Those bleary eyes... Have you just awoken?  
Far from \"morning,\" the day is almost at its peak.  
Hardly the hour to be dozing away.  
  
**Christina：**  
But forget that—listen, lad!  
The great Christina is here to invite you on a festive date!  
  
**Christina：**  
Why cock your head in confusion?  
The festive season is in full swing!  
It's the perfect occasion to pursue a little romance!  
  
**Christina：**  
And I, of all people, have chosen you as my partner!  
You should surely be leaping and dancing for joy!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm? You still seem decidedly confused.  
Ah, it must be your amnesia.  
Of course, of course. Well, that also makes things entertaining.  
  
**Christina：**  
In that case, allow me to teach you  
the proper way to enjoy these festivities!  
Though it may not be a painless lesson!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Run for it.  
`Tag 2`  
**Christina：**  
Don't you know, my dear?  
Nobody can escape from me!  
  
**Christina：**  
It's the height of rudeness to flee in the face of such stunning beauty.  
And while I'm courting you with such passion, too! ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah! ☆ The talk of pain was my little joke.  
But I should praise your instincts.  
You wouldn't last long on a battlefield without them!  
  
**Christina：**  
Anyway, you have no choice in this.  
Surrender yourself to stave off my boredom! ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
Now, let our thrilling festive diversion begin!  
  
**Christina：**  
There's that confusion on your face again. What is it now?  
...My clothing?  
 Ah, this outfit intrigues you?  
  
**Christina：**  
I said this is a festive date, did I not?  
It's only right to dress up for such an occasion.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  It suits you.  
`Tag 3`  
**Christina：**  
But of course. It would be difficult to find a clothing item that does not!  
Still, that was nicely said, lad.  
  
**Christina：**  
I tire of excessive praise from those who seek to flatter me.  
A plain, concise compliment makes a nice change.  
  
**Christina：**  
Let's keep this up and enjoy our seasonal date to the full!  
Although for a date, I feel we are still a little distant.  
If we're doing this, I'd like to do it properly...  
  
**Boyfriend：**  
Hey, do you... want to hold my hand?  
  
**Girlfriend：**  
Of course! Here, let's intertwine our fingers!  
  
**Boyfriend & Girlfriend：**  
Hee hee... Ahaha... ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
...Hmm.  
Lad, give me your hand.  
  
**Christina：**  
Holding hands with fingers entwined...  
Like this, I suppose?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Help... Hand being... crushed...  
**Choice: (5)**  Squeeze back hard.  
`Tag 4`  
**Christina：**  
Oh, how pitiful.  
Well, if I were to apply more pressure, your thumb may snap off...  
But that's enough joking. I wouldn't want you to flee again.  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Christina：**  
Ah...! That's a fine grip you have.  
Perhaps you're more manly than I thought...! ♪  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Christina：**  
Still, I see.  
This does result in more contact than linking hands normally.  
  
**Christina：**  
How's this, lad? I hear it's sometimes known as a lovers' clasp!  
Hmm... Your face doesn't exactly look impressed.  
  
**Christina：**  
Mere handholding doesn't faze you, eh?  
Well, I suppose you're experienced with such things.  
  
**Christina：**  
Then how about this?  
If we link our arms as well... This seems more intimate still, does it not?  
  
**Christina：**  
...You still seem very calm.  
I must say, I was anticipating a more flustered reaction!  
  
**Christina：**  
I'm doing my best to woo you with physical flirtations.  
Must you seem so utterly oblivious?  
  
**Christina：**  
Or are you saying... you don't find me attractive in the slightest?  
That would actually be a shock...  
  
**Christina：**  
I originally intended this date as a mere diversion.  
A way to tease him and amuse myself.  
  
**Christina：**  
But perhaps I took him too lightly...  
  
**Christina：**  
Still, this too has its appeal!  
Even outside of combat, I enjoy conquering a challenge! ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
Well now! If these efforts were ineffective,  
what mode of attack should I try next?  
  
**Boyfriend：**  
Will you close your eyes for me?  
  
**Girlfriend：**  
Yes, of course...!  
  
**Boyfriend & Girlfriend：**  
...  
  
**Christina：**  
...Those two are beginning to irritate me!  
I find myself reaching for my blade's hilt...  
  
**Christina：**  
That said... Even with all his stubbornness...  
  
**Christina：**  
The lad will surely be swayed if I steal his very lips.  
  
**Christina：**  
No, but wait. If he remained unmoved even then,  
I'd be forced to draw my blade.  
I might slay him before I can stop myself.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm... I'm not so pure as to begrudge a mere kiss,  
so what is this hesitance I feel?  
Bizarre. ...  
Is it because it's him?  
  
**Christina：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Move closer to Christina.  
`Tag 7`  
**Christina：**  
...Hm?  
What now, lad? Why are you leaning in?  
  
**Christina：**  
Could it be you're imitating that couple?  
...  
Are you serious, lad?  
  
**Christina：**  
I don't know if you're attempting to catch me off guard,  
but you should be aware that I hate to lose.  
  
**Christina：**  
You won't get me to retreat.  
If you're casually teasing, I'd advise you to rethink.  
  
**Christina：**  
I never betray my vows.  
You will only be testing your own resolve.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Get on tiptoes.  
`Tag 8`  
**Christina：**  
...!  
Very well. I accept your challenge...!  
  
**Christina：**  
...  
  
**Christina：**  
Should I close my eyes? The mood is... well, not awful.  
My heart is even racing. As if I were an innocent maiden!  
  
**Christina：**  
This lad... I knew he was difficult to predict,  
but he really does know how to keep me on my toes!  
  
**Christina：**  
After making an absolute vow,  
I cannot falter even if my lips are stolen!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Finally make physical contact.  
`Tag 9`  
**Christina：**  
...!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hm?  
  
**Christina：**  
...Boy.  
Why are you patting me on the head?  
  
**Christina：**  
There was snow on my brow?  
Ah... That's why you were reaching toward me?  
  
**Christina：**  
I see... Thank you.  
I appreciate your consideration for my appearance.  
  
**Christina：**  
By the by, lad.  
For some reason, I feel quite heated right now.  
...I trust you won't complain if I swing my sword in your direction?  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Run for your life.  
`Tag 10`  
**Christina：**  
Not so fast! ♪  
  
**Boyfriend：**  
Oh, please! Wait for me, honey!  
  
**Girlfriend：**  
Oh, darling! Catch me if you can~! ♪  
  
**Boyfriend & Girlfriend：**  
Hee hee... Ahaha... ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahahahah! ☆  
Wait for me, boy! ♪  
  
**Narration：**  
And so, amidst the seasonal cheer that filled the streets of Landosol,  
a pair of lovebirds enjoyed a playful pursuit.  
  
**Christina：**  
...Hahah.  
I'm enjoying this date already! ♪
