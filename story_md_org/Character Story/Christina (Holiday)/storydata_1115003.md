**Narration：**  
As Christina and {player} tour the city together,  
they find the sun is setting before they know it.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm. I'll buy that outfit as well.  
Lad, wait here.  
  
**Christina：**  
Actually, I should also get new shoes to match.  
Forget trying them on. I'll take these, and these, and...  
these ones as well.  
 Don't drop them, now.  
  
**Christina：**  
Hm? Young lad, are you staggering?  
From carrying a mere ten or twenty shopping bags?  
Your strength needs work.  
  
**Christina：**  
I know—let me help you train by adding a few extra on top! ☆  
Conveniently enough, I see a store just over there  
selling some familiar-looking plate armor!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahah!  
I'm joking. Don't make that strained face.  
You'll make me want to tease you further! ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
...I intended this date as a way to stave off tedium,  
but I'm enjoying it more than I thought.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That's good to hear.  
`Tag 1`  
**Christina：**  
Of course, once it's over, it'll be back to the same old doldrums.  
  
**Christina：**  
I've played many roles in my life, you know.  
  
**Christina：**  
Most notably as a fighter, but also a manager, producer...  
I've tried so many things to slay my curse of boredom.  
  
**Christina：**  
Yet that nemesis plagues me still,  
never remaining slain for long.  
  
**Christina：**  
Today's seasonal date is no different.  
I tried enjoying this \"normal\" activity,  
but once it ends, the battle will simply begin anew.  
  
**Christina：**  
What would it take to leave me truly satisfied?  
  
**Christina：**  
...Ah, no. Ignore my empty rambling.  
It's of no consequence.  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Christina!  
You're Christina Morgan, aren't you?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm?  
I won't deny it—I am that peerless luminary,  
Christina in the flesh! ☆  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
It's been too long, Christina!  
Do you remember me... no, remember us?!  
  
**Ruffian 3：**  
I won't let you say you've forgotten!  
Not after the brutal thrashing you gave us!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm. I can't recall!  
  
**Ruffians：**  
Why, yooooouuuu!  
  
**Christina：**  
If you wish to be remembered, try changing those stock hairdos  
and hackneyed manners of speech, why don't you?  
  
**Christina：**  
Hmm. No, perhaps that would do you no good.  
The small-fry aura seeps forth from every cell in your bodies.  
Ah, some diseases are beyond curing! ☆  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
You're as irritating as ever...!  
But look! I've brought a whole crowd of men you've wronged in the past!  
It's time you finally paid your dues!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ahahahah! ☆  
I'm afraid I always pay in cash. I owe no debts to anyone!  
  
**Christina：**  
Still, settling scores in this festive season?  
You must be a lonely bunch.  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Sh-sh-sh-shaddup!  
What's the season got to do with it?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah, such a sorry sight.  
Your wretchedness almost tempts me  
to take some shred of pity upon you.  
  
**Ruffian 3：**  
Y-you wanna fight?!  
It's more than ten against one, you know?!  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Even you can't make it out unscathed from this!  
  
**Christina：**  
Well, let's see. Though I can't say I recall your ires,  
I don't like to leave debts unpaid.  
I suppose I may as well return your claims with interest!  
  
**Christina：**  
Hah. In the end, this is all that satisfies me.  
The taste of blade upon blade, answering blood with blood.  
Such is the life of Christina Morgan.  
  
**Ruffians：**  
Let's get her, guys!  
  
**Christina：**  
My only place is here on the field of battle!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Leap in between them.  
`Tag 2`  
**Christina：**  
Wha—?!  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Who the hell are you?!  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Move it, brat! You wanna get killed?!  
  
**Ruffian 3：**  
It's that woman we've got beef with!  
You stay outta this!  
  
**Christina：**  
These rascals are right, lad.  
Don't stand in the way of my gratification! ♪  
  
**Christina：**  
They may have no strength, brains or dignity,  
but I can't refuse a call to battle!  
  
**Christina：**  
I'm sure you must be perfectly aware by now  
that they pose me no threat.  
  
**Christina：**  
Now hurry and step aside.  
If you remain there,  
 my blade might just slip through your flesh.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Bow down to the angry men.  
`Tag 3`  
**Christina：**  
Wha...?  
Hold on. Lad...!  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
The hell d'you think you're doing?!  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Some punk's apology isn't gonna—  
  
**Christina：**  
That's enough yapping from you!  
  
**Ruffians：**  
Eeek...?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Young lad. What's the meaning of this?  
When did I ask you to debase yourself?  
  
**Christina：**  
You don't think I could lose to these riffraff, do you?  
That would be a grave insult indeed!  
  
**Christina：**  
If you insist on standing in the path of my pleasure,  
there are limits to what I can—  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Satisfying you is my job, not theirs.  
`Tag 4`  
**Christina：**  
...!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ah...  
Yes, I see.  
 Ahahahah!  
Indeed... You're completely right, lad.  
  
**Christina：**  
I suppose I must apologize.  
To think I would make eyes at these other men  
in the middle of our festive date. It seems the fault here is all mine.  
  
**Christina：**  
That was too thoughtless of me.  
I'm sorry.  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
H-hey...!  
  
**Christina：**  
Well, you heard the lad!  
My tedium has a prior engagement!  
So it's time you all hurried off! ♪  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
I-is this a joke?!  
Our grudges aren't gonna be settled by...!  
  
**Christina：**  
Otherwise, it is not me,  
but this young lad to whom you must all answer.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  ...Huh?  
`Tag 5`  
**Ruffian 1：**  
S-say what...?  
Wh-what's that feeble brat got to do with it?!  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
H-hold it! This is Christina, remember?!  
And she's spending the year's special season with this guy.  
Surely he's gotta be a monster in his own right...?!  
  
**Ruffian 3：**  
Just look how calm he is!  
Almost like he's spacing out,  
 but in this situation, it's just scary!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Cock your head in puzzlement.  
**Choice: (7)**  Yawn.  
**Choice: (8)**  Drop your sword in shock.  
`Tag 6`  
**Ruffian 1：**  
H-he cocked his head at us...!  
Is he trying to say he could snap all our necks...?!  
  
**Christina：**  
My, my. The young lad seems angry!  
It's enough to send chills down my spine.  
Ahahahahah! ☆  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 7`  
**Ruffian 2：**  
U-uwaaaghhh!  
This guy... Did he just yawn in the face of certain peril...?!  
  
**Christina：**  
H-haha. It seems the lad  
could take every one of you in his sleep.  
Ahahahahah! ☆  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Ruffian 3：**  
H-he threw his sword aside?!  
So he thinks his fists are good enough for us...?!  
  
**Christina：**  
Oh, you've really made the lad angry now.  
 Just watch his hands.  
Those small shivers—he can barely restrain himself.  
Ahahahahah! ☆  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Christina：**  
Now, what will it be?  
Shall we paint this season a jolly red?  
Though it will soon vanish into the pure white snow! ♪  
  
**Ruffians：**  
W... W...  
  
**Ruffians：**  
We won't forget thiiiiiiis!  
  
**Christina：**  
...Pfft!  
  
**Christina：**  
Ha... aha... ahahahahahah! ☆  
Hilarious! That was quite the delight, lad!  
  
**Christina：**  
I haven't laughed so hard in years!  
Ah, tears of mirth are pouring from my eyes!  
  
**Christina：**  
I've tried many things to slay my plague of tedium,  
but thanks to you, I've learned something new.  
  
**Christina：**  
Be I a fighter, or a manager, or a producer...  
  
**Christina：**  
...Or even an ordinary woman.  
  
**Christina：**  
No matter how I live this life of mine...  
  
**Christina：**  
Young lad.  
With you by my side, I doubt I'll ever be bored again! ♪  
  
**Narration：**  
As she gazed at {player} with newfound appreciation,  
a surprisingly mellow smile spread across Christina's face.
