**Narration：**  
One day, Chika arrives at the sea, looking for somewhere  
she can practice singing to her heart's content.  
  
**Chika：**  
I've been feeling great ever since the concert...  
I guess I have {player} to thank.  
  
**Chika：**  
That should be enough practice for today—  
Oh? Speak of the devil...  
  
**Chika：**  
Hello.  
What are you doing today?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Slaying sea monsters.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chika：**  
Slaying monsters?  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh right. They're hosting a festival around here tonight...  
Of course, securing the safety of the coast is vital then.  
  
**Chika：**  
In that case, allow me to help out.  
  
**Chika：**  
Please, don't worry about it.  
You help me out all the time.  
The least I can do is return the favor.  
  
**Chika：**  
Besides, slaying monsters is my primary profession.  
I can help you out using Song Summoning.  
...Will that be okay?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Couldn't ask for better company.  
`Tag 2`  
**Chika：**  
All right then!  
I'll first summon a spirit to search for monsters.  
If it finds any, we can fight them together.  
  
**Monster：**  
Graaarghhh!

**Spirit：**  
—!

**Chika：**  
Thank you.  
It looks like that was the last monster on the beach.  
Working together, that didn't take long at all.  
  
**Chika：**  
Now that there are no monsters, I'll stay here a little longer.  
There's something I want to do.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'll stay with you until you head back.  
`Tag 3`  
**Chika：**  
You'll... stay here with me?  
  
**Chika：**  
In case any more monsters show up?  
You want to protect me? Thank you.  
Okay, I'll take you up on your offer.

**Chika：**  
Lah-lah. ♪  
  
**Chika：**  
...Ah, {player}  
Did you wake up? Good morning.  
Although the sun *has* already gone down.  
  
**Chika：**  
You must've been tired.  
You fell asleep right away.  
  
**Chika：**  
The festival has already begun.  
Look, you can see the glowing lights coming from the city.  
  
**Chika：**  
You were sleeping so soundly, I didn't want to wake you up.  
  
**Chika：**  
You were really quiet.  
I was able to concentrate on what I was working on.  
  
**Chika：**  
I've been writing down lyrics. It's for a new song.  
  
**Chika：**  
It's not for summoning, not for performing as an idol.  
I'm writing a song that expresses my honest feelings.  
  
**Chika：**  
Someday—  
  
**Chika：**  
Someday, when it's finished...  
I'd like you to hear it.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Looking forward to it.  
`Tag 4`  
**Chika：**  
Th-thank you...  
  
**Chika：**  
It's gone completely dark, so I'll stop here for today.  
Well, shall we go?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Let's go to the festival.  
**Choice: (6)**  I'll walk you back to town.  
`Tag 5`  
**Chika：**  
You'd want to go with me?  
...I would love that.  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Chika：**  
Th-thank you. Or, um...  
Would you like to go to the festival with me?  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Chika：**  
It looks like they have plenty of stalls out.  
We can buy different snacks and share them together.  
Heheh. I'm getting giddy just thinking about it.  
  
**Narration：**  
And so, the two of them enjoyed the festival in each other's company.
