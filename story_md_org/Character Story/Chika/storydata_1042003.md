## Subtitle: What Makes You Happy
  
**Narration：**  
{player} meets up with Chika to accompany her  
as she trains for the Carmina concert.  
  
**Chika：**  
Hi there, {player}.  
You're right on time.  
Shall we go, then?  
  
**Chika：**  
I still feel shy about training where there are others, so...  
Let's go to our usual forest.  
  
**Chika：**  
We may encounter monsters,  
but the two of us should be able to handle them.  
  
**Chika：**  
When I'm with you, all my fears seem to disappear.  
  
**Chika：**  
...Oh, never mind. It's nothing.  
Come on, let's go and practice.  
  
**Chika：**  
H-how did I do?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You don't seem in top form.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chika：**  
No... Even I could tell I wasn't singing very well.  
For some reason, I feel like I'm being watched  
by a lot of people.  
  
**Chika：**  
Isn't that strange?  
I mean, you're the only other person here.  
  
**Chika：**  
Still, I feel someone's gaze on me—  
as if I were singing in front of an audience...  
  
**Monster：**  
Grrrghhh!  
  
**???：**  
Aaaghhh!  
A-a m-monster—!  
  
**Chika：**  
A monster's cry! But not only that,  
I'm sure I heard someone else scream just now!  
  
**Chika：**  
Let's go see if they need our help!  
The voices came from over there!  
  
**Chika：**  
Are you okay?!  
  
**Guard Captain：**  
Ch-Chika!  
Um... Y-you see, we're huge fans of yours!  
And we heard rumors you were training in the woods, so...  
  
**Chika：**  
My fans?  
You ventured this far into the forest for me?  
  
**Guard：**  
W-we're so sorry!  
We knew it was dangerous,  
but we didn't *really* expect there to be monsters!  
  
**Monster：**  
Grrrghhh!  
  
**Guard Captain：**  
Eeeeeek!  
  
**Chika：**  
Let's talk after. All of you, stand back!  
We must defeat the monster first!

**Chika：**  
{player},  
I'll summon the spirit. Draw the monster's attention away from me,  
please!  
  
**Spirit：**  
—!

**Monster：**  
Graaarghhh!  
  
**Chika：**  
Whew...  
We managed to defeat it.  
  
**Guard：**  
W-we're saved!  
Thank you, Chika!  
You looked real badass when you were fighting out there!  
  
**Chika：**  
...  
  
**Guard Captain：**  
U-um? Chika?  
  
**Chika：**  
How could you do something so dangerous!  
This area is overrun by monsters!  
Why come here without even carrying weapons?  
  
**Chika：**  
If something were to happen to any of you, I—  
  
**Guard Captain：**  
Ch-Chika... we're real sorry!  
We didn't mean for this to happen.  
  
**Chika：**  
It's fine, as long as you realize your mistake.  
Besides...  
  
**Chika：**  
I'm truly blessed to have fans like you  
who want to hear my music.  
  
Thank you so much.  
  
**Chika：**  
I'm sorry I got upset.  
But it's better to be safe than sorry.  
Please don't do anything dangerous like this again.  
  
**Guard Captain：**  
O-of course!  
We promise!  
  
**Guard：**  
I can't believe you were actually worried about us!  
You're the best, Chika!  
We're never gonna stop rooting for you!  
  
**Chika：**  
That means a lot to me.  
...  
More monsters may show up.  
Let's return to the city together.  
  
**Guard Captain：**  
Um... By the way, who is that knight fella with you?  
W-wait, is he...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm her manager.  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm her escort.  
`Tag 2`  
**Chika：**  
Th-that's right! He's our manager!  
On days like this, when I train outside the city,  
he accompanies me as my escort.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Chika：**  
Y-yes! That's right!  
You see? Even I make sure to have a proper escort.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Guard：**  
Right, of course...  
Then the next time we come to watch you train,  
we'll make sure to have an escort.  
  
**Chika：**  
Actually... I'd really like to keep my training private.  
Let's call it a day for now and head back into the city.  
  
**Chika：**  
{player}. Thank you for today.  
I'm so relieved  
no one got hurt.  
  
**Chika：**  
But we really just got lucky.  
And it's all my fault. I put my fans in danger...  
  
**Chika：**  
I'm supposed to be protecting everyone.  
How could I let this happen?  
  
**Chika：**  
Still, I don't know if I can train in the city...  
I'm just not used to singing in front of others.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Don't sell yourself short.  
`Tag 5`  
**Chika：**  
So you're saying I lack confidence, huh?  
True. If I'm going to sing in front of my fans,  
I need to believe in myself and my music.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  You should let people hear you sing.  
`Tag 6`  
**Chika：**  
...You're right.  
Soon, I'm going to perform in front of an audience.  
I can't keep singing on my own and expect to improve.  
  
**Chika：**  
I'll stop going to the forest to train.  
Or else I may put my fans in harm's way again.  
  
**Chika：**  
I need to get used to singing in public to build confidence.  
I'll start practicing towards this from now.  
  
**Chika：**  
If I could make just one person happy with my music...  
I would keep singing for that person.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  You make me happy.  
`Tag 7`  
**Chika：**  
Wha... what?!  
I-I-I do?  
  
**Chika：**  
...Oh, you mean... *my music*?  
R-right! You're talking about my music.  
For a second, I thought...  
  
**Chika：**  
Anyway, I'm glad my music makes you happy.  
But it's weird...  
I also feel a little let down.  
  
**Narration：**  
Chika found herself disappointed  
for reasons even she couldn't explain.
