## Subtitle: A Song Just for You
  
**Narration：**  
Stuck on her song writing,  
Chika takes a walk to clear her mind.  
  
**Chika：**  
*sigh*  
I'm surprised how hard it is to pen my own feelings...  
It was going so well up to a point...  
  
**Chika：**  
If I could just talk to him right now.  
  
**Chika：**  
Huh?! {player}?  
A-are you out for a walk?  
What a coincidence. I also felt like stretching my legs a little.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Ask about her new song.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chika：**  
Actually, that's exactly what I'm working on.  
I wanted to take a break from it.  
  
**Chika：**  
I'm a bit stuck right now, but I will definitely finish it.  
And when I do, I want you to hear it.  
  
**Chika：**  
Ahh! It's so bright!  
Just like the light from before?  
  
**Chika：**  
Why does this have to happen now?!

**Chika：**  
Hi there, {player}.  
Are you out for a walk?  
  
**Chika：**  
I'm headed to my part-time job...  
I work at the jazz cafe just up ahead.  
  
**Chika：**  
Say!  
Would you like to stop by the cafe?  
I finished the song I told you about,  
and I want you to hear it.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I wanna hear it.  
`Tag 2`  
**Chika：**  
Thank you!  
Let's head to the cafe then.  
  
**Chika：**  
It's not open yet,  
but I got permission from the manager,  
so you're welcome to come in.  
  
**Chika：**  
Right, I'm just going to start playing.  
This song is just for you...

**Chika：**  
...Wh-what did you think?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You play the piano well.  
**Choice: (4)**  It made me sleepy.  
`Tag 3`  
**Chika：**  
Do you think so?  
Now that you mention it, it's the first time you've heard me play  
an instrument.

`Tag 4`  
**Chika：**  
Hey! It's not meant to be a lullaby, you know?  
  
**Chika：**  
But I'm glad you found my singing that soothing.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Chika：**  
No, wait, hold on!  
That's not what I meant when I asked what you thought...  
  
**Chika：**  
Um, wh-what did you think of the lyrics?  
I tried to express... some of my feelings.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I understand how you feel.  
`Tag 6`  
**Chika：**  
Y-you do?!  
Well... okay.  
You now know how I feel. That I have feelings for—  
  
**Chika：**  
U-um, so...  
Are you going to... give me an answer?  
  
**Chika：**  
Wah-waaah!  
I-I can't!  
I'm so embarrassed, I'm about to explode!  
  
**Chika：**  
S-sorry!  
I've got to go!  I'm so sorry, manager!  
I-I don't feel very well. Please excuse me!

**Ameth：**  
Okay. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Honestly...  
You didn't understand what the song meant, did you?  
  
**Ameth：**  
*sigh* You're such a blockhead.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That song... You do realize it took Chika a lot of effort  
to write it, and even more courage to sing it to you?  
She was trying to tell you something!  
  
**Ameth：**  
If she sings it for you again,  
you better listen properly this time!  
Got it? That's a promise!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Fine. Then I'll leave it at that for today.  
Bye-bye. See you around!

**Chika：**  
...H-huh?  
I was... writing the song and—  
  
**Chika：**  
Did I fall asleep?  
And what was that strange dream?  
  
**Chika：**  
The song I sang was the one I'm writing now, but...  
I think it was finished.  
I can still remember the lyrics clearly.  
  
**Chika：**  
How could an unfinished song be completed in a dream?  
Maybe it wasn't just an ordinary dream...  
  
**Chika：**  
It's all very strange.  
But, anyway, now that the song is finished,  
I need him to hear it!  
  
**Chika：**  
Thank you for coming, {player}.  
I've completed the song I told you about,  
and I want you to hear it.  
  
**Chika：**  
What? Um, yes, in my dream...  
You had the same dream again?  
Still, I'd like you to listen to it afresh!  
  
**Chika：**  
...{player}, this song is just for you!  
  
**Chika：**  
Th-that song expresses my deepest feelings.  
  
**Chika：**  
Um... I ran off in my dream...  
b-but this time I won't run!  
So please let me know... h-how you feel!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I understand how you feel.  
`Tag 7`  
**Chika：**  
...I'll make a good songwriter, too?  
  
**Chika：**  
Huh? Um... What do you mean?  
But you said you understood how I feel...  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh!  
W-wait. He doesn't get it at all—  
  
**Chika：**  
I-I'm so embarrassed!  
I completely misunderstood... and went skittering off—  
Ohhh... What am I even doing?  
  
**Chika：**  
N-no... Please don't worry.  
I'm okay.  
I'm happy that you like my song.  
  
**Chika：**  
It's a shame I couldn't convey my feelings properly,  
but being able to sing it in front of him  
is a big step forward!  
  
**Chika：**  
Although I would've preferred if he understood...  
But I am by no means giving up!  
  
**Chika：**  
Um... If I write another song, would you listen to it again?  
  
**Chika：**  
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  I'll listen to it, no matter what.  
`Tag 8`  
**Chika：**  
That's a promise!  
...I'll do my best!  
  
**Narration：**  
Chika is now more determined than ever  
to convey her feelings.
