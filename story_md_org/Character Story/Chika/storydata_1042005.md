## Subtitle: Another Summoner
  
**Narration：**  
Chika calls {player}  
into the city one day.  
  
**Chika：**  
Thank you for coming, {player}.  
I have a small favor to ask you today.  
  
**Chika：**  
You see, I want to go find a new song for summoning.  
And... well, I was wondering if you would come along.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'll go.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chika：**  
Are you sure?!  
Thank you so much!  
  
**Chika：**  
I already know where we're headed. We can leave right away.  
I really appreciate you coming.  
  
**Chika：**  
Come to think of it,  
I haven't told you much about Song Summoners, have I?  
  
**Chika：**  
Not to sound pompous, but we Song Summoners are a rare breed.  
We don't inherit our ability from our parents.  
Instead, it is a gift we are born with by chance.  
  
**Chika：**  
The songs we sing differ from summoner to summoner.  
First, we must create a unique song within ourselves  
and summon a spirit with it.  
  
**Chika：**  
Only after we succeed in this are we recognized as a summoner.  
We write our song down, so other summoners may summon spirits  
using the musical score we leave behind.  
  
**Chika：**  
This is how we entrust our songs to the next generation  
of summoners.  
Of course, I too have written down  
a score of my song.  
  
**Chika：**  
I've been traveling around, seeking other summoners.  
I want to inherit as many songs as I can and protect others  
with my summoning. That's why I keep traveling.  
  
**Chika：**  
Now that I live in a city as large as Landosol,  
many people have helped me gather information.  
  
**Chika：**  
Thanks to this, I may finally be able to meet  
another living Song Summoner.  
  
**Chika：**  
You see... I've never met a fellow summoner until now.  
That's why I'm so excited.  
  
**Chika：**  
I really hope it works out.  
  
**Chika：**  
According to my sources,  
there should be a blind old lady living around these parts.  
She's supposed to know something...  
  
**Chika：**  
{player}, there's someone there.  
Let's go see!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Hmm? Now then, who goes there?  
  
**Chika：**  
Um, excuse me...  
We are—  
  
**Old Woman：**  
—You're a Song Summoner, aren't you?  
A rare thing these days.  
  
**Chika：**  
What?!  
H-how could you tell?  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Hmph. By the sound of your voice, dearie.  
After all, I'm a summoner myself.  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh! You?  
I didn't expect to find you so easily!  
  
**Chika：**  
I've come here today with a request.  
I'd like you to teach me your song!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
If an old crone's song will be of use to you, then it's yours.  
Here's the score.  
Take it.  
  
**Chika：**  
Are you certain?  
I thought there would be some kind of test to prove myself...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...And *I* thought there weren't any of us left.  
But then a young, powerful summoner like you shows up.  
It's only natural I'd do what I can to help.  
  
**Chika：**  
Th-thank you so much!  
I promise to make good use of your song!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
No need to thank me.  
Just hurry on back to where you're meant to be protecting.  
  
**Chika：**  
All right. Well then, goodbye.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...Ah, that's right.  
There's one more thing I should tell you.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Not long ago... another young summoner paid me a visit.  
Came seeking my song, just like you.  
  
**Chika：**  
Another summoner besides me?  
Are you certain?!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Guessing you're as glad as I was to learn  
there are others of us out there.  
Just thought I'd let you know.  
  
**Chika：**  
Yes! Thank you so much!  
  
**Chika：**  
Did you hear that, {player}?  
It seems there's another active summoner!  
And they're around my age!  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh, I'd love to meet them someday!  
  
**Chika：**  
Um... {player}?  
Why are you laughing?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It's rare to see you so happy.  
`Tag 2`  
**Chika：**  
Oh!  
H-how embarrassing. In my happiness,  
I guess I got carried away...  
  
**Chika：**  
But... I really would like to meet them.  
If I can find this person,  
will you come with me like you did today?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  If that's what you wish.  
`Tag 3`  
**Chika：**  
Thank you so much!  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh,  
I should really try and calm myself.  
Deep breaths... Deep breaths...  
  
**Chika：**  
...  
  
**Chika：**  
Do you mind if I tell you something?  
...Recently, I've been afraid of revealing my emotions.  
  
**Chika：**  
Especially when I'm singing, I'm afraid of expressing myself.  
This has never happened to me before.  
But ever since becoming an idol, I've been scared...  
  
**Chika：**  
I... want others to feel excited when they hear me sing.  
I want them to love my music. I've felt passionate about this  
ever since meeting my guildmates and you.  
  
**Chika：**  
But the more I feel this way,  
the more I worry about not singing well...  
About not being able to... get my feelings across.  
  
**Chika：**  
Recently, it's even painful to sing at times...  
{player}, what do you think I should do?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Believe in your fans.  
`Tag 4`  
**Chika：**  
Believe in my fans...  
  
**Chika：**  
You know, I was surprised  
to discover  
I have so many fans.  
  
**Chika：**  
Those people, they're rooting for me because they love  
my music, right?  
  
**Chika：**  
I guess I've already won their hearts over  
with my singing...  
  
**Chika：**  
I can't believe I didn't realize this.  
How silly of me.  
  
**Chika：**  
But I've realized now, thanks to you.  
From tomorrow, I think I can sing with my head held high.  
  
**Chika：**  
You know... I actually have a solo concert soon.  
Would you like to come see me perform?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Come hell or high water, I'll be there.  
**Choice: (6)**  I'll show up, even if it's canceled by rain.  
`Tag 5`  
**Chika：**  
P-please be careful!  
I don't want you to get hurt.  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Chika：**  
Don't worry.  
The concert is going to happen, rain or shine.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Chika：**  
You promise, then? I'm counting on you to be there.  
If I know you're coming,  
that'll push me to practice more and more!
