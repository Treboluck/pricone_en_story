## Subtitle: Singing with You
  
**Narration：**  
While {player} takes a walk through the city,  
he hears a familiar voice singing.  
  
**Chika：**  
*sigh*  
I still can't seem to remember all the intricate moves.  
I have to practice more!  
  
**Chika：**  
Aah! Wh-who's there?  
I'm sorry. I thought I was alone—  
  
**Chika：**  
...Oh? {player}, it's you.  
That's a relief. I thought you were a stranger for a second.  
  
**Chika：**  
I was just doing my idol training.  
  
**Chika：**  
My guildmates put together a training routine for me.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'll accompany you while you practice.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chika：**  
R-right, we did agree to something like that...  
  
**Chika：**  
But, you see, well...  
T-today's routine is a little embarrassing.  
So I'd prefer to practice alone!  
  
**Chika：**  
Besides, there aren't any monsters here,  
so I'm in no danger.  
I'll be fine on my own!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Having someone watch is part of training.  
`Tag 2`  
**Chika：**  
Oh... You're right, {player}.  
I guess that's what being an idol is all about...  
  
**Chika：**  
...V-very well then.  
I appreciate you accompanying me.  
  
**Chika：**  
Today, I'm working on dancing while singing.  
  
**Chika：**  
I usually only focus on singing...  
But if I'm going to perform as an idol,  
it seems I have to do both.  
  
**Chika：**  
Well, here goes.  
Please let me know what you think about my dancing!  
  
**Chika：**  
*huff, huff* That's all for now.  
H-how was it?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I think it was good.  
**Choice: (4)**  Something was a little off.  
`Tag 3`  
**Chika：**  
Hehe... You don't mean that, do you?  
You're just being nice.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Chika：**  
That's what I thought...  
Thank you for being honest.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Chika：**  
My moves are a bit awkward, aren't they?  
And I messed up the choreography as well.  
I could tell myself.  
  
**Chika：**  
What? My singing... too?  
I sound like a different person today?  
  
**Chika：**  
Well, I was Song Summoning the other day.  
Today, I'm just singing normally.  
  
**Chika：**  
But I don't think that's the only the reason.  
You see, I still feel some hesitation...  
  
**Chika：**  
I am a Song Summoner.  
My purpose for singing is to protect others.  
Should I really be using it for something else?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  You sing beautifully.  
`Tag 6`  
**Chika：**  
H-huh?! You're making me blush.  
Why would you say something like that?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Because there are many ways to use your gift.  
`Tag 7`  
**Chika：**  
Do you... really think so?  
  
**Chika：**  
I always thought my singing was only for summoning spirits.  
But... what else can I use it for?  
  
**Child 1：**  
Hey, miss!  
You're not gonna sing anymore?  
  
**Chika：**  
What? Wh-who are you?  
  
**Child 2：**  
We heard your beautiful singing, so we came to check it out!  
Hey, can you sing some more?  
  
**Child 1：**  
I wanna listen too!  
  
**Child 3：**  
Me too, me too!  
  
**Chika：**  
Did you really like  
my singing?  
  
**Children：**  
Yup!  
It was super pretty!  
  
**Chika：**  
A-all right, I'll sing  
just a little more then.  
  
**Children：**  
Whoopee!  
  
**Chika：**  
Heheh. They all look so happy.  
  
**Chika：**  
I think I understand what you were trying to say, {player}.  
The children were smiling because of my singing.  
  
**Chika：**  
Maybe there *is* more that my music and I can do.  
  
**Chika：**  
Thank you.  
I'm seeing things in a new light because of you.  
  
**Narration：**  
And so, with a look of new-found confidence,  
Chika devoted herself to her idol training again.
