## Subtitle: Candy Hunt Panic!
  
**Narration：**  
The city of Landosol is alive with Halloween festivities.  
As {player} strolls through the streets, he spots Misogi,  
who seems to be looking for something.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ohhh, where is it?  
I really thought I'd find it around here...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh, hey, mister! What great timing!  
You gotta come help me search for candy!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Did you drop your candy somewhere?  
**Choice: (2)**  You shouldn't eat candy you find on the ground.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misogi：**  
No, no!  
I didn't drop it or anything!  
I'm in the middle of a game to find candy hidden around the city!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Misogi：**  
Why the heck would I do that?!  
Anyway, I didn't drop it!  
I'm playing a game where you have to search for hidden candy!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Man：**  
There's still plenty left to find, so keep hunting!  
The leftovers are the luckiest, so you can't give up just yet!  
  
**Girl：**  
C'mon, let's find lots!  
  
**Boy：**  
That candy's all mine!  
  
**Misogi：**  
See? Those kids are on the hunt for candy too!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Everyone's hunting with their moms and dads,  
so I was at a bit of a disadvantage...  
  
**Misogi：**  
But with you on my side I'm sure we'll find tons,  
so let's do this together!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Got it.  
`Tag 4`  
**Misogi：**  
Thanks!  
I'll give you half of the candy after!  
  
**Misogi：**  
I'm sure there's some around here, so if you just help me search...  
Oh, hey! Found it!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Eheheh...  
Can't beat my instincts, huh?  
 I'm always planting traps and stuff,  
so I've got a sense for where things are hidden! ♪  
  
**Misogi：**  
All right, mister, I'll find suspicious spots, so you help me search them!  
Our next stop is... Let's see...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh! I bet there's some in that patch of grass!  
Let's check!  
  
**Misogi：**  
See? The gap between these leaves is the perfect size to hide things!  
See what you can find, mister!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Ooh, candy.  
`Tag 5`  
**Misogi：**  
Nice work!  
OK, now let's find another spot!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Little candies under the bench! ♪  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ooh, there's chocolate inside this pumpkin! ♪  
  
**Man：**  
Well, well, well!  
Word on the street is that there's just one last candy treat left to find!  
  
**Man：**  
Whoever finds it gets this special Halloween basket of treats  
as a bonus prize, so don't give up now!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hear that, mister?!  
This is our chance to get a ton of candy at once!  
Let's find that last one!  
  
**Misogi：**  
I can't find it anywhere!  
After all that searching, too!  
  
**Girl：**  
Is there really any candy left?  
  
**Man：**  
Oh yes, the last candy is still...  
  
**Dog：**  
Woof woof!  
  
**Man：**  
Ahhh?! The basket!  
W-waaaait!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahahah!  
I think that dog wants to play a game of chase!  
  
**Dog：**  
Woof woof!  
  
**Man：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
That basket's got all the event funds inside, too...!  
Somebody catch that mutt!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hey, old man!  
If we catch that dog for you, will you give us the bonus prize?  
  
**Man：**  
Huh? S-sure!  
I don't see why not!  
  
**Misogi：**  
All riiiight!  
Let's catch it no matter what, mister!  
  
**Boy：**  
Not if we catch it first!  
  
**Dog：**  
Woof woof!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahahah!  
What a cute doggie~! ♪  
  
**Girl：**  
Wait, doggie!  
Ahaha, it's running way too fast!  
  
**Boy：**  
Ahahahaha!  
Run like the wind!  
  
**Man：**  
It's great you're having fun, but if someone doesn't catch it,  
I'm going to be in real trouble...  
Can someone please catch that dog soon?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Awww, but I wanna keep playing longer!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Don't you want the candy?  
`Tag 6`  
**Misogi：**  
Oh! Good point!  
No candy for us if we don't catch it!  
I was having so much fun, I almost forgot!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hmm... I don't see how we're gonna catch it on our own, though.  
I know! Let's get everyone else to help out!  
  
**Boy：**  
Everyone?  
  
**Girl：**  
Like, all of us together?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Yeah!  
We can all run at the dog from different directions!  
  
**Misogi：**  
C'mon, mister!  
You run that way towards the dog first!  
All right? Ready...  
 Go!  
  
**Dog：**  
Woof woof!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ah! It went your way!  
  
**Boy：**  
I'm on it!  
You're not getting through here!  
  
**Dog：**  
Woof!  
  
**Girl：**  
Can't let you through here either!  
  
**Dog：**  
Woof woof!

**Misogi：**  
Ahaha!  
This is a dead end for you!  
  
**Dog：**  
*whine*...  
  
**Misogi：**  
There, there. Good boy...  
Let go of the candy now, will you?  
  
**Dog：**  
Woof!

`image display end`  
**Man：**  
Phew, finally that's taken care of.  
What a relief...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hey, old man!  
We captured the silly dog, but where was the last candy in the end?  
  
**Man：**  
Huh? Oh, well, actually...  
The secret is, that basket itself is the final candy.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Whaaaaa?!  
This is the last one?!  
  
**Boy：**  
How were we supposed to guess that?!  
  
**Man：**  
Ahahah, sorry, sorry.  
Now, then... You're the one who caught the pup,  
so I guess this candy belongs to you.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Nuh-uh!  
We caught the dog together, so we all oughtta share it!  
  
**Man：**  
Oh, I see. I suppose you're not wrong.  
Well then, this candy belongs to everyone here!  
  
**Girl：**  
You mean it?  
Thanks!  
  
**Boy：**  
Yaaay!  
Candy for everyone!  
  
**Misogi：**  
We got a bit less candy in the end,  
 but who cares as long as we had fun!  
  
**Narration：**  
And Misogi flashed a massive grin at all the other kids.
