## Subtitle: Halloween Never Ends!
  
**Narration：**  
After the madness of the Halloween parade,  
Misogi and {player} are on their way back home.  
  
**Misogi：**  
That was fun, huh, mister?!  
Aw man, I still wanna keep going!  
But I guess it's getting too dark, huh?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Wait, huh? Mister, you're glowing again!  
Do you wanna keep going that bad, too?!  
  

---  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh! Hey, mister!  
Perfect timing!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What's up?  
`Tag 1`  
**Misogi：**  
Check it out!  
I got a letter from my dad who's off exploring!  
  
**Misogi：**  
And look! He sent a treasure map, too!  
See? There's an \"X\" on it right here!  
That's gotta mean treasure!  
  
**Misogi：**  
C'mon, let's go find it together!  
Ready, and go!  
  
**Misogi：**  
The \"X\" mark should be around here...  
But it's just an empty field.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  What's this on the ground?  
`Tag 2`  
**Misogi：**  
Hm? A little wooden box?  
 That's weird.  
Whoa! There's a key in it!  
Is it the key to some treasure?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
But where's the chest?  
Maybe we'll find it if we keep looking!  
  
**Misogi：**  
There's no treasure chest anywhere!  
  
**Misogi：**  
What's that, mister?  
Let's take a closer look at the map?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hmm...  
 Well, I guess if you say so...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahhh!  
The map blew out of my hands!  
Hold uuuup!  
  
**Misogi：**  
We got the map, but now it's dirty...  
Even though it's a rare present from my dad...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Don't worry.  
**Choice: (4)**  Your dad, huh?  
`Tag 3`  
**Misogi：**  
But it's all soggy, and there's dirt on it too...  
And you can't wash paper... What now?!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Misogi：**  
If only I'd been a bit more careful...  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? That's not it?  
 Look at the map again?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahhh!  
There's another \"X\" on it!  
What the heck?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
It might have appeared because the map got wet?  
Oh, right! Guess my dad invented a special map  
that's too clever even for me!  
  
**Misogi：**  
C'mon, mister!  
Let's go check out the new \"X\" spot!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Whoa!  
He suddenly fell into a pit in the ground!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Wait right there, mister!  
I'll get you out!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  There's something down here.  
`Tag 6`  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? Buried treasure?  
You'll dig it up for me?  
 Thanks, mister!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Wow! A treasure chest!  
D'you think the key we found will fit?  
  
**Misogi：**  
It opened!  
 Inside is...  
Whoaaa! What're these clothes?! It's a present from my dad!  
There's even a message inside! Look, mister!  
  
**Misogi：**  
\"Happy Halloween, Misogi…\"  
Ahhhhhh!  
Halloween's today, right?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
I was gonna go to the Halloween parade,  
but I was so excited about the letter, I forgot!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Guess I should wear this to the parade, shouldn't I?  
Thanks a bunch, Dad!  
  
**Misogi：**  
I'd better get lots of pranks ready!  
Listen, I've gotta get changed, so let's meet up this evening, mister!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I'm still stuck, though...  
`Tag 7`  
**Misogi：**  
Ohhhh! I almost forgot!  
Sorry about that, mister! I'll get you outta there!

**Misogi：**  
Hey, mister!  
Trick or treat!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Give Misogi candy.  
`Tag 8`  
**Misogi：**  
Thanks a bunch, mister!  
Take... this!  
  
**Misogi：**  
That firecracker's my thanks for the candy!  
Did it shock you?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahahah! Your eyes are popping out!  
It wasn't *that* scary!  
 But it's funny, so that's all good!  
  
**Misogi：**  
So hey, mister...  
What d'you think of my costume?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  It really suits you.  
`Tag 9`  
**Misogi：**  
Well, thanks, mister!  
Guess my dad picked out the perfect costume just for me!  
Eheheh...  
  
**Boy：**  
Trick or treat!  
  
**Girl：**  
Give us your candy or get pranked!  
  
**Woman：**  
Oh, dear me. How very cute.  
Don't worry, there's plenty of candy.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hey, mister!  
We should go get some candy too!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? You've gotta hand out candy to the other kids?  
Then let's walk around and do it together!  
  
**Misogi：**  
You guess that works?  
 Thanks!  
Eheheh, it's way more fun when we're together!  
  
**Misogi：**  
I hope next year and the year after,  
we can keep doing Halloween together forever!  
You'll do that, right, mister?

**Ameth：**  
So blinding!  
Misogi's pure, innocent gaze is blinding my eyes!  
  
**Ameth：**  
\"Together forever,\" huh...  
 That really is a beautiful phrase.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I hope you'll take good care of that innocent little girl.  
Don't even think about betraying her trust.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, I wouldn't expect that from you, anyway.  
Just like Misogi, I have plenty of trust in you, you know.  
  

---  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh...? Did I fall asleep?  
Maybe all that running tired me out...  
  
**Misogi：**  
I think I just had a dream  
about pranking you and going to a Halloween parade.  
Pranking you is always the most fun part of all!  
  
**Misogi：**  
So you'd better stick around with me forever,  
 OK, mister?!  
  
**Narration：**  
And as she imagined future days with {player},  
Misogi's smile was full of purer joy than ever before.
