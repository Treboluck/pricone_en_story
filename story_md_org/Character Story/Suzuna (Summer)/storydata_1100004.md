**Narration：**  
{player}is taking a break after helping  
out with the photoshoot, during which Suzuna comes over to see him.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Whattup, whiz-boy.  
Are you gazing at the ocean?  
Nice, nice. Mind if I sit beside you?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
The photoshoot?  
Yeah, it's all done now.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hey. I really owe you a thanks,  
whiz-boy.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
What for?  
Well, for when I was surfing.  
I managed to pull it off thanks to you.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
You didn't do anything? No way, Jose!  
You were watching over me the whole time!  
That totally got me inspired!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hey, whiz-boy.  
I know this was work, but how about next time we—  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Eeek?! It's so bright!  
What's with this light?!

**Suzuna：**  
Huh? Whiz-boy?  
What're you doing here?!  
You're on your break?  
Well then!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I'm here for photoshoot.  
It's swimsuit themed, but it's not really going that well, so I'm on break.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hm? What's the issue?  
Well. They want me to show, like, a sexy, womanly side.  
But I dunno how to do that.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I think you've got that down already.  
**Choice: (2)**  Sexy...  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzuna：**  
For real?  
Thanks so much!  
Mind being more specific while we're at it?  
Huh? You can't say?!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzuna：**  
Hm? Why're you staring at me like that, whiz-boy?  
Huh? I've already got that down?  
You're gonna make me blush!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Suzuna：**  
Hey. Mind if we have a look around the beach?  
I wanna wander around a bit more.  
  
**Cameraman：**  
There you are!  
Suzuna!  
Break time's almost over!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh, already?!  
I barely just got talking to whiz-boy!  
  
**Cameraman：**  
Oh? Who might that be?  
Your boyfriend?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
What?! No! Definitely not!  
He's, uh...!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Wh-what should I even say here?!  
I dunno!  
  
**Cameraman：**  
Oh?  
I see.  
Interesting...  
Hey, you. How about you come watch Suzuna's photoshoot?  
  
**Cameraman：**  
Or even better, how about you snap some photos of her?  
I'll even include it in the album if you take some good ones.  
Here you go. This is my camera.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh?  
Whiz-boy's gonna be the cameraman?  
  
**Cameraman：**  
Yup.  
That said, it's not a proper photoshoot, so have fun with it.  
I'll watch from close by. Right then. Let's get going.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Dunno what lead to that,  
but it means I get to spend more time with whiz-boy, right?  
Neat. ♪  
  
**Suzuna：**  
You being the cameraman is kinda weird.  
Hm? How come you're not doing anything?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh, right!  
You probably don't know what to do with the camera!  
  
**Cameraman：**  
It's not that hard.  
Show him the ropes, Suzuna.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Me?  
Hm... I dunno if I can,  
but I'll give it a shot!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Um, so...  
I'll strike a bunch of poses,  
so you just take the photos the way you like!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Right then.  
Let's get started! ♪

**Suzuna：**  
Come on, first you need to get used to the camera!  
Just keep taking photos!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Yeah, that's it!  
Keep going! ♪  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Man, you look so serious.  
I'm happy and all,  
but it feels kind of weird.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Wait a minute.  
How come you're coming so close?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Whoa?!  
What's wrong? Err, n-nothing! It's fine!  
Keep going!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh?! Y-you want an even sexier pose?!  
U-uh... S-something like this?

**Suzuna：**  
Wh-why am I getting all embarrassed over a normal pose like this?!  
I don't get it?!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
It'd be pretty bad if I got caught out.  
I'm a pro, so I gotta play it off.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
N-not everyone gets to see me strike a pose like this.  
Come on, hurry up and take the photo...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
It's real sexy, right? Th-this is so, like, totally natural for me.  
I-I can even take it a step further.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Oh man. He's looking right at ,e.  
Th-this is getting really embarrassing...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh?! You've almost got it, so I should do some more poses?  
R-really? O-okay... Got it...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Wait, you really liked my expression just there?  
B-but I didn't strike any poses.  
B-but it was good? Well then...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Wh-what's going on here... I'm being so weird for no reason...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Wh-whiz-boy, I...  
Whoa?!  
Y-you're way too close!  
Come on, get back! Just get back!

**Suzuna：**  
Okay, that's enough! We're done here!  
You didn't get a good photo? Don;t worry, I bet you did!  
Hand over the camera!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Just hand it over!  
Yeah! No questions!  
I'll check the photos myself! You're not allowed to look!  
  
**Cameraman：**  
Wow! That was good stuff, Suzuna!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Whoa?! You gave me a fright there.  
Wh-what's up?  
  
**Cameraman：**  
Pardon me.  
I got so many good photos thanks to him  
that the excitement got to me.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh?  
Were you taking photos at the same time?  
  
**Cameraman：**  
I got the feeling that I could get the photos I was looking for  
after seeing the two of you talking together.  
Never expected it to go this well, though.  
  
**Cameraman：**  
Mind showing me the pictures he took of you?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh? S-sure.  
Here you go.  
  
**Cameraman：**  
Hm.... They're all good,  
but almost all of them are out of focus.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
O-oh.  
That's a shame, isn't it?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I feel kinda bad,  
but there's something so embarassing about photos that he toom of me.  
  
**Cameraman：**  
Oh?  
There's one really, really good photo in here.  
Can probably chalk that up to beginner's luck.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Wait, which one?!  
Huh?! Did he really take this?!  
  
**Cameraman：**  
This really is a fantastic photo.  
It even brings a new side of you to light.  
Let's put it in the album!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I can't believe you're this good at taking photos.  
Totally whiz-boy material! ♪  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Wait!  
It's a greta photo,  
but I don't want everyone else seeing it!  
  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Aaand welcome back.  
Her reaction makes me all the more curious  
about what sort of photo you took...  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'd assume it's the most natural photo you could take of her.  
If that's the case, then it really is something only you could take.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hopefully you'll get to see even more sides of her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, I'll see you later! ♪

**Suzuna：**  
*yawn* When'd I fall asleep?  
Feels like I had a kind of embarrassing dream, too...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I mean, whiz-boy was so close...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh? Whoa!  
When did you wake up?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
My face is all red?  
N-no it isn't!  
I bet it's 'cause of the sunset. Yeah!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
O-oh yeah! Take a look at this photo!  
The one with me surfing!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Everyone was going on about how great it is!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
I know I'm the only one in the photo,  
but looking at it'll remind me of how much you were cheering me on.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
It really is a great photo.  
Packed full of great memories.  
Do you feel the same?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
You do?  
Aha! Well then!  
Hearing that makes me even happier!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
How come?  
Hm...  
I dunno!  
If you're happy, then I'm happy!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Yup, yup. ♪  
Everyone's waiting for us, so let's head back!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hey, whiz-boy!  
Let's go to the beach together again!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
And not for work, either!  
Let's swim, surf, and eat all sorts of delicious stuff together!  
Promise!  
I mean it!  
  
**Narration：**  
Suzuna flashed a brilliant smile after  
{player} nodded in response.
