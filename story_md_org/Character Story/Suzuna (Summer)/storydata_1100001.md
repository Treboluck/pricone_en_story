middle of town while out for a walk.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
What're you all looking so down for?  
Tomorrow's photoshoot is at the beach.  
Get yourselves jazzed up!  
  
**Woman：**  
Well... We're actually short on staff.  
The person who usually does the photoshoots is off sick.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Wait, for real?!  
Yikes!  
  
**Woman：**  
I'm sorry.  
This is our responsibility, so it's our job to do something about it...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Don't say that!  
We're buds, right?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Let's figure something out together!  
I'll hit up some of my friends and—  
...  
Hey!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Whiz-boy?! In the flesh?!  
Talk about totally genius timing! LOL!  
Wait, this isn't the time to be laughing!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hey, are you free tomorrow?  
We've got a photoshoot at the beach,  
but it turns out we're gonna need all the help we can get.  
It'd be rad if you could come.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sure.

Can't be going to the beach without the right gear!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Check it out, whiz-boy!  
These swimsuits are totes adorbs!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
The flashy stuff is right up my alley,  
but it's kinda by the numbers.  
Might be more interesting if I go for the cuter stuff. ♪  
  
**Suzuna：**  
*sigh* Wild! Cute! Cute and wild!  
You think so too, right?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh? Did my agency not prepare a swimsuit for me?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
They did, yeah.  
But it'd be way better if I chose one for myself, right?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
It's like, I want to reach as many of my fans as possible.  
That's why I want your input as well!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
What sort of swimsuits are you into, anyway?  
Cute ones? Sexy ones?

You're not sure, huh?  
Okay. I'll try a bunch out, so gimme some input on the ones that catch your eye.

Whiz-boy? Why'd you freeze up all of a sudden?

`Tag 5`  
**Suzuna：**  
Cute?  
Oof! Now you've got me all hype!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Suzuna：**  
A reaction like that means  
this has to be the best choice!  
How much is it...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Uh... 8,000 rupies?!  
I figured it'd be about 5,000...  
That's way over my budget...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Hm? There's a sticker on it.  
Twenty percent off?  
Whiz-boy! What's twenty percent of 8,000?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
1,600 rupies?!  
Yikes! That's a steal!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Got all worried for nothing, didn't I? LOL!　♪  
I'm definitely getting this one!  
Let's head over to the register!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Excuse me!  
I'd like this one!  
  
**Owner：**  
Sure thing.  
Let's see, twenty percent off 8,000...  
That'll be 6,400 rupies! Thanks a bunch!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
What?! 6,400 rupies?!  
How come?! Wasn't it supposed to be 1,600?!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh? What is it, whiz-boy?  
It's twenty percent off, so 8,000 minus 1,600 makes 6400 rupies?  
Well then. That's my whiz-boy.  
  
**Owner：**  
Ahahaha...  
Sorry for the confusion there, miss.  
  
**Suzuna：**  
It's cool. I'm the one that got it wrong.  
What am I gonna do, though?  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Whiz-boy really likes it,  
but 6,400 rupies is just out of my budget...  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Right! I'm gonna have to pull out the big guns!  
  
**Suzuna：**  
Excuse me! I really, really want this swimsuit,  
so please let me work here to make up for what I don't have! Please!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Same here.  
`Tag 7`  
**Suzuna：**  
Huh? You'll help out?  
You really don't have to go that far,  
but... Thanks.  
  
**Owner：**  
Hm... The other employee's off today, so...  
I might just take you up on that.
