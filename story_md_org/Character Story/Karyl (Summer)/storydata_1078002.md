# Karyl (Summer) Episode 2
Excited for the upcoming Tantalizing Tropical Tour, Karyl is less than pleased when she finds their vacation is at a location much closer than expected. The rest of the Gourmet Guild comfort her, and though still annoyed, she tries her best to make the most of it.
  
## Subtitle: Welcome to... the Tropical Resort?
  
**Narration：**  
A few days later...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's finally here.  
The Tantalizing Tropical Tour...! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We have the calm, blue sea!  
A gleaming white beach!  
The radiant sunshine!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...And a very upset Karyl, to boot!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hey now, what's wrong?  
Let's get hyped!  
Otherwise Mr. Sun up there is gonna laugh at us! ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
Are you hungry, perchance?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Lunchtime is almost upon us.  
And it's our fate as members of the Gourmet Guild  
to have ever-hungry tummies...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Embarrassing as it is to admit,  
my tummy gets rumbly much more often these days.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
We weren't sure if there would be anywhere to eat here,  
so myself and my lord took the liberty of preparing lunch for us.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  We got up real early, too.  
**Choice: (2)**  We put a lot of effort into it.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed.  
The excitement kept me up last night, too,  
so waking up early on top of that has left me quite a bit tired.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed. My lord has been quite proactive when it comes  
to cooking,  
largely due to the way in which we take charge of  
chores at the Sarendia Orphanage. It's a valuable experience.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Wow! You two almost sound like a cou—  
Err. A very friendly lord and subject!  
Now I'm really looking forward to eating it. ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank you. I believe we'd be best eating before taking a dip.  
Then again, I do also recall reading that having  
a meal before swimming can lead to drowning...  
  
**Karyl：**  
What's the deal here?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh wow! You scared the life out of me!  
Don't just shout out of the blue like that, Karyl.  
I thought my heart was gonna stop!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Whatever! I don't give a crap about what happens to you!  
More importantly. Wasn't this supposed to be a Tantalizing Tropical Tour?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
There's not a single thing tantalizing or tropical about  
the Marjan Coast! We're barely even outside Landosol!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You know how excited I was for this?  
To get to experience a proper tropical resort?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Damn it all! I should have known this was coming!  
Karin even said that the government's strapped for funds.  
That was foreshadowing, and I fell right for it!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Can't believe she had the nerve to hype this up, then send us here!  
Special invitation-only tickets? Screw you!  
We can just walk here whenever we feel like it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh. That's the issue, huh?  
I'm fine with it, if I'm being honest.  
The ocean's still nice and pretty.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Indeed. Miss Karin never once lied to us.  
\"Tropical\" generally entails the south,  
and we're currently south of Landosol.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And hey. Our lodging is free, isn't it?  
Which means we're here for a lot cheaper than usual.  
It's not like we've been ripped off, so let's calm ourselves a bit.  
  
**Karyl：**  
That's not the issue! I'm pissed we got tricked in the  
first place!  
Actually, even worse—I'm the one that tricked *myself*  
into thinking we'd be going somewhere special!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
That just goes to show how excited you were.  
If anything, I feel a bit happy knowing that.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That said, we're still here at the beach.  
It would be a waste to spend the trip with such a negative mindset.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So let us enjoy our time to the fullest extent, Miss Karyl.  
Though four days and three nights may seem short,  
I'm sure we can get plenty out of it together.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe.  
I'm more than happy to just spend a trip like this with you all,  
if I'm being honest.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Fair enough.  
No point in complaining now, is there?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Not that I'm expecting anything good at this point.  
No doubt our lodging'll be a dump, too.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But hey. We're at the beach!  
I'm just gonna forget everything and go wild! Yeah!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha.  
Now she's rushed off to take her frustration out on the ocean.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So it seems.  
As for food, we may be best leaving it for later.  
Are you all right with that, Miss Pecorine?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh. Don't worry about me.  
I probably won't get that hungry this time around.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hey, you guys! Less talking, more swimming!  
There's barely anyone around for some reason!  
This place is all ours, baby!  
  
**Karyl：**  
And I'm getting real lonely floating around here by myself!  
So get your butts moving!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha.  
She really can be dependent on other people, can't she?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Okay! I'll be over in a jiffy, Karyl!  
And I'll make sure to hug you nice and tight!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But first up, warm-ups!  
And a one, and a two... and we're off! ☆  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Pecorine! That won't suffice, I'm afraid!  
There are no lifeguards around, either.  
None of us will be able to help if you drown.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This is my first time at the beach,  
and my lord doesn't quite recall how to swim  
due to his amnesia.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, don't worry about that.  
If worst comes to worst, I can whip up a quick spell  
to save you guys.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ohhh...  
You're as skilled as ever, Miss Karyl.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hehe. I say that genuinely, too. Your repertoire is vast.  
And you even went out of your way to learn magic that  
can be applied here.  
I'm incredibly thankful for that.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well...  
Let's just say I had my own reasons for learning, too.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Swim, swim, swim! ♪  
Touchdown!  
What's up, Karyl?  
Lemme on your swim ring, too!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Whoa?!  
Quit it, you dummy!  
You'll make us both drown!  
  
**Karyl：**  
There's no way a swim ring this size is gonna support both of us!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh.  
That reminds me.  
Where did this swim ring and beach ball even come from?  
Hey, you've even got drinks!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Nothing to be surprised about here.  
I can pack a bunch of essentials into my bracelet,  
then take them out when need be.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wow...  
Magic really is crazy useful, isn't it? ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmph. Except the amount of effort it takes to  
reach that level is hellish, to say the least.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha.  
I always knew you were a hard worker.  
Lemme pat your head. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hehe.  
Mind if I have a drink?  
My throat's all parched from the heat.  
Mmm...♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
Get outta my face!  
And quit trying to get on the swim ring, too!  
Argh! Just get away from me in general!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Koro, {player}!  
Quit watching and come drag this idiot away from me!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh, very well.  
You want more company, don't you?  
Then allow us to come join you. ♪
