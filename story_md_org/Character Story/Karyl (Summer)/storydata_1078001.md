## Subtitle: A Tropical Island to Dream Of
  
**Narration：**  
In a local lottery, the members of the Gourmet Guild  
have won tickets to a Tantalizing Tropical Tour.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Arghhh! It's nothing but work, work, work!  
I'm stressed out of my mind here!  
Any more of this and I'm gonna start losing my hair!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Urgh... I gotta suck it up and deal with this, though.  
That tropical tour we're going on is  
for four days and three nights, after all.  
  
**Karyl：**  
And being a civil servant means I'm pretty much busy forever...  
There's no way I can just take that much time off.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'd like to get a bunch of work done beforehand.  
Ideally four days' worth, but two at the very least.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Two should give me a bit of leeway...  
I can head to the beach straight from work on the first day,  
then do the opposite on the last day.  
  
**Karyl：**  
There's no one else that can fill in for me, so I can't just  
put it off for four whole days. I don't even want to imagine what  
kind of punishment Her Majesty would have in store for me.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Just the idea's sending shivers down my spine.  
I wouldn't be able to handle it if I knew they were  
having fun together while I'm stuck at work, though.  
  
**Karyl：**  
And I know for a fact that it'll be a ton of fun, too!  
I've always wanted to go somewhere like  
the beach with people I get along with. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm not missing this for the world!  
Which means I gotta work, work, work!  
Let's do this!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hey there, Karyl.  
`Tag 1`  
**Karyl：**  
Eeek?!  
Don't sneak up on me like that!  
Otherwise I might legit kill you!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, it's you!  
Hey there!  
  
**Karyl：**  
What're you doing around these parts?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm on my way home.  
`Tag 2`  
**Karyl：**  
Well then. Back from work, I take it? And this is a  
good shortcut, too, huh? Watch out, though. Security's  
rough around here. You might get taken in if you look shady.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Not that it's any of my business.  
You're free to go wherever you want.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Apologize for scaring her.  
**Choice: (4)**  Express concern over her seeming down.  
`Tag 3`  
**Karyl：**  
Uhh... Bit too late for apologies, isn't it?  
You're always trying to find ways to scare me to death.  
Is seeing me jump out of my skin that funny to you?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hehe. I guess I'm kind of to blame, too.  
All you did was say hi this time.  
I shouldn't have reacted like that.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm not exactly everyone's favorite person at the palace.  
When people approach me, it's usually not in a kind way.  
That's why I always get freaked out if someone calls out to me.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You guys are different, though. And I appreciate that.  
Just kidding, ahaha. I sure made myself  
sound like a depressed loner there, didn't I?  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Karyl：**  
Hm? Not every day that you're this perceptive.  
Yup. I'm feeling pretty down. Exhausted, even.  
So much so that just dealing with you is a pain.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Karyl：**  
Hehe. Oh well. Not like I care about you enough for it to matter...  
I'm kind of busy, you know. You caught me just as  
I was about to head back to do overtime.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Only reason I came here was to get some dinner in  
the business district.  
I'll be at work for a good while  
before I get to go back home.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I take it you're in a busy period?  
`Tag 6`  
**Karyl：**  
That's one way to put it, I guess. Things have been kind of fishy  
around Landosol these days. New breeds of monsters appearing,  
strange phenomena occurring with no rhyme or reason, etc.  
  
**Karyl：**  
One such place is the Marjan Coast.  
The fishing trade there's taken a big hit thanks to some  
new monster going wild.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Not that it affects us that much,  
considering we're off on a tropical tour.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But it'd be wrong to just leave without doing anything, wouldn't it?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Dealing with the problem means getting in touch with other  
departments, figuring out how to tackle the issue, all that stuff.  
And then there's the endless paperwork that comes with it.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm kind of like a secretary of sorts,  
so it's my job to deal with that paperwork.  
And I'm not exaggerating about it being endless.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But well...  
I'll do what I can to have most of it  
it cleared up before the vacation, at least.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  How about I lend you a hand?  
`Tag 7`  
**Karyl：**  
Don't be silly. I work at the palace.  
That paperwork has all sorts of confidential info in it.  
There's no way I could let you near it.  
  
**Karyl：**  
But hey. I do appreciate the offer.  
You really are a good guy to a fault, aren't you?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hehe. Don't worry about me, okay?  
Get yourself home already.  
You've got Koro waiting for you, don't you?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Making her sad's gonna earn you some capital punishment.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Anyway, thanks.  
I got a nice breather thanks to you.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Bye-bye.  
Next time we meet, we'll be on vacation. ♪
