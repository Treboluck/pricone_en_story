# Chieru Episode 6
As usual, Chieru finds herself naturally searching for {player}. Hearing that he's out on a delivery, she follows him to Elizabeth Park, but the sight of him chatting happily with the girls at the farm leaves her with complicated feelings.

**Narration：**  
On the way home from St. Theresa's,  
Chieru finds herself with time to kill,  
so she naturally heads to a certain spot in Landosol.  
  
**Chieru：**  
I am the cutie, chelly Chieru~! ♪  
Everybody loves her, chelly Chieru~! ♪  
  
**Chieru：**  
Soooo~? Nope, guess he's not here yet.  
Not that I'm looking for anyone in particular.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Great! Since I've got time to spare,  
maybe I'll gaze up at the sky and wait here awhile!  
Not for anybody in particular, of course!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Getting bored of sky now...  
  
**Chieru：**  
And he's *still* not here...  
Not that I'm waiting for anybody in particular.  
  
**Chieru：**  
I wonder if he's struggling with a heavy load today?  
Oh well. I'll study the sky a bit longer...  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Still nothing.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? He's not showing up at all.  
Huh? What's his game today?  
Huh? Is this some kind of joke?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Why do I have to wait around forever for some guy?  
Aren't I the one who keeps people waiting?  
Like, what? The heck? Who thinks this is funny?  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Where the *heck* is he?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
What kind of joke is this? What kind of joke is this?!  
I cannot even anymore! What is that boy even doing?!  
Did he hit his head on a slime horn and die in a hole somewhere?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wait. What if... something bad *did* happen to him?  
No way. Oh, heck! I've gotta go find him!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ah...?!  
That's the same delivery bag {player} always carries!  
Must be a co-worker! I should try asking that guy!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Excuse me~!  
I've got a little question to ask!  
  
**Chieru：**  
\"Elizabeth Park\"...?  
  
**Delivery Man：**  
Yeah—it's a farm outside town.  
Lately he's been doing local deliveries too,  
but originally, that farm was his main area.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ohhh~! Wow, I never knew!  
What a silly little mix-up he's caused!  
On his behalf,  
 I'm super sorry!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hmmm, I see...  
In that case, maybe I'll wander off on a random walk to that farm too.  
Oh, not to get in his way, of course! It's an impromptu field trip!  
  
**Delivery Man：**  
Uhhh... Are you a relative of his?  
  
**Chieru：**  
No, no, no!  
  
**Delivery Man：**  
Then... his girlfriend?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Whaaa~? Don't be silly!  
As if he measures up to me! 'Specially in looks.  
  
**Delivery Man：**  
But then... what does that make you? His stalker?  
  
**Chieru：**  
H... huhhh?!  
You'd look this universally beloved beauty in the eye  
and call her a s-stalker?!  
  
**Delivery Man：**  
Well, if you're not related or dating,  
but you were waiting for him this whole time...  
  
**Delivery Man：**  
And now you're heading off on a hike just to find him, right?  
To me, that sounds an awful lot like a stal—  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, heck no. It's a field trip.  
  
**Delivery Man：**  
Are you sure?  
 You really seem like a stal—  
  
**Chieru：**  
Heck no. I'm killing time. I'm a flighty young maiden.  
  
**Chieru：**  
So, outrageous misunderstandings aside,  
I made it all the way to Elizabeth Park.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Naturally, I'm here for no reason other than a random field trip.  
I'm going to be a very independent Landosol woman someday,  
so I need to know about all sorts of careers and industries.  
  
**Chieru：**  
I most certainly am not a stalker.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hm? That figure emerging from from a quaint little shack...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Eek! It's {player}!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ahah! He really is here!  
Look at his face, vacant as always. Hilarious.  
  
**Chieru：**  
But... huh? Wait a minute.  
Why are you watching sneakily from the shadows, Chieru?  
  
**Chieru：**  
I was so surprised, I kind of hid myself on instinct,  
but objectively speaking, don't I look like a stal—  
  
**Chieru：**  
No. I'm a flawless beauty.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yes, that's right!  
I'm the cutest, most beautiful girl alive!  
It's not like me, all this getting flustered over nothing at all!  
  
**Chieru：**  
It's just... just, um... I'm feeling out of sorts lately!  
This frankly unstable character isn't the Chieru I want to be!  
  
**Chieru：**  
I can read the room, but I don't. I act as my impulses guide me.  
There's no time for hesitation or deception in my life!  
Leap at your youth, Chieru! Grab it by the horns!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Che! ☆ Ru~~n! ♪  
Howdy there, {player}!  
Betcha didn't expect to see such a cute—  
  
**Chieru：**  
Gah! He's with someone?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wh-who's that?!  
That sweet and charming young lady with looks to rival my own?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
And wait a minute. Why have I hidden myself again?  
If I keep doing this, the suspicions will become allegations!  
People will write ballads about the Adorable Stalker!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yes, let's go.  
Leap out, Chieru: take two!  
Che! ☆ Ruuu—  
  
**Chieru：**  
Guehh! Two more beautiful girls enter stage left?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Are these... girls from the farm? AKA Bethpark-ettes?!  
{player} seems to be chatting away happily,  
so does he... know them? Are they... friends?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ah! Thinking back, didn't {player} mention  
he has a whole bunch of friends who are girls...?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Daaang. I didn't think he really meant it...  
I thought he was just bigging himself up like boys do...  
  
**Chieru：**  
And to think it's a whole fleet of heavy-duty cuties!  
This explains a whole lot! No wonder he was able to face my charms  
and keep working hard without a single salacious \"gueheheh\"!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Man... They sure are cute, though, these farmgirls!  
 Gueheheh!  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Hm? Wait, huh?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, shoot! I was so entranced by the Bethpark-ettes' cute faces,  
I missed {player}'s regular face vanishing from the scene!  
Wh-where is he?! Where'd the non-cutie go?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hi there.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chieru：**  
Guehhh?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
U-um, {player}?!  
D-did you need to pop out of the shadows like that?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  What're you doing?  
`Tag 2`  
**Chieru：**  
Huh?! Um—who, me?  
Well, I was, uh... you know! Just... passing through?  
Yeah! I just happened to have... business in the area...  
  
**Chieru：**  
What is this scene?! Oh geez, why'm I making excuses?!  
Don't lose your nerve, Chieru! Live your chelliest life!  
  
**Chieru：**  
...O~r not! That was just my little joke!  
Don't I say the darndest things?! ☆  
  
**Chieru：**  
Lemme be straight with you!  
The real reason I'm here isn't by chance at all. Truth is, I...  
  
**Chieru：**  
I was bored, so I came to make fun of ya!  
  
**Chieru：**  
...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oops, so sorry! I might've mixed up a couple of words there!  
Not \"make\" fun \"of\"—I came to \"have\" fun \"with\" you!  
Yes, that sounds more acceptable. Even if the result's the same.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Can't fun. Gotta work.  
`Tag 3`  
**Chieru：**  
Uh-huh. Heard that one before!  
Work, work, work. How are you not tired of that excuse yet?  
Are you trying to make it your catchphrase? Are you feeling OK?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well, whatever.  
So you're working. Go on, go on—don't mind me.  
  
**Chieru：**  
As it happens, I just came here on a field trip anyway!  
So you ignore me and keep working hard as always.  
Yes, I'll just watch from an inconspicuous distance!  
  
**Chieru：**  
What?  
Oh, no, I think not! I'm certainly no stalker!  
  
**Chieru：**  
To be frank, since our school forbids all part-timing,  
I find myself pining for this kind of working atmosphere!  
  
**Chieru：**  
This might surprise you, but I'm hyped to become a productive  
member of society!  
 I don't have a career path planned out,  
but I'm considering vocational options!  
  
**Chieru：**  
So please carry on!  
Do your work. Show me what it's all about.  
  
**Chieru：**  
I'll just make sure I don't get in the way of your work  
by watching from this shadowy spot!  
I've got a great view here, and you can barely see me at all!  
  
**Chieru：**  
What?  
 Oh, no, I think not. No stalkers around here!  
This is a field trip! Nope, stalking is not on the agenda.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Actually, is your head overinflated?  
Why would anybody want to stalk you, anyway?  
As if any girl would make a hobby of that. Are you feeling OK?  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Hm?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? I thought I just saw someone.  
Well, whatever! Back to my lovely field trip!  
  
**Narration：**  
And having received {player}'s implicit approval,  
Chieru and Ayumi enjoyed a pleasant day of legal stalking activities.
