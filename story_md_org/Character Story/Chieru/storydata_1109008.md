**Narration：**  
One lazy Sunday, {player} is strolling through the city  
when he finds himself assaulted from behind  
by a Flying Cross Chop out of nowhere.  
  
**???：**  
Heeeey there!  
  
**Chieru：**  
From the skies above, the heavenly Chieru descends!  
I'm going for the way-too-full-of-energy angle today!  
Am I absolutely killing it on the cute meter, or what?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Um... So I've gotta ask,  
what're you doing out here today without your delivery bag?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Cheru~n! ☆  
**Choice: (2)**  Can't stuff. Gotta work.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? What kind of dumb response do you call that?  
It doesn't even answer the question.  
Can you try to uphold your side of this serious conversation?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Chieru：**  
Rejected before I even asked?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Um, but hang on. You're just forcing that gag now, aren't you?  
If you say \"gotta work\" when you don't even have work,  
that's generally known as a \"lie.\" Are you all right in the head?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Chieru：**  
C'mon, {player}. Are you even listening?  
Please don't try to dodge the issue by happily sparkling away.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh...?  
Wait, what's this light? It's coming this way...  
Huaaaaghhhh!

**Chieru：**  
Huaaaaghhhh!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Help meeee!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Buegh! *pant*... *pant*...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wh-what just happened? What is this madness?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Who decided I should pay cash and line up for ages  
to have my soul ejected through my throat?  
Why is this a thing? Are you trying to torture me?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ahh...?! Wait, don't tell me  
you're a deviant who gets off on terrifying cute girls to death?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Heck no, heck no, heck no!  
I'm scared on two different levels now!  
Save me from both these terrors!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh?  
Um, well, yes, that's true.  
I *was* the one who said we should try this ride...  
  
**Chieru：**  
But still...!  
I-I didn't know it would be this high up!  
A-aahhh... This is... this is... this is...!

**Chieru：**  
Nguaaaahhhh!!!  
  
**Chieru：**  
I'm sorry I didn't think this throooough!

**Chieru：**  
Ughhh... My life flashed before my eyes...  
  
**Chieru：**  
We may have made a tiny error picking that as our first ride...  
All my stamina points for the day have been scattered in the wind...  
...How'd you find it, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  It was scary.  
**Choice: (5)**  It was fun.  
`Tag 4`  
**Chieru：**  
Huh...?  
I didn't know you had emotions like \"fear\"...  
It's hard to tell when you have the same blank stare the whole time.  
  
**Chieru：**  
From where I'm standing, it looked more like  
the \"oh, huh\" face you make when you hear thunder,  
but apparently that counts as a scared face to you. I'll remember that.

`Tag 5`  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, I see. You enjoyed the sight  
of an innocent young girl screaming in terror that much.  
I knew I could count on your twisted mind.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Chieru：**  
But enough about that!  
{player}, that was just the first ride of the day!  
We've gotta chell up the pace if we're gonna make good time!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Leisurely enjoying the park may be a valid choice as well,  
but our goal here today is to try every single attraction!  
This is no time for vacant stares, my friend!  
 Oh—that's just your face!  
  
**Chieru：**  
By the way, I've got a ton of notes on this park!  
Since I'm dragging you along, I had to put in a little effort!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, but of course, it's not that I was so excited I couldn't sleep,  
so I stayed up all night looking up theme park deets,  
or any ridiculous ideas like that. Just so you know.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well, I guess there might have been  
a *little* bit of that situation involved...  
  
**Chieru：**  
However! Online deets aren't everything. They're just secondhand info.  
What we really enjoy—what plan works best for us—  
is for us to decide through personal experience!  
  
**Chieru：**  
So come on!  
Let's get chelling and try every ride!  
 Yeah!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yahoo!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wahey!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Cheruru~n!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ahhh, this is fun!  
Man, we're making it through these at a great pace!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh...? What's the matter, {player}?  
That plain face of yours is looking even less lively than usual.  
We've still got the final leg left to run, you know?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  This is a tough schedule...  
`Tag 7`  
**Chieru：**  
Aw, don't be like that.  
It's true that I'm rushing us onward at a breakneck pace,  
but that's 'cause today's theme is quantity over quality!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh~? But it's a waste if we don't, right?  
There are so many neat-looking attractions to enjoy.  
We've gotta make it through as many of them as time allows.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Are you just that impatient?  
**Choice: (9)**  Are you an efficiency freak?  
`Tag 8`  
**Chieru：**  
Oh... Apparently I do give that impression sometimes.  
Personally, I'm just trying to make the most of what I'm given...  
  
Jump to tag 10  
`Tag 9`  
**Chieru：**  
Wow, you're rude.  
Can't you find a nicer word for it?  
Like \"unbridled curiosity\" or \"the spirit of adventure\"?  
  
`Tag 10`  
**Chieru：**  
But, well... I suppose.  
It's true that my friends and so on  
often tell me I should \"slow down a little.\"  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? But like, how can I waste this time?!  
Youth is short, you know?  
We've only got a few years to have unbridled fun!  
  
**Chieru：**  
That's why I want to savor these brief years before adulthood begins—  
this season of saying \"cherun\" and laughing happily with friends—  
by filling it with fun that I can look back on without regrets.  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Or whatever!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yeah—the other day, we had to write down  
\"goals for the future\" for a career thing at school!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well, at the time I scribbled down  
random stuff like being a domestic helper...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, but no—I do have real plans too!  
I've given a decent amount of thought to what I want to do...  
  
**Chieru：**  
But... it's not so much a \"goal\" exactly. More like a dream...  
Well, it's not what you'd call a career, anyway,  
so I thought there wasn't much point telling the teachers!  
  
**Choice: (11)**  What kind of dream?  
`Tag 11`  
**Chieru：**  
Ehhh~? Who actually asks that~?  
Well, I did kind of bring it up now because I was hoping you might.  
  
**Chieru：**  
All right! My real dream...  
is to go sightseeing on a tour around the world!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ahaha. Sounds dumb, doesn't it?  
And honestly, maybe I am a dumb person.  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Huh?  
You're not laughing.  
  
**Choice: (12)**  Tell me more details.  
`Tag 12`  
**Chieru：**  
Eh? Why the super-serious face?  
Huh? Details?  
Y-you wanna hear about this? Seriously?  
  
**Chieru：**  
No, I mean... Sure, I'll share. Since it's you.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Um, so... this is actually not a random idea I came up with,  
but a real dream I've been thinking about since I was little...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Once I graduate high school, I'm going to travel abroad.  
  
**Chieru：**  
\"Where to\"? Well... umm...  
 everywhere.  
Let's see... I guess I'll start off close to home.  
Then I'd like to just keep moving, crossing border after border.  
  
**Chieru：**  
I'll find work along the way,  
live like that for a year or two...  
 or maybe even longer?  
For now, I just want to keep going as long as I can.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well, I know what you're thinking.  
To put it in a clichéd way, it's what you'd call a journey to find myself.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Like, I'd set off right this minute if I could!  
There are plenty of fields where teenagers can compete  
on the global stage, so I don't think it's too early.  
  
**Chieru：**  
But to really do this, I'll need proper finances.  
And I can't let my parents down,  
so I've promised to stay in Japan till I'm done with high school.  
  
**Chieru：**  
I'm super grateful to my mom and dad.  
Since I was little, they've always let me do  
whatever lessons and stuff I asked for.  
  
**Chieru：**  
And some of those things, I'm even still doing now.  
So honestly, if it's about hobbies or challenging myself,  
I've got tons of options in my life already.  
  
**Chieru：**  
But... I'm sure there must be more out there!  
  
**Chieru：**  
I don't know what they are yet,  
but this world must be full of fun things I still haven't heard of!  
That's why I...  
  
**Chieru：**  
I want to travel all over,  
meet all kinds of people,  
and find all sorts of new dreams.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Then I'll look back on all the dreams I've found,  
think super hard, choose really carefully,  
and become the me I want to be the very most!  
  
**Chieru：**  
That's my real dream!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Cheru~n! ☆  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
And... welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hmmm... Interesting.  
Chierun thinks harder about this stuff than you'd guess.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I mean... w-we knew this is what she's really like, right?  
She loves to clown around, playing up the whole \"cheru~n\" routine...  
  
**Ameth：**  
But her tough personality always shines through.  
...Mostly in the form of faux-innocent snark.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, whatever.  
I'm sure you've known from the beginning  
that there's more to her than vibes and impulses.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Maybe it's thanks to your memory loss,  
but you never judge people on surface appearances.  
That's why you always manage to get through to their hearts.  
  
**Ameth：**  
...Oh well, I guess there's no point telling you this.  
You don't do this stuff on a conscious level,  
and you'll forget I said any of this when you wake up, anyway.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Bye-bye now, {player}.  
Keep helping Chierun find herself,  
as long as it doesn't get in the way of your actual work.

**Chieru：**  
U... unhhh...  
I can't eat any more roller coasters...  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Uweh? Is this Landosol...?  
Oh, right... This again. That light gave me a weird dream...  
  
**Chieru：**  
What was the dream about...?  
I think I was with someone like him, on something like a date,  
and then I started talking about serious future plans...  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Urk. Not good.  
I can't really remember, but somehow I feel super embarrassed.  
  
**Choice: (13)**  Good morning...  
`Tag 13`  
**Chieru：**  
Eeeek!  
  
**Chieru：**  
G-g-g-good morning to you too!  
O-oh, right! It's just you, {player}! What a chelly shock!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh? You too?  
Huh... You had the weirdest dream. I see, I see.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Um, just to check. This may be a silly question,  
but was it a dream like this?  
One with a boxy machine that you ride up and down...?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, I knew it! It's the same!  
Yep, then we should drop this topic!  
We're done here! Bye-bye!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Go on. I said we're done. Hurry on home.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? Why are you still here, {player}?  
What? Little old me?  
Well, I'm gonna hang around here for a while...  
  
**Chieru：**  
No, I don't have stuff to do.  
But it's a lovely Sunday, so it'd be a total waste  
to head straight home as early as this, wouldn't it?  
  
**Chieru：**  
You never know where you'll find fun new things!  
Gotta go out and look for them!  
Hey, do you want to come too? With me? To chell around?  
  
**Chieru：**  
\"Can't chell. Gotta work.\"  
  
**Chieru：**  
That's your next line, isn't it?  
Yes, yes, I know the drill. How hilarious.  
Honestly... The youth of today are no chelling fun...  
  
**Choice: (14)**  Let's chell around.  
`Tag 14`  
**Chieru：**  
Huh?  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Huh?! What?  
Wait. Did you just say you'd come with me?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Um... yes! Of course!  
I'd, um...  
 S-sounds chellerific.  
Then... sure. Let's go and... do stuff together.  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Eheheh.  
  
**Narration：**  
After all the time she'd spent stubbornly chasing him,  
Chieru found herself strangely embarrassed  
by the prospect of sharing an ordinary walk with {player}.
