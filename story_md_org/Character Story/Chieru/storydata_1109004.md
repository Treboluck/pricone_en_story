**Narration：**  
While on a stroll through the city,  
{player} bumps into Chieru on her way home from school.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh? If it isn't {player}!  
What a fluke!  
 Cheru~n! ☆  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Cheru~n.  
**Choice: (2)**  Hello there.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chieru：**  
\"Cheru~n\"?  
Ooh, what's that adorable greeting?! Whoever thought it up is a genius!  
What kind of ultra-adorable mega-genius could she be?!

**Chieru：**  
...\"Hello\"?  
*sigh*... This is what's wrong with you, {player}.  
You mustn't let outdated ideas tie you down.  
  
**Chieru：**  
To make a difference in this world, you've gotta try bold new things!  
You can't reach the future while common sense holds you back!  
I have a message just for you and your old-fashioned ways:  
  
**Chieru：**  
Don't run from the \"cheru~n\"!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Chieru：**  
Uhhh...  
 Um, {player}? No, no, don't worry.  
That whole response was random nonsense,  
so don't bother scouring it for meaning.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Um, so, what are you doing here, anyway?  
It looks like your body's gone all sparkly...  
Huh? What new game is this?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Actually... huh? It's coming for me too?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? Huhhh?!  
Wh-wh-what is this light?  
 Isn't it super rude?!  
Pyeaaaghhh!

**Guy 1：**  
Well, guys and gals!  
Looks like we've all got our third round of drinks!  
So for the third time, here's to us! Cheers!  
  
**Guys：**  
Waheeeey!  
  
**Girls：**  
Yaaaay!  
  
**Chieru：**  
I wanna go home...  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Please, Kazama!  
Do you have to be such a downer?!  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Seriously, Kazama. The other girls'll think we're mood-killers!  
  
**Girl 3：**  
We worked really hard to set up this boyfriend opportunity!  
At least make an effort to look lively!  
  
**Chieru：**  
'Kaaaay.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Aw man...  
Miiko and the girls are good pals,  
so I came along when they asked me to make up the numbers...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Even though I already had plans,  
I had to drop them all just to come to this mixer...  
  
**Chieru：**  
And what do I get? A crowd of indistinguishable boys  
rambling on about who-cares-what and boring me half to death.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ugh, what a waste.  
The seconds of my precious youth are ticking pointlessly away...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Sigh...  
Chierun wants to go home now...  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Kazama! Hey—your face is a mess!  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Remember your charm! Show us a smile, Kazama!  
  
**Girl 3：**  
Exactly—isn't that what you're good at?!  
Do your weird \"cheru~n\" thing and lighten up the mood!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ehhh~? Sure, I *guess* I can.  
But you'd better buy me a strawberry yogurt crepe tomorrow.  
  
**Girl 1：**  
If you do a good job, sure.  
  
**Chieru：**  
...I'll hold you to that!  
  
**Guy 2：**  
So, hey!  
Whereabouts are you girls from?  
Where d'you usually hang out?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, well~!  
It depends on who we're hanging with,  
but we're usually free to go pretty much anywhere~!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Miiko and the girls, that is. I wouldn't go if you paid me.  
  
**Guy 1：**  
For real?! Listen, then, Chieru!  
You should come out with me sometime!  
I know a ton of cool places!  
  
**Guy 2：**  
No, no, no... Listen, Chieru.  
I know this town better than him, and everyone knows my name!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ooh, you're so amazing! Let's schedule a date sometime!  
  
**Chieru：**  
With Miiko and the girls, that is.  
My next opening's 'round about the twelfth of never.  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Hey, Kazama!  
Tone it down a little!  
 Now all the boys are laser-focused on you!  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Make your mind up.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, hey, listen.  
Here's a stellar plan—why don't I hurry on home?  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Hang in there a *little* longer.  
I'll add some banana on top of the strawberry yogurt, 'kay?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hah, you think that's gonna cover it?  
I'll be needing kiwi, pineapple, mango—the full tropical works.  
  
**Girl 3：**  
Ngh... Kazama...!  
  
**Chieru：**  
You can call me Chierun if you like, you know~?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ah, geez...  
I like the sound of tropical fun with the girls tomorrow,  
but nothing's chelling up my mood here tonight...  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Hm?  
What's this? That boy sitting at the very edge of the guys' group...  
  
**Chieru：**  
I dunno... He's smiling and nodding along with the others,  
but I don't think he's spoken a word since the introductions.  
Umm, what was his name again? {player}?  
  
**Chieru：**  
He doesn't really fit in with the other shallow tryhards,  
so maybe he just came along to make up the numbers?  
Wow, what an angel. That's so me!  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Hey—Kazama! Your eyes are glazing over!  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Can you *try* to take part?!  
Maybe you don't care, but for us, this is a big deal!  
  
**Girl 3：**  
Yeah, throw us a freakin' bone!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ah, geez... Fine, fine...  
  
**Girl 1：**  
No, not \"fine, fine.\" It's \"cheru~n,\" remember?!  
Don't run from the \"cheru~n,\" Kazama!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Don't try to force the \"cheru~n,\" dude.  
I'll sue you for chelly harrassment.  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Quit being stubborn! Just do your usual thing  
and miracle-whatever chelly-chelly-hoy it up already!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Excuse me? It's \"twinkle twinkle hoy.\"  
And that's not me, that's Maho from the class next door!  
  
**Girl 3：**  
Oh, really? Still, they're basically the same thing!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well, they *are* basically the same.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Whew...  
The wind feels good...  
  
**Chieru：**  
I said I got a call from my folks and slipped out for a breather...  
But yeah. Staying here much longer might be pushing it.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh well, guess I'll head back in. For the sake of that  
strawberry-yogurt-banana-kiwi-pineapple-mango crepe...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  What're you doing?  
`Tag 4`  
**Chieru：**  
Ueghh! The tagalong dude from before?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huhhh...? Why's he out here?  
What now?  
 Oh well, guess I'll flash a smile.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, nice to see you! Chelly evening~! ☆  
  
**Chieru：**  
Man, it was just so hot and stuffy back inside,  
I slipped out for some fresh air! Ahaha!  
 Um, how 'bout you?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, you needed a breather too?  
Guess me and you are birds of a feather!  
  
**Chieru：**  
He's like me...? Yeah. I think... he is.  
  
**Chieru：**  
It's just a feeling...  
But there's something about him.  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Hey. Can I ask you something?  
  
**Chieru：**  
About this whole... well, mixer-type thing?  
The posers-getting-together routine?  
Do you come to these a lot?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  All the time.  
**Choice: (6)**  Not really, no.  
`Tag 5`  
**Chieru：**  
You're a party animal?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
No... That's a joke, right?  
I saw you back there, all on your own.  
You weren't getting into the party vibes at all.  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Chieru：**  
Uh-huh, I figured.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Chieru：**  
Well... I guess I didn't need to ask.  
When I saw you inside,  
it was obvious you were out of your depth.  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Though of course, today, I'm not one to be pointing fingers.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Like, I don't mean to say I'm even slightly shy.  
If anything, most of the time I'm the life of the party.  
But I'm just not feeling today's event. It's so... \"ehhhh.\" You know?  
  
**Chieru：**  
And just so you know, I had lessons this evening.  
I dropped everything to come here! And look where that got me!  
Isn't this the total worst? Worster than the worstest, even?  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Huh? Oh—my lessons?  
Today I had, um... art and dancing penciled in.  
Mm, yeah. I do a bunch of stuff. Just casually.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ah, geez... What a waste of time.  
If I was gonna skip lessons, I'd rather be gaming at home.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  You're a gamer?  
`Tag 8`  
**Chieru：**  
Oh—well, sort of, I guess.  
Whether it's hobbies or whatever, I'm the kind of girl  
who'll give anything a try if it catches my interest.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Recently... there's this game that's been  
a hit with girls at my school.  
\"Legend of Astrum,\" it's called.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh?  
Wait, you play Astrum too, {player}?  
...Hm? Huh? Wait, isn't that name...?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hey, {player}!  
Sorry, but... could you maybe tell me your account name?  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
And... welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just saw was something like a dream.  
You'll forget it all once you wake up,  
so don't think too hard about it, OK?  
  
**Ameth：**  
After that, you and Chierun  
realized you'd already met each other over \"here,\"  
and had fun reminiscing over your adventures.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It went on for so long, you two never did go back inside,  
which earned you teasing and icy looks from your friends...  
But yes, we can go into those details another time.  
  
**Ameth：**  
If the two of you  
manage to gather enough of your scattered memories,  
maybe I'll even be able to show you firsthand.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But there's not a lot of point telling you that right now.  
Oh well. You just go and have fun with Chierun.  
She may not look it, but she's more rational than you might think.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She can be a bit too blunt with the things she says,  
but even that works as a social tactic to get to know people quickly.  
Though other times, she really does talk without thinking...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, I think that's all from me for now.  
See you later!  
  

---  
  
**Chieru：**  
*yawn*...  
Oh—{player}? Good morning, I guess...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh...? Wait, was I fast asleep just now?  
Weird... It feels like I just had a really funny dream.  
Am I OK in the head?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh—that's right, that's right, I was in some kind of cute cafe!  
And after that, I ended up chatting with an interesting guy...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, yes! That's just it! He was so easy to talk to...  
Huh? Why do *you* know about my dream? That's creepy.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh!  
 Speaking of cafes, there's a nice one just over there!  
Well then, {player}, instead of standing around,  
why don't you go ahead and buy me a—  
  
**Chieru：**  
No. Wait a minute, Chieru.  
  
**Chieru：**  
A boy and a girl in a cafe.  
Hmm. Is that...  
 the best idea?  
  
**Chieru：**  
With this guy, it sounds patently ridiculous,  
but if anyone saw us and thought it looked like a date...  
Miiko might be... not so happy.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh! Actually!  
It's absolutely nothing! Let's go home!  
Even if it is a bit of a shame...  
  
**Chieru：**  
No, no, no. Why's this getting me down?  
That doesn't even make sense. Yeah. I should go home.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? You're not going home?  
Oh—you're gonna drop by that cafe first?  
Huh... That's interesting...  
  
**Chieru：**  
...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Coincidence much?! So am I~! ☆  
  
**Narration：**  
Rationalizing to herself that you can't argue with coincidence,  
Chieru skipped over to the cafe with {player} after all.
