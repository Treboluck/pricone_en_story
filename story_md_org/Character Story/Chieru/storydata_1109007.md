# Chieru Episode 7
One morning, Chieru goes for a solo walk—but when she bumps into {player}, it soon turns into a duo walk. As she drags him out of the city on a mad dash around the region, Chieru comes to realize how much she enjoys their time together.

**Narration：**  
One morning on a day off school,  
Chieru decides to kill time by sneaking into school anyway—  
not St. Theresa's, but a classroom in Lucent Academy.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Gooood morning!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Heheh. Even if I clearly don't belong here,  
nobody asks questions if I act like I own the place!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well, in the first place, it's not a school day,  
so there aren't many people around  
besides kids who've shown up for clubs or extra lessons.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hmm, doesn't look like anyone I know is here...  
I know Suzy and Misacky aren't winning any prizes for studying,  
so I thought they'd be here for remedial classes...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well, whatever!  
If I ain't got friends here, I just gotta make some!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Morning, morning! Mind if I sit here?  
  
**Student：**  
Oh, good morning...  
 Wait, who're you?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Just chelly ol' Chieru!  
 Cheru~n! ☆  
  
**Student：**  
Huh~? That's no help.  
But you seem fun, so whatever!  
 Cheru~n! ☆  
  
**Student：**  
That uniform... You're not from this school, right?  
Did you sneak in for extra classes? Here, sit down.  
  
**Chieru：**  
I sure will! Thanks a chellion!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Man, this laid-back vibe at Lucy AC is the best!  
My usual little ol' school gets so uptight about rules.  
  
**Student：**  
Oh...? What little ol' school's that?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Little ol' St. Theresa's Academy for Girls!  
  
**Student：**  
St. T's?!  
That place is super elite!  
No way! Are you a rich girl?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well... sure.  
If you mean, like, my family, I guess you could say that.  
  
**Student：**  
Ehhh~? I thought rich girls were more...  
 sparkly and shiny!  
Or, like...  
 proper and graceful!  
Or, um...  
 always saying \"oh my\" and \"good day,\"  
 you know?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yep! We've got lotsa girls like that.  
My folks earned their whole fortune from scratch,  
but most girls at St. T's are sheltered old-money types!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Still, even \"good day\" gals  
are super diverse and fun once you get to know them!  
  
**Chieru：**  
You get gals who've spent their whole lives in all-girls' settings,  
so by the time they reach high school, they're afraid of literally nothing,  
like my pal Miiko and her buds!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, and also,  
I heard there's a total delinquent and a hopeless shut-in around too!  
Hilarious, right? Aha! I *so* wanna meet them!  
  
**Student：**  
Ohhh... Sounds like lots of fun!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yep, it's wild! St. T's is the best!  
  
**Student：**  
...Huh?  
But wait—why'd you come to our school then, Chieru?  
Aren't you scouting it out for a transfer or something?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Nopers!  
I just dropped by. Like an adventure!  
Huh? Isn't that how going for walks works?  
  
**Student：**  
Oh... You're on a walk right now, huh...?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yep!  
Since there's no school today,  
I thought I'd see where my own two legs can take me!  
  
**Student：**  
Huh... On your own?  
  
**Chieru：**  
The idea's to chell around a bunch of different places!  
It'd be more fun with a group, sure,  
but I'd hate to drag them all over the city.  
  
**Chieru：**  
So on that note, I oughtta get going!  
See you 'round! Chelly-bye now!  
  
**Student：**  
Huh?! Wait... but the lessons...?!  
  
**Student：**  
...And she's gone.  
What a funny girl she was... Heheh.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wow! So big and fancy!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wow! So small and cheap!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wow! So mid and normal!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hmmm...  
  
**Chieru：**  
What's the deal?  
I've been flitting around following my impulses,  
but it feels like my hype meter's topped out...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh? Over there... That's {player}!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh—right...  
My plan today was to go anywhere and everywhere,  
but before I knew it, I'm back to the same old spot...  
  
**Chieru：**  
...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well, whatever!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Heeey, {player}! What a fluke!  
Your luck just ran clean out—welcome to the tour from hell!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Apropos of zilch, how'd you like to go somewhere with me?  
Or maybe lots of places?!  
All the places and more, even?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Can't places. Gotta work.  
**Choice: (2)**  No work today. Gotta rest.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chieru：**  
There you go again, parroting that line like a Shadow.  
I've heard it enough times by now!  
It's not gonna catch on, you know?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Besides, {player},  
you're not carrying your delivery bag today!  
You can't fool a genius—I can see you're free as a bird!

`Tag 2`  
**Chieru：**  
Did you say \"rest\"?! Rest is for the weak!  
Don't give up on life before you've lived it!  
You'll never accomplish anything with that negative attitude!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Chieru：**  
So with zero ado, time to get moving!  
Dash, dash, dash to the ends of the earth!  
Better be quick, or I'll leave you in the dust!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Let's... chelly-cheru!  
  
**Chieru：**  
...  
  
**Chieru：**  
H-huh?  
Umm, {player}?  
I noticed you're not running?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ahhh... Super sorry.  
Did you *actually* have something important to do?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  On second thought, I'm actually free.  
`Tag 4`  
**Chieru：**  
Oh—are you sure?  
I mean, if it's too much trouble, I won't push you...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Let's get chelling.  
`Tag 5`  
**Chieru：**  
W...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wahoooo!  
That's my {player}! You're in the groove!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Then without even one more ado...  
Let's chelly-cheru~!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Leap into youth! Leap out of Landosol!  
Leave the city behind and blaze a trail!  
No time to stop and smell the flowers, just—  
  
**Chieru：**  
Wait, strike that part. Yes, we can stop! Yes, let's smell flowers!  
It's not like we have a destination.  
It'd be crazy talk not to enjoy the journey!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Even the dullest and emptiest field is a picnic from another angle!  
We can't miss an instant of this great adventure.  
Let's take in all the sights and smells as we pass them!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Thus it begins! The perfect picnic!  
  
**Chieru：**  
And for Act Two! All-out fishing action!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Aw yeah! Fish get!  
This one's a whopper!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Now grill it! Eat it! Savor it!  
  
**Chieru：**  
So gooood! Praise the sea!  
 'Kay, next!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Act the Fifth! Wild beast hunting!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Aw yeah! Show me the prey!  
Shwip shwip! Swhip shwip!  
I'll catch you and cook you on the barbie!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHHH!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Looks too icky! Looks too strong! Next!  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huuooaaaargh?!  
So strong! So scary! Escaaaape!  
  
**Chieru：**  
A-Act Ten! All-out climbing!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Aw yeah! Go for the peak!  
Hammer those pitons!  
Sheer cliffs can't stop us!  
  
**Chieru：**  
...But only in your imagination, of course.  
Alas, back in reality, the sun's already setting.  
We'll have to make do with virtual climbing for today.  
  
**Chieru：**  
By the way, Virtual Chieru over here, AKA Virchieru,  
made it to the very top of the legendary peak after a journey  
of ten long days and nights. How about Virtual {player}?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I scaled the peak.  
**Choice: (7)**  I fell to my doom.  
`Tag 6`  
**Chieru：**  
Ooh! Congratchellations!  
 After a long and grueling climb,  
you reach the peak and behold a heavenly being!  
Standing before you is a goddess, radiant with unearthly beauty!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Or so you think, but wait—you spoke too soon!  
On closer inspection, the radiant beauty belongs to chelly ol' Chieru!  
Well, mistaking Chieru for a goddess is an easy error to make!

`Tag 7`  
**Chieru：**  
Ahhh! It's true! {player} slipped on a stray stone,  
snapped his safety line, and went tumbling into the void!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, {player}! {player}—!!!  
  
**Chieru：**  
But everything's fine, 'cause this is virtual.  
You get three lives per credit.  
Hit Continue and retry this stage from the top!  
  
`Tag 8`  
**Chieru：**  
Final Act: All-Out Postmortem!  
Wham! Bam! Blammety-blam!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ehm, so in conclusion,  
I think we can all agree this has been a very eventful day.  
How did you find it, Special Guest {player}?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  I'm exhausted.  
**Choice: (10)**  I'm eager for more.  
`Tag 9`  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? Say what now?  
You're tired... but it's a joyful kind of tired?  
Looking back, this was a magical page in the story of your youth?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
No... okay, you didn't actually say that.  
Sorry. I might've read a little bit too much between the lines.  
  
Jump to tag 11  
`Tag 10`  
**Chieru：**  
Um, really...?  
Sorry, even I'm gonna nope out on this one.  
We packed way too much into one day already. I'm totally stuffed.  
  
`Tag 11`  
**Chieru：**  
Still, apologizing for past mistakes isn't the Chieru way!  
  
**Chieru：**  
After all, I still had fun!  
 And I think you did too, right?  
  
**Choice: (12)**  Yeah, it was fun.  
`Tag 12`  
**Chieru：**  
Eheheh! That's good.  
Really, thank you so much for tagging along today!  
Next time I'll try to plan a slightly more compact tour.  
  
**Chieru：**  
You know, I'm always longing to experience  
as many fun things as I can find in this big, wide world...  
  
**Chieru：**  
But today, I think I learned something important!  
  
**Chieru：**  
At the end of the day, if I'm with a fun guy,  
wherever I go and whatever I do,  
I'm always gonna have a great time!  
  
**Narration：**  
And Chieru beamed at {player}  
as she explained her obvious yet monumental discovery.
