# Chieru Episode 2
Chieru makes first contact with Miiko's crush, the enigmatic {player}. To learn more about him, she engages him in spur-of-the-moment conversation, only to learn that he's a total weirdo with amnesia. But not a bad guy, on the whole.

**Narration：**  
One day, {player} is walking around Landosol  
in the middle of a delivery job  
when an unfamiliar girl pops up right in front of him.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Cheru~n! ♪  
  
**Chieru：**  
Delivery Boy, I see you're hard at work!  
Everyone really appreciates your efforts!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Thank you.  
**Choice: (2)**  Cheru~n?  
`Tag 1`  
**Chieru：**  
Wow! He's polite, too!  
  
**Chieru：**  
I see, I see... A very standard reaction.  
Maybe a teensy bit formal for a conversation with a fellow youth,  
but this isn't a situation that calls for creativity, so I'll let it slide.

`Tag 2`  
**Chieru：**  
Ooh, nice reaction!  
  
**Chieru：**  
That's a patented original greeting of mine, you know!  
It's totally free to use, so don't forget to tell all your friends!  
Cheru~n! ♪  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Chieru：**  
I, by the way, am a rosy-fresh first-year at St. Theresa's: Chieru!  
You can call me Chierun, Chellypon, or any other adorable nickname!  
Now that you know me, what do they call you?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Some call me {player}.  
`Tag 4`  
**Chieru：**  
Ooh~! What a lovely name! Which I've never heard before!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Heh heh heh. Little does he know...!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Finally we meet, dear {player}.  
That grueling half hour munching on sweet buns in the shadows  
as I staked out Miiko's mailbox really paid off!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Now—let the games begin.  
Just call me Chieru the One-Day Queen of Romance!  
Miiko's random affections  
 will soon be yours to embrace!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Well then, if that's all...  
**Choice: (6)**  Bye now.  
`Tag 5`  
`Tag 6`  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, sure! See you around!  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Wait!  
  
**Chieru：**  
No, no, no. Wait right there a second.  
Who the heck said we're done talking?  
I mean, we barely even started yet!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh?  
Well, if you ask what I actually want...  
 I'm not sure what to say...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Zero points for planning. Hmm, what now?  
I dashed straight at the target as soon as I found him,  
so I didn't think this far ahead...  
  
**Chieru：**  
I've got him right where I need him,  
but yeah, this is where the hard part starts.  
How'm I gonna lead the conversation toward Miiko?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hmm...  
Miiko and the girls told me *not* to just spill the beans, too...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well, whatever! I'll just go with the flow and see what happens.  
If anyone's an expert at flow-going, it's me.  
  
**Chieru：**  
So, umm~? You know~?  
Isn't the weather just lovely today~?  
Oh, yes, it really is pleasant and sunny! Total same!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Um, so, like, how's stuff lately? Pretty fine?  
Wow! Total coinkydink! All's fine with Chieru, too! Chelly fine, even!  
  
**Chieru：**  
By the way, what exactly are you up to right now?  
Work?  
 Oh, doing deliveries!  
Yes, of course! Ahah! I knew that~!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hmmm... What's this empty conversation?  
It's got less substance than a vacuum.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well, I *am* rambling about nothing, so I guess that checks out.  
And it doesn't help that he only gives the blandest reactions.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Bland... but I suppose  
 it's not a disrespectful sort of bland.  
I dunno. It's like... he's just vaguely detached?  
Not just verbally, but in general? Like... he's just... vague as a person.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, right. What was it Miiko was saying?  
That he defies all the usual examples?  
Now that I look at him...  
 Hmm. I guess she might be right?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Well, I should get back to work.  
`Tag 7`  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, su~re! See you later!  
  
**Chieru：**  
...is *not* my line!  
Didn't I *just* say we're still talking?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Actually, {player}, I'm impressed.  
You get to have a conversation with a girl as cute as me,  
and you're making multiple skedaddle attempts? Are you feeling OK?  
  
**Chieru：**  
This is where boys usually go gaga, you know.  
Aren't you gonna?  
 I mean, not that I want you to,  
 but *really? *  
Not even a hint of the usual annoying ploys for attention?  
  
**Chieru：**  
\"Like what\"?  
 Well, uh...  
Like, for instance, when you introduce yourself,  
you could try to make a big thing of how special you are.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Y'know—the thing where you just happen to mention  
that you live in some fancy upscale area or whatever.  
Ugh... I'm gonna puke just thinking about it...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh—so where *do* you live right now?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh?  
Ummm... So, like, you don't... *have* a home address?  
No... no hometown or anything?  
 Um, but like... why?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  I've got no reason.  
**Choice: (9)**  I've got no memories.  
**Choice: (10)**  I've got nothing in this world.  
`Tag 8`  
`Tag 9`  
`Tag 10`  
**Chieru：**  
Huh.  
 ...Huh?! You're an amnesiac?!  
But... uh... Is this for real?  
Huh? Huh? You really don't remember *anything? *  
  
**Chieru：**  
...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, is this a prank?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Judging from that face, gonna say that's a no.  
  
**Chieru：**  
...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Dear Miiko.  
I've got bad news.  
The guy you're into has a serious case of not normal.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hopeless romantics may tell you  
\"where there's love, there's a way,\"  
 but, um, I dunno.  
If I'm being honest, I think this one might be a bit too out-there.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Also, he's not nearly as cute as you made him out to be.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Mm... so. What do I do now...?  
  
**Chieru：**  
H-hey, real sorry, {player}.  
Could you tell me a little bit more about, like,  
your entire life and that kind of thing?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hmm, hm...  
Oh, I see, so it's like that.  
Huh... Interesting.  
 And then? What next?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Dear Miiko.  
I think I'll keep trying a little longer.  
  
**Chieru：**  
This boy may indeed be bizarrely vague as a person,  
and a lost soul without any home, memories or identity.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Also, he may not be as cute as you made him out to be.  
  
**Chieru：**  
However, I feel like he's not actually a bad guy.  
Thanks to his strange background, he comes across as rather awkward,  
but I don't think he does anything illegal or immoral.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hmm, hm. Yes, I see... So, um...  
Right now... you're living with a girl who's much younger than you?  
  
**Chieru：**  
...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yes, I see! Tell me more.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Go on...? What about this girl?  
Oh... you make her wait on you hand and foot? Take money from her?  
Yes, yes... And you sleep in the same bed. I see, I see.  
  
**Chieru：**  
...  
  
**Chieru：**  
What's wrong with you?!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Dear Miiko.  
I hope you're doing well. This is Chieru from St. Theresa's.  
I'd like to deliver my report on the investigation we discussed.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Verdict: Heck no.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Heck no. Just give up.  
It's not happening.  
This target is a piece of work beyond saving.  
  
**Chieru：**  
He blithely relates atrocities defying all public morals  
like some kind of completely unhinged psychopath.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Like, I mean, I know I'm the one who asked...  
But even if you're asked, who admits to this stuff?  
Is he asking me to turn him into the authorities, or what?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Honestly... he even gives perverts a bad name.  
Like, if I was a pervert,  
I'd at least make an effort to keep it on the down-low.  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Hm? Wait, does this mean...?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Logically speaking?  
If he's happy to tell everyone about this stuff,  
then he can't actually be doing... anything... wrong...?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Um... {player}.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Really sorry, but could we  
go over the stuff you just told me in a *tiny* bit more detail?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Dear Miiko.  
  
**Chieru：**  
I've just concluded my first direct contact with the target.  
I'd like to report my own subjective impressions of his character.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Tentative verdict: Yep-going-on-nope.  
  
**Chieru：**  
After extensive questioning, I'm pretty sure he's innocent.  
To put it kindly, he's pure. To put it less kindly, he's a total chump.  
  
**Chieru：**  
There's no denying he's weird,  
 but I guess he isn't a bad guy.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Still, he's nowhere near as cute as you claimed. Best regards.  
  
**Narration：**  
And Chieru skipped along the homeward road,  
musing on how this world is full of the strangest people.
