# Chieru Episode 3
Chieru makes contact with {player} a second time, this time turning the topic to romance in an effort to make Miiko's dreams come true. But strangely enough, he shows no interest in the subject whatsoever. Surprised by this unusual reaction from a boy his age, Chieru feels an unexpected connection to him.
  
## Subtitle: Weirdness Is a Virtue
  
**Narration：**  
On the way home from school,  
Chieru has waved goodbye to her friends  
and is wandering alone through the city streets.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Aw man...  
I was really hoping to eat extra-fluffy crepes with the girls today.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well, it's not their fault something suddenly came up.  
Let's stay positive and flip this on its head!  
Looks like today, I've got some unexpected free time!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Yay! Awesome!  
Ooh, whatever shall I do~? So many possibilities!  
Maybe I'll indulge in that most refined of activities: a walk!  
  
**???：**  
Oh...? If it ain't Chieru!  
It's been forever! Wahey!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh—hi there. Long time no wahey.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Uh, who's this? The guy with the ultra-hip and \"with it\" aura.  
He comes on pretty strong, but when did he ever appear in my life?  
Maybe he's from that time I hung out with a crowd from another school.  
  
**Chieru：**  
I can't remember every random doofus I run into,  
so to protect my precious memory space,  
I go ahead and forget them as soon as the night's over. So sorry!  
  
**Random Doofus：**  
What a riot!  
 You seriously out here on your ownsome?  
Where's Miiko and the guys?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, they kind of stood me up today,  
so I'm enjoying a chelly little walk for a change~!  
  
**Random Doofus：**  
Wow, lame!  
Then why don't you and me hit up a cafe?  
I'll treat you to somethin'.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Nope, I'll pass~! ☆  
Chelly-bye now! ♪  
  
**Random Doofus：**  
Huh?  
Wait... Uh, you're free, aren'tcha?!  
Hold up! Wait a sec, girl!  
  
**Chieru：**  
No, I'm not \"free.\" I'm swimming in endless possibilities.  
Can't let a second of my precious youth go to waste.  
  
**Chieru：**  
No~w then! Is anything interesting going on anywhere~?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh? I think that's...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Nyeheh! Perfect time-killer spotted!  
Miiko, here I go again!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Heeeey there!  
  
**Chieru：**  
'Sup, 'sup! Long time no wahey!  
So good to see you again, {player}!  
Whew, thank goodness I didn't go along with the other doofus!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Like, as it so happens, I was wandering around just hoping  
to bump into an old pal like you!  
 Haha!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Who are you again?  
`Tag 1`  
**Chieru：**  
Oh, you joker!  
Oh, you funny joker!  
  
**Chieru：**  
You know me, don'tcha? It's me, Chieru!  
Remember? I talked your ear off just the other day!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Um. So, like, what's the blank stare for?  
Huh...? For real?  
Are you saying you've *actually* forgotten about me?  
  
**Chieru：**  
No way. Wait, wait, wait. Isn't that incredible?  
Like, are you sane?  
 How do you even manage to forget a face this cute?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Awww, how hopeless can you get?  
Okay, I'll give you a hint.  
Well, I say \"hint,\" but it's basically just the answer. Ready, and...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Cheru~n! ☆  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Cheru~n...?  
**Choice: (3)**  Uh-huh...  
`Tag 2`  
**Chieru：**  
So close! That was too quiet, and the finger-flick was limp!  
Now, watch—you've gotta give it stars-from-the-eyes energy!  
Che! ☆ Ru~n! ☆☆☆  
  
**Chieru：**  
Now, are we all clear?  
Good, then it's your turn next. Ready... go!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? Why-the-blank-stare, part two.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? You're kidding me, right? Even this doesn't jog your memory?  
It's \"cheru~n,\" you know?! Watch me:  
 Cheru~n! ☆  
  
**Chieru：**  
Look, isn't something wrong here? You should totally remember this!  
After a display like that, you can go \"What a cutie\" or \"What a weirdo,\"  
but either way, it's gotta stick in your mind somehow!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Chieru：**  
Hm?  
 Oh, you finally remembered?  
Right, I see. The overwhelming chaos energy reminded you.  
Yes, I see, I see. The sheer torrent of unstoppable verbiage.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ohhh, you! No need to shower me in compliments!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Um, so what're you doing right now, {player}?  
Well, I guess you're part-timing again! Given the delivery bag.  
  
**Chieru：**  
No, no, don't mind me!  
Yes, I know. You've got your work to do.  
Go ahead, go ahead! You wouldn't want to be late!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Bye, then.  
`Tag 5`  
**Chieru：**  
Yes, yes! Hurry along now~!  
  
**Chieru：**  
So, anyway!  
There's a little question I've been wanting to ask.  
Are you interested in any—  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Why are you coming with me?  
`Tag 6`  
**Chieru：**  
Huh?  
Well, like you said, you've got work to do.  
  
**Chieru：**  
No, no! I'd hate to get in the way!  
Please carry on! Don't mind me at all!  
  
**Chieru：**  
I'll just tag along of my own accord.  
  
**Chieru：**  
So, yes! I've been meaning to ask you!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Do you have, like... a special girl in your life right now or anything?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  What do you mean?  
`Tag 7`  
**Chieru：**  
Um, what do I *mean~? *  
Huh? Like I said...  
Have you got... a girlfriend? Or a lover?  
Or a more-than-friends-but-it's-complicated?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Oh—no. No need to answer.  
I get the picture from your reaction.  
Yep, that's a nope.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Last time we talked, I was too cautious with my approach,  
so we didn't even touch on the romance angle.  
This time, I'm going pedal-to-the-metal from the start!  
  
**Chieru：**  
So, get this! I know a cute girl! Shall I introduce you? Gueheheh.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  I'm kind of busy right now, so...  
`Tag 8`  
**Chieru：**  
Hey, waaait! Don't run awaaaay!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Big oof! I hit the pedal so hard,  
I cut too many corners and almost spiraled off the track!  
  
**Chieru：**  
This is tricky.  
All I wanna do is naturally lead the convo towards romance... Let's see...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ahhh! Look at that flirty couple over there!  
Oh yeah—speaking of couples,  
have you ever thought about dating a girl yourself?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Heck yeah! So natural!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Bet you do, huh? You're at that age, huh? And you're a boy, huh?  
You try to act the gentleman, but underneath you're a total lech, huh?  
I understand! No need to tell me! I get it!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Ring-a-ding-ding! ♪  
Oh boy! This news just in!  
I've got the perfect opportunity to sate your raging libido!  
  
**Chieru：**  
The truth is... and this is a *huge* coincidence that I'm bringing up *very*  
naturally...  
 I've got this friend who's cute and shy yet also thirsty, and she  
might just want to be your girlfriend specifically! So if you like, I could—  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh?  
\"What's a girlfriend\"?  
Oh, you joker! Don't pull the innocent act on me!  
  
**Chieru：**  
A girlfriend's a girlfriend! Y'know, a lover! Honey! Sweetheart!  
Uh? Be more specific, you say?  
Well, um... I guess you go out together, eat dinners, and...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? You've got \"lots of those\"?  
No, no, no! Not like that! You can't have lots of girlfriends!  
You're thinking of the other thing! Like, just girls who are friends!  
  
**Chieru：**  
What's... the difference...?  
 Well, that's a pretty awkward one to answer...  
Um, so, like, I guess lovers are... like friends, but, um, a bit... deeper?  
With more love? Special bonds?  
 A sort of mutual agreement of intimacy?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hmm, tricky.  
What *is* this question? Philosophy?  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh? What about me?  
No way, no way. I'm not seeing anyone!  
All that dating stuff is super not my thing! Count me out!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Hmm, how should I put this?  
Like, personally, rather than getting too involved with one person,  
I'm more comfy having fun times with lots of different pals!  
  
**Chieru：**  
So? So? How 'bout you?  
Tell me why you want a girlfriend!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Huh?  
Oh, right. You never said you wanted one.  
In fact, you've shown zero interest from the start.  
 Wowee, twinsies!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Man, agreeing with me? What a rare breed you are!  
...Um, yes. It really is rare.  
Barely anyone's like this at our age.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Especially boys—they're usually a lot more eager.  
They come at me almost like animals!  
'Course, in my case, it doesn't help that I'm the cutest thing alive.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Still, they really tick me off. The pushy plays for attention.  
Especially good-looking guys—you oughtta see them swagger!  
And I'm just like \"Sure, dude. Can you calm down a little?\"  
  
**Chieru：**  
Uh, wait. Did I go too far?  
Oh nooo! Here come the icy stares again! I'm so sowwy!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Still... what's this feeling...?  
  
**Chieru：**  
This {player} guy is a boy too,  
but for some reason all this talking to him isn't getting me down.  
  
**Chieru：**  
I know he's a total weirdo!  
But then... sometimes I get these \"Huh, he's not bad!\" vibes too.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Sure, he's a total weirdo,  
but he's not like other guys... or that's how it feels.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Not to discount the \"total weirdo\" thing.  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Listen, {player}.  
This question's a bit more on the serious side, but...  
  
**Choice: (9)**  What is it?  
`Tag 9`  
**Chieru：**  
Are you...  
  
**Chieru：**  
Are you the least manly guy in the world?  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Chieru：**  
That's not quite right. Did I mess up my choice of words...?  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Well, whatever.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Point is, it's a compliment!  
I kind of like those weird vibes you've got going on,  
so you stay your hopeless self for the rest of your life!  
  
**Chieru：**  
Well then! Good luck with your deliveries!  
  
**Narration：**  
After delivering a mad rush of badly chosen words,  
Chieru dashed away with a spring in her step.  
  
**Chieru：**  
...Oh.  
  
**Chieru：**  
Silly me! ☆  
I forgot all about the Miiko thing, didn't I?  
 Teehee-cheru! ☆
