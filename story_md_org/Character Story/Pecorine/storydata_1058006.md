## Subtitle: Viva Bureaucracy!
  
**Pecorine：**  
There you are, {player}!  
Heyas! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Everything going all right?  
I'm sorry I made you come  
all the way out here!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh... Isn't today's sunny weather amazing?  
It might even be a bit *too* warm,  
but that just makes this ice cream taste extra delicious! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Check it out!  
I couldn't choose just one flavor,  
so I asked for a cone with all of them!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I've got every single flavor right here!  
It's such a colorful sight,  
I could stare at it all day!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Though it is a tiny bit awkward  
that the stack of scoops ended up taller than I am!  
How crazy is that?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhhh, I can't see where I'm going!  
That *is* you, right, {player}?  
Say something so I can tell!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's good to see you, Peco.  
**Choice: (2)**  Are you trying to destroy your stomach?  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
You got it!  
It's always a pleasure!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You've been calling me \"Peco\" a lot lately,  
haven't you?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I love the way it makes us sound like besties!  
Hey, how about I try shortening your name, too?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha...  
Don't worry, I've had intensive training!  
Stomach training!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Even if all of Landosol is blown to smithereens,  
nothing will lay a scratch on my stomach of steel! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Sure, eating this much ice cream  
might make my insides feel a bit chilly...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But my stomach burns the calories for heat in a flash,  
so my body temperature is safe from harm! ☆  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Oopsie-daisy...  
H-hang on a moment...  
If I get too distracted by talking, this ice cream's going to topple over!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It would be a tragedy  
for all these flavors to go splat on the street!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll gobble them up nice and quick!  
*munch munch munch*  
Mmmm! So gooooood! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Aahhhhh!  
All that frozen goodness in my mouth at once  
gave me the king of all brain freezes! Owieee!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh, but it was so worth it!  
Whoever invented ice cream is the greatest genius who ever lived!  
The savior of all humanity!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Uh-oh, I think my lips are all covered in cream...  
Let me just wipe myself off with a handkerchief.  
Eheheh... What kind of lady am I?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Anyway!  
We didn't just come here to eat ice cream, did we?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Today's the day all our efforts pay off!  
We're going to submit the paperwork to start a new guild!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
You were such a lifesaver with the preparations.  
Helping me come up with a name and everything!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's fun to work on a big project together with friends!  
Don't you think?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
To be totally honest,  
that's one of the reasons  
I wanted to start a guild to begin with.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I've been living a wandering life,  
traveling around from one town to the next,  
but everyone needs a place to come home to, right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Sadly, the startup costs for this guild  
took up almost all the money I'd saved up for my journey...  
But I can always just earn that money again!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Anyway... I'm sure it won't be a problem really,  
but if anyone from the government spots me,  
things could get a bit complicated.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's why I'd like you  
to submit these documents for me, {player}.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I know you've lost most of your memories,  
and complicated stuff isn't your strong point right now...  
So your job is just to hand these papers to the person at the desk!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll come inside the building with you  
and watch how things go from a distance,  
keeping my face hidden.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So if you find you have any problems,  
just give me a sign!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's the long and short of the plan!  
Sound good to you?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
All right then, let's go!  
  
**Clerk：**  
Thank you.  
These papers all seem to be in order.  
  
**Clerk：**  
We'll check over all the details,  
and send notice of whether your application was successful  
within the next few weeks.  
  
**Clerk：**  
The notification will be sent by mail,  
so please provide a contact address for your guild's representative.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Keep it up, {player}!  
You're doing great!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...What's this?  
I think {player} is looking this way  
with a bit of a troubled expression!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What could be wrong?  
I think he's trying to mouth something...  
Let me see...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"I... love... you... with... all... my... heart!\" Is that right?  
Oh, {player}, you little charmer, you!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You know I love you too, {player}!  
Almost as much as grilled meat!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmmm...?  
Maybe that's not what he's saying.  
Looks like... something about an address?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, dear! I should have thought about that, shouldn't I?  
He said he's just been staying at cheap hotels,  
and I don't have a fixed address either...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmmmm...  
Maybe if I ask at the restaurant I've been working at,  
they'd be able to receive the results for me?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll just jot down their address on a scrap of paper  
and subtly hand it to {player}...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hey, {player}!  
Tell them to use this address!  
  
**Clerk：**  
Hmm?  
That face...  
Could it be...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh!  
Um, look,  
you've got the wrong person!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I-I-I-  
I'm definitely not called Eustiana or anything!  
I'm just the perpetually peckish Pecorine, see? ☆  
  
**Clerk：**  
Ah! That's right, I knew it!  
You're that wanted criminal...!  
Help, security! Capture this woman!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I-I-I-I'm so sorry!  
I think I'd better make a run for it,  
{player}!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let's meet up later, and I'll treat you to dinner!  
I'll be waiting at the usual time,  
at the meeting place we always use!  
  
**Clerk：**  
Hold it!  
Don't you dare run,  
you treasonous royal impersonator!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You've got it all wrong, totally wrong!  
I'm not the impostor, it's her that...  
Oh, I don't know how to explain!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Waaaahhhh!  
Why does nobody ever believe meeeee?!
