**Narration：**  
The morning after their first night training together,  
Pecorine and {player} are preparing breakfast.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh no! I completely forgot to buy any!  
This is a real pickle. What to do, what to do...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hm? What did I forget to buy, you ask?  
Seaweed, of course! Nori seaweed!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's full of vitamins, super compact,  
and it's a must for stopping rice balls sticking to your hands!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I never usually leave the house without it... Urgh. I messed up.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'll go buy some.  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
N-no, no! If you're going, I should go too!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm... But I came all this way to get away from Landosol.  
Wouldn't heading back now defeat the whole purpose?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Urgh... All right, then.  
Can I take you up on that offer, please, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You can count on me.  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Thank you...  
 I really appreciate it.  
I'll just do a bit more training  
 while I wait for you here, then!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Is {player} still not back?  
He's been gone for an awful long while now...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm starting to get worried.  
I guess I could venture a little closer to the city!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I came all the way to the main road,  
but I still haven't seen any sign of {player}...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I hope he hasn't gotten totally lost or anything...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? That figure over there, is that...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh!  
 It *is* you, {player}!  
Thank goodness. You took so long, I was worried sick!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? You got held up making some food you thought I'd like?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, so that's why!  
Well, thank you for going to the trouble!  
Eheheh... That makes me so happy!  
  
**???：**  
Aaaaaagghhhhhh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm?  
 That sounded like...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Knight：**  
Ngh... Milady, save yourself!  
  
**Young Noble：**  
Ahhh...!  
I-I can't! We're surrounded on both sides!  
  
**Monsters：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Knight：**  
Milady! Look out!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll rescue you! Hiyaahhh!☆  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Knight：**  
I-incredible! With a single attack?!  
I don't know who you are, but thank you for your assistance!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We can talk afterwards!  
First, let's take care of these guys... Hoiyahhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*pant* *pant*... This is honestly pretty tiring.  
I'm getting so hungry, my Royal Equipment's growing weaker!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUOOOGHHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This looks bad. There's no end to these monsters...!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ah—not good!  
One of them snuck around behind me!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'll protect you, Peco!  
`Tag 5`  
**Pecorine：**  
{player}?!  
It's too dangerous! Please, get yourself to safety!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh...! He got sent flying...!  
Even if it's to help me, he's pushing himself too hard!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If only I had something to eat right now...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? You've got just the thing?  
B-but this is...!  
  

---  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A shrimp tempura rice ball!  
Did you make this for me?!  
That's my Ricebowl Prince!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's even wrapped in the nori I asked you to get!  
Ahh, so easy to eat! It's full of loving care!  
All right, I'll dig right in! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*nom nom nom*...  
*nom nom nom nom* ♪  
I-it's so goooood!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The sticky rice! The tasty nori!  
And the juicy shrimp! It's all just perfect! How crazy is that?! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Mmmm...! And this sensation coming over me...  
You're lending me your power!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But this power feels different from usual!  
Like it's gushing forth from within, stronger than ever before?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Thank you for this, {player}!  
With your food and your strength,  
 I'm reaching a whole new level!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm going all out! Hiyaahhh! ☆  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm not done yet! I can take every last one of you!  
Heave-ho! ☆  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  

---  
  
**Knight：**  
Wh-what incomparable strength...  
This girl—no, this pair... Who are they?  
I feel like I recognize the girl's face somehow...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's a wrap! I've taken care of all the monsters!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
{player}, you're not hurt too badly, are you?  
Let me see...  
 Oh, it's just a few little bruises. Thank goodness...  
  
**Young Noble：**  
Um...  
Thank you so much for saving us when we needed it most.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No, no, it's nothing, really...  
 Oh?!  
Y-you're...  
  
**Young Noble：**  
Ummm... Is something the matter?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I've spoken to her a few times at royal banquets...  
But I suppose she wouldn't remember me, would she?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm sure her memories will have been adjusted...  
  
**Knight：**  
M-milady! Step away from her at once!  
  
**Knight：**  
This girl is a wanted criminal!  
I knew that face looked familiar from somewhere!  
  
**Young Noble：**  
A criminal?  
But she was kind enough to rescue us just now,  
and she really doesn't seem dangerous...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Even outside of Landosol, a bounty is still a bounty...  
I should have known I couldn't escape that.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No, this is no time to stand around feeling shocked!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let's run for it!  
{player}, follow me!  
  
**Young Noble：**  
Ah...! Wait a moment!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
{player}...  
That girl's someone I used to know. She's awfully kind...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But it looks like she's forgotten all about me right now.  
Ahaha... Whyever could that be?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? Is someone calling from behind us?  
  
**Young Noble：**  
Thank you for helping us!  
Good day to you both!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ah... That's her voice...  
Is she... thanking us?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Even without their memories of me,  
I guess people don't change. Not deep down...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I don't think that knight's following us.  
Maybe his mistress asked him to stay!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, yes—{player}!  
I still didn't thank you properly.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Thank you so much for protecting me back there.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Um, {player}...  
I think I'd like to go on this journey alone after all.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I really do enjoy spending all this time together,  
but sticking with me will just get you into trouble.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I don't care.  
**Choice: (8)**  Let's stay together.  
`Tag 7`  
**Pecorine：**  
O-oh, {player}.  
Please don't say such childish things!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
When you say it like that, I...  
I get so happy, my head starts to spin like crazy...  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Pecorine：**  
Whoa... You don't mince words!  
You're so manly sometimes, {player}!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No... I shouldn't try to laugh it off.  
Um, listen...  
 Thank you so much.  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Pecorine：**  
Say, {player}...  
Why do you still try to stick with me  
even when you can see it's dangerous?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? ...I looked like I was about to cry?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
O-of course I wouldn't do anything like that!  
What would I start crying for?!  
I'm the happy old perpetually peckish Pecorine, remember?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...I just figured it out.  
Why I felt such incredible power back there.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It seems that...  
I trust {player} from the bottom of my heart...  
and I was reaching out to him.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Just like the girl we met back there and her knight,  
I wanted so badly for him to protect me...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Oh boy.  
I'm just no match for you, am I, {player}?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
All right, then!  
I guess I'll allow you to accompany me for a little longer! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let's train together, eat all sorts of delicious meals,  
and become as strong as we possibly can!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And one day, when you finally get stronger than me...  
I hope you'll protect me as my personal knight!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm counting on you, OK? My future knight! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wait... Ahhh?! You're already my Ricebowl Prince!  
Prince or knight... Which do I want you to be?!  
  
**Narration：**  
Having discovered a whole new side  
to her own feelings for {player},  
Pecorine was filled with a deep sense of satisfaction.
