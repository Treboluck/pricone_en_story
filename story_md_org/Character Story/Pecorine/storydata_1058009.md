## Subtitle: A Date with Departure
  
**Narration：**  
Now that she is being pursued by the authorities in Landosol,  
Pecorine begins making plans to hide out elsewhere.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If I stay here in Landosol, they'll catch me eventually...  
I guess first of all, I need to get away from the city.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Which means I'll be needing supplies.  
No time like the present! I'll head to the shops right away!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Okay... First up, medicine and bandages.  
Where would I find those...?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hi there.  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? {player},  
 heyas! ☆  
What a funny coincidence, running into you here!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? You just finished up a part-time work shift at this shop?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You're such a hard worker, {player}.  
 Good boy! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Listen, I'm actually looking for medicine and bandages.  
Do you know where I'd find them?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Wait, wha—?! C-could this be...?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The legendary salt said to make even the stinkiest dishes delicious  
with a single sprinkle?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's supposed to be incredibly rare on this continent...  
I can't believe I ran into it today!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh! And these mushrooms here  
are the perfect accompaniment for all kinds of monster cuisine!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
They make a great base for soup, too,  
with a deep-bodied flavor that's absolutely to die for!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhh, why did today have to be the day  
all the ingredients of my dreams are on sale?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But I can't... Urgh...I have to prioritize the camping supplies I came for.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, but wait...!  
I-if I won't be in Landosol for quite a while,  
I should seize this opportunity!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh! ♪ These won't take up too much space,  
and I'm sure I'll use them up quickly...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huhhh?! Is that a rare and delectable dried Gellatina?!  
And next to it, the ultimate barbecue sauce  
from Landosol's finest eatery?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What am I gonna do?!  
At this rate, I'll end up with more than I can possibly carry!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And yet, as the leader of the Gourmet Guild, devotees of tasty food,  
how can I return these to the shelf...?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Um, Peco?  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, I'm sorry, {player}.  
I got so distracted by these amazing products!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Are you going on a camping trip?  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh?  
O-ohhh...! Did I say something like that just now?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
When did I let that happen?  
Urgh... The tasty food made me totally drop my guard.  
I'm so stupid!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But I guess this means  
{player} was paying attention to every word I said...  
That's kind of... how do I put it...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It feels... pretty nice!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Truth is, I'm planning to go on a sort of training journey.  
That's why I came here to stock up on supplies.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Of course, I'm totally used to this kind of thing!  
Don't you worry about me!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I'll go and train too.  
**Choice: (8)**  I'll be your bodyguard.  
`Tag 7`  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? You want to train with me?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Travelling together does sound pretty fun...  
But it's not like I'm doing this for pleasure...  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Pecorine：**  
Y-you want to protect me?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I mean, you're a reliable guy,  
so it *would* be great to have you along...  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Pecorine：**  
No... I really can't.  
It would be wrong for me to put you in danger like that!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
There are monsters and bandits out there,  
and if anything were to happen to you...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? It's dangerous for me too?  
Well, yes, I suppose, but...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhh, how can he even be so kind?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Worrying about me like this when I'm just a forgotten princess...  
It's enough to bring tears to my eyes.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
When he looks at me with such determination,  
how can I turn him down?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
All right, then. Let's go together!  
But promise me you won't do anything risky, OK?  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Got it.  
`Tag 10`  
**Pecorine：**  
Heheh! It's a promise!  
Well then, I guess we're buying food for two!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? It's not just food we need?  
Well, of course I know that!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But you can't fight on an empty stomach, now, can you?  
Food's always the first priority for staying alive!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whew, we sure bought a ton!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I can't wait to cook it all! How crazy is that?! ☆  
You'd better believe I'll turn it into a feast!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wait, am I enjoying this a bit too much?  
Now that {player}'s coming, I'm getting carried away...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hm... Maybe the thought of this trip  
was making me feel more lonely than I realized.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Not being able to eat meals with the Gourmet Guild...  
Even having to leave {player} behind...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wahhh?! Why are you suddenly leaning in so close?!  
Huh? I had a weird look on my face?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahahah.  
 I must've been off in my own little world  
thinking about how to use these ingredients!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Umm... {player}. Thank you a whole bunch.  
For saying you'll come along with me.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Thanks to you,  
my heart feels as satisfied as a stomach bursting with rice!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm really looking forward  
 to hitting the road together!  
  
**Narration：**  
And the happiness on Pecorine's beaming face was beyond doubt.
