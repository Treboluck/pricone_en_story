For our very first day, we sure went at it! ♪  
Let's rest up so we're ready for another hard day's work!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? {player}, did you just start glowing?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Actually, I feel like I've seen this light before... Waaahhh?!

**Pecorine：**  
Hmmm... My mimi's totally broken again.  
Where in the world am I?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, I know!  
{player} gave me his number before.  
Maybe he can help me out!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll try giving him a call!  
 Beep, boop, bomp~! ♪

Right now, I'm in very big trouble!  
Can you come and help me quick?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? You don't know where I'm at?  
Actually, that is my problem as well...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I am very lost!  
What should I do, {player}?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You will find me, so stay calm?  
O-okay!  
 Thank you very much!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Umm... First I should look for landmarks nearby?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmmm...  
Oh, I see two smoke chimneys in front!  
And, um...  
 There is a park very near me!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? You think you get the idea?  
Tell me, where should I wait, then?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The park?  
 Yes, I understand! I'll be waiting for you!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh—{player}! Heyas! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
How did you find me so quick when every building looks the same?!  
Thank you very much for helping!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
To start, we need to fix my mimi,  
 so I need a repair place...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh! Now my tummy is growling loud...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
 Maybe I should eat food too!  
Can we go and eat together while my mimi is fixing?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*munch munch* *nom nom*...  
Mmm, very yummy!  
 How crazy is that?! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Food from Japan is all delicious!  
Whew, my tummy is full now! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Today, I should be at a big party,  
but I never have fun at those...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So I sort of ran away  
 while my parents were not looking!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I know I am a princess, but more than big events,  
I like just going out for meals with friends like this.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Um,  
 thank you again for coming all the way to find me today.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If I ever get in trouble again,  
 can I still ask you to help...?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Of course.  
`Tag 4`  
**Pecorine：**  
Are you sure? That makes me happy!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I would like to give you the title of a knight from my country!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If we meet and you help me another time again...  
Can I hold a knighting ceremony for you?!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Can't we meet when you're not in trouble?  
`Tag 5`  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? I-I didn't mean like that!  
I want to spend lots of time with you anyway!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So, um... If I call when I don't have problems,  
will you still come to find me?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? You want to go out for a meal like this again?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, {player}...  
I can see you think of me like a real friend, don't you?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes!  
 Let's meet and eat food together another time!  
It's a promise! ♪

**Reporter：**  
Here's another question for Princess Eustiana.  
Do you have any special memories from your time in Japan?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Yes. One of my fondest memories is the time  
I was able to meet a friend from Legend of Astrum in real life.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Even outside the game, this friend was a huge help to me.  
I'm honestly so grateful.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"It made me appreciate more than ever  how Legend of Astrum  
is able to bring people together and create real personal connections.  
I'm so proud of what we've been able to achieve.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"And also...  
Hee hee. It helped me find a very special young man.\"  
  
**Reporter：**  
Huh? ...Huh?! A young man?!  
  
**Reporter：**  
Y-Your Highness! What kind of young man do you mean?!  
Is this the same friend from Astrum you just mentioned?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Hee hee...  
 What do you think?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Let's just say I'm hoping...  
to make him my personal knight someday.\"  
  
![105801102.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/105801102.webp)  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Eheheh... Let's meet up again, {player}! ☆\"  
  
**Reporter：**  
N-no waaay!  
What a romantic confession!  
  
**Reporter：**  
We have to find out who this {player} is!  
Ahhh... The princess's favored knight... Whatever could he be like?!

**Ameth：**  
Ahahaha!  
Pecorine is such a perfect tease sometimes! ♪  
  
**Ameth：**  
Are you trying to become a Princess Knight in real life, too?  
What an entertaining turn of events! Haha.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That Pecorine may be much stronger than you here in Astrum...  
But being strong doesn't mean you're immune to weakness.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So listen up.  
Make sure you never let go of that desire to protect her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
After all, you are her knight.  
The kind and valiant knight responsible for protecting her smile.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, that's it from me.  
I'll see you some other time.

**Pecorine：**  
Mmnhh...  
 Ah!  
Th-that was a dream, wasn't it...? Though it felt surprisingly real...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
{player}...?  
Looks like you're still asleep.  
 Heheh, aren't you the cutest! ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Why do I feel like I said some kind of  
super daring things in that dream...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I feel a bit... embarrassed.  
Almost as if my secret desire to be near you  
has spilled out into the open or something...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Even so. I really am glad to have you right here beside me.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Just knowing that you're here  
gives me ever so much courage...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Is it OK if I hope just a little?  
For a future where you're here to protect me...  
  
**Narration：**  
Murmuring those words under her breath,  
Pecorine placed her hands softly around {player}'s.
