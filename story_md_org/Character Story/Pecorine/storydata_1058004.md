# Pecorine Episode 4
One day, {player} finds himself somehow unable to understand Pecorine. What's more, when he meets her in one of Ameth's dreams, it seems that Pecorine is a visitor from another country, and they can't communicate without a translator. Thankfully, when he wakes up, they're able to talk normally again.

**Pecorine：**  
\"Ooh, {player}!  
Heyas! ☆\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"It's rare for us to run into each other at lunchtime, huh?  
Were you heading for a bite to eat?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"I'm feeling pretty peckish myself,  
so why don't we go together?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Eheheh...  
I found another super tasty restaurant the other day!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"They've got a bit of a rivalry with the restaurant  
where I've been doing my waitressing work.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"So the manager asked me to go scope out their menu,  
and I totally fell in love at the first mouthful!  
How crazy is that?! ☆\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Ever since then,  
I've been going there every day!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"I'm such a bad girl...  
A traitor to my own employers...!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"But what can I do?!  
It really is delicious!  
Their sushi bowl especially is to die for...! ☆\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"...\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"...I hate to ask this, but...  
Could it be that you've...\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"...forgotten who I am?  
...Just like everyone else?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Hmmm?  
Hmmmm...  
I guess it looks like you do still recognize me.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"But then why are you ignoring me?  
My voice is on the loud side if anything,  
so I don't think you could have failed to hear me...\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Huh? You can't understand a word I'm saying?  
You can't even tell what language I'm speaking?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Ohhh...  
 I get it now. I'm so sorry!  
This has happened to me a few times before!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Like, I'm just talking like I normally do,  
but for some reason nobody can tell what I'm saying!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Up until I met you guys,  
I'd barely talked to anyone for a while, so I'd almost forgotten!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Don't worry, if we wait a little while,  
the problem usually seems to fix itself naturally...  
...But I guess you can't understand that either. Hmmmm...\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Wahhh?!  
{player}, did you just start glowing?!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Wh-wh-wh-what is all this?!  
Don't tell me this is somehow my fault too?!\"

**???：**  
H-Hel...lo.  
  
**???：**  
Excuse... me.  
Could you... lend me, \"mimi\"?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh...  
No! Not \"mimi\" like ears.  
I mean \"mimi.\" You know?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes! Mobile device mimi!  
How crazy that?! ☆  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Lend her your mimi.  
**Choice: (2)**  Attempt to speak English.  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Thank you!  
You don't mind, I use your mimi, short time?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I beg please!  
Right now, I big trouble!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ummm...  
Those words, English, right...?  
I very sorry... Your pronouncing, hard to understand.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
English, not my first language either.  
I not very good. Sorry...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Um...  
Your mimi, translate function. Can I use please?  
That what I try to ask,  
 how crazy that?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
\"...There. Perfect!  
Thank you ever so much!  
Whew... The kindness of strangers is a beautiful thing!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"I don't know what I would have done without this mimi!  
My mimi suddenly froze up and stopped working, you see.  
I was in a real bind!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Yes...  
As you can tell,  
I need its translation function to communicate here...\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"I am trying to learn Japanese for myself, too!  
But it's tough when the grammar's so different  
from my native language!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Ahaha...  
My homeland isn't quite as advanced as Japan  
when it comes to digital devices...\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"So our mimis can be kind of buggy sometimes!  
It's a bit of a pain!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"But my father insists  
I should stick to our home-grown tech,  
so I can't just switch over.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"To be honest...  
I'd much rather use the latest Japanese models,  
at least while I'm staying here in this country...\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"But he already gave in to my pleas to bring me along on this trip,  
so I can't be too selfish!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"...Oh...  
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to tell you my whole life story!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"I'm probably boring you to death, aren't I?  
I can be too talkative sometimes!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"People in this country tend to be kind of shy,  
so I think they find my personality overwhelming!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Ehm, let's see...  
 Do you know if there's  
any stores nearby where I could get my mimi repaired?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Not being able to communicate creates all sorts of problems,  
so I'd like to get it fixed up soon!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Oh? You'll show me to the nearest place?  
Wow, how crazy is that?! ☆\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"That's another thing about this country!  
Everyone's so helpful to strangers!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Thank you so much!  
I won't forget this! In fact, you've got to let me repay you!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Is it okay if I ask your name?  
I'll drop by sometime to thank you properly!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Oh, but I should introduce myself first, shouldn't I?  
My name is Eu...  
 Ahhh, wait... I should avoid my real name...\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"I guess this visit did get covered in the media...  
So some people might recognize it...\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"I wouldn't want to cause too much of a fuss...  
Ahhh, but it would be rude not to introduce myself...\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Huh? \"Pecorine\"...?  
Is that... a nickname for me?  
Wh-where the heck did you pull *that* one out from?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Actually, though, I like it!  
This might be the first time  
anyone's ever given me a nickname!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Eheh...  
Well then, how about your name?  
Huh? Your name's {player}?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Could you possibly be...  
the same {player} I met the other day in Astrum?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"I knew it!  
You're that guy who was so nice to me in the game!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"It's me! You know!  
I don't suppose you remember, do you?  
I never did get the chance to tell you my name...\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"We barely had any time to chat  
before something came up and I had to log out in a hurry.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Eheheh...  
But you really were so helpful,  
showing the ropes to a total newbie like me.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"I don't know what I would've done without you!  
It made me really happy!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Ahah...  
I guess you're just as helpful  
in the game as you are in real life!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Oh,  
do you remember me now?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"That's right, that was me!  
Even though I'd barely played the game before,  
I was wearing that crazy armor, right?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"I was given those items as a sort of gift,  
but they were so tricky to use properly!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"And when everyone else works so hard to craft rare items,  
just getting them for free like that...\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"It felt a bit too much like cheating, you know?  
Like, it's unfair to the other players.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"...Oh?  
Is that the store where I can get my mimi fixed?  
Thanks for bringing me all this way!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Once the repairs are finished,  
I'd like to treat you to a nice meal somewhere as thanks!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Eheheh...  
If you don't mind, that is!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"It would be a shame to waste such a miraculous reunion,  
so I'd love it if the two of us could be good friends!\"  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ahhhhh...!  
So close! She was this close to saying it!  
But I guess Pecorine's real name remains a mystery for now...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Honestly, though!  
Why do you all love using that nickname so much?  
It makes it ten times harder to ask her actual name!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Something about her makes me curious...  
Though I suppose it doesn't really matter.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Since she never uses anything but that nickname,  
I'm sure she must have some reason to hide her identity...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Though to be fair,  
it's not like \"Ameth\" is my real name, either.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ah, well...  
Sorry about that. I guess I was half talking to myself.  
You're probably pretty confused, so let me explain the basics.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just experienced  
was something similar to a dream.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You could call it a sort of memory integration protocol,  
or a kind of tuning-up...  
Well, call it what you like, it doesn't really matter.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Your issue right now  
is that little communication problem  
you were having with Pecorine, right?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm pretty sure there's something out of the ordinary about her...  
She seems to be causing little bugs here and there.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I wouldn't even be surprised if that was tied in  
with the reason she's always so hungry.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, anyway, don't worry.  
I'll have a look into patching up the translation issue,  
so you should be able to talk normally again soon enough.  
  
**Ameth：**  
However...  
I can't do that while I'm showing you dreams,  
so it's time for you to wake up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Of course, I'm sure you'll stumble into  
more of these dreams sooner or later...  
So maybe when you do, I'll explain a bit more.  
  

---  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Mm... Ahh...?  
There's a funny feeling in my throat...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahh~! Ahhhh~!  
Hmm... Am I coming down with a cold?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Oh!  
You're awake now, huh, {player}?  
I think you fell asleep while standing up!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, what's this?  
You can understand what I'm saying again?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Thank goodness!  
It's a little lonely not to be able to talk to anyone.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What do you think that was all about, though?  
You suddenly falling asleep was weird, too...  
I feel like there's too many mysterious things going on lately!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, I just hope we can solve them one by one!  
If only to give the people of this land an easier life!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Uh-huh!  
But for the moment,  
I think getting some nutrition comes first!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Umm...  
{player}...  
Would you like to join me for lunch?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I invited you once already,  
but I don't think you understood me then...  
So let's start over and do this properly!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's an OK, then?!  
Wahey!  
You're always such a nice guy!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Then let's get going! We should go right away!  
It's a pretty famous restaurant, so we've got to beat the rush!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If I can possibly help it,  
I'd rather we don't have to wait to fill our bellies!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well then, let's move! Eheheh!  
Another day, another lovely meal to share together!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You know...  
When you eat a good meal,  
all your other worries just seem to melt away, don't you think?
