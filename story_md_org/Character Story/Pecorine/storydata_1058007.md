## Subtitle: An Unforgettable Flavor
  
**Pecorine：**  
{player}!  
C'mon, over here!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Have you seen this buffet?  
The cakes are all-you-can-eat!  
Ahhh... All-you-can-eat... It's music to my ears!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Of course, eating *too* much might get me blacklisted,  
so I've been trying to keep to a sensible pace!  
I have at least heard of the concept of restraint, you know?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So, {player},  
what kind of cakes did you go for?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh! Now those are some adventurous picks!  
How crazy is that?! ☆  
Would you mind if I tried one bite of each?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Go right ahead!  
**Choice: (2)**  I've seen how big your \"one bite\" can be...  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
Yaaaaay!  
{player}, you're such a nice guy!  
Can I fall in love with you?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Is that another \"go right ahead\"?  
Ahaha!  
You could at least try to act a little embarrassed!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
Aw, c'monnn!  
I'll leave at least enough for you to have a bite too!  
Restraint is my middle name!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Just a little taste! Just one mouthful!  
A nibble is all I ask!  
You know you want to share! Right? Right?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
Anyway!  
It's finally become a reality, huh?!  
Our very own guild... the Gourmet Guild!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Now even guild-only restaurants are open to us!  
It's a fabulous new world!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I really couldn't have managed any of it  
without your help, {player}.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I mean, even with your help,  
I managed to almost get arrested!  
I'm so sorry for all the trouble back there!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Just so you know,  
I made sure to include your name on the guild roster...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So if you ever get the urge to take part  
in any guild-only events or anything,  
feel free to take advantage of it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The guild system is a big part of life here in Landosol,  
so things can be inconvenient if you're not registered with one.  
You often only get limited service, even at public facilities.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, but don't worry about the operating costs,  
I'll take care of all of that!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I might have to take on a few more waitressing shifts, haha!  
Who knows when I'll be able  
to set back out on my training journey?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Anyway...  
With so many people here in Landosol,  
there are plenty of big guilds doing serious business...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But there's also plenty of smaller guilds  
that are more like friendly little clubs.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The Gourmet Guild is definitely the latter type,  
so I'm not about to tie you down or anything!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If you find it's a bother, you can always quit whenever,  
so let's keep things nice and casual!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
By the way,  
for our guild's objective, I listed \"food tasting.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
'Cause you know,  
we always seem to go out to eat together!  
So our usual routine is now our guild activity too!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm planning to explain all the details  
when we meet up with Kokkoro and Karyl this evening.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But you, {player}...  
You've been a special help to me this whole time,  
so I wanted to see you first, and treat you to cake!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's why I invited you  
out here today!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh... You know, while we were setting up the guild,  
I kind of enjoyed being able to see you all the time,  
even outside of our dinners together.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But now that we've got everything settled,  
I guess that's one good thing that'll have to come to an end.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't forget though,  
I'm basically free whenever!  
So let's keep having little dates sometimes, {player}!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm?  
Was I the only one  
who thought of these as dates?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We always seem to end up going to restaurants I want to visit, though...  
If there's anywhere you want to go, {player},  
make sure to let me know, OK?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'll be happy to accompany you anywhere!  
Even if it's just an alliance of convenience,  
we are fellow guild members now!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And a guild is like family!  
You don't mind if I think that, do you?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheh...  
It's such a precious thing  
to be able to bond with other people.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
To have somewhere to come home to.  
People you can share meals with,  
sitting around the same table like family.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
{player}...  
The truth is, I...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...No, maybe I shouldn't tell you just yet.  
I've already caused you so much trouble,  
I wouldn't want to get you mixed up in my problems.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Just being able to eat sweet treats together like this  
is already the happiest thing in the world!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It would be selfish of me  
to ask any more of you than that!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Anyway,  
my silly little problems aside...  
{player}, how are your memories coming along?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I feel like you're more independent lately  
than you were back when we first met.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmm, I see.  
You still haven't remembered any of the important stuff, huh?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha...  
Well, I suppose there's no use trying to hurry...  
But it must frustrating.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Being forgotten by other people is a sad thing,  
but forgetting things yourself has to be hard too.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If there's really someone out there  
who's toying with people's memories like that...  
I don't think that's a crime that can be easily forgiven.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Why the heck  
would they do such a horrible thing?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Ah, forget I said that.  
I shouldn't go around deciding people are evil  
when I don't even know them.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We should eat these sweet treats,  
and take our minds off all that stuff!  
A little sugar, and you can't help but smile!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
*munch munch*  
Mmmmmm!  
That's the stuff of dreams right there! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You know, {player},  
if your old memories come back...  
You might forget the taste of these cakes, right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
All the days we've spent together...  
They might be washed away by your old self.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But even if that happens,  
I can always meet you again...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And we'll have plenty of time  
to make happy memories to make up for what we've lost.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let's become friends again,  
and eat lots of cakes together!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We'll reforge our precious bonds  
no matter how many times it takes.  
Okay, {player}?
