**Narration：**  
While visiting the local shopping district,  
{player} hears a familiar-sounding animated voice.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Nyahah! The pickings are rich today!  
Ain't nuthin' feels better than this!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Just the sight of my favorite stories and spellbooks...  
Ooh, it gets my heart a-pounding!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Oh, I'll take three copies!  
Make out the bill to \"Twilight Caravan\"!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
One to read, one to keep, and one to spread the good word!  
That's the otaku way!  
 Now then, which shop is up next~?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hi there.  
`Tag 1`  
**Nanaka：**  
Hm? Whoa! If it isn't Private {player}!  
Fancy seeing you here!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  What're you up to?  
**Choice: (3)**  Are you shopping?  
`Tag 2`  
**Nanaka：**  
Ohohoh!  
I'm ever so glad you asked!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
This fine day, I'm doing my rounds of the district,  
checking out the hottest new goods!

`Tag 3`  
**Nanaka：**  
This is no mere shopping trip!  
I'm doing my rounds of the whole district!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Nanaka：**  
Y'see, I love collecting merch for all my favorite stories...  
So I check all the stores on the regular!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Magical girls are the best of all!  
I want to become a magical girl right out of a manga!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
The magical girls in manga live normal lives most of the time,  
but when the world needs them, they go all out and fight!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
They're strong *and* they're cute as a button to boot!  
Whewww! Isn't that just the greatest?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
So my goal  
 is to be just like them!  
A magical girl who looks cute while defending justice!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ahh! Don't tell me...  
You're actually a fan of magical girls yourself?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I mean, usually when I start talking about this stuff,  
people tune out in seconds, but you're actually listening!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
So I thought you might be a fan...  
Right? Amirite?! C'mon, spill all the beans!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
No, you don't even need to say a word to ol' Nanaka!  
You're a magical girl lover for certs! Because I said so!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ooh, I knew you were special!  
Great! Starting now, you can join my team as a magical boy!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I'll find you a shiny wand and cute frilly clothes!  
Magical girl duos are a classic trope too, don'tcha know!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I know! We should have a team catchphrase, too!  
Wahah! I'm just bursting with ideas right now!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Thanks, but no thanks.  
**Choice: (6)**  I'm not sure about the frilly clothes...  
`Tag 5`  
**Nanaka：**  
Bueeeghhh?! But why?!  
Isn't this the coolest plot twist ever?!  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Nanaka：**  
What... the heck?!  
Mmm... Wouldn't it be fun, though? Thinking up costumes and stuff?  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Nanaka：**  
Well, if you're not into that, I can't force you.  
Let me know if you ever change your mind!  
  
**Woman 1：**  
She's as wild and noisy as ever, that Nanaka...  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Seriously, all that energy.  
How does she not get tired?  
  
**Woman 1：**  
I know it'd wear me out just trying to listen to her.  
I feel kinda sorry for that boy she's with.  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Must be a rare breed if he can keep up with her crazy vibe.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Th-those are some cutting comments...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Who are those girls?  
`Tag 8`  
**Nanaka：**  
Oh, well. They're my long-time classmates.  
When we were kids, we used to play at being magical girls together...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Where did they lose their way? They're missing out in life!  
'Course, I'm used to that attitude by now.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Kapow! Enemy attacked Nanaka, but it failed!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
...Wh-why are you looking at me like that?  
I'm telling you, I can take it like a boss!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  I'll become a magical girl after all.  
`Tag 9`  
**Nanaka：**  
Uweh?! F-for real?!  
Why the sudden 180?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Nobody can make fun of us if we're together?  
Whoaaa!  
 Wait, I just said I'm immune to that!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
But, but, but...!  
 Whatever the reason, this is totally hype!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
So, can you use magic?!  
If you're gonna be a magical girl, we gotta get the basics down!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
What's that? You can't cast spells yourself,  
but you can power up other girls' magic?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
That sounds less like a mage  
and more like a cute mascot who supports the heroes!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Woohoo! That's the most classic magical girl trope!  
I'm getting pumped—  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Aaaahh!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Stop, thief! That's my bag!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Oho?! A thief, you say?  
It sounds like an incident is afoot!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
All right! Nanaka, magical girl of justice,  
will catch that thief in no time!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hold it right there!  
Give back what you stole!  
  
**Thief：**  
The hell are you?! Quit chasing after me!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I'm afraid I can't do that!  
As a magical girl, I cannot give in to evil!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
You'll be defeated at the hands  
of Nanaka, the greatest mage in all Astrum!  
  
**Thief：**  
Wh-what's this girl's problem?!  
  
**Thief：**  
Well, *I* can't afford to get caught!  
Let's see how you like this!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Whoa, careful there!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Can it be... you're a mage as well?!  
Ooh, what a crazy twist!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
A magical girl faces an evil warlock...  
Is this fiction or reality?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
The sheer magical-girl-iness of all this  
is making my heart go doki-doki!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Time to show you what this cutie badass is really capable of!  
Hold iiiiit!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Geez, you're too stubborn!  
How long are you gonna keep running?!  
  
**Thief：**  
Sh-shaddup!  
You think I'd just let you catch me?!  
  
**Thief：**  
You and your crazy outfit...  
Get a faceful of this!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Utterly futile!  
  
**Thief：**  
Whaaa?!  
My magic just disappeared?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hohohoh... Since when were you under the impression  
your magic would work on me?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I've read more spellbooks than I can count!  
Normal spells are nothing to a true magic nerd!  
  
**Thief：**  
Dammit...!  
Then it's time for my secret weapon! Huaaaghhhh!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Wh-what's that massive spell?!  
I, uh, don't think I've seen that one before!  
  
**Thief：**  
Hah! Look down on me, will you?!  
Now you're gonna regret it!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
What now?! I wasn't expecting such a crazy spell!  
This matchup's broken!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Support Nanaka.  
`Tag 10`  
**Nanaka：**  
Oh! Of course! I forgot about your ability!  
Wooo! This feels like... a power rush!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
The energy... It's surging through me!  
With this, I think I can overpower his spell!  
  
**Thief：**  
Time to die!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Let's see how you like my...  
full power!

**Thief：**  
Wha...?!  
Sh-she's matching my spell in strength?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
A magical girl always comes out on top in the end!  
  
**Thief：**  
Damn... you...! I'm being overpow... Aaargh!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
With a cybernetic flash,  
I smite my foes!  
  
![101300202.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/101300202.webp)  
**Thief：**  
W-w-waaaghh!

`image display end`  
**Nanaka：**  
Mission... complete!  
  
**Thief：**  
Aaagh! Please spare me!  
I'm sorry for everything!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
But I refuse!  
 You can repent in a comfy cell!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
More importantly!  
 Where'd you learn that spell just now?  
That wasn't normal magic, right?  
  
**Thief：**  
F-from some strange man...  
He gave me this spellbook,  
saying it'd give me incredible power...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Wahah! I've never seen this book before!  
Gimme deets! What's it called?! Is it super rare?!  
  
**Thief：**  
I don't know any details...  
The strange man just told me it'd let even a guy like me use magic.  
  
**Thief：**  
He said with this, I'd be able to get back  
at all the people who ever made fun of me.  
  
**Thief：**  
I got carried away... Thought I was totally invincible...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hmm... I can kind of empathize with that,  
but magic is for helping people, not hurting them!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
If you use it right, to protect people in trouble,  
I'm sure you'll earn plenty of respect!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Don't you think that's a better way to teach those bullies a lesson?  
  
**Thief：**  
Y-you're right... Yeah...  
I was such an idiot! I won't do this again!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Great! Then that's the end of that!  
Although, that mystery man... Who could he be...?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I guess this calls for  
 some more investigating later!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Here, have this back.  
The thief stole this bag from you, right?  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Y-yes...  
 Thank you...  
And...  
 I'm sorry.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hmm? S-sorry for what, exactly?  
  
**Woman 1：**  
I mean, I... I've been making fun of you all this time...  
  
**Woman 2：**  
I'm sorry too.  
You were so cool catching that thief.  
I was wrong about you.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I... I don't, I mean, um, how to say...  
No need for thanks, my dearies!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I only did what any magical girl would do!  
Besides... I did get a neat spellbook out of it!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Why do I have this, you ask?  
Heheh... Before handing the thief over to Nightmare,  
I kinda convinced him to let me keep it.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I'm curious about the man who sold it.  
Who knows, he might even know about  
the legendary spellbook I'm after!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
So I think my next step should be to track him down.  
Oh,  
 you're helping too, of course!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
It's thanks to your power that I beat the thief today!  
It looks like we're cut out to work as a team!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
The wondrous story of a new magical girl duo  
begins here and now!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so {player} found himself officially designated  
as Nanaka's new magical girl partner.
