## Subtitle: The Dark Collector
  
**Narration：**  
Nanaka and {player} visit a merchant of magical goods  
in search of information about the mystery man.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hey hey, shopkeep!  
 This may be sudden, but we're looking for a guy!  
There's this mystery man handing out strange spellbooks.  
Know anything about him?  
  
**Man 1：**  
Hmm... Sorry, doesn't ring any bells.  
But listen, I've got a bunch of new stock that's right up your alley!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Say what?! Th-this is tie-in magical merch  
for that series that's getting an anime adaptation!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hm? Oh, don't you know about anime?  
It's an awesome new up-and-coming technology!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
They flip through lots of pictures in sequence  
to make it look like the characters are moving!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Then they display the results with magic!  
You get it?  
 They're bringing the 2D world to life!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
It's like a whole new heavenly world for otaku like me!  
The characters we love, walking and talking before our eyes!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Whoaaa?! Th-this is that hyper-rare magical card that was only on sale  
for a brief three days' time! And it's signed, to boot!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Guaahhh! I can't get enough!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Still, I never thought I'd see you bring a boyfriend here!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hmm? I'm not sure I heard you right just now.  
  
**Man 1：**  
Hmm? Are the two of you not a couple, then?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
...No, no, no... No way, no way, no way!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
A hardcore nerd like me? His girlfriend?!  
That's an insult to {player}!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're cute, though.  
**Choice: (2)**  You're actually beautiful.  
`Tag 1`  
**Nanaka：**  
Bwegh! D-d-d-d-d-d-did you say \"cute\"?!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Nanaka：**  
Bwegh?! B-b-b-b-beautiful?!  
U-uerghhh... My body is rejecting this alien reality...!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Nanaka：**  
D-d-d-do you have any idea what you're saying?!  
Those words are poison to little ol' Nanaka!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
S... Staying here is much too dangerous!  
I mustmake my retreat! F-fare thee well!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Ah! Hey, Nanaka, wait!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Whew...  
 H-honestly, me and him, dating?!  
Where did he get such a wild idea?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I mean, we have been doing a bunch of things together,  
but that's because he's my true comrade!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
O... objectively speaking, would those seem like dates?  
E-even my regular rounds?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Huh? Could it be that I'm living a normie life...?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
No, no! Get real! Remember who you are!  
A magical girl and hardcore otaku!  
Lover of manga! Adorer of waifus!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Yeah... I'm no normie... I could never be... In fact...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Normies should all explode!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  What's up?  
`Tag 4`  
**Nanaka：**  
I was just pulling myself together  
and plotting how best to purge this world of normies...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Wait, waaaaghh?! {player}?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
L-listen, um! I didn't run away because I felt awkward!  
Honest!  
 I'm as chipper and upbeat as always!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
M-more importantly! About that mystery man of ours!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
If normal merchants haven't heard of him...  
What do you say we try the black market?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Thanks to the guild I belong to, I have a few underworld contacts.  
And traders in illicit magic are bound to have sweet info, right?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
If we just hang around right here...  
Aha! There he is! That guy!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Well, well, Miss Collector. What brings you here today?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Yo there!  
As it happens, we've got a little question to ask you.  
  
**Man 2：**  
Hmm... Information brokering isn't really my business...  
  
**Man 2：**  
Still, I'd hate to make an enemy of your infamous guild.  
Just this once, I'll oblige.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Sounds good! Just this once is totally fine!  
 Thanks a bunch!  
So, the thing is...  
  
**Man 2：**  
Ah, I see. To be quite blunt, I do know of this man.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Wahah! Get hype!  
Deets!  
 Gimme the deets!  
  
**Man 2：**  
He wanders the continent,  
gathering all manner of spellbooks and artifacts,  
and offering them at no charge to those he deems worthy.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Whoa... Wh-why the heck would he do that?  
  
**Man 2：**  
That, I cannot say...  
However, I've had dealings with him in the past.  
  
**Man 2：**  
Those in the know tend to refer to him as the \"Dark Collector.\"  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ohhh...? If you ask me,  
handing out rare spellbooks for free is plain crazy talk.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
So... do you know any way we could meet him?  
  
**Man 2：**  
Ah, well... I was only directly in contact with the man's apprentices.  
I've never met him in person, so I don't know his location.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Oh? Is that right? That's a pity...  
Just when I thought we'd found a lead.  
  
**Man 2：**  
Rumor has it that he's searching for something.  
And gathering allies to aid him in finding it.  
  
**Man 2：**  
That's all the information I can give you.  
I'd rather not get mixed up in all this, so I'll take my leave now.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
All righty!  
 Thanks again!  
  
**Man 2：**  
One word to the wise, my dear.  
The man you seek is a mage of considerable strength.  
  
**Man 2：**  
Far stronger than you yourself, I fear.  
Curiosity often leads to tragedy... Do be careful.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ohohoh! Now this is starting to get interesting!  
That warning just sets my magical girl soul a-blazing!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Nobody ever became a hero by letting sleeping dogs lie!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
My gut tells me that the thing this man's searching for  
might be the legendary spellbook I seek!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
So first, let's find an apprentice  
 who can lead us to the master!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Bahah! I'm getting so pumped!  
You just wait, mystery man!  
You're not getting your hands on my legendary spellbook!  
  
**Narration：**  
Thanks to a turn of events that seemed straight out of one of her stories,  
Nanaka was left in higher spirits than ever.
