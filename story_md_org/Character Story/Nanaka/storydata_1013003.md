**Narration：**  
Today, Nanaka has asked {player} to meet her  
on the Esterella Road.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hey hey! There you are, my trusty mascot! Perfect timing!  
Have you learned to transform into a cute animal yet?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Aren't we doing your usual rounds today?  
`Tag 1`  
**Nanaka：**  
Doing the rounds is great,  
 but today I have other plans!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
You remember I told you I work at a second-hand shop?  
Well, occasionally we get customers looking for lost items.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
When I actually accepted one of their requests, it was such a success,  
I ended up turning it into a sort of side business.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
So that's what we're doing today.  
I called you out here to help me track down the treasure!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I haven't found any leads on our mystery man,  
so until there's progress on that front,  
I thought we could make this our team activity!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Now, let's join hands and overcome the shackles of despair!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  In the shadow of despair lies hope!  
**Choice: (3)**  Despair is your destiny, magical girl!  
`Tag 2`  
**Nanaka：**  
Ooh! That line's straight out of the manga I'm reading!  
How come you know it too?  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Nanaka：**  
Noooo! That's the villain's line from volume two!  
...Wait, why do you know the lines from the manga I'm reading?  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Nanaka：**  
You've been studying up on my favorite series, Magical Girl Celly?  
Whoaaa! Awesome! You're a god among men!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I knew you were a great partner, but you're a true comrade too!  
I am in awe of your nerd cred right now!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
We must get together and share notes!  
Ooh! I am so hyped for this!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hm? We've veered off topic?  
Bahah! Sorry about that!  
You know how I get carried away sometimes!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
All righty then, why don't we head into the woods?!  
Private {player}! Forward march!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Our client for this job...  
is looking for a pendant her husband gave her.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
She was attacked by a monster while gathering herbs in these woods.  
and lost the pendant as she fled the scene.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
She said it's an important memento,  
so I want to get it back to her without fail!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I mean, this item's full of memories, right?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
So that's like... Right!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Like losing limited merch that you lined up all day to buy  
in the blazing heat of summer!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
So I won't accept anything but a successful outcome!  
Now,  
 let's work together and recover our client's lost smile!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Hmm... This is weird.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  What's up?  
**Choice: (6)**  No pendants to be seen...  
`Tag 5`  
**Nanaka：**  
Don't you sense it? This strange atmosphere...  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Nanaka：**  
Oh, well, that's an issue too, yes,  
but there's something else bugging me...  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Nanaka：**  
These parts should be teeming with monsters,  
but we haven't run into a single one...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Could it be they all ran away  
when they realized the incredible Nanaka was here?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Bahah!  
Who'da thunk even monsters know my reputation?!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Actually, this might make it easier to search—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Yes, of course. It would never be that easy.  
The noise came from thattaway, right...?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Why do I feel like we're dealing with a big nasty?  
Let me just go and take a peek...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
...Ah. There it is.  
Ohhh boy, it sure doesn't look happy.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Maybe the lack of monsters nearby  
is that big guy's fault. He's going pretty berserk.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Did he wake up on the wrong side of the lair?  
...Wait, huh?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Is it just me... or is that monster wearing a necklace on its leg?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Ueghh... Definitely not just me.  
That's gotta be the item we're looking for...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Guess we've got no choice but to defeat it...  
Oh well! Let's get this over with!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
You're on support duty, 'kay?  
I'll take the front lines!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
And, um...  
When this battle is over, there's something I need to tell you...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Say what now?  
`Tag 8`  
**Nanaka：**  
Ahah!  
 I always wanted to try saying that line!  
Not that I really plan on dying today!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Now, Mr. Monster!  
Let's see how you match up to the great Nanaka,  
Astrum's strongest and cutest magical girl!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
With a cybernetic flash—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Whoa whoa whoa!  
 Interrupting the catchphrase is a no-no!  
Don't they teach these things in monster school?!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Not interested, eh...?  
All right! Then have a taste of the ol' Nanaka magic!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Charging straight into my attacks, huh?  
Has it really gone crazy? Get back, dummy!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Still, Granny always said that berserk enemies  
are easy pickings if you keep your cool!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I gracefully dodge the charging monster... And theeeen...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Fire off that new spell  
that I learned from the thief the other day!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
With my super-spell and your support ability combined,  
we're unbeatable!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Taaaake thiiiis!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Woohoo!  
 Check that out!  
It went down in a single blast!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Well then, let's just retrieve the necklace...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Wait! Stop stop stop! Stay back, kid!  
You shouldn't touch that necklace!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I'm sensing magical energy from inside it...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I think there must have been a spell on this necklace  
that was making that monster go crazy.  
  
**Nanaka：**  
And this sensation...  
It's similar to my new super-spell...  
No, it's not just similar. It's... the same?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
My client wouldn't cast a spell like this,  
so could it be the work of our mystery man?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
He found the pendant in the forest, enchanted it,  
and used it on that monster, maybe?  
  
**Nanaka：**  
The lingering energy in the the pendant is only faint,  
but I can feel powerful magecraft behind it...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I don't know his reasons, but I can't let him abuse his power!  
Let's track him down and teach him a lesson!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
If he were to get his hands on the legendary spellbook,  
who knows what he'd do with it...  
  
**Nanaka：**  
For the moment, this necklace goes...  
 like so!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Nasty spell, go away! Moe moe...  
 kyun! ♪  
  
**Nanaka：**  
There! That should clear up the lingering magic!  
That's our Nanaka!  
 Perfect to a fault! ♪  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Now we just need to hand this baby over to the client!  
Whew... This was a pretty tiring day!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
I need to go home and recharge with 2D content... Oh! I know!  
Next time you're free, we should go on my rounds together!  
  
**Nanaka：**  
Since you've shown an interest in my the stuff I'm into!  
I want to teach you all the tricks of the trade!  
  
**Narration：**  
Thrilled to have found a friend she can share her hobbies with,  
Nanaka headed back to the city with {player}.
