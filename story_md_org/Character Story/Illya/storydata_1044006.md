**Narration：**  
One day while strolling through the city,  
Illya is taken into custody by a patrolling knight.  
  
**Illya：**  
How many times must I tell you?! I am not a lost child!  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
Yes, yes, whatever you say. Of course you're not.  
So... where do you live? Can you tell me your name?  
  
**Illya：**  
You do not understand!  
Cease treating me like a child at once!  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
Right, right. I'm sure you're a big girl now.  
Now,  
where are your mommy and daddy?  
  
**Illya：**  
Grrrr! You aren't listening at all!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You've been arrested? What did you do?  
**Choice: (2)**  Are you lost, little girl?  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
Don't treat me like some criminal! I was just lost!  
Wait, no! That's not right either!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
Don't you start with that as well!  
I wasn't lost, this fool just thinks I was!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Illya：**  
Wait... if it isn't {player}, my faithful minion!  
Help me explain to this nincompoop!  
Tell him I'm really a grown-up woman with a body to die for!  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
Oh, are you this kid's big brother?  
You shouldn't let your sister wander off, you know.  
Well then, I should get going.  
  
**Illya：**  
Hey! Don't you run away!  
...Curses. He escaped before I could clear up  
that ridiculous misunderstanding...  
  
**Illya：**  
Outrageous! Utterly unforgivable!  
Who does he think he is, treating me like a child?!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I should thank him for taking care of my li'l sis.  
**Choice: (5)**  Now now, calm down. Big Bro will walk you home.  
`Tag 4`  
**Illya：**  
Wh-wh-who are you calling \"li'l sis\"?!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Illya：**  
Who made you my \"Big Bro\"?!  
That's enough impertinence from you!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Illya：**  
I am your unholy mistress! And you, my minion!  
We are by no means commonplace siblings!  
  
**Illya：**  
B-besides...  
Being related would be problematic, would it not?  
In certain... eventual... situations...  
  
**Illya：**  
You're not sure what situations I might mean?!  
Urghh... Th-that much, you can work it out for yourself!  
At any rate, I have no desire to be a sister of yours!  
  
**Illya：**  
Yes... it would be most problematic.  
As long as such misunderstandings continue to occur,  
my ambitions cannot be fulfilled!  
  
**Illya：**  
At this point, I will just have to recover my powers,  
and with them, the body of a true temptress!  
You will aid me in this, understood?!  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmm? You're curious about my ambitions?  
Well... My main goal is world conquest,  
but first, you and I should...  
  
**Illya：**  
Wait! I'm not saying that out loud!  
Enough of your incessant prying!  
  
**Narration：**  
Regardless of her body's age, it seemed like it would be a while  
before Illya regained any measure of grown-up composure.
