# Illya Episode 3
One day, Illya wakes up to find herself in her true form, so she summons {player} to help investigate the cause. It seems to have been triggered by a pleasant dream she had, but when she uses her magic to avoid revealing the nature of the dream, she reverts to her younger form.

**Illya：**  
{player}! {player}!  
Behold! My glorious form!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  And who might you be?  
**Choice: (2)**  You're all grown up?!  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
This is no time for silly jokes!  
This is not the first time you have witnessed my true beauty!  
It is I! Your mistress, Illya!

`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
I have always been grown up!  
This is merely my original form unleashed!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Illya：**  
When I awoke this morning, I found myself in this shape!  
Quite some time has passed since then,  
but my body shows no sign of returning...  
  
**Illya：**  
I may have recovered my true form for good!  
  
**Illya：**  
I wanted to celebrate with you first of all.  
So I came to show you at once!  
  
**Illya：**  
You wonder what could have caused this?  
True, I do not know the reason.  
  
**Illya：**  
As such, I am still somewhat concerned.  
Who can say what might turn me into a child once more?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Let's try to work out the cause.  
`Tag 4`  
**Illya：**  
Yes, that seems best.  
If we clear up the mystery, there will be no need to worry.  
However, I really have no idea...  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmm? What else happened this morning?  
Ah, I see. If we identify what was different, it may lead us to the cause.  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmm... Even so, that said...  
I cannot recall anything particularly unique...  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmmm... This morning... This morning...  
What was different...?  
  
**Illya：**  
Oh! I know!  
You appeared in my dreams this morning.  
That has never happened before.  
  
**Illya：**  
That's the only difference I can recall.  
  
**Illya：**  
Up until now, I have been able to assume this form  
when you were close by.  
So perhaps it stands to reason that this dream was the cause.  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmm? What kind of dream was it?  
Well, I think it was a pleasant one!  
I recall awakening in a rather good mood...  
  
**Illya：**  
Ah yes, I remember now!  
I invited my guild's members to the castle to celebrate our marri—  
  
**Illya：**  
...!!!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Is something wrong?  
`Tag 5`  
**Illya：**  
N-no! Not in the slightest!  
I didn't have any dreams about you, that's for certain!  
  
**Illya：**  
I say I didn't, so I didn't!  
Certainly no rosy fantasies of you and I... of us getting...  
Of course I would not have such a dream!  
  
**Illya：**  
Arghhh, enough pestering!  
I told you it was nothing, did I not?!  
Take this and be quiet!  
  
**Illya：**  
H-hmph!  
That's what you get when you don't respect  
a lady's delicate boundaries!  
  
**Illya：**  
Ahhh! I'm a child again?!  
That spell just now must have used up my energy...  
  
**Illya：**  
Hmmm... Well, no matter.  
We can continue to work together to find a different restoration method.  
  
**Illya：**  
Come—I'm counting on you to serve me faithfully!  
Yes, just like a lifelong partner...  
  
**Illya：**  
Eheheh...!  
  
**Narration：**  
Moments later, Illya demonstrated the remarkable ability  
to collapse from embarrassment at her own words.
