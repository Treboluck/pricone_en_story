# Illya Episode 7
Illya tries all sorts of methods to restore her full powers, but none are successful. She even fails to rest {player}'s head on her lap, ultimately resting her head on his instead. Illya swears that when she recovers her true body, she will return the favor.

**Narration：**  
Today, Illya has summoned {player} to join her  
on an important mission.  
  
**Illya：**  
The time has come to restore my powers and recover my true body!  
In my current state, I look like nothing more than your little sister...  
And that cannot continue!  
  
**Illya：**  
Wh-why? Because I say so!  
It is most inconvenient!  
  
**Illya：**  
When I am by your side, I can regain my true form at times...  
But a temporary revival is not enough!  
I wish to recover my true glory once and for all!  
  
**Illya：**  
As such, I have been conducting various investigations,  
and I found a promising lead in a certain tome!  
It will be our first goal!  
  
**Illya：**  
As my minion, it is your duty to aid me properly!  
Come, it is this way!  
  
**Illya：**  
The herbs that grow on this remote cliff  
are said to possess a \"growth-accelerating property\"!  
I am certain they will be of use, so go and harvest them!  
  
**Illya：**  
That's right. This is a job for you.  
I would like to climb up and obtain the herbs myself,  
but this cliff is frankly unscalable with the short limbs of a child.  
  
**Illya：**  
I attempted it a number of times,  
but I always lost my grip partway.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's give up, then.  
**Choice: (2)**  Leave it to me.  
`Tag 1`  
**Illya：**  
Don't give up before you even try!  
This is well within your abilities!

`Tag 2`  
**Illya：**  
Oho! I'd expect no less from my minion!  
I knew you would not let me down!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Illya：**  
The point where the herbs grow is not too high.  
Now, go forth and climb!  
  
**Illya：**  
Very good, very good! You are making steady progress!  
  
**Illya：**  
Whoa! Your foothold crumbled beneath you...  
You are now dangling in midair!  
A-are you all right?  
  
**Illya：**  
Ahhh! A brilliant recovery.  
Very good, very good. No less from my minion!  
  
**Illya：**  
...  
  
**Illya：**  
Excellent. These are indeed the herbs I sought.  
Now, let me try a bite... *munch*  
  
**Illya：**  
Mnghh!  
 S-so bitter! What is this plant?!  
It is not fit for human consumption!  
  
**Illya：**  
The best medicines have the harshest tastes...?  
I'll have none of that nonsense!  
These herbs are no good. On to the next plan!  
  
**Illya：**  
According to a rumor I managed to track down,  
deep within the earth here lives a rainbow-colored insect.  
Its juices bestow great reserves of magic, or so they say...  
  
**Illya：**  
I know.  
I would rather not rely on such dubious rumors either.  
But we cannot ignore a valuable possibility!  
  
**Illya：**  
The question is, how are we to uncover this elusive insect?  
I have tried digging up the ground many times,  
but have never seen hide nor hair of it.  
  
**Illya：**  
That is why I have brought you!  
You may have what it takes to find the tiny creature!  
Now, start digging!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Found it.  
`Tag 4`  
**Illya：**  
I see, I see.  
You found it, did you...  
  
**Illya：**  
Wait, what?! You found it already?!  
  
**Illya：**  
It's true... That is indeed a rainbow-colored insect.  
Remarkable work!  
  
**Illya：**  
S-still... Must I really eat this thing?  
Look at all those tiny wriggling legs...  
  
**Illya：**  
This can be... a last resort!  
We will put it on hold for now.  
Next! Let's try the next plan!  
  
**Illya：**  
According to an urban legend, one who finds a shell  
with a golden sheen will have their wish granted.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Isn't that just a superstition?  
**Choice: (6)**  Then you can wish for your powers back!  
`Tag 5`  
**Illya：**  
Urk... W-what choice do we have?!  
I must follow every lead I uncover!

`Tag 6`  
**Illya：**  
Quite right, quite right.  
That seems like a perfectly valid wish, after all.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Illya：**  
The problem is, I have not been able to find any such shell.  
I searched for three days and nights, but—  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Found it.  
`Tag 8`  
**Illya：**  
Why must you be so fast?!  
Even for my finest minion, such skills seem unreasonable!  
  
**Illya：**  
Still, you have done well!  
Shining shell! Restore me to my former glory!  
  
**Illya：**  
...  
  
**Illya：**  
H-how do I look? H-has my body changed?  
  
**Illya：**  
Not in the tiniest bit?  
Y-you must be mistaken!  
Look closer! There must be some difference!  
  
**Illya：**  
Y-you really don't see any change?  
Ngh... I see...  
I suppose superstitions are not to be relied upon...  
  
**Illya：**  
O-of course, I knew that from the start!  
So naturally, I am not shocked or disappointed!  
  
**Illya：**  
I-I just feel a little... taken aback... slightly startled...  
and somewhat dumbfounded... That is all.  
  
**Illya：**  
Still, I am not about to give up!  
I must search for more information!  
When I find more leads, I will require your help once more!  
  
**Illya：**  
{player}, I have to say I was impressed  
by your success in these endeavors where I had failed.  
You are a faithful and valuable minion indeed.  
  
**Illya：**  
Alas, in this form I cannot unleash my potential.  
I feel terribly weak and powerless...  
You are all I can rely on. I'm counting on you, minion.  
  
**Illya：**  
B-by the by!  
You have worked long and hard for me today,  
so I should give you some reward.  
  
**Illya：**  
I know. I will let you rest your head on my lap.  
You must be tired, so I will ease your fatigue.  
No need to shy away—come, make yourself comfortable.  
  
**Illya：**  
How is that?  
Most pleasant, I should hope?  
  
**Illya：**  
My legs are so small, they are difficult to rest upon?  
Curses! Must this meager form fail me even here?!  
Urghhh...  
  
**Illya：**  
Hm? What's that? We should switch?  
You wish to rest my head on your lap, do you?  
But how will that ease your fatigue?  
  
**Illya：**  
Still, my head upon your lap...  
Hmm. I suppose it cannot hurt to try.  
  
**Illya：**  
Ahh...! This is very pleasant!  
There may be more to this \"lap pillow\" notion than I realized.  
  
**Illya：**  
I would very much like to grant you this same sensation...  
But in this body, I cannot even do that.  
  
**Illya：**  
Once I regain my adult body, I swear I will return this favor.  
And I promise you, it will be worth the wait!
