**Narration：**  
Today, Miyako is voraciously consuming  
the special Halloween pudding {player} bought her.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Mmm~! ♪  
 Halloween pudding is all Miyako's... And so gooood!  
Munchy pumpkin and creamy cream are a perfect pudding match!  
  
**Woman：**  
Hurry up, folks! Only a few tubs left  
of our Halloween Pudding Ice Cream!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Pudding ice cream?! Like ice cream but pudding?!  
{player}! Miyako needs that too!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Aren't you full yet?  
`Tag 1`  
**Miyako：**  
Ghosts don't get full of pudding!  
 Quick, go buy it!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako needs the pudding ice cream!  
  
**Woman：**  
Oh, I'm very sorry. We sold the last tub just now.  
Try coming back tomorrow!  
  
**Miyako：**  
T-too late for pudding...  
 This is all your slowpoke fault!  
Miyako can't wait for tomorrow!  
Pudding ice cream, pudding ice cream, pudding ice cream!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Oh! Miyako knows. We can just *make* it instead!  
Bestest idea, right?!  
  
**Miyako：**  
To make pudding ice cream... We can take pudding and freeze it!  
Oh, but... Me and you can't use any ice magics...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Which means...  
 We have to go somewhere cold for freezing!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Look at all the snow! ♪  
  
**Miyako：**  
If we bury pudding here, it'll go freezey and icey for sure!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako brought lots of normal pudding!  
Let's bury it all here!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hurry and freeze deliciously!  
Pudding, you're ice cream now! ♪  
  
**Miyako：**  
Urgh... Miyako is getting cold chills...  
Well, of course snowy mountains are cold.  
But no running. Pudding ice cream is so close to ready!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Big uh-oh! Miyako wasn't ready for mountain weather!  
Who knew there would be mega snowstorms?!  
  
**Miyako：**  
W-we should run and come back later!  
  
**Miyako：**  
H-huh?  
 {player}, hurry up!  
This is no time for looking tiredy and sleepy!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Aaaahhh! Open your eyes, {player}!  
Sleeping means dying! Dying of cold is the worstest!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Wake! Right! Up! Right! Now!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Slappy! Punchy!  
  
**Miyako：**  
I-it's no good... He even sleeps through hitting!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Why did this happen to us?!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hmm? Ooh! Miyako sees a cave!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Urghhh... {player}, you're heavy!  
Heavey-ho! Heavey-ho!  
  
**Miyako：**  
*pant*... *pant*... Miyako used ten puddings worth of energy...  
{player}, open your eyes up already!  
You really want to die?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Don't die and leave Miyako here!  
Poke! Poke! Pokey-poke!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Slappy! Punchy!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako won't allow any dying!  
You need to live to give Miyako more puddings!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Whacky-whacky-whacky-whack-whack-whack-whack!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm awake...  
**Choice: (3)**  Help... Being killed by... ghost...  
`Tag 2`  
**Miyako：**  
Get up now! Open your eyes!  
This is the worstest time for becoming not alive!

`Tag 3`  
**Miyako：**  
No! No killing!  
A dead {player} can't buy any puddings!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Miyako：**  
...Oh! You really woke up!  
 What a big phew!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Relief makes me want to eat pudding ice cream...  
But the pudding is out in the snow...  
  
**Miyako：**  
What a big fail... Miyako was tricked by temptation...  
Now there's no pudding, only cold... Such despair...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Let's start a fire to get warm.  
**Choice: (6)**  We need to share body warmth!  
`Tag 5`  
**Miyako：**  
That's a good idea! You do the firey thing!  
  
**Miyako：**  
...Huh? You can't make fire?  
 Why did you even say it then?!  
I thought you might know fire-making magics!

`Tag 6`  
**Miyako：**  
Wh-why are you taking clothes off?! Did your brain freeze?!  
...You read it in a book?  
 What a crazy book.  
Miyako thought you'd lost all moral decency.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ahhh, but... Maybe it doesn't sound so... Urghhh.  
N-no, it's too embarrassing! Very bad plan! Next idea!  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Miyako：**  
What other ways could we...  
 Oh! Look there!  
There's animal furs deep in the cave!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Maybe this cave is a shelter for hunters.  
What a lucky find for us!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako will wrap both of us up together.  
Need to make sure you stay not asleep.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ahh... This feels much better now!  
Wrapping up with you is comfy...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Your body is all warm and snuggly!  
Miyako is all cold and dead, so that makes it feel even warmer!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Mmmnh... Now Miyako feels... sort of a bit sleepy...  
Must eat... pudding... ice cream...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Zzz... Zzz...  
  
**Miyako：**  
...Ahh! Was Miyako asleep?! Super not good!  
Miyako would have died if not dead already!  
  
**Miyako：**  
{player}, did you keep Miyako warm the whole time?  
Eheheh... Maybe that's why. Warm makes me sleepy.  
  
**Miyako：**  
With all these furs, your face looks less ghosty now.  
Does the cave feel less cold than it did before, too?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Yes! The blizzardy snow has stopped!  
We survived the mountain!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Now we can finally eat pudding ice cream!  
Umm, I think it was over here...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Wow, look! The pudding is hard and shiny!  
Let's try it out!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Mmmm~! ♪ It's all crunchy and tasty!  
  
**Miyako：**  
First it tastes like icy sherbet... But as it slowly melts,  
it fills the mouth with creamy pudding flavor!  
  
**Miyako：**  
It's like pudding that's not pudding! A pudding revolution!  
  
**Miyako：**  
...Achoo! Urgh... Even with no blizzard,  
eating icy food in the snow feels cold and freezy...  
  
**Miyako：**  
...Miyako Pounce!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Eheheh! ♪  
 If we snuggle like before, it's all warm!  
Now we can eat pudding ice cream, no problem!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Thank you for coming with Miyako, {player}!  
  
**Narration：**  
Cuddling up to {player} in the snow,  
Miyako basked in the refreshing taste of frozen pudding.  
Somehow it tasted better than the store-bought ice cream ever could.
