**Narration：**  
With Halloween drawing to an end, Miyako watches sadly  
as the city returns to its usual, undecorated state.  
  
**Miyako：**  
Halloween was a crazy time, but lots of fun.  
Feels lonely to think  
 it's all over already...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hmm?! What now?!  
 It's so shiny! Can't look at the light!  
  

---  
  
**Miyako：**  
That Halloween pumpkin pudding...  
Who knew we'd have to line up for a whole hour for it?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako thought we might die of boringness...  
But we got pudding in the end!  
Good work, {player}!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Pudding~! ♪ Pudding~! ♪  
Hmm? What's this shiny shop over here?  
  
**Miyako：**  
A \"gaming arcade\"?  
 Miyako never saw one before!  
Looks like fun! Let's go inside!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ooh, wow!  
 Big, cuddly animals... and anime figures!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ohhh! That machine has sweet things in it!  
\"Get all your Halloween candy here,\" it says!  
  
**Miyako：**  
{player}! Look at this!  
There's ice cream, jellies... even puddings inside the game machine!  
  
**Miyako：**  
This is a trove of treasures!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako's gonna slip inside and grab the puddings!  
Then eat them with the pumpkin pudding we got!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Stealing is wrong.  
**Choice: (2)**  Isn't the pumpkin pudding enough?  
`Tag 1`  
**Miyako：**  
Miyako is no dirty thief!  
All puddings in the world belong to Miyako!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Miyako：**  
You're talking crazy nonsense!  
More puddings is always better than less puddings!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Miyako：**  
Hmmm... The game looks fun too though...  
How do you play this machine?  
  
**Miyako：**  
Press buttons to move the crane... and grab prizes?  
Your explanations are confusing!  
Show Miyako how it works!  
  
**Miyako：**  
*staaaare*...  
 Ooh! The crane grabbed the pudding!  
Amazing! Insta-win!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Now it's Miyako's turn!  
{player}, put 100 yen in the slot!  
  
**Miyako：**  
...Stop there! Now to grab!  
Here it comes... Here it comes...!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Ah... Aaaahhh! So close!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Time for a second try!  
{player}, 100 more yens!  
  
**Miyako：**  
First line up the crane in front of the pudding...  
Now look from the side... Right there!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Aaaahhhhh! The crane hit a stupid jelly and stopped going down!  
{player}, next 100 yen, quick!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Not another fail!  
100 yen coin, quick quick!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Why does it hate Miyako?!  
Urghhh... Hurry and come out already! Next 100 yen!  
  
**Miyako：**  
This time, no failing... Next time...!  
{player}, put 500 yen in this time!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Why why why?! It never works! This is too annoying!  
Hey, why are you trying to press buttons now?!  
This is Miyako's challenge! Miyako will get it!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  P... Please let me help...  
`Tag 4`  
**Miyako：**  
Hrmph... All right then...  
 We can play together!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Urk...  
 Your hand goes on top of Miyako's?  
This feels pretty funny...  
  
**Miyako：**  
But this way you can do the timing part!  
Pudding crane, go!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Aaahhh... This position isn't really over the pudding.  
You think it's good?  
 Oh! The arm hooked onto it at a funny angle!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Whoaaaa! Amazing! Pudding is Miyako's!  
You must be a game genius!  
  
**Miyako：**  
But in the end, we spent about 3,000 yens...  
More moneys than the pumpkin pudding cost.  
  
**Miyako：**  
There's lots of other games in here that look fun!  
Let's play something else now!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Oh!  
Let's try that... \"pudding club\" machine!  
It must have lots of puddings inside! ♪  
  
**Miyako：**  
Hmm? That says \"print club,\" not \"pudding club\"?  
T-too shocking...  
But come in anyway! Take a snapshot with Miyako!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Are you even visible in photos?  
`Tag 5`  
**Miyako：**  
No problems at all! I can show up if I want to!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Now get in here and take the picture!  
\"Halloween Frame\"...?  
 Let's use this one!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Pose settings can be whatever...  
Wahhh! The machine says to squeeze together!  
You, come over here!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Now make a happy face! ♪  
  
**Miyako：**  
Picture snapped!  
 Ummm...  
Next we do drawings and writings on top!  
A bit here, a bit there...  
  
**Miyako：**  
Pffft! The \"long leg\" option makes you look too funny!  
You're like a space alien!  
  
**Miyako：**  
This is gonna be a masterpiece!  
Let me try to make you look super hot!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Eye size at biggestest... Stretch out the chin...  
 There! All done!

**Miyako：**  
Oh, the photos popped out!  
W-wow... You look like a different person!  
  
**Miyako：**  
Eheheh.  
 Miyako never took photos with people before.  
This will be Miyako's treasure! ♪  
  
**Miyako：**  
Even ghosts can have precious memories~!  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Eww... That guy's using the machine on his own...  
  
**Woman 2：**  
What a loser... Doesn't he have any friends?  
  
**Miyako：**  
This was so many funs!  
Now to go home and eat pudding!

`image display end`  
**Ameth：**  
And... welcome back.  
I whipped up that little dream based on your old memories.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Photos are a fine thing, aren't they?  
They can bring even the haziest of memories back into focus.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Since she became a wandering spirit,  
Miyako can't have had much opportunity to leave her mark.  
This might be the greatest treasure she could ask for.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Unlike pudding, it won't be gone before she knows it.  
  

---  
  
**Miyako：**  
Mmnhh... Did we both fall a-sleepy...?  
Miyako thinks... there was special Halloween pudding in the dream too!  
  
**Miyako：**  
But Halloween is over now...  
So there will be no more Halloween pudding for eating...  
  
**Miyako：**  
No pudding is sad...  
 But next year Miyako will eat twice as much!  
Next year Halloween will be even more funner than this year!  
  
**Miyako：**  
You better be there too!  
All Miyako's fun this year was because you were there!  
So you gotta give Miyako lots and lots of pudding next year too! ♪  
  
**Narration：**  
Smiling happily at the memory of this year's fun times,  
and in anticipation of those to come,  
Miyako bid farewell to the Halloween season.
