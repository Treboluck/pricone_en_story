**Jun：**  
...  
  
**Jun：**  
...Ah, young man. We meet again.  
  
**Jun：**  
Did you make it back to your lodgings all right yesterday?  
  
**Jun：**  
I see. Well, that is good to hear.  
The streets of Landosol have been treacherous of late.  
I was concerned that you may have fallen prey to unruly sorts.  
  
**Jun：**  
...You have my apologies.  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm?  
Why do I apologize, you ask?  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha... The city's declining peace and order  
is the responsibility of those tasked with protecting  
that city, is it not?  
  
**Jun：**  
We have been increasing our patrols  
and strengthening security regulations...  
  
**Jun：**  
But after so many years of peace,  
our assigned funds have dwindled,  
and most of our personnel are lacking in experience.  
  
**Jun：**  
The sudden rise in strange incidents and criminal activity  
has left us struggling to keep up.  
  
**Jun：**  
In response to the citizens' fears and unease,  
other guilds have sprung up to defend the populace in our stead...  
  
**Jun：**  
But those guilds often come into conflict with one another,  
leading to still greater unrest.  
  
**Jun：**  
It is a vicious cycle.  
We can hardly leave things in this state. I know that, but...  
  
**Jun：**  
First of all, we of Nightmare must pull ourselves together.  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha... I suppose all of this is hardly your concern.  
I must have been standing here for so long  
that I am starved for conversation.  
  
**Jun：**  
At any rate.  
You came here to see me, did you not?  
  
**Jun：**  
Perhaps you have lost your way again?  
It is not my job to guide you at every turn...  
But I have little to do, so I can draw a map if you so desire.  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm?  
Oh... You came to thank me for yesterday?  
  
**Jun：**  
Well, I never. How very courteous of you.  
You are most welcome, young man.  
  
**Jun：**  
I did nothing that should really deserve your thanks,  
but if I have been of help to you, that warms my heart.  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm?  
To express your gratitude,  
you have brought a present for me?  
  
**Jun：**  
Th-thank you.  
How excessive... All I did was give you directions.  
I feel a little embarrassed to accept this.  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha...  
Well then, what exactly have you brought for me?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  A delicious cake.  
**Choice: (2)**  A cute ribbon.  
`Tag 1`  
**Jun：**  
A cake?  
Well, thank you.  
I confess, sweet treats are not my usual fare...  
  
**Jun：**  
Hm?  
Your companion told you that all girls  
are fond of sweet things?  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha...  
I'm not sure if I'm exactly of the age  
to be called a \"girl\" anymore...  
  
**Jun：**  
And after all, I hardly look the part, do I?  
So it's quite rare for anyone to treat me that way.  
I'm actually a little touched.  
  
**Jun：**  
What's this? Why are you staring at me?  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm?  
You're wondering how I plan to eat the cake  
with this heavy helmet on?  
  
**Jun：**  
Well, of course, I plan to take it home  
and eat it after taking my helmet off.  
  
**Jun：**  
I'm sorry.  
Due to my circumstances,  
I can't reveal my face to anyone.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Jun：**  
A ribbon?  
Ah, you mean a hair accessory.  
I'm aware of them.  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha.  
Ever since I was a very young girl,  
I have always worn a helmet in public...  
  
**Jun：**  
So I have never purchased accessories for myself.  
This may be the first time I've ever handled a ribbon.  
  
**Jun：**  
That's right.  
Due to my unique circumstances,  
I can't remove this helmet in front of others.  
  
**Jun：**  
So I'm afraid I have little use for this ribbon...  
But I appreciate the sentiment,  
so I'll take this home and try it on by myself.  
  
**Jun：**  
I may be past the age where such a sweet accessory  
would have suited me... But I have always been a little  
jealous of the other girls with their trinkets.  
  
**Jun：**  
So this makes me rather happy.  
Thank you, young man.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Jun：**  
Haha...  
I was a little concerned when you came by...  
But it seems you really did just want to show your gratitude.  
  
**Jun：**  
I suspected for a moment that your present box  
might be booby-trapped, but I need not have worried.  
  
**Jun：**  
How embarrassing...  
This profession has dulled my capacity for trust.  
  
**Jun：**  
To think I would doubt even your honest expression of thanks.  
  
**Jun：**  
Please forgive me for my suspicion, young man.  
  
**Jun：**  
But it can hardly be helped.  
It is my calling to protect this palace from danger.  
This guard duty has long been passed down in my family.  
  
**Jun：**  
Should I fall, this palace, nay, this kingdom would be  
endangered. To prevent such a tragedy, I must stand here  
and remain vigilant with each day that comes.  
  
**Jun：**  
...Does that seem a lonely life to you, young man?  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha.  
I'm sorry. That must be a difficult question to answer.  
  
**Jun：**  
Don't worry.  
I am satisfied with my lot. With this life.  
  
**Jun：**  
I have been entrusted with a great task.  
My pride in that helps to soothe my heart.  
  
**Jun：**  
And even just standing and waiting here,  
I was lucky enough to meet a fine young man like yourself.
