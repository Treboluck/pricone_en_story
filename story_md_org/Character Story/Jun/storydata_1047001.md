# Jun Episode 1
In front of Landosol's royal palace stands Jun, a steadfast, statue-like figure clothed from head to toe in heavy armor. When {player} explains that he's lost, Jun kindly draws a map for him.

**Jun：**  
...  
  
**Jun：**  
...Do you need something, young man?  
  
**Jun：**  
Oh, my apologies.  
Did I startle you?  
  
**Jun：**  
I am always standing in front of the royal palace gates  
like this, you see, never moving an inch.  
  
**Jun：**  
It seems that passers-by  
often mistake me for a decorative statue.  
  
**Jun：**  
Occasionally I even find tourists stop to pose beside me  
and take photographs.  
  
**Jun：**  
Are you not familiar with photography?  
It is a magical technique of projecting images onto paper.  
  
**Jun：**  
All it requires is a simple magical apparatus,  
so even ordinary citizens can make use of it at little cost.  
  
**Jun：**  
Until relatively recently, there was a widely-held belief  
that these devices would extract one's soul.  
  
**Jun：**  
So it does make me a little uncomfortable  
to be used as a photo opportunity.  
  
**Jun：**  
And from a security perspective,  
it's hardly ideal to have many photos taken of the palace.  
  
**Jun：**  
Even so, it's not enough of a crime  
to warrant harsh reprimands or punishment.  
So as a rule, I let the practice slide.  
  
**Jun：**  
Though as a loyal knight  
sworn to defend the palace above all else,  
perhaps my solution isn't exactly ideal. Hmm.  
  
**Jun：**  
...  
  
**Jun：**  
...You're a man of few words.  
I'm not exactly the talkative type myself,  
so conversations like this are not my strong point.  
  
**Jun：**  
If you don't say anything,  
the burden of talking falls entirely to me,  
which feels a little awkward.  
  
**Jun：**  
Let me ask again.  
Do you have some business at the castle,  
ehm... {player}, was it?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Yup, that's my name.  
**Choice: (2)**  Do we know each other?  
`Tag 1`  
**Jun：**  
Ah, good.  
Yes, I thought I knew your face.  
  
**Jun：**  
To tell the truth, this helmet obscures my vision somewhat.  
I need to get rather close just to identify who it is that  
I'm talking to.  
  
**Jun：**  
I have worn a helmet around the clock  
since a very young age...  
  
**Jun：**  
So it does not present a major issue in my daily life...  
But I may never be suited for customer service positions.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Jun：**  
No, I do not believe we have ever met in person.  
Her Majesty once showed me a likeness of you, that's all.  
  
**Jun：**  
Ah... Perhaps I shouldn't mention that.  
Please forget about it.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Jun：**  
At any rate, I have long been hoping  
to have the opportunity to speak with you.  
  
**Jun：**  
Since we had the good fortune to meet today,  
I'd appreciate it if you would humor me.  
  
**Jun：**  
Though I understand my work here is important,  
standing motionless in front of the gates all day  
can be surprisingly tiring, you know.  
  
**Jun：**  
Would you stay awhile and distract this young woman  
from her tedium, {player}?  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm?  
Yes, I am a woman, as it happens.  
  
**Jun：**  
Not that it makes a lot of difference. Due perhaps to the  
impact of my bulky armor, I am often mistaken for a man.  
Now, how others see me is hardly an major concern...  
  
**Jun：**  
But when I see girls walk by in fashionable clothing,  
I admit I feel a little jealous at times.  
  
**Jun：**  
My strict family code forbids me from removing this armor,  
so I will never know that pleasure.  
  
**Jun：**  
Well, no matter.  
Let me introduce myself properly.

**Jun：**  
I am the captain of Nightmare, Defenders of the Throne.  
You can call me Jun.  
It's good to make your acquaintance.  
  
**Jun：**  
Nightmare forms one part of Princess Knight,  
the great guild that serves the throne of Landosol.  
You might call us a government entity.  
  
**Jun：**  
Our primary duty is to protect the palace  
and the city surrounding it.  
  
**Jun：**  
In wartime, our guild served as an army, doing battle  
on the front lines in place of the powerless citizenry.  
We represent the military might of this proud nation.  
  
**Jun：**  
But times have been peaceful of late, so it may be better  
to think of us as simple security guards.  
  
**Jun：**  
We have the right to perform arrests, so I would advise  
against committing any offences in our presence.  
  
**Jun：**  
Nightmare is not known for showing mercy  
to criminals who disturb the peace and order.  
  
**Jun：**  
I sincerely hope you never make an enemy of us.

**Jun：**  
...  
  
**Jun：**  
...Hmm? That was all I had to say,  
but was there still something you wanted?  
  
**Jun：**  
Ah. So you've lost your way.  
You were struggling to find your bearings  
and locate the hotel where you're staying?  
  
**Jun：**  
I see, I see.  
You should have said so in the first place.  
  
**Jun：**  
Sorry to keep you with all this unnecessary talk.  
I was concerned that you might be here to investigate  
the palace, you see...  
  
**Jun：**  
For whatever reason, it seems Her Majesty  
does not think very highly of you.  
  
**Jun：**  
I apologize if I sounded needlessly threatening.  
If you are simply lost, it is my duty to come to your aid.  
  
**Jun：**  
Well, then.  
Could you tell me the hotel's name?  
I'll draw a simple map for you.  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha...  
The streets of Landosol are quite difficult to navigate  
for those who are not used to them.  
  
**Jun：**  
If you ever have trouble finding your way,  
you should make for the palace, which is visible  
from every corner of the city.  
  
**Jun：**  
You will always find me standing right here.  
I will gladly point you in the right direction.  
  
**Jun：**  
Oh, no need to thank me. We who fight for justice  
should always show kindness to those we protect.
