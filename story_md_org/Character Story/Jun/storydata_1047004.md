## Subtitle: An Off-Duty Hero
  
**Jun：**  
Whew.  
It's getting dark already.  
  
**Jun：**  
Thanks to Chris putting in a word with Her Majesty,  
my hours have been reduced somewhat recently...  
  
**Jun：**  
So I can at least return home  
and rest in my own bed these days.  
  
**Jun：**  
But actually, the whole process  
of traveling between my own home and the palace  
is a little arduous in and of itself.  
  
**Jun：**  
Before now, I had always slept at the Nightmare guard station.  
  
**Jun：**  
The more time I spend away from the palace,  
the more I worry about its defenses...  
  
**Jun：**  
And Chris never does anything out of the goodness of her heart,  
so I can't help but suspect her motives.  
  
**Jun：**  
Still, ah well...  
I can't deny I feel exhausted as usual.  
  
**Jun：**  
Not that anything in particular came up today,  
but standing on one's feet all day while remaining alert all the while  
does take its toll.  
  
**Jun：**  
Well, such is the life of a gatekeeper.  
  
**Jun：**  
Up until a few days ago,  
that young man often came by to see me...  
  
**Jun：**  
And the thought of seeing him was enough to get me through the day...  
But those days are behind us now.  
  
**Jun：**  
He is an honest and reliable young man,  
so I doubt he would break his word and come near the palace...  
I suppose the two of us will never meet again.  
  
**Jun：**  
I knew this would be the case...  
But it does make me feel a little lonely.  
  
**Jun：**  
...  
  
**Jun：**  
...Hmm?  
Did I just see something move in the shadows?  
  
**Jun：**  
An intruder? Or a monster?  
Could it be one of those \"Shadow\" creatures  
I have heard rumors of lately?  
  
**Jun：**  
I suppose I should go and investigate.  
It is our duty at Nightmare  
to defend the peace of the city.  
  
**Jun：**  
Who goes there?!  
If you hear my words, I ask that you respond  
and show yourself at once!  
  
**Jun：**  
...Wait, huh?  
Young man?  
  
**Jun：**  
H... How unexpected.  
What are you doing in a place like that?  
  
**Jun：**  
Ehmmm...  
I confess I was not expecting  
to see you again so soon after our farewell.  
  
**Jun：**  
I am not sure how I should act in this situation.  
  
**Jun：**  
...?  
Young man? What is wrong?  
At least respond to my words.  
  
**Jun：**  
What's this...?  
Could it be he is asleep?  
Whyever could that be?  
  
**Jun：**  
Nghh...?  
What's this... bright light?  
  
**Jun：**  
Urghh...  
For some reason... I am starting to feel sleepy myself...  
  

---  
  
**???：**  
...  
  
**???：**  
...Hmm?  
Ah, young man. I was waiting for you.  
  
**???：**  
Haha.  
Finally you show yourself before me. I am quite relieved.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Scream.  
**Choice: (2)**  Hug her.  
`Tag 1`  
**???：**  
Oh?  
Ah, you surprised me there.  
You shouldn't cry out so suddenly.  
  
**???：**  
You were scared? Of me?  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm?  
Since I came out in this full masked costume,  
you panicked a little?  
  
**Jun：**  
Does it look so ghastly?  
This is the garb of Tora Tiger,  
beloved hero of justice.  
  
**Jun：**  
I thought children were generally fond of it...  
It hurts me a little to see it treated as frightening.  
  
**Jun：**  
Ah.  
I suppose you are in high school already,  
so you are hardly a mere child.  
  
**Jun：**  
I must apologize.  
I should not have treated you as such.  
  
**Jun：**  
In the future I will try to choose  
a mask that is more popular with high schoolers.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Jun：**  
Oh my...  
I'm sorry, young man.  
  
**Jun：**  
Since you lunged at me so suddenly, I seem to have instinctively  
thrown you to the ground with my aikido techniques.  
You aren't hurt, are you?  
  
**Jun：**  
You shouldn't suddenly try to embrace women, you know.  
I can handle a little physical contact myself,  
but others might mistake you for some kind of pervert.  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha.  
Rushing to embrace me in a burst of joy...  
Were you really that happy to see me?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Jun：**  
At any rate...  
It seems we are attracting a lot of attention from passing students,  
so perhaps we should settle our business here quickly.  
  
**Jun：**  
Young man, I would like you to have these.  
They are free tickets to the amusement park.  
  
**Jun：**  
...Hmm?  
Oh no, I am not inviting you on a date.  
We hardly have that kind of relationship, do we?  
  
**Jun：**  
But you often come to the park  
to help me with my work, do you not?  
  
**Jun：**  
Helping to set up the stage for the hero show,  
or playing the villain for me to defeat...  
Well, this is my way of thanking you.  
  
**Jun：**  
I would hate to make you do all that work for nothing.  
So please accept this gift, young man.  
  
**Jun：**  
Really, I insist.  
Thanks to my work, I receive plenty of these free tickets.  
  
**Jun：**  
It is no trouble at all to share some with you,  
and I hardly ever take advantage of them myself,  
so I would much rather see them put to good use.  
  
**Jun：**  
I believe they can also be redeemed for cash,  
so if you are the type who prefers more pragmatic gifts,  
feel free to do so as you wish.  
  
**Jun：**  
Still, you are in high school, yes?  
At the height of your glorious youth.  
  
**Jun：**  
You should take this opportunity to invite some girl  
on a pleasant date to remember.  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha.  
I suppose that would make me  
your personal Cupid, now, wouldn't it?  
  
**Jun：**  
Well, I hope you have a good time.  
The smiles of young folk like yourself  
are the finest reward I could possibly ask for.  
  
**Jun：**  
Yes... That was all I wanted.  
Sorry to make you come all the way out here, young man.  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha.  
I would love it if you could lend me  
a helping hand with my work again in the future.  
  
**Jun：**  
So, until then, this is farewell... young man.  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
There we go. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Everything you just saw was essentially a dream.  
You'll forget all of it when you wake up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
...Do I really have to explain this every time, I wonder?  
And these dreams have unexpected effects sometimes, too...  
It's nothing but trouble, I swear.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You're supposed to forget it all, you know.  
But sometimes it seems like you and the girls who join you  
actually remember quite a bit of it...  
  
**Ameth：**  
It can even have an effect on your actions afterwards.  
Though lucky for me, it hasn't had any serious implications yet.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh, right.  
Sorry, sorry.  
I'm just blathering on to myself here, aren't I?  
  
**Ameth：**  
You'll catch a cold lying around outside forever,  
so it's high time you woke up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh, and I'll say this just to make sure...  
Don't tell Jun anything about our little dream.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'd really rather not have her catch the slightest whiff  
of my existence.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's the captain of that Nightmare guild,  
and I feel like there's something off with them...  
  
**Ameth：**  
To be frank,  
they might even be working directly with our enemy.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Now, I'm sure Jun herself is every bit as upstanding as she seems...  
  
**Ameth：**  
But when you're part of an organization,  
your own morality is often only one small part of the picture.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So do be careful with her.  
I believe Jun told you this herself as well,  
but it's best for both of you if you avoid getting too close.  
  
**Ameth：**  
The friendlier the two of you get,  
the harder it might make things in the long run.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, that's that.  
See you around!  
Until we meet in another dream.  
  

---  
  
**Jun：**  
Mnhh...  
H... Hmm?  
Was I... asleep just now?  
  
**Jun：**  
I feel like I had the strangest dream...  
Urgh... my head is aching terribly.  
  
**Jun：**  
I feel ashamed.  
How could I fall asleep out in the open like this?  
Hmm... Could some strange magic have been at work?  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm?  
Ah, young man...Were you sleeping alongside me just now?  
  
**Jun：**  
What could this mean?  
As I recall, I was on my way home  
when I spotted you in the shadows...  
  
**Jun：**  
I rushed over to take a closer look,  
but that must have been when I fell asleep for some reason.  
  
**Jun：**  
How very unusual.
