## Subtitle: Curious About You
  
**Jun：**  
I'm sorry, young man.  
Did I keep you waiting?  
  
**Jun：**  
I had to send word to Nightmare, my place of work,  
that I would be taking the day off today...  
  
**Jun：**  
But the communication channels were busy,  
so I had to wait my turn to use them.  
  
**Jun：**  
I cannot use magic myself, which is inconvenient at times like this.  
  
**Jun：**  
I have no choice but to find a guild with a communications specialist,  
and fill in paperwork to use their services.  
  
**Jun：**  
It may even have been faster to walk to the palace myself  
and pass on the message in person.  
  
**Jun：**  
It would be rather more convenient  
if there were a tool similar to a camera  
allowing anyone to use communication magic at will...  
  
**Jun：**  
But that would be difficult, both practically and legally.  
Communication magic is quite strictly regulated,  
so the general public can rarely take advantage of it.  
  
**Jun：**  
Such is Her Majesty's will...  
Her policies are quite restrictive when it comes to magic  
that would be of use to the general public.  
  
**Jun：**  
Personally, I would prefer it  
if we could work to enrich the lives of the populace...  
  
**Jun：**  
But I'm sure Her Majesty must have her reasons,  
so I should not voice my personal misgivings.  
  
**Jun：**  
At any rate...  
Thank you for accompanying me all this way, young man.  
  
**Jun：**  
Ordinarily I spend all day standing in front of the palace,  
so I am not too familiar with the rest of the city streets.  
  
**Jun：**  
When I told you I needed to send a quick communication,  
I did not expect to have to walk so far,  
or that I would keep you waiting for so long.  
  
**Jun：**  
I had better head home now and get some proper rest.  
  
**Jun：**  
That's right...  
I am still not fully healed from the injuries I sustained yesterday,  
and I have no pressing work to attend to, so rest is the priority.  
  
**Jun：**  
Thank you again for everything you did to help me.  
I won't forget this debt, young man.  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha...  
You really are the kindest young man I know.  
  
**Jun：**  
Always compassionate and ready to lend a helping hand  
without expecting anything in return.  
  
**Jun：**  
You help others as a matter of course,  
and that is a fine thing indeed.  
  
**Jun：**  
Myself, I have a tendency to overthink things somewhat...  
  
**Jun：**  
So I admire your straightforward character—perhaps even envy it.  
I would like to learn to be more like you.  
  
**Jun：**  
Dear me, I'm talking your ear off, aren't I?  
Somehow I always get carried away when speaking with you.  
  
**Jun：**  
But my ramblings can't be all that entertaining,  
so I should spare you the rest.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I don't think you're boring.  
**Choice: (2)**  You're leaving already?  
`Tag 1`  
**Jun：**  
Haha.  
Whenever I start to become negative,  
you always have encouraging words to offer...  
  
**Jun：**  
That might be your most appealing feature, you know.  
  
**Jun：**  
...Wh-wha...?  
Wh-why are you grabbing my arm?  
  
**Jun：**  
Is there something you wish to say to me, young man?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Jun：**  
Hm...?  
Well... yes, that was my intention.  
  
**Jun：**  
Is there some problem with that?  
I am not very sensitive to these things,  
so please let me know if I do anything to upset you.  
  
**Jun：**  
Is there anything you wish to say to me, young man?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Jun：**  
Hmm?  
It seems a shame to go our separate ways,  
so we should hang out somewhere together?  
  
**Jun：**  
It's getting close to lunchtime,  
so we could at least go out for a meal, you say?  
  
**Jun：**  
I suppose I would not mind that.  
I also feel it is a shame to part so soon.  
  
**Jun：**  
But of you recall, I am injured,  
and the poison has not fully left my system...  
I should not push myself.  
  
**Jun：**  
I would rather avoid walking too great a distance,  
or working myself too hard.  
  
**Jun：**  
Will you join me even so?  
  
**Jun：**  
Good.  
Well then, lead the way, young man.  
  
**Jun：**  
I am not too familiar with this area,  
so you can choose our destination.  
  
**Jun：**  
I would be interested to see the places  
you usually visit for food or entertainment.  
  
**Jun：**  
No, no, I want to know more about you,  
young man.  
  
**Jun：**  
Strictly speaking, I am not supposed to get too close to you...  
  
**Jun：**  
Ordinarily, I obey the orders I am given without question.  
But for some reason when it comes to my orders to stay  
away from you, I feel a compulsion to resist.  
  
**Jun：**  
How very odd. I don't understand it.  
I have never felt anything like this before.  
  
**Jun：**  
Still, it suddenly occurs to me...  
Walking around in this suit of armor, I am bound to attract attention.  
  
**Jun：**  
It would hardly do for it to come to my guildmates' attention  
that I have been going out on the town with a younger man.  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm?  
Then perhaps I should take my armor off first, you say?  
  
**Jun：**  
I could visit a nearby shop,  
and purchase some ordinary clothing to change into?  
  
**Jun：**  
Then nobody would suspect that I am Jun, captain of Nightmare?  
  
**Jun：**  
Well, you are not wrong...  
But as I have said before, I cannot expose my face to others.  
  
**Jun：**  
I have a code to follow.  
My family is not so strict that they would demand my death  
if my face were ever to be exposed...  
  
**Jun：**  
But I have followed this code ever since I was a young girl.  
  
**Jun：**  
The thought of breaking it scares me.  
Besides, showing my face to the world would be so embarrassing.  
  
**Jun：**  
Ahhh! Don't try to remove my helmet!  
You are quite forceful, young man...  
  
**Jun：**  
Are you the type who becomes frustrated  
when things do not go your way?  
  
**Jun：**  
Sheesh...  
You are honest and straightforward, yes,  
but I suppose that also makes you a little childish.  
  
**Jun：**  
Now that you have shown your petulant side,  
it would be unfair for me alone to play the perfect saint.  
  
**Jun：**  
In truth, I have always wanted to act more like an ordinary girl...  
  
**Jun：**  
To be open with my feelings,  
and have fun with someone as my true self.  
  
**Jun：**  
After all, living my whole life separated from the world by walls of iron...  
  
**Jun：**  
Always keeping my distance from others...  
makes me lonely, young man.
