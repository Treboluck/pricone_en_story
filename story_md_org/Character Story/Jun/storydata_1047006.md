## Subtitle: Bashful Captain
  
**Jun：**  
Good morning, young man.  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha...  
I suppose it's a little late to be saying \"good morning\", isn't it?  
  
**Jun：**  
The sun is high in the sky...  
I have my Nightmare duties to attend to today,  
but I'm late as can be.  
  
**Jun：**  
Still...  
Thanks to that good night's rest,  
it seems my body has fully recovered.  
  
**Jun：**  
I do still have a few aches and bruises here and there...  
But I keep my body fit, so I'm sure that will pass soon enough.  
  
**Jun：**  
I appreciate all you have done for me.  
Thank you, young man.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're welcome.  
**Choice: (2)**  Oh, I didn't do anything really.  
`Tag 1`  
**Jun：**  
Yes, I really do appreciate it.  
I'll be sure to thank you properly another time.  
  
**Jun：**  
I've probably said this before,  
but if you ever need anything,  
do feel free to come to me.  
  
**Jun：**  
In case you didn't know, I am a knight by heritage.  
And a knight never lets a favor go unreturned.  
  
**Jun：**  
Yes...  
My family places a lot of stock in its history.  
We even live by a strict family code.  
  
**Jun：**  
It's that family code which requires me to wear  
my armor and helmet at all times.  
  
**Jun：**  
Some might laugh at the notion, or call it old-fashioned.  
  
**Jun：**  
But is upholding one's own code of honor  
not something to be proud of?  
I would like to think it is.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Jun：**  
Haha.  
Please, at least allow me to express my honest gratitude.  
  
**Jun：**  
Even if we are acquaintances of sorts, to carry another  
person to your home unbidden and care for them  
is not something just anyone could do.  
  
**Jun：**  
This world is lacking in chivalry of late.  
Most people are too preoccupied with their own concerns  
to spare a thought for others.  
  
**Jun：**  
They see only what is convenient for them  
and turn a blind eye to all else.  
  
**Jun：**  
So the kindness in your heart is a rare treasure.  
You really are a most noble young man.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Jun：**  
At any rate...  
Young man, do you know where I can find my helmet?  
  
**Jun：**  
You see, when I woke up, it was nowhere to be seen.  
I took off all of my armor in order to sleep,  
and placed it beside my bed...  
  
**Jun：**  
But the helmet alone is missing.  
I feel rather uncomfortable with my head uncovered,  
so please let me know if you have seen it.  
  
**Jun：**  
Hmm?  
It is generally considered bad manners  
to keep one's head covered indoors?  
  
**Jun：**  
That is true enough.  
Right now, I have this mask to conceal my face,  
and it is just the two of us here, so...  
  
**Jun：**  
Well, I suppose there is no great need for it at present.  
  
**Jun：**  
What's that?  
Yesterday, my helmet was dirtied when I collapsed on the street,  
so you washed it and have put it outside to dry?  
  
**Jun：**  
You would have liked to wash my armor too,  
but you didn't want to move the whole thing around  
in case the clattering disturbed my sleep?  
  
**Jun：**  
I see, I see.  
Well, I appreciate your consideration.  
  
**Jun：**  
To tell the truth, I consider my armor and helmet  
almost as personal as underwear...  
  
**Jun：**  
So it embarrasses me to have them washed  
by a young man like yourself.  
  
**Jun：**  
But I understand you meant no harm, so I will not object.  
It is my own fault for being so sensitive.  
  
**Jun：**  
More to the point...  
What exactly are you doing over there?  
  
**Jun：**  
Oh, you are cooking a meal?  
You look a little unsure of yourself...  
Let me take over. I'm accustomed to cooking for myself.

**Jun：**  
Providing a meal is the least I can do  
after all you have done for me.  
  
**Jun：**  
Yes, you should take a seat.  
Today's menu will be...  
Hmm, let's see...  
  
**Jun：**  
What?  
Is there anything you can do to help?  
  
**Jun：**  
I suppose you would be bored just sitting around.  
Shall we cook a meal together then, young man?  
  
**Jun：**  
Yes, you can peel these vegetables for me.  
I'll prepare the meat in the meantime.  
  
**Jun：**  
Haha.  
Working together like this, we seem almost like newlyweds.  
  
**Jun：**  
No, perhaps not.  
I am an adult, and you still little more than a child.  
I suppose \"like mother and son\" would be more appropriate.  
  
**Jun：**  
Forget I said anything.  
For some reason when I am with you, I can't think straight.  
I seem to become strangely self-conscious...

**Jun：**  
You know, due to my appearance, men rarely approach me.  
I fear I am lacking in experience with the opposite sex.  
  
**Jun：**  
I have male comrades in Nightmare, of course,  
but even there I can be somewhat awkward...  
  
**Jun：**  
It seems my hesitance to speak freely  
makes others think I am the strong, silent type.  
Even though in reality, I am just too shy to approach them.  
  
**Jun：**  
Still, this is strange.  
Usually, I would not dream of sharing these worries with anyone.  
  
**Jun：**  
I have a reputation to maintain  
as the dignified and imposing captain of Nightmare...  
  
**Jun：**  
But somehow when I am with you,  
I feel like just an ordinary, easily-embarrassed woman.
