## Subtitle: Together, With You
  
**Narration：**  
Having finished their work for the day,  
{player} and Djeeta make their way through town.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hey, are you free tomorrow?  
If you are, then how does having lunch together sound?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
We still haven't celebrated you joining the crew yet,  
so this seemed like a good opportunity.  
Assuming you're fine with it, of course.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's party.  
`Tag 1`  
**Djeeta：**  
Wahoo! Thanks!  
Guess I'll see you tomorrow, then!  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day—  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hey, hey! Over here!  
You can't even imagine how hungry I am after skipping breakfast.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
I got us a reservation yesterday,  
so let's speed along!  
  
**Woman：**  
Hello, Djeeta!  
I assume he's the new crewmate you were talking about?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hello!  
Yup, that's him. He's super reliable.  
  
**Man：**  
Hey, Djeeta!  
I got your armor all fixed up, so come pick it up tomorrow!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Got it! Thanks, as always!  
  
**Child：**  
Hey!  
It's Djeeta! What're you up to?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hey there!  
I'm on my way to get lunch. With my new crewmate, even!  
  
**Child：**  
Whoa! That sounds cool! I wanna join your crew as well!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Fine taste, my boy. ♪  
You're more than welcome to. Once you're a bit older, of course.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Someone sure is popular.  
`Tag 2`  
**Djeeta：**  
It hasn't been too long since I  
moved to Landosol,  
but everyone here's so nice.  
They've helped me out with all sorts of stuff.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
So yeah, I get along with them all really well.  
If anything, they feel more like family than acquaintances.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
It's not just them, though.  
I'd put you in that same category.  
We're crewmates, after all!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Then again, though.  
Feels like people would see us more as siblings when we're together.  
But which one of us would be the elder one? Hmm...  
  
**Djeeta：**  
I'll be honest, you feel more like the younger one.  
So yeah!  
I'm henceforth your lovely and reliable older sister!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Big Sis.  
`Tag 3`  
**Djeeta：**  
What is it, oh brother of mine?  
Hehe. Just kidding.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Oh! I got caught up in the conversation there,  
but here we are. Come on, in you go!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hello!  
  
**Staff：**  
Welcome!  
Oh, hi Djeeta!  
Your seat's just over there.  
Give me a shout when you're ready to order!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Okay-dokey!  
Where's the menu...  
Ah, here we go. Anything you fancy in particular?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Whatever my lovely and reliable big sister likes most.  
`Tag 4`  
**Djeeta：**  
Hmm... Let's see here—  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hey, wait a minute!  
Was that your way of teasing me, you little rascal?  
Sheesh. Let's stick to normal names, okay?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hehe. Sorry.  
That was just my way of getting back at you. Did I surprise you?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Anyway.  
If you want recs, then this and this are really good here.  
Let's get them first, then decide on the rest. Excuse me!  
  
**Staff：**  
Okay! I'll be right over!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hmm?  
Is there something on my face? You keep staring.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  It's nice to see you're having fun.  
`Tag 5`  
**Djeeta：**  
Is that the impression I gave you?  
Hmm... Well, you're not wrong.  
I'm having a bunch of fun right now.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
I was all on my own up until recently.  
Being able to laugh and joke away with crewmates  
was something I could only fantasize about.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Here we are now, though.  
I've got a precious comrade right in front of me.  
There's no way I wouldn't be happy about that.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
And well, that's the whole point of today.  
I wanted to let you know that.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
From the bottom of my heart. Thank you so much for joining.  
Here's to more fun times ahead of us!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
There's another reason too, you know.  
It's because I'm with you.  
Life's been nothing but fun ever since I met you.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
I really, really hope that stays the same.  
I wanna experience all sorts of new things with you.  
  
**Narration：**  
With those thoughts in mind,  
Djeeta couldn't help but smile at {player}.
