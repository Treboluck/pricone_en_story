## Subtitle: Awakening
  
**Narration：**  
Having caught word of someone looking to employ their services,  
{player} and Djeeta make their way to the business district to find them.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hello!  
We heard that you've got potential work for us?  
  
**Man：**  
Oh! So you're the much rumored skyfarers, huh? Thanks for  
coming.  
Truth is, this store's been getting all sorts of harassment  
from Krook'd & Co. I need you to fend them off once and for all!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Krook'd & Co., huh...  
I've heard the rumors about them expanding their,  
uh, business. And how they go about it.  
  
**Man：**  
Yeah. And now they're trying to take this store and rights to  
the land from me! On a daily basis, no less.  
It's killing my business, I tell you!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
That's awful...  
Okay, don't worry. We'll sort them out.  
  
**???：**  
Well, well. If it isn't the person hogging up my favorite spot  
in town. Will today be the day you finally give in, perhaps?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Who're you?!  
  
**Krook'd：**  
Call me Krook'd, my dear. Of Krook'd & Co.  
Pardon me, but who might you be? Friends of his, possibly?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
I'm Djeeta.  
It's me and my crewmate here's job  
to keep this store out of nefarious hands!  
  
**Krook'd：**  
Oh ho? Hired yourself a crew, I see.  
Lovely. You and I share similar mindsets.  
It's your time to shine, my friends!  
  
**Guild Master：**  
Hey hey hey! Lemme give you a fair warning, my dude.  
Your ass is in for a bruising if you don't pack up shop right now.  
Those two shrimps ain't gonna change that!  
  
**Man：**  
Eek! H-help!  
Krook'd hired that guild to force me out of here!  
Do something about them! I'm begging you!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Okay. You stay back!  
We'll handle this!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Sorry, but this ends today.  
If you want someone to take on, we'll gladly accept!  
  
**Guild Master：**  
You got guts, kid!  
We ain't gonna hold back, though!  
Go earn your keep, boys!  
  
**Subordinates：**  
Woooooooo!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Here they come! Brace yourself!  
  
**Subordinate 1：**  
Hiyahhh!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
You're wide open! Hahh!  
  
**Subordinate 1：**  
Graagh!  
  
**Guild Master：**  
Quit playin' around, you losers!  
They're just kids! Pile on 'em!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Be careful! We're outnumbered by a fair bit!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You as well.  
`Tag 1`  
**Djeeta：**  
I will, thanks!  
We don't want the store getting damaged,  
so let's lead them away from it bit by bit!  
  
**Subordinate 2：**  
Drop dead, kid!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Urgh!  
No thank you!  
  
**Subordinate 2：**  
Gragh!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
*huff, puff* You okay...?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Hanging in there...  
`Tag 2`  
**Djeeta：**  
Good to hear.  
Keep it up. We're almost done...!  
  
**Guild Master：**  
The hell do I keep you lot around for?  
Guess I'll need to sort this mess out myself.  
Hey, you! Forget these losers. Let's have a nice, fair duel!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
A duel...?  
  
**Guild Master：**  
You heard me. We'll keep our hands off this place if you win.  
If you lose, though, then it's ours. Plus you've gotta disband  
that crew of yours.  
Sound good, Mr. Krook'd?  
  
**Krook'd：**  
Hmm... I trust your judgment.  
Do spare me the shame of you losing, though.  
  
**Man：**  
Don't accept it! They'd never fight fair.  
He's obviously got something up his sleeve!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Okay. I accept.  
  
**Man：**  
Why?!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
We don't have a choice. It's either this, or lose the numbers game.  
They've obviously got something planned, but don't worry.  
This is as much of a chance for us as it is for them!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
The odds may be low, but they're worth betting on.  
I guarantee it!  
  
**Guild Master：**  
Heh! Got a good head on your shoulders there, squirt.  
Get over here!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Wish me luck.  
  
**Guild Master：**  
We'll keep it simple. The duel starts when this coin hits the floor.  
You okay with that?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
I am.  
  
**Guild Master：**  
Cool.  
'Cause I ain't!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Wahh!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
He threw the coin at me!  
  
**Guild Master：**  
Down you go!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Urgh!  
  
**Guild Master：**  
Come on, come on! Throw that towel in, baby!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Urgh... I-I'm not throwing anything in!  
  
**Guild Master：**  
You damn poser! I know you're just a skyfarer in name!  
You ain't even got an airship to speak of! It's pathetic!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
No it's not! We don't have one yet, but that'll change!  
One day we'll take to the skies!  
  
**Guild Master：**  
Like hell you will!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Ahh! My sword—!  
  
**Guild Master：**  
You're done for!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Is this it? Is this all I'm capable of?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Sorry...  
I can't keep that promise we made anymore...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You can't give up here!  
`Tag 3`  
**Djeeta：**  
...!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Yeah... You're right!  
There's still so much left for us to do.  
I can't give up here... I'd be a fool to!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
This duel isn't over!  
Not by a long shot!

**Guild Master：**  
The hell?! You trying to blind me now?!

**Djeeta：**  
We're just getting started!  
  
**Guild Master：**  
Huh? Where'd that outfit come from?!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Thank you, {player}.  
I was ready to give in, but your voice gave me the will to go on!  
  
**Guild Master：**  
Whatever. You're still going down!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Think again, buddy! Hah!  
  
**Guild Master：**  
What the?! How'd she manage to counter that?!  
I dunno what happened, but she got real fast all of a sudden!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
And now for the finishing blow!  
Eat this! Flashpoint! Haahhh!  
  
**Guild Master：**  
Graagh!  
  
**Subordinate 1＆Subordinate 2：**  
B-Boss!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Phew...  
This duel's as good as over.  
But hey. If you wanna keep going, then I'll take you down again.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
If not,  
then take him and get lost. For good!  
  
**Subordinate 1＆Subordinate 2：**  
Eeek! Come on, Boss! Get a grip!  
  
**Krook'd：**  
Now you've done it.  
Trust me, I'll remember this!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Phew... Now that was a hairy situa—

`image display end`  
**Djeeta：**  
Huh...? W-what just happened there?  
Oh...  
Krook'd and that guild disappeared, too.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Support her.  
`Tag 4`  
**Djeeta：**  
Oh... Thanks.  
I... I won, didn't I? I remember being close to passing out,  
but everything after that is a blur...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Your clothes and speech changed out of nowhere.  
`Tag 5`  
**Djeeta：**  
Even my speech? Honestly,  
I was so desperate that I didn't even notice...  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Ah, now it's starting to come back to me.  
What in the world was with that power?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
I don't really get it, but one thing's for sure.  
We'd be able to do a lot more if I mastered it.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
That said, I don't even know how I triggered it in the first place.  
If I had to guess, I'd say it had something to do with you.  
Which reminds me. Thanks for calling out to me—it was a big help!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Travelling the world might bring us the answer.  
`Tag 6`  
**Djeeta：**  
Maybe. Actually, no. I'm sure it will!  
We're still a ways off from getting an airship,  
but now we have another goal for when we do!  
  
**Man：**  
Are you okay, Djeeta?!  
Thank you so, so much!  
I honestly don't know how to repay you!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
You really don't need to.  
If anything, I should apologize for coming so close to losing.  
Still though, I'm glad I was able to help in the end!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
It was a close call, but we managed to pull through.  
The more time I spend with you, the more confident I get  
that we'll be able to set to the skies someday.  
  
**Narration：**  
A smile upon her face, Djeeta set her sights on the  
bright future her newfound power could lead her to.
