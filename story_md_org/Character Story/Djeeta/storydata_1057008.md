## Subtitle: A Special Place in My Heart
  
**Narration：**  
Having finished up their last job for the day,  
{player} and Djeeta find themselves on their way back to Landosol.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
We're not that far off from town, but let's take a little break.  
And speaking of town, I kinda wanna do some sparring when we  
get back. Sure wouldn't mind having a partner for that... *glance*  
  
**Djeeta：**  
You wanna join?  
Woo!  
I know you're getting loads stronger, so I gotta keep it up as well!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
You remember that weird power of mine, right?  
I'm calling it \"Class Change\" for now, but that's beside the point.  
Basically, I wanna try all sorts of stuff so I can master it.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
But that's easier said than done. I need to get stronger first.  
So yeah—  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hey... Is it just me, or did it get a lot brighter out of nowhere?  
Did the sun decide it wasn't bright enough or something?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Actually, wait!  
I know what this is!  
It's happened before—!

**Djeeta：**  
Let's see. These stairs are the quickest way to the faculty room...  
Right?

**Djeeta：**  
Woo!  
Now I know my way around school! Impressive, right?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
It's already been a week since I came to Japan,  
so I wanted to make sure I memorized that much.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Oh yeah! I went shopping with Yui and Makoto, then they took me  
to,  
uh,  
what was it? Oh, a coffee shop! ♪  
And also!  
Karaoke! Now that was something else!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I take it you had fun?  
`Tag 1`  
**Djeeta：**  
Absolutely! Tons of fun!  
Oh...  
Ehehe, sorry. I got kind of carried away there,  
didn't I? It really was a lot of fun, though.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Oh yeah, I meant to say.  
Thanks for helping me carry these handouts. It's a big help.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Always willing to help a friend.  
`Tag 2`  
**Djeeta：**  
You really are just the same in real life  
as you are in Astrum, aren't you?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Ah, man.  
It's nice being able to talk with you like this.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Break time always flies by thanks to how fun it is  
talking to everyone in class.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
But truth be told, I've wanted more time to talk with you as well.  
I mean, you're the only one who knows  
what I'm like both here and in Astrum.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
You keep disappearing the second school's over, though.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
There's so much I still don't know about this town,  
so I was hoping you'd show me around...  
Actually, hey!  
How about we do that today?  
Unless you're busy, of course.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'll take you somewhere special.  
`Tag 3`  
**Djeeta：**  
Somewhere special? Really?  
Yay! Now that sounds fun!  
I'll see you after school, then!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hopefully the day flies by... ♪  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Actually, wait.  
Which way was it to the faculty room again?!

**Narration：**  
After school—  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hey! Sorry for the wait!  
Let's get going!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Let's take a little detour first.  
`Tag 4`  
**Djeeta：**  
A detour? Sure!  
What have you got in mind?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Wait, I know where this is.  
It's the same park Yui and Makoto took me to last Sunday, I'm sure.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hey. What's that red truck?  
It wasn't here last time.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Lemme go buy us some crepes.  
`Tag 5`  
**Djeeta：**  
Crepes?  
Ohhh! They're selling them out of that!  
I'll wait here, so you can decide what to get.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Well this is new.  
It's normally me dragging him around,  
but now we've switched roles.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
He seems pretty friendly with the clerk, too.  
Maybe he's a regular here?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hmm... This might actually be the first time I've watched him  
from behind, now that I think about it.  
 Normally we're  
standing beside each other or back to back.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Welcome back. This is... chocolate banana flavor, I assume?  
I'll take that, then.*munch*  
  
**Djeeta：**  
...Hmm, pretty good. But not like,  
super delicious?  
Not bad, either. Just... okay?  
 Yeah, that's it. Regular old okay.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hey, I'm trying here!  
It's just... hard to describe as anything other than that.  
Huh...?  
Don't laugh!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Well. That was \"just\" okay all the way to the end.  
Definitely one of the most... unique crepes I've had.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Oh, it's almost time?  
Yay!  
I won't lie, I've been dying to see this place  
ever since you mentioned it.  
Call me excited!  
  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Oh, wow! I didn't know there was an observation deck here!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Look, the sun's about to set!  
It's so pretty...  
  
**Djeeta：**  
It's not just the location itself, is it?  
It's that and the scenery that make this place special to you.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
That's why we took the little detour through the park, right?  
So we could make it here just in time for this.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Thanks. I'm glad you were willing to show me this.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
It's a slight bit different,  
but the sunset back home was always really pretty as well.  
Sure brings back memories...  
  
**Djeeta：**  
This place really is lovely.  
It'd be nice if I could bring you to my hometown one day.  
Then I'd show you my favorite spot there.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
And hey.  
It'd be worth showing you all the nice spots nearby, too.  
How does that sound?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Pretty great.  
`Tag 6`  
**Djeeta：**  
Right? You know what else would be great? If we could  
explore all around the world, same way we do in Astrum.  
Together, of course!

**Ameth：**  
So, how'd you like that little present?  
Bet it was a nice dream for you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You had a special little place, huh?  
Nothing wrong with that.  
She seemed really happy about it, too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And hey, exploring the world sounds like fun.  
Think you've got what it takes to fulfill that wish, though?  
I'll wish you luck either way.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's enough for today, though. Catch you later. ♪  
  

---  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Mmm...  
Did I... Did I randomly fall asleep again?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Good morning...  
is what I'd say if the sun wasn't ready to set.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
So I had a dream just now. And the scenery in it was really pretty.  
Just as pretty as the sunset right now...  
Actually, no.  
Even prettier. It really was special.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
If the world within our dreams is full of stuff like that,  
then I sure wouldn't mind exploring it.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Ahaha... I shouldn't get ahead of myself,  
should I?  
This world's huge enough as it is.  
Adding more to our plate's  
a recipe for disaster, isn't it? Ehehe.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Well, it is. But that reality isn't enough to put me off.  
There's so much to see in the world. So much to experience.  
I wanna make the most of it, together with you!  
  
**Narration：**  
Djeeta, much like in their dream,  
stared off into the sunset with a brilliant smile on her face.
