**Narration：**  
Djeeta, having gotten work for the crew,  
calls {player} along so he can help out.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hey! Over here!  
We've got another day of fulfilling work ahead of us.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Nothing too hard. Just gotta take this stuff to another town.  
It's kinda far, so ideally they want us there before sunset.  
The two of us should be able carry this much by ourselves, right?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
No guarantee we'll get there without issue,  
but we can work together if anything goes down!  
So yeah, let's get going!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
The weather sure is nice today.  
Guess we don't need to worry about it raining.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hey. Do you mind if I ask you something?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sure, go ahead.  
`Tag 1`  
**Djeeta：**  
Umm... I just wanted to know why you agreed to join my crew.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
It's not like we've got an airship, let alone any other members.  
I kinda got caught up in the moment when I asked,  
so I was sure you'd turn me down.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Ideally I'd like to have the crew approved as an official guild.  
Then we'd get direct funding, not to mention access  
to much bigger, better paying jobs.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
That's not as easy as it sounds, though...  
Like I said, no members. And definitely no airship.  
Which ironically makes it even harder to gather people.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
And yet you still joined, even with all that in mind.  
So yeah, I was just kinda... curious.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
If there's a reason, then I'd like to know.  
But only if it's okay with you.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I want to go where I've never been before.  
`Tag 2`  
**Djeeta：**  
Oh... How come?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I might find some leads on my memories.  
`Tag 3`  
**Djeeta：**  
Wait a minute. What do you mean by that?  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} uses this opportunity to tell Djeeta  
about his amnesia.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Oh. I didn't even realize...  
Thanks for telling me, though.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Don't worry. I'll get us an airship soon enough.  
Then we'll be able to travel all over the world.  
We're bound to find some clues then!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
You're helping me, so it only makes sense to help you as well!  
And hey, it's the captain's job to take care of their crewmates!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  There's more to it.  
`Tag 4`  
**Djeeta：**  
Really? Like wha—  
  
**???：**  
Someone, anyone! Please help!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hmm? Someone just shouted for help there, didn't they?  
Let's go check!  
  
**Merchant：**  
*sigh* You'd think at least one or two people would pass by...  
What am I supposed to do now?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hey there! Is something the matter?  
  
**Merchant：**  
Oh, thank the heavens! Someone finally came!  
I was in the middle of a delivery job, but then monsters jumped me.  
Thankfully I'm fine, but they scared the horses away.  
  
**Merchant：**  
I managed to drive off the monsters,  
but this wagon isn't gonna move on its own.  
I'm really at a los for what to do here,  
heh...  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Oh no, that's awful.  
...  
Hey. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Yup. Let's help him.  
`Tag 5`  
**Djeeta：**  
Great!  
 So yeah. We'll help you out!  
  
**Merchant：**  
Really?!  
Then again, aren't you two in the middle of a job already?  
I'd hate to take up your time...  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Urgh... I mean, you're right.  
But still! I can't just abandon someone in need of help!  
I'll never become a proper skyfarer like that!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Wait right here. I'll head back to Landosol and bring back  
some horses.  
Don't worry, he'll keep you safe in the meantime.  
  
**Merchant：**  
Oh, you're a skyfarer?!  
Never thought I'd meet one on land!  
Thanks, I really appreciate it.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
No problem!  
...  
I'll get back as quick as I can, so take care until then!  
  
**Narration：**  
Some time later,  
Djeeta safely returns from Landosol with the horses.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hey! I got them!  
  
**Merchant：**  
She's back! With the horses, too!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Sorry for the wait!  
Finding some horses that wouldn't flee from monsters  
took some time, but I managed it!  
  
**Merchant：**  
Wow, you sure thought this through!  
Thank you so much! I really owe you one!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
No, it's fine.  
How did things go while I was gone?  
  
**Merchant：**  
Well enough.  
Some monsters appeared,  
but your friend here held the fort.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Well then. That's a relief.  
You've got your horses now, so we'll be on our wa—  
  
**Merchant：**  
Wait a minute. Mind if I ask where you're going?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Uhh, a town close by the mountains.  
We need to make a delivery before sunset.  
  
**Merchant：**  
Perfect.  
I'm passing through there, so hop on.  
I'll get you and your goods there in a jiffy!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Are you sure?  
  
**Merchant：**  
Hey now.  
That's barely any effort compared to what you did for me.  
Come on. Let's get going!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Okay! Thanks a lot!  
Good things really do happen if you help other people out, huh?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Phew. Today was a rough day, wasn't it?  
At least we managed to get the job done in time, though.  
We even helped someone in the process!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
I didn't expect those horses to be so reliable, though.  
They got us  
right through the mountain range, so we barely had to walk.  
Thank goodness it all went well.

**Djeeta：**  
I never told you how special this spot is to me, did I?  
It's super pretty when it gets dark. Especially with all the stars in the sky.  
And they always get me thinking.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
If I had an airship, I'd love to fly towards them.  
I'd love to see just where they take me.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Oh yeah. Remember what we were talking about earlier?  
About the other reason you joined the crew.  
Mind if I ask about that?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I want to help fulfill your dream.  
`Tag 6`  
**Djeeta：**  
Really...?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Thanks! I never would have guessed that.  
You really are super kind, aren't you?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
I feel kind of bad, though.  
It's not like I can do much in return...  
Actually, wait!  
I've got it!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
I'll help you recover your lost memories.  
You'll help me become a skyfarer like my dad.  
That's fair, isn't it?  
  
**Djeeta：**  
And hey. If today's anything to go by, things'll work out.  
You think so too, don't you?  
  
**Narration：**  
{player}, agreeing entirely with Djeeta's proposition,  
gave her a determined nod.
