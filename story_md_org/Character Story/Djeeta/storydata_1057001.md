**Narration：**  
One day in Landosol,  
a certain girl makes preparations to leave town.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
A town by the sea. Now that sounds lovely.  
Excuse me! Is this everything?  
  
**Man：**  
Yup, that's all of it. You sure you'll be okay on your own, though?  
That town's pretty far, not to mention you've got  
the horse and wagon to worry about.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
No problem!  
The horse seemed really docile, so it should be fine.  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Tch! What're you thinkin', hiring a runt like that for the job?!  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
You're gonna regret passing us up, buddy!  
Big-time! Tch!  
  
**Man：**  
Ignore them. They're just salty because you got the job.  
Their fault for trying to force more money out of me.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Ahaha... Thanks. I appreciate it.  
  
**Man：**  
Oh yeah. That guy over there's doing a different job for me,  
but he's going to the same place as you.  
You might as well go together.  
Hey, you! Mind coming over here for a 'sec?  
  
**Man：**  
This gal here's delivering goods to the same town as you.  
How about going together with her?  
Better to be safe than sorry, especially when you're out of town.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Hello! Funny how we're going to the same place, isn't it?  
Umm... I don't mind going together, but it's up to you.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm fine with it.  
`Tag 1`  
**Djeeta：**  
Great!  
I'm Djeeta. Pleasure to meet you!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Oh, so you're delivering a letter?  
Makes sense. You seem pretty nimble, which is perfect should anything happen.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
I have to be honest, though.  
Part of me was worried if I could do this on my own.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
I've done a similar job before,  
but I was pretty much alone the entire time.  
It got pretty lonely without anyone to talk to.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
But hey, you're here today!  
Now I won't need to worry about that, haha.  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
There she is. Hold up, kid!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
You're... those two from earlier, aren't you?  
  
**Ruffian２：**  
Let's make this quick. Hand over everything in that wagon.  
And don't try to pull anything funny, either!  
Come on!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Sorry, but no can do.  
I took this job on, so I have a duty to finish it.  
  
**Ruffian１：**  
The hell? She ain't even scared.  
Whatever. That'll change soon enough. Aight, get her!  
  
**Ruffian２：**  
You're goin' down, ya little runt!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
They only care about me, so you stay back!  
I can handle this on my o—  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Shield her.  
`Tag 2`  
**Ruffian１：**  
We ain't got no beef with you, just that runt over there!  
Outta the way!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Thanks, {player}!  
Don't worry, though. I meant it when I said I can handle this on my own.  
  
**Ruffian１：**  
Damn, she's really steppin' up! Eat steel!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Yah!  
  
**Ruffian１：**  
Gurgh! The hell?! She's fast!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
One down, one to go!  
  
**Ruffian２：**  
Gah! W-what's the deal here?!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
I'd rather not take this any further,  
but that all comes down to you. Give up or get beat up!  
  
**Ruffian１：**  
Tch! Come on, let's bounce!  
  
**Ruffian２：**  
Dammit! We'll get you back for this!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
...Phew. Thanks for that.  
You okay?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Yup.  
`Tag 3`  
**Djeeta：**  
Thank goodness.  
Sorry,  
I got you wrapped up in my business.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
We should get away from here, quick.  
No guaranteeing they won't be back with more people.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Honestly, though.  
First they try to hike up prices,  
then they take it out on me!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
They probably saw me as some kid, but too bad for them.  
I'm no poser when it comes to my dream to become a capable  
skyfarer. Training's part of my daily routine!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Do you know what a skyfarer is, actually?  
  
Basically, we gather up crews and  
explore the world in our airships.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Never heard of skyfarers, huh...  
Figures. I barely see any airships around these days.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Truth be told, my dad's a skyfarer as well.  
Even now, he's off exploring somewhere far from this continent.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
That's my dream. To be a fully-fledged skyfarer like him.  
So I set out to do just that. I even formed my own crew.  
Which I'm the only part of. And I don't even have an airship.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
That's why I'm doing all these jobs.  
Lets me save up money for one, plus it's good training!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
And while I'm at it... You tried to help me earlier, right?  
That got me thinking.  
It'd...It'd be really nice to have crewmates like that.  
I'd have their back, and they'd have mine.  
  
**Djeeta：**  
So yeah! How does joining my crew sound?  
I really, REALLY wanna explore the skies with you!  
Please...!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Join her crew.  
`Tag 4`  
**Djeeta：**  
For real?  
Woo! My first crewmate!  
  
**Djeeta：**  
Oh, sorry. The excitement kinda got me,  
haha.  
Anyway! It's great to have you on board, {player}!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus, spurned on by the allure of adventure,  
{player} became the newest member of Djeeta's crew.
