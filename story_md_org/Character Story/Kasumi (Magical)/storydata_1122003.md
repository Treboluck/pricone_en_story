## Subtitle: Her New Self
  
**Narration：**  
A few days after catching the magical trinket pusher,  
Kasumi is heading somewhere with {player}.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
All right, my dear assistant.  
Let's review the case.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The incident began a few days ago  
when you and I witnessed a strange occurrence.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  A man transformed into a monster.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kasumi：**  
That's right.  
And now we know that the phenomenon was caused by the use of a  
certain magical tool.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
\"Release your hidden power.\"  
That's the promo slogan it's being traded under.  
But it's a mysterious item that, when used, turns humans into monsters.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
In every age, there will be people who seek power.  
But I don't think it's something to be desired to the extent that one is  
willing to look like that.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Following my investigation, we discovered the seller of the magical  
items, and captured him in magnificent fashion.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  So the case is solved.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kasumi：**  
...Right.  
As a detective, I was able to capture the culprit selling dangerous items.  
The great detective Kasumi's job ends here.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
However, my dear assistant...  
Um... Please don't laugh at what I'm about to tell you.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
This time, as Misty★Kasumi...  
the Magical Detective, my heart is kicking up a fuss.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Those magical items that the seller had  
were very dangerous tools.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
With him peddling such things in the city,  
I feel like peace in Landosol is being threatened.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
When I think about that, I'm unable to contain myself.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Despite forbidding myself from transforming in order to remain a  
detective, as a magical girl, I just cannot cage my heart.  
...Funny, isn't it?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I think it's cool.  
`Tag 3`  
**Kasumi：**  
My dear assistant...!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'm wavering between being a detective and a magical girl,  
yet you're still willing to praise such a half-hearted person, are you?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
All right. Thanks to you, I've made up my mind.  
Let's go, my dear assistant. Our destination lies ahead.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
According to the information we coaxed out of the dealer,  
the magical items were originally found here.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Certain fragments that fell inside this cave  
were processed and used to craft those magical items.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Be careful, my dear assistant.  
It's hard to get a good footing here─  
Whoa!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Catch Kasumi.  
`Tag 4`  
**Kasumi：**  
Th-thanks for catching me,  
my faithful assistant.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Th-this is... a bridal carry?!  
Wh-what should I do? I've entrusted my whole body to him!  
I'm not heavy, am I?! Am I?!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Recently, I've been on hiatus from the magical girl business, so I'm  
out of shape. For some reason his arms seem to be shaking!  
Wait... Am *I* the one who's shaking?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ah, um, my dear assistant?  
I'm really grateful you saved me and all, but can you please put me  
down now?  
...I'm ...quite heavy, right?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  You're not heavy at all.  
**Choice: (6)**  You're as light as a feather.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kasumi：**  
R-really? Th-that's good to hear.  
No, I'm not concerned about my  
weight, got it?  
Argh! If you're really an assistant detective, then you  
should be more wary of the subtleties of the heart!  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Kasumi：**  
R-really?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Th-thank goodness...  
B-but he's quite a kind person, so maybe he's  
saying it to make me feel better. Ugh, I want to know his true feelings...!  
I'm a detective, so why am I getting so worked up?!  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Kasumi：**  
Honestly, whenever I'm with you, I always get distracted.  
Of course, in a good way.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But I think... it's about time we braced ourselves.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The feeling I'm getting from this area is awfully similar to the evil  
magic I sensed emanating from those magical tools...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
My dear assistant, I don't know what's going to happen next.  
So make sure you don't leave my side─  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
A monster?!  
Now...?!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Wait, no... This monster—could it be...?!  
A picture is worth a thousand words. Eat this!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It has zero effect...!  
I knew it! This is no normal situation.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
They're coming from different directions?!  
Are all these monsters gathering here?!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Apparently my unpleasant premonition was right on the money.  
It seems that the monsters are being drawn toward the aforementioned  
magical items.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I know I said that in every age, there will be people who seek power,  
but apparently monsters are just the same.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
We're completely surrounded.  
What's more, they're strengthening themselves with the magical items.  
I think we're in a bit of a pinch.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But for some reason, I'm quite calm.  
Humble detective me wouldn't feel this way.  
But inside me now, there's another...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
My dear assistant.  
When we're in a life-and-death situation, you know what we're  
supposed to do, right?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Transform!  
`Tag 8`  
**Kasumi：**  
Bingo!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Misty, Theory, Truly!  
Magical Ribbon: Spiral!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi.  
With a wave of my wand, I'm on the case!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Monsters enslaved by evil power!  
Now that Misty★Kasumi is here,  
know that you no longer have a way out!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
There's no point in resisting!  
Hopeful penetrator of mysteries: Misty Bullet!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!

**Monster：**

**Choice: (9)**  You can do it, Misty★Kasumi!  
`Tag 9`  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Thanks for your support! ☆  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
No, wait!  
That's how I usually respond to children!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
But being cheered on... fills me with energy...!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Hey, monsters!  
I'll sear this into your memories with the power of love and hope!

**Monster：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
There is no case that cannot be solved by  
Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi. ♪  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...I suppose these are the fragments that are used to craft  
the magical items.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
This sensation...  
Could it be an Antibeast after all...?  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Misty Bullet.  
  

---  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
With that, those magical items can no longer be made.  
It seems as though we've preserved the peace in Landosol.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
But apparently,  
Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi isn't going anywhere for a while.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
As long as disaster continues to strike Landosol,  
my role as a magical girl will never end.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
My dear assistant.  
The battle ahead may be long...  
but will you remain by my side?  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Yes, as a detective's assistant.  
**Choice: (11)**  Yes, as a partner to the magical girls.  
`Tag 10`  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
I'm so grateful.  
Of course, detective me hopes for a long partnership.

`Tag 11`  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Thank you.  
With you at my side, I feel like I can do anything.  
  
`Tag 12`  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
For the time being, this case is closed.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Catching the criminal as a detective,  
returning the peace as a magical girl...  
It really has been an eventful few days.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
However... I suppose that  
thanks to this case, I've realized something.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
The part of me dreaming of becoming a great detective,  
and the part of me wanting to protect the peace as a magical girl...  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
They're both me,  
and they can't be separated.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
That's why, as I am now...  
as a detective and a magical girl, I'm going to do my utmost.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Therefore, I really hope you can continue to support that version of me.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
My... dear assistant.  
  
**Narration：**  
Through a series of incidents,  
Kasumi was able to see herself in a new light.
