## Subtitle: Anyone Can Transform
  
**Narration：**  
One day, in a string of peaceful and uneventful days...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Misty, Theory, Truly!  
Magical Ribbon: Spiral!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi.  
With a wave of my wand, I'm on the case!  
  
**Thief：**  
Y-you again?!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Oh dear. Stealing again?  
You don't learn, do you?  
  
**Thief：**  
You won't catch me this time!  
I'm outta here!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Block his path.  
`Tag 1`  
**Thief：**  
What the—?!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Nice work, my dear assistant!  
Misty Wrapping!

**Thief：**  
D-damn you...!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
There is no case that the Magical Detective cannot solve!  
  
**Thief：**  
A-again with the magical detective crap?!  
You're not detective-like at all─  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Ah, but I am.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Because it's my dream.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
And that's the truth.  
  
**Thief：**  
...Tch.  
Just my luck.

**Kasumi：**  
Great assist back there, my dear assistant.  
It seems like...  
w-we're...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I can't believe I was about to say that we're a good match...!  
Argh, he's waiting for the rest of the sentence...!  
Maybe I can get away with saying it plainly...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
A-aaaa-a good─  
  
**Kasumi：**  
?!  
What's... this light?!  
I hope it's not another weird creature falling from the sky─  
  

---  
  
**Kasumi：**  
It's been quite a while since I last came to an amusement park...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
After all, I usually spend my time reading books at home or at school.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Um... {player}?  
What made you choose the amusement park today?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Guess.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kasumi：**  
Oh, so you're challenging me?  
Understood. Please spare me a moment to think...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Why would he invite a female junior from the same school to an  
amusement park? I'll have to recall all the similar situations in the  
books I've read in the past, and conjecture the reason...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Er, the reason to invite a girl to an amusement park...  
according to...  
all works, regardless of time and place... is for...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...a date? Nothing else comes to mind.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
No way, no way! Why would he ask me... out on a date?  
Eh? Wh-what should I do? Why did I come here in my school uniform?!  
I wish I'd put more effort into my outfit...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Time's up.  
`Tag 3`  
**Kasumi：**  
Huh? Ah, hold on a minute!  
I'm not ready to answer, and I'm not mentally prepared... Huh?  
What's this flyer...?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Um... A magical girl show?  
Ah, I've read the light novel before, at the library...  
Oh, they're about to perform it on that stage over there?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I see, I see. So a stuntman friend of yours asked for help,  
and now you're performing as a support actor, right?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
And you thought I'd like it, so you invited me, right?  
I see. I'm following you now. I completely understand.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ugh, I... jumped to the wrong conclusion...!  
I'm still far from being like the detectives in my books...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Um... {player}.  
Thank you for  
inviting me today...  
I really love magical girls... Heheheh.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...It's not like I'm disappointed that this isn't a date.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Okay, let's head to the stage, shall we?  
Even though we're probably a bit too early for the show...  
  
**Woman：**  
Ah! You! You're performing today, right?  
We're in big trouble! It's a major incident!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
What? An incident?!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  What happened?  
`Tag 4`  
**Woman：**  
So the thing is...!  
Argh, I don't know what to do anymore...!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Um, Miss, please calm down.  
Could you tell me the details?  
  
**Woman：**  
Wh-who are you?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I heard the word \"incident\" and interjected thinking it could be a case...  
I can't show {player} that I'm unreliable...!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
If there's an incident,  
maybe I can do something to help.

**Kasumi：**  
H-how did this happen?!  
  
**Host：**  
Everyone!  
The magical girl is here! ♪  
  
**Children：**  
Whaaa!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Ahhh...!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I need to make sense of this...  
Usually when this happens in a mystery novel,  
there's a rundown of events leading up to that point!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Let's see. {player} invited me on a date to an  
amusement park, then an incident suddenly occurred onstage,  
so I, the great detective, stepped in to solve the case!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
No, that's not right!  
The actress playing the magical girl injured her leg and can't perform,  
so I'm now her substitute!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
All because I said I could maybe help...!  
  
**Host：**  
Everyone in the audience!  
Let's wave at our magical girl! ♪  
  
**Children：**  
Hello, Miss Magical Girl!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
U-um...!  
L-let's have a g-great time togever...!  
  
**Host：**  
Oh no, Miss Magical Girl, you're looking a little down.  
Are you nervous? Come on, everyone, let's cheer her up with  
our support! ♪  
  
**Children：**  
You can do it!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
R-right...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
The children in the audience are all watching with twinkles in their eyes...  
I've read the script, and I have a good memory, but...!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
A magical girl... is supposed to transform, and protect peace in the city.  
She's supported by all sorts of people... and is full of love and hope...  
and all that wonderful stuff.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But I'm... not a magical girl.  
I'm always reading books at the library, and I barely speak to other  
people... I'm the exact opposite of a magical girl.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Regardless of whether I change into an outfit like this,  
my heart cannot transform...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'm so sorry, {player}...  
I don't think I can do it!

**Host：**  
Ohhh nooo!  
We have a sudden intruder!  
A big, scaaary monster has climbed onto the stage!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Growr!  
`Tag 5`  
**Children：**  
Eeek! It's so scary!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Huh? That voice... {player}?!  
Is that you inside that costume?!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  No, it's not me.  
`Tag 6`  
**Kasumi：**  
It's not you in there?!  
Ah,  
of course... You're a monster, aren't you?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
U-um, I...!  
I knew it! I can't handle it...!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I'm just not a magical girl...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Transform with me.  
`Tag 7`  
**Kasumi：**  
Wh-what do you...?!  
  
**Host：**  
What's this? It seems like they're having some kind of whispered  
conversation...  
And now the monster suddenly attacks head on!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
He's trying so hard...  
for my sake...?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I... don't want to hurt his feelings!

S-scary monster!  
I'm going to protect the peace in this city!  
  
**Host：**  
Come on!  
Show Miss Magical Girl your support, everyone!  
  
**Children：**  
You can do it!

Yes!  
There's no way I'll lose!

Right back at you...  
Huh? Ehh?!  
{player}?!  
  
**Host：**  
...U-um.  
Mr. Monster fell over...  
  
**Children：**  
...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
H-here's the final blow!  
Hyaaa! Magical Finish!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Gufuh!

Oh! That was a weird sound!  
I hope he's all right...  
  
Jump to tag 11

**Kasumi：**  
...I can't say I've ever heard the sound \"gyafun\" before...

P-... peace has been restored to the city!  
  
**Host：**  
A-amazing! A wonderful victory for Miss Magical Girl!

**Kasumi：**  
Good work today, {player}.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
A lot happened,  
but...  
thank you very much.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Because of you, I... was able to perform right until the end.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
By the way. The only time I ever read magical girl books in school was  
when I took a break from mystery novels for a change of pace.  
But such whimsical themes are actually a bit too... cutesy for me.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But I feel like today...  
I was able to obtain a little bit of whimsy for myself.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
In your opinion, how did I do today?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Was I able to...  
transform into a new me?

**Ameth：**  
Magical Fairy Pretty★Ameth is on the scene. ♪  
  
**Ameth：**  
...What?  
If you have something to say, just say it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Okay, okay, good work today, too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Magical girls, right?  
Obsessed with changing their appearance.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Owing to her being a bit of an introvert,  
perhaps Kasumi's desire to transform is particularly strong.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But she was so cute trying her best  
to act the part of a magical girl.  
I just love the way she posed while fighting her embarrassment.  
  
**Ameth：**  
*sigh*  
I want to transform too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
...Not really.  
I have no particular interest in signature poses and the like.  
  
**Ameth：**  
All right, that's all for today.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Bye bye! ♪  
...  
Signature pose, huh?

**Kasumi：**  
Ngh... Vertigo...?  
No, I completely lost consciousness... Was it a dream?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
I've experienced this phenomenon before...  
Ugh, but when I try to remember it, my memory goes all fuzzy...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Right, where were we?  
I was talking about how well we match...  
  
**Choice: (12)**  How well we match?  
`Tag 12`  
**Kasumi：**  
Wahhh?! Y-you were awake, my dear assistant?  
It's nothing, nothing at all, so just pretend you didn't hear!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Ughh. I'm such a coward.  
It's harder to speak my mind than it is to demonstrate my reasoning...  
  
**Choice: (13)**  I'm curious though.  
`Tag 13`  
**Kasumi：**  
Eh?!  
Why are you only ever assertive at times like this?!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
You're an assistant detective, so you need to ask?  
Wahhh! It's wonderful that you suddenly have such pride as my  
assistant...!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But I'm not mentally prepared...!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
D-don't bring your face so close to mine!  
S-stop, pleeeaaase!

With a wave of my wand, I'm on the case!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
I-I sense a case!  
This definitely isn't me making a getawaaay!  
  
**Narration：**  
Once again, Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi  
spent the day rushing about the sleepy city of Landosol.
