**Thief：**  
Urgh!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Did you see that?  
There's no escaping from this magical detective.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Culprit secured;  
case closed! ☆  
  
**Thief：**  
Dammit... Captured by a cosplay freak...!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...Can you please stop commenting on my outfit?  
It doesn't matter how much I get used to it, it's still a point of  
embarrassment for me.  
  
**Thief：**  
Just what the hell's a magical detective?  
There's nothing detective-like about you at all!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...Eh?

**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...My dear assistant.  
I'd like you to answer me honestly...  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Do you think, perchance, that at this moment... I don't look like a  
detective?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're a splendid magical girl.  
**Choice: (2)**  Look away.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
In other words, I'm not a detective...?  
Oh, right. I can surmise your meaning based on your reaction.  
I-I see...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
You're really not one to lie, are you?  
Don't underestimate my skills of perception.  
Just from your eye movement I can tell what you're thinking.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
This is not good.  
In fact, it's definitely bad...  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
I suppose it's true that I've been relying on my magical powers a little too  
much lately.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
When I capture criminals after transforming into a magical girl,  
for some reason they just confess to everything without any probing.  
I suppose we can say criminals are just receptive to this power.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
In addition, there's the physical abilities—I'm usually bad at manual jobs,  
but like this I can treat any attacking criminal to a Misty Bullet,  
and I can  
restrain a fleeing one with my Misty Wrapping.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
And after a case is successfully closed, I strike my signature pose in  
response to the children's cheers of joy.  
Fanservice is an absolute must.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
I see.  
When I think about it again carefully...  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
This isn't the work of a detective!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Perhaps within a story aimed at children, such a detective may be  
passable.  
But it's a long way from one who solves mysteries using  
knowledge and reason, which I've been striving to become…  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
All right, I've decided!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
I'm going to seal away the magical girl in me!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You what now?  
`Tag 4`  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Th-there's no need for such a despondent expression!  
I said I'm just sealing her away, not giving her up forever.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
It's just,  
I want to reconsider my roots...  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Anyway!  
I hired you as an assistant for me, a detective, in the first place!  
You mustn't forget that!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Come now, my dear assistant, there are cases calling out to us!  
We'd better get a move on!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Having said that,  
it's not like there's a new case around every corner.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But I don't mean it's a bad thing to be at peace.  
They say that a detective can only succeed when they have time on  
their hands.  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But  
I don't know how to quell this wavering feeling in my heart...  
  
**Man：**  
Hey, you!  
You son of a motherless goat!  
  
**Thug：**  
Huh? What did you say?  
  
**Man：**  
The other day, you son of a motherless goat!  
All I did was bump into your shoulder...!  
  
**Thug：**  
What?  
Oh, you're the guy I pushed around a li'l the other day!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
...Oh? Looks like a quarrel.  
Stopping fights isn't really a detective's area of expertise...  
  
**Kasumi：**  
But I *am* a member of Caon,  
so it's not like I can just ignore it.  
  
**Thug：**  
Hah. Lookin' fer payback? Good luck with that!  
I can't believe you came all the way here just to get hurt again!  
  
**Man：**  
Heheheh... We'll see about that.  
  
**Thug：**  
Wh-whatcha sayin'...?  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Hm? That fellow seems a bit strange...!  
My dear assistant, keep your wits about you!  
  
**Man：**  
Feast your eyes on  
my secret power!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
He just put something on his finger...  
A ring?  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Thug：**  
Wh-what the—?!  
H-he transformed... into a monster...?!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
That... isn't normal, now is it?  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Thug：**  
Ah! Aaahhhh!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
This is bad... We have to help him!  
I must transform...  
But...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Intervene.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kasumi：**  
My dear assistant!  
He didn't hesitate at all! He never ceases to amaze...!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
This monster's really strong...!  
At this rate, I won't be able to hold it back...!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Argh, this isn't the time to waver!  
I'm coming to save you, my dear assistant!  
  
**Kasumi：**  
Misty, Theory, Truly!  
Magical Ribbon: Spiral!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi.  
With a wave of my wand, I'm on the case!  
  
**Thug：**  
M-Magical Detective...?  
She's one o' those magical girls who's become the talk o' the town!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi  
will let nobody threaten the peace of this city!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Eat this!  
Hopeful penetrator of mysteries: Misty Bullet!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRUAAUUGHHHH!  
  
**Thug：**  
Wow, she did him in with one shot...!  
Nice one, Misty★Kasumi!  
  
**Man：**  
U-urghhh...!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Hmm... He returned to his original form.  
Just what the devil was all that just now...?  
  
**Thug：**  
This punk! Scared the livin' crap outta me...!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Wait!  
  
**Thug：**  
Y-yes, ma'am!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
This quarrel of yours—it all began with you, did it not?!  
As a magical detective, I cannot let this slide.  
I must insist you reflect on your own actions.  
  
**Thug：**  
...Ugh... I-I'm sorry for everythin'!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Ah, yes... You're so reflective  
that you startled me somewhat.  
  
**Thug：**  
It's not like I get scolded by magical girls on a daily basis!  
If I don't turn over a new leaf now, then when will I?  
  
**Thug：**  
I truly am sorry.  
I'll properly nurse this man back to health myself!  
Thanks fer protectin' me, Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...R-right.  
So I suppose this case is...  
solved?  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
But I'm still curious about that man and how  
he transformed into a monster... as well as that strange ring of his.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  That's good, then.  
`Tag 6`  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...No, it's not.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
I mean, it's a good thing that nobody got hurt, obviously.  
But after all, I transformed, didn't I? No sooner than I'd promised not to,  
I went and did it without even thinking!  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
And that's all because  
you, my dear assistant, are foolhardy!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  ...I'm sorry.  
`Tag 7`  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Honestly, what am I going to do with you?  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
...  
But, well, I suppose  
I don't necessarily regret transforming.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Because I did it to protect you.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
If I hadn't transformed, and you were hurt as a result,  
*that* would have been regretful.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
That's why, well...  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
What you did was right.  
But I'd be happy  
if you didn't make me worry so much about you.  
  
**Misty★Kasumi：**  
Because you're Magical Detective Misty★Kasumi's  
precious partner, you know.  
  
**Narration：**  
Despite being scolded by Kasumi,  
{player} could sense both her concern for him,  
and a solid feeling of trust.
