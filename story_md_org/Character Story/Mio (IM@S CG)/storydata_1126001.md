**Narration：**  
A little while before the \"New Generations\" girls  
had their fateful encounter with {player}...  
  
**Mio：**  
Hey, hey, Shimamu! For tonight's dinner, is there anything you're hankering for?  
Your personal chef Mio is open for requests! ☆  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Tonight's dinner, huh? Well, let's see...  
Oh—  
I had fish yesterday,  
 so meat would be nice!  
  
**Mio：**  
Ooh! A perfect request for meat bargain day!  
Then I'll go all out and prepare the meatiest of feasts!  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Eheheh, I can't wait to taste your cooking! ♪  
Well then, I should get going!  
  
**Mio：**  
'Kay! See you this evening!  
  
**Mio：**  
Now then! First I'll take care of the cleaning and laundry.  
Then I'll check the budget.  
 Let's get stuff done!  
  
**Mio：**  
These are last week's expenses, and our last job paid...  
Urk. Not good! We're barely breaking even!  
  
**Mio：**  
We need money, but we can't really take on any more work...  
Gotta think of a way to reduce our spending...  
  
**Mio：**  
...Meat isn't the only thing on sale today, right?  
Okay! Let's stock up while we have the chance!  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Oh—Mio! Good to see ya!  
We've got a bunch of bargains, so it's a good day to buy!  
  
**Mio：**  
Really?  
 Lucky me!  
We're kinda strapped for cash this month, so that really helps! ☆  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Weren't you saying the same thing last month?  
Not splurging a bit much, are you?  
  
**Mio：**  
Oh, please! No chance of that while I'm handling the budget!  
We just had a little unexpected expense last month, that's all!  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Haha, OK, if you say so.  
So? What'll you be buying today?  
  
**Mio：**  
Lessee. Three servings of the meat that's on sale,  
and some chicken bones for soup!  
Oh, and some milk, tea leaves, and veggies from here to here!  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Here you go. Always a pleasure!  
  
**Mio：**  
...Huh? I don't think I asked for this many veggies...  
  
**Store Owner：**  
The extra's on the house.  
If your budget's tight, this is the least I can do.  
  
**Mio：**  
Aw, man...!  
If you threw in some fruit on top, I'd be over the moon, you know!  
  
**Store Owner：**  
...Gahhh, what a charmer!  
Oh, all right, you win this time! Here, you can have this too!  
  
**Mio：**  
Wahey! Thanks a bunch, gramps!  
When we've got a bit more cash, I'll come buy a ton to repay you! ☆  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Yes, yes. I'll look forward to it without holding my breath.  
  
**Mio：**  
Phew... This should really help for this month!  
And I won't even have to backpedal on Shimamu's request! ♪  
  
**Wife：**  
It's always excuses, excuses, excuses with you!  
  
**Mio：**  
Whoa! What's all this?!  
  
**Husband：**  
Ah, shaddup! I'm sick to death of your petty complaints!  
  
**Wife：**  
Thanks to your dawdling, today's sale item is sold clean out!  
You've been like this since the day we married!  
  
**Husband：**  
Then why didn't ya say something sooner?!  
You always start bellyaching when it's far too late—  
  
**Mio：**  
Whoa—hold it, hold it!  
No need to say anything you'll regret!  
  
**Married Couple：**  
Mio?!  
  
**Mio：**  
You'll bother the other customers, fighting right outside the store!  
Now why don't both of you calm down, 'kay?  
  
**Wife：**  
...Now listen, Mio.  
It's not just about today's sale. This idiot is always—  
  
**Mio：**  
Nothing for it... Look, I'll give you the one I bought!  
Heck, go ahead and take all three of our portions!  
  
**Husband：**  
W-wait, but...  
  
**Mio：**  
There. That settles this. No more fighting!  
I want to see the two of you get along!  
 Well then, bye-bye! ☆  
  
**Wife：**  
But we can't accept— Ahhh, she's gone...  
  
**Store Owner：**  
You're a lucky pair, having a good kid like Mio on your side.  
If it weren't for her, who knows what a scene you'd have caused?  
  
**Wife：**  
Oh dear... Making a sweet youngster like her take pity on us...  
I'm a little ashamed of myself.  
  
**Husband：**  
There's no arguing with Mio...  
She's like the poster girl of this district, brightening all our days.  
  
**Store Owner：**  
Haha, you're so old-fashioned.  
Nobody says \"poster girl\" nowadays—they're called \"idols\"!  
  
**Wife：**  
Ah... That does feel like the right word.  
If Mio ever became a real idol, that'd be a sight to see!  
  
**Mio：**  
Aaaaghhh... What have I done?!  
  
**Mio：**  
I acted on the spur of the moment, but now what about dinner?!  
A pile of veggies and soup with no main dish?!  
That's the saddest feast ever!  
  
**Mio：**  
Could I stop by another shop for meat?  
 ...N-no, I mustn't!  
If we stretch our budget any more this month, it'll snap!  
There's gotta be another solution...  
  
**Mio：**  
...Ahhh!  
 This is it!

**Mio：**  
Now! You guys must be pretty hungry, right?  
Feast your eyes and mouths on this Mio dinner special! ☆  
  
**Rin：**  
...Um, Mio...  
Doesn't this meat look... purple? Is it just me?  
  
**Mio：**  
Oh... well... Th-that's right!  
 It's spices! That's the spices showing!  
Probably 'cause I tossed in a whole bunch! Silly me! ☆  
  
**Uzuki：**  
Also, does the meat seem weirdly squishy to anyone?  
It almost feels more like slime than animal meat...  
  
**Mio：**  
T-totally your imagination!  
I bet that's just 'cause it's so fresh and juicy!  
  
**Mio：**  
C'mon, what's gotten into you two?  
I made sure to taste it, so I can guarantee it's good!  
  
**Rin：**  
Um, this isn't exactly about the flavor...  
Did you buy this meat from a normal shop?  
  
![112600102.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/112600102.webp)  
**Mio：**  
Urk...!  
  
**Rin：**  
I'm sure I'd remember if I'd seen meat like this on sale.  
You went to the usual place, right?  
  
**Uzuki：**  
That's just it.  
The veggies and fruits are just like always,  
so why's the meat so strange...?  
  
**Mio：**  
Ahhh! Ahhhh! Better dig in before the food gets cold!  
Well then, don't mind if I do!  
  
**Narration：**  
Though its appearance was a little offputting,  
nobody could fault the flavor of Mio's impromptu monster dish,  
and it wasn't long before it became a regular fixture on their menu.
