**Narration：**  
Once done eating, Hiyori and {player}  
head off to take part in the New Year's sales  
and work off all the calories.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Do you mind if we check out that store, Mr. Knight?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
There's something I really, *really* wanna get there!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
This should be the place.  
  
**Staff：**  
Beloved customers! Landosol's largest store is back at it again! We've  
prepared a grab bag with a luxurious prize, and you better believe it'll  
put us in the red!  
But who has the mettle to win?! Come test your luck!  
  
**Staff：**  
The wheel of fortune is yours to spin! But only the blessed will win!  
What will be your fate? The audience can't wait!  
So come one, come all! Show us your potential!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Did you hear that?  
They only do this once a year,  
but you get a *super* expensive prize for cheap if you win!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
And just like they said, it's all down to luck!  
You need to spin and win to get the right to buy it!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I keep hearing about how low the odds are,  
so I've always been curious about giving it a shot. ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I want to try it as well.  
`Tag 1`  
**Hiyori：**  
Really?  
Then let's see if we've got any New Year's luck together. Time to spin!  
  
**Staff：**  
Welcome, welcome! Please step in line!  
Who knows? You might just have a lucky spot!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ehehe. Hopefully that's the case!  
I'm so excited!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Haaah! Gimme the goods, baby!  
  
**Staff：**  
Too bad, my friend.  
You do get complimentary tissues, though.  
  
**Man 1：**  
Dammit.  
Next year for sure!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I kind of expected it, but the odds really are low.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
But also, that's a good thing for us!  
I can't let the odds get to me,  
either.  
I'm in it to win it!  
  
**Man 2：**  
My turn! Let's gooo!  
  
**Staff：**  
Aaand nope!  
  
**Man 3：**  
Come on! Get in there!  
  
**Staff：**  
Not this time!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Urgh... I'm losing all confidence here.  
  
**Staff：**  
It's your turn, young lady!  
Show us what you've got! Give it a good spin!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Okay!  
Power me up, Mr. Knight!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Thanks!  
Feels like my luck's through the roof now!  
  
**Staff：**  
Wow! This might just be it, folks!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I'm gonna win! For sure!  
  
**Man 1：**  
She's popping off!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Sure is!  
This might just be the one!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Come on! Let's goooooo!  
  
**Staff：**  
Ohhhhhh! C-could it be?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ahh... Ahhhhhh!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Did she do it?!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Do we finally have a winner?!  
  
**Staff：**  
Close, but no cigar!  
Here's your tissues!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Urgh... So much for that.  
Sorry, Mr. Knight. I made your power-up go to waste...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It's too early to give in.  
`Tag 2`  
**Hiyori：**  
Yeah... You're right.  
It'll be back next year,  
so I'll definitely win then! For sure!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
But next up is your turn!  
  
**Man 2：**  
He's got a lot less vigor than her.  
Think he'll manage it?  
  
**Man 1：**  
Doesn't seem like he's even interested.  
I bet he just lined up for the hell of it.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Mr. Knight! Spin it real good!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Spin it.  
`Tag 3`  
**Man 3：**  
Oh. There it is.  
  
**Staff：**  
Oh...  
  
**Staff：**  
Oh...  
Oh my gosh, folks! The mad lad did it!  
Here's your coupon for the prize!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
What?! For real?!  
That's amazing!  
You did it, Mr. Knight! You won!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Well that was a bit of a letdown.  
  
**Man 2：**  
I figured someone with a bit more zest would've pulled it off.  
  
**Man 3：**  
Nah, man.  
This is the power of a calm, pure mind.  
  
**Man 1：**  
Fair enough.  
It probably takes a will of steel to stay composed  
knowing you might just get a super luxurious prize.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Yup!  
He was the same as ever!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Sorry for saying all that, man.  
If anyone deserved to win, it was you! Congrats!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Congratulations!  
Come on, let's go exchange that coupon for the grab bag!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  ...  
`Tag 4`  
**Hiyori：**  
Hm? What's wrong?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I... don't have enough for it.  
`Tag 5`  
**Hiyori：**  
Huh?!  
  
**Participants：**  
You WHAT?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
We worked together on New Year's Eve, right?  
What happened to the money from that?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Well...  
**Choice: (7)**  I gave it to Kokkoro...  
`Tag 6`  
**Hiyori：**  
You gave most of it to Kokkoro, huh?  
And then you spent the rest on the food we ate earlier...  
  
Jump to tag 8  
`Tag 7`  
**Hiyori：**  
How much? More than half of it?  
Wait. Almost *all* of it?  
So what you spent today was pretty much all that was left...  
  
`Tag 8`  
**Hiyori：**  
Well...  
That's a good thing, at least.  
You got to repay her for everything she's done for you.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey, Mr. Knight. I'll cover for what you don't have, so go buy it.  
The fact that we came together can be seen as good fortune,  
right?  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} accepts Hiyori's money and enters the store,  
returning with the grab bag not long after.  
  
**Participants：**  
Congratulations!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Look, look! Everyone's celebrating!  
Man, that must feel nice. I gotta try harder next year.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Give Hiyori the grab bag.  
`Tag 9`  
**Hiyori：**  
Huh? What're you doing?  
Wait. Y-you're giving it to me? But why?  
  
**Choice: (10)**  As thanks for lending me the money.  
`Tag 10`  
**Hiyori：**  
You're the one that won it, though.  
That, plus I...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...Were you planning on giving it to me from the very start?  
  
**Choice: (11)**  Good fortune, from me to you.  
`Tag 11`

**Hiyori：**  
...!  
Mr. Knight!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Thanks so much! I love you! For real!  
There's no one luckier than me today!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Don't ever leave me, okay?  
Promise!  
Ehehe!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Damn. He was gonna give it to his girlfriend all along, huh?  
  
**Man 2：**  
Talk about the power of love.  
Way to show off, buddy!  
  
![108700202.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/108700202.webp)  
**Hiyori：**  
Huh?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh!  
No! You've got it all wrong!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I'm not his girlfriend! Really!  
There's nothing like that between us!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Yeah yeah, we hear you.  
Treat that cutie right, brother!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I swear! It's not like that!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Don't worry, we get it.  
Thanks for kicking off the new year with some good memories!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
You don't get it!  
You don't get it at all!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I mean, he's already got Yui...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Don't just stand there! Say something!  
  
**Choice: (12)**  Dunno what's going on, but it seems fine.  
`Tag 12`  
**Hiyori：**  
You as well?!  
Come on! It's anything but fine!  
  
**Narration：**  
Some say that Hiyori's desperate attempts to explain the  
situation still resound throughout Landosol to this day.
