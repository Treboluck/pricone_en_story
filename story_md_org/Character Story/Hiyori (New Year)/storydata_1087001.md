**Narration：**  
The business district is bustling due to New Year's sales.  
In the midst of all that, Hiyori bumps into {player}.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh hey,  
it's Mr. Knight!  
What's up?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  My body desires sustenance.  
`Tag 1`  
**Hiyori：**  
Same here, funnily enough!  
My tummy's been rumbling all day!  
That kind of makes me sound like Peco, doesn't it? Ahaha.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
You know how we all went to see the first sunrise of the year, right?  
After that I was helping out with the Menagerie's New Year's party  
right up until yesterday.  
Talk about being busy!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
And today we had to do all the cleanup,  
so I still haven't had a bite to eat yet.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I didn't think I'd bump into you today though,  
so this is a nice surprise. ♪  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Errr...  
I assume your tummy was responsible for that?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
You must be starving!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Um...  
Sorry. That was me. Ehehe...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh! How about we grab some food together, then?  
There's so much good-smelling stuff around here that  
I can't hold back anymore!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Will you show me around?  
`Tag 2`  
**Hiyori：**  
Of course!  
Let's get rolling!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
The question is what do we start with?  
Is there anything you fancy?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Something over there smells sweet.  
**Choice: (4)**  There's an enticing fragrance coming from over there.  
`Tag 3`  
**Hiyori：**  
*sniff, sniff* Wow! I can smell dangos and shiruko!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Hiyori：**  
Mmm! Nothing stirs the appetite quite like the smell of mochi being baked!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Hiyori：**  
Phew!  
The smell alone's making me feel full!  
Wild!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey, Mr. Knight!  
Let's just eat anything and everything we want!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh man... There's even yakisoba and takoyaki!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Whoa! The stall over there's selling chocolate bananas and cotton candy!  
Enough talk! Let's get down to business!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Excuse me!  
One box of takoyaki, please!  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Sure thing! Oh, if it isn't Hiyori!  
I hear you took care of my daughter the other day. Thanks for that!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
No problem!  
I scratch your back, you scratch mine and all that!  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Really appreciate it.  
By the way, you sure you only want one box?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
There's no way I can eat that much!  
Oh, wait.  
I need to get Mr. Knight's share as well!  
One more box, please!  
  
**Shopkeeper：**  
Got it! Thanks a bunch!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Sorry for the wait! Here's your takoyaki!  
Anything else you wanna eat?  
  
**Shop Clerk 1：**  
Hiyori!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
That's my name!  
Oh! It's the lady from the taiyaki stall!  
  
**Shop Clerk 1：**  
Thanks for helping me carry all that stuff the other day!  
Here's some taiyaki as thanks. On me, of course!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Wow! Thank you so much!  
  
**Shop Clerk 2：**  
Hey there, Hiyori.  
Fancy some grilled squid? Feel free to take it!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I do!  
Are you sure, though?  
  
**Shop Clerk 2：**  
Sure as can be!  
You helped me out a bunch last year, so it's only fair I pay you back!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Well then.  
Guess I'll take you up on that offer!  
  
**Shop Clerk：**  
Hiyori! Take this as well!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Thanks!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh man!  
They gave me so much!  
I can't hold all this by myself,  
so let's eat it together!  
  

---  
  
**Hiyori：**  
We should be able to eat while we walk if we split it!  
So take this, this and this!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
There we go. Good thing you were here with me!  
I'd never have been able to eat all this on my own!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh... This is bad. Both of our hands are full.  
Now the both of us can't eat. Ahaha...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Then I'll feed it to you.  
`Tag 6`  
**Hiyori：**  
Thanks! I'll do the same for you!  
Perfect! We can both feed each other!  
Open wide and say \"ahh!\"  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Open wide and say \"ahh!\"  
`Tag 7`  
**Hiyori：**  
Ahh!  
*munch, munch*  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Mmm! Hehe! Now that's delicious!  
How's yours?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Delish!  
`Tag 8`  
**Hiyori：**  
Great! Want another bite?  
Then open wide for me again.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
...All the people I helped last year ended up repaying me.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I don't expect anything in return when I help people out, but well,  
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't really happy.  
It makes me wanna bring smiles to even more faces this year!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
And first up is you, Mr. Knight! What do you wanna eat next?  
A caramel apple? Grilled squid? Come on, feel free to pick!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus the two of them enjoyed the  
plentiful amount of food they had been given.
