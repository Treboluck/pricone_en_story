With an intense day behind them, Hiyori and  
{player} return to the guildhouse to rest their exhausted bodies.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Phew... I sure am beat.  
Glad we can finally get some rest.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
The day's pretty much almost over, too.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Huh?  
It's kinda bright in spite of that.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Wait, what's going on?!  
It's so bright, but I'm... getting so... sleepy...

**Hiyori：**  
Oh. There's something stuck to my kimono.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
A fortune slip?  
Did someone throw it away?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh geez. First time I've seen a slip with bad luck.  
Can't even imagine who could have pulled this.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Let's see here... \"Your desires won't come to fruition.\"  
\"No splendid encounters await you.\"  
A-ahaha...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hey Hiyori. Did a fortune slip come flying this way?  
**Choice: (2)**  Hey Hiyori. Happy New Year.  
`Tag 1`

**Hiyori：**  
Oh! Hey there!  
I did just pick one up there.

**Hiyori：**  
Oh, hey!  
Happy New Year!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Hiyori：**  
Guess what? I picked up a fortune slip with bad luck on it just there.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Thanks. I was looking for it.  
`Tag 4`  
**Hiyori：**  
Wait, this is yours?!  
Which means you just finished up your first shrine visit of the year...  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Well then. Sorry, I shouldn't have looked at it without permission.  
Don't worry, though! It'll be fine if you tie it up at the shrine!

**Hiyori：**  
Look! I got great luck!  
And great luck means lots of great things to come!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ehehe! ♪ Cool, right?  
And hey. I got to see you this early into the year.  
It's already paying dividends!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I went with my friends from school today.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
We all got dressed up nice and fancy, so it was super fun!  
We also got sweets from the stalls there,  
plus we took pictures and stuff.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
And also...

**Hiyori：**  
Hey. I... actually have something I want to get off my chest.  
Would you mind taking some time to hear me out?  
I'd really appreciate it.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'm all ears.  
`Tag 5`  
**Hiyori：**  
You're as kind as always, aren't you?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Well, um. One of my friends from class has a person she likes, you see.  
And she asked me to cheer her on.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Thing is, another friend in one of my clubs also likes that person.  
And well... She also asked me to cheer her on.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
The boy they both like was with us today, too.  
It got real tense at times, and dealing with that was exhausting.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
But they're both my friends, you know?  
So now I'm stuck deciding if I should cheer just one,  
or tell the both of them that I won't get involved.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
But the more I think about it, the more confused I get.  
You know that fortune slip I pulled? It's so bad that  
I wasn't even happy about that, if I'm being honest.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Just cheer both of them on.  
`Tag 6`  
**Hiyori：**  
Both of them?!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Won't one of them just end up feeling hurt if I do that, though?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  It might end up being both of them.  
`Tag 7`  
**Hiyori：**  
O-oh. That's true.  
They could both get turned down.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
What should I do, then?  
I really don't have it in me to just leave them be.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Tell me. Is there *anything* I can do?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Just be by their side when they need it most.  
`Tag 8`  
**Hiyori：**  
Be by their side? Really?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Isn't that enough?  
`Tag 9`  
**Hiyori：**  
Yeah... You're right.  
The fact that you're hearing me out right now is already a big help.  
Thanks a lot.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I never thought about it that way before, but it makes sense.  
You don't need to do anything super special.  
Just staying by the people you want to support is enough!

**Hiyori：**  
Thanks so much!  
Now I know how to approach this!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
If anything happens, I'll make sure to stay by their side!  
I'll hear them out, just like you did for me today!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Cheering people on and pushing them along is good,  
but they're not the only ways to help out!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Ehehe. Thanks so much. I feel a lot better now.Really!  
You're gonna go tie that fortune slip up, aren't you?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
You better hurry, otherwise all the bad luck'll come your way!  
Just kidding! But take care! See ya!

**Hiyori：**  
Oh. I forgot to ask something else important.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey. What if I want to cheer myself on?  
What should I do then?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
I dunno why, but I start to get all nervous and fiddly  
around you these days. It's such a... weird feeling.  
I just don't understand it...

`image display end`  
**Ameth：**  
Welcome back.  
Did you have a nice dream?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Good to see that Hiyori cheered up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's still a child, all things considered.  
She'll grow, develop and change,  
even without anyone else's help.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But you're probably the only one that can lead her in the direction  
that she'll feel satisfied with.  
That's a pretty important role, you know.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And also. You talked the talk,  
so make sure you stick by her if she's ever feeling hurt.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's something that you, and only you can do.  
...  
Don't forget that.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway. Catch you later.

**Hiyori：**  
Mmm...  
Huh. When did I fall asleep?  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Oh. It wasn't just me.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey, Mr. Knight.  
Thanks.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
What for?  
Nothing!  
Hee hee!  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Well. Truth is, you appeared in the dream I had.  
You told me to stick by the people I want to cheer on.  
Or I think you did, at least.  
  
**Hiyori：**  
Hey.  
Guess who's by your side right here, right now?  
Ehehe.  
  
**Narration：**  
Saying that, Hiyori sat down next to {player},  
refusing to leave his side for quite some time.
