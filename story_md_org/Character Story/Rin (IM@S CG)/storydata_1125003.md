During their stay at the village, Rin is challenged to a duel.

Following her endeavors, she is praised by one and all as the Violet Idol Fencer.
  
## Subtitle: Iolite Blue!
  
**Narration：**  
{player} and friends are staying at a village  
while the \"New Generations\" girls work hard at their lessons.  
This morning, {player} is helping Rin train, when...  
  
**Rin：**  
Hm? What's happening over there?  
It's rare to see such a crowd this early.  
  
**Woman：**  
\"Rin\"... That's the idol girl, right? What should we do?  
  
**Man：**  
I mean, at this rate, the village is in big trouble...!  
  
**Rin：**  
...Hey. What's going on?  
It sounds like this involves me somehow.  
  
**Woman：**  
Oh, it's too awful! This note was pinned to the noticeboard...  
  
**Note：**  
I hereby challenge Rin the Violet Fencer to a duel.  
If you don't show up, calamity will befall this village.  
  
**Note：**  
Don't you dare bring anyone else. Come alone.  
Make sure you're ready at the following time and place...  
  
**Rin：**  
A challenge for me, huh.  
Given what's written here, I suppose I can't refuse.  
  
**Man：**  
Wait, wait—you can't actually go alone!  
Any fool can see this is a trap!  
  
**Rin：**  
Well, yes, obviously.  
But if I don't show up, who knows what might happen to the village?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's too dangerous. I'm coming too.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rin：**  
Thank you.  
 But it'll spell trouble if you're spotted, so I'll go alone.  
There's a map on the note, so I'll take it along with me.  
  
**Rin：**  
Everyone else, just in case something happens,  
try to stay safe indoors and keep your doors locked.  
 Got that?  
  
**Man：**  
S-sure. All right.  
But are you sure you can handle this alone...?  
  
**Rin：**  
Don't worry. I'll be fine.  
 I'm a fair bit stronger than I look.  
I'll work things out somehow.  
  
**Rin：**  
{player}, if Uzuki or Mio ask you about where I am,  
tell them I'm doing some solo lessons.  
Well then, I'd better go.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh—there you are!  
 Geez, did you go wandering off again?  
I've told you enough times to stay put. Honestly!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're helping out with lessons today, remember?  
C'mon, hurry and come with me.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I've gotta help Rin. Come with me.  
`Tag 2`  
**Karyl：**  
Uh, say what now? What're you talking about?  
...Hey! Don't just pull my arm like that! Where are you taking me?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
...And you're sure this is the right place?  
We did check with the villagers,  
but it'd be bad if it turns out to be wrong! Ugh, I'm so nervous...  
  
**Rin：**  
I've come to accept your challenge! Now, show yourself!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ah! She's here!  
...Hey, don't stick your head out! Keep yourself hidden properly!  
  
**Bandit Leader：**  
Huh, so you really came alone.  
Maybe you're just that confident, or maybe you're an idiot.  
  
**Rin：**  
You're... that bandit!  
...Weren't you still supposed to be paying for your crimes?  
  
**Bandit Leader：**  
I've got more friends than you know.  
And they helped me bust out of jail, see?  
So now I'm here to settle old scores with you.  
  
**Rin：**  
...Guess you haven't learned your lesson.  
Well, I'll just escort you to Nightmare a second time.  
  
**Bandit Leader：**  
It ain't gonna be that easy this time!  
I've brought a secret weapon, see? *gulp*... *gulp*...  
  
**Bandit Leader：**  
G... gghh... aaaagghhhh...!  
 Rrraaghhhhh!  
  
**Rin：**  
...?! He's fast!  
 ...Ngh!  
  
**Bandit Leader：**  
Tch... You can guard even that?  
 Still, it won't happen again!  
  
**Rin：**  
What did you just drink?!  
The speed you're moving at... A human body can't take it!  
  
**Bandit Leader：**  
Heh... Heheh... It's an extra-special drug...!  
Long as I can kick your ass, I don't care what happens to me!  
  
**Bandit Leader：**  
Take this, and this, and this, and this!  
  
**Rin：**  
Nng... ghh... Aaaahhhhh!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wh-what now?! This doesn't look good for her!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'll power her up!  
`Tag 3`  
**Rin：**  
...! This energy... Could it be...?  
  
**Bandit Leader：**  
Th-the heck? What's this aura...?!  
  
**Rin：**  
I can't let this drag on too much longer.  
I'll settle it in one strike!  
  
**Rin：**  
Gleaming iolite... Lend me your glow to purge the world of darkness!  
Taste my Blade of Violet! Iolite Blue!  
  
**Bandit Leader：**  
Ggguaaaaarghhhhhhh!  
  
**Rin：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
 That's the end of that.  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Hold it. This ain't over just yet.  
  
**Girl：**  
H-help me...!  
  
**Rin：**  
Wha...?!  
 What's going on here?!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Whaddaya think? A little insurance in case you beat our boss.  
If you fight back, this girl's life is over!  
  
**Rin：**  
Cowards!  
Didn't you say you'd leave the villagers alone?!  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Idiot. We never wrote what'd happen if you did show up!  
Now—toss your blade aside!

**Rin：**  
...There. Will this do?  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Hah. Sticking it in the ground? What a show-off.  
Well then, let's see you walk slowly—  
  
**Rin：**  
O Blade... Become as violet chains to chasten the guilty!  
Bind him! Hauyne Judgement!

**Bandit 1：**  
Whaaa?! D-dammit! What's all this?!  
  
**Bandit 2：**  
Tch... I can't move...! Damn this girl! Men, kill the hostage!

**Rin：**  
This many of them were hiding?!  
 Look out!  
  
**Bandit 3：**  
Take this!  
  
**Girl：**  
Nooooooooo!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Lightning Sphere!  
  
**Bandit 3：**  
Awawawawawah?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You creeps are such losers!  
How's it feel to have your hostage plan fall through?!  
  
**Bandit 1：**  
Ugh... The hussy even brought friends, did she?!  
  
**Rin：**  
Are you in any position to be judging me?  
I'll happily take you all on myself!  
  
**Bandit Leader：**  
D-dammitall...  
  
**Rin：**  
Whew...  
 You really saved me there. Thank you.  
I didn't think you'd follow me all the way here.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Geez. You shouldn't charge in alone against brutes like that.  
Though I'm impressed you kicked all their butts regardless.  
  
**Girl：**  
E-excuse me!  
 Thank you so much for saving me from them!  
You're... that idol who performed in the village, aren't you?  
You were incredibly cool just now!  
  
**Rin：**  
Haha... Thank you.  
I'll try to work hard to make sure you enjoy our performance too.  
  
**Girl：**  
Oh, no! I'm certain that as Rin the Violet Idol Fencer,  
you'll become the greatest of all idols! I'll be cheering for you!  
  
**Karyl：**  
What kind of overblown title is that?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Sounds strong.  
`Tag 4`  
**Rin：**  
Um, I don't know about \"strong\"...  
Is that really what an idol should aim for?  
  
**Rin：**  
...Also, I've been wondering for a while...  
But what's this \"Violet Fencer\" thing even about?  
  
**Narration：**  
After crushing the bandits and adding another page to her legend,  
the future seemed bright for Rin the Violet Idol Fencer...
