## Subtitle: Strange Memories
  
**Narration：**  
Having accepted the \"New Generations\" girls' job request,  
{player} and friends are on their way to the town of Musa...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Apparently the repairs are gonna take a little while.  
Geez... I can't believe the carriage wheel broke like that!  
  
**Rin：**  
Not much we can do about it now.  
I just hope we can set off within the day...  
  
**Karyl：**  
The guy was like, \"I'll do my best, so hang in there!\"  
As if positive thinking will help anything!  
These old men, I swear...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's all wait together, then.  
**Choice: (2)**  Anybody mind if I go for a walk?  
`Tag 1`  
**Karyl：**  
They only need one of us here, so no point in you hanging around!  
If you're that bored, why don't you go stock us up on food?  
  
**Rin：**  
In that case, I suppose I'll go along.  
The others are taking a break too, so let's call it a bit of exercise.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Karyl：**  
...Oh, come on. Do you not realize how easily you get lost?  
Wandering off on your own is a no!  
 If you're really that bored,  
you and Rin can go buy us some food supplies. All right?  
  
**Rin：**  
Sure, I don't mind. Everyone else has headed off already.  
...But wait, have you really gotten yourself lost that often...?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rin：**  
Hmm... So this is what rest stations on the road are like.  
I've never actually visited one before, so this is new to me.  
  
**Rin：**  
Looks like there's plenty of food, so no problems there.  
I hope there's something of good value that won't go bad too quickly...  
  
**Rin：**  
...Hmm? What's up, {player}?  
Why did you suddenly stop?  
 Something catch your eye?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  That old guy looks pretty depressed.  
`Tag 4`  
**Man：**  
*sigh*... *sigh*...  
  
**Rin：**  
Oh, that's what's bothering you.  
He certainly is sighing a lot. Could he be in trouble?  
  
**Rin：**  
...Well, can't hurt to ask.  
I'm guessing you don't plan to just leave him there.  
  
**Rin：**  
Hey—mister.  
You don't look very happy. Is something wrong?  
  
**Man：**  
Hmm? Oh... Well, yeah.  
I'm just not sure what to do with all these. *sigh*...  
  
**Rin：**  
...Flowers? You've got quite the supply.  
  
**Man：**  
That's the thing...  
 Truth is, I'm a flower wholesaler.  
I just took receipt of a new supply to take to Landosol.  
  
**Man：**  
But it turns out I put one too many digits on the order!  
There's no way I can transport all these, so I'm in a pickle... *sigh*...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Let's help him out somehow.  
`Tag 5`  
**Rin：**  
Agreed. We can't abandon him after hearing him out.  
Hey, mister. We'd like to help, if you're interested.  
  
**Man：**  
Well, I do appreciate the offer, but help how, exactly?  
Selling these off one by one would take forever...  
  
**Rin：**  
Yes, I guess selling them individually is out.  
Hmm. You do seem to have a good variety...  
  
**Rin：**  
I know—let's try binding them into bouquets of ten or so.  
That should speed things up.  
 Do you have any paper?  
  
**Man：**  
Sure, some basic wrapping stuff.  
 But can you do that?  
From the looks of it, you're an adventurer, aren't you?  
  
**Rin：**  
Haha... Well, just watch.  
  
**Rin：**  
...There, that should do.  
 Doesn't look too bad, does it?  
  
**Man：**  
Forget \"bad,\" it's practically a professional product!  
Young miss, show me how you did that!  
 Let's split up the work!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Teach me how to do it, too.  
`Tag 6`  
**Rin：**  
Sure, I'll try.  
 First you remove the leaves.  
Then choose a main flower,  
and weave the others around it, one by one...  
  
**Rin：**  
Get your flowers here!  
How does a pretty bouquet for the journey sound?  
  
**Customer 1：**  
Excuse me! I'll take this red one!  
  
**Rin：**  
Sure, that'll be 500 rupies. Thank you for your business!  
  
**Customer 2：**  
Umm... I'm looking for a gift for my girlfriend.  
Do you have any recommendations...?  
  
**Rin：**  
In that case, shall I make you a bouquet based on her image?  
It will be a more personal gift that way.  
  
**Customer 2：**  
Will you really?! That would be great!  
  
**Man：**  
Man, thanks to that girl, they're selling like crazy!  
Heck, we've got so many customers, it's wearing me out.  
  
**Karyl：**  
This is where you've been?! Finally, I found you!  
Listen, you! Were you ever planning to come back?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
The repairs are almost done, so we're getting ready to leave!  
And you haven't even bought food? What the heck have you—  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Help us out here.  
`Tag 7`  
**Karyl：**  
Huhhh?! Why should I have to—  
  
**Man：**  
Ohhh, is your friend going to lend us a hand?  
Then bring the bouquets from over there, would you?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wait—I never agreed to any of—!  
  
**Customer 3：**  
Excuse me, miss! I'd like one of these!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Won't anybody listen to me?!  
  
**Man：**  
Man, you guys were lifesavers!  
The rest should be easy enough to transport to Landosol.  
  
**Rin：**  
That's good to hear.  
I'd have hated to see such nice flowers go to waste.  
  
**Man：**  
Here—take this for all your help.  
I can't let all that work go unpaid.  
Well then, I oughtta get going. Thank you again, really!  
  
**Rin：**  
Good luck in Landosol!  
...  
That took more time than I expected. Sorry.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're telling me! We should be on the road by now!  
...Well, the extra cash does help cover our repairs,  
so I guess it worked out, but still.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Look, I'll go ahead and pay the repair guy.  
You two hurry along to the carriage, all right?  
  
**Rin：**  
Thank you for helping back there.  
It feels like I owe you guys for all sorts of things.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  How did you know all about making bouquets?  
`Tag 8`  
**Rin：**  
Hmm... Actually, I'm not sure about that.  
It's not like I've ever worked at a flower shop in Landosol.  
  
**Rin：**  
It's just... I dunno. Like I knew it subconsciously...  
I just had a feeling for how to put it together  
and which flowers would work.  
  
**Rin：**  
It's a bit strange. I never work with flowers usually.  
Yet somehow...  
 it feels like something I've always done.  
  
**Narration：**  
As Rin gazed pensively off into the distance,  
she was overcome by a mysterious sense of nostalgia.
