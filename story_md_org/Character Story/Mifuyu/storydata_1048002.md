**Narration：**  
Having been adopted as Mifuyu's pupil, {player} now  
hones his swordsmanship under her watchful eye.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
C'mon, that all you got? You're not even trying!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
No, no, no. Here, watch me.  
You take this, and go like this, take aim... and thrust!  
Then step back!  
These are the basics of the \"stick and move.\"  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Good! That's it!  
  
**Townsman：**  
Heeey, somebody, heeelp!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh? Someone from the town is shouting and running this way.  
What's going on?  
  
**Townsman：**  
*huff* *huff*  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
What's all the fuss?  
  
**Townsman：**  
Ya see, some kids were playing in the ruins of the old castle  
when some monsters suddenly attacked.  
I got away,  
but the kids are still back there!  
  
**Townsman：**  
Please help us! If ya think you can take the monsters,  
ya gotta get those kids outta there!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Okay. And if we help, how many rupies will you pay us?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Uh, hey, don't you think that's a bit cold?  
**Choice: (2)**  Wow, Teach, you never forget the bottom line!  
`Tag 1`  
**Mifuyu：**  
I-I know that.  
I was just kidding.

`Tag 2`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Come on, I didn't mean it...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Understood. We'll save the kids—  
free of charge.  
How many monsters are there? Knowing this in advance  
will make the fight go much more smoothly.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hmm, I see...  
Okay, let's get moving, {player}!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
So this is the old castle.  
All right, {player}, time to put what I taught you to use!  
Let's finish this nice and efficiently!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hiyaaah! Let's go!  
  
**Monster：**  
Gyaaarghhh!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Uryaaah! More!  
  
**Monster：**  
Gyaaarghhh!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Now where the heck are those kids...?  
Ah! There they are! They're clinging to that window ledge  
up there to get away from the monsters!  
  
**Boy：**  
Waaah! Somebody heeelp!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I think we've pretty much cleared out all the monsters.  
Hold on, kids! We'll be right there!  
  
Okay, there we... go!  
  
**Boy：**  
Waaah! That was so scary!  
  
**Girl：**  
You're so strong and nice, lady!  
Thank you!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh, you're welcome.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Heheh. I guess a freebie here and there doesn't hurt.  
  
**Townsman：**  
Thanks, lady!  
Hmm... I don't have anything to pay you back with,  
but the least I can do is mend those clothes of yours!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
...My clothes?

**Mifuyu：**  
Oh wow! That *is* some serious rippage.  
That's too bad, really.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
But, well, I think it can wait a little longer.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  What?  
`Tag 4`  
**Mifuyu：**  
I have another monster-hunting job lined up after this.  
My clothes might get torn again, so it's just more efficient  
to keep them like this for now.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Quietly hand her your cape.  
**Choice: (6)**  A girl should look more proper.  
`Tag 5`  
**Mifuyu：**  
What? You're saying I should cover up with this?  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh? What, you're lending me your cape?  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Mifuyu：**  
A girl should care more for her appearance, huh?  
You know, I'd completely forgotten.  
It's been so long since I thought any of that applied to me.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
...Thanks for reminding me, {player}.  
  
**Narration：**  
As Mifuyu recalled a forgotten side of herself,  
her bond with {player} grew stronger.
