**Mifuyu：**  
All right, time for another big day of training!  
Let's see if you can take what I dish out!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Not bad! Sparks are flying from our clashing blades!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh? Those aren't sparks...  
The light... It doesn't seem to be fading.  
In fact, it's getting brighter—  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Aaaahhh!

**Mifuyu：**  
*huff* *huff*  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
A-are they still after me?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Oh hey, Mifuyu!  
`Tag 1`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ack! H-hey!  
K-keep it down!  
I'm covering your mouth!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Mf, mmgrmf, mgmllmgmf!  
`Tag 2`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh, that's it! I can hide behind you!  
Sorry, {player}! I need to borrow your back for a moment.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Eep!  
They're here!  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Heeeey! Mifuyu, where'd you go?  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Maybe she went that way! Find her!  
Yaaahhh!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Whew. Looks like I managed to lose them.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh, what was up with that pack of girls just now?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Well you see... I've proposed improved working conditions for women  
where I work, and fought to improve our wages. Along the line,  
I gained some tenacious fangirls, as you just saw...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
What's worse, there's a work dance party tomorrow...  
So now I'm being hounded by people wanting to go with me,  
which explains the mob back there.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  What do the men think?  
`Tag 3`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Huh...? Th-the men? I never talk to them.  
Except for you, that is.  
Hey, no no,  
don't you go looking at me with that pitying gaze!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Uh-oh, here they come again!  
Let's see...  
This time I'll wait them out  
in that alley!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
You're coming with me, {player}!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I was in such a hurry that I didn't realize...  
This alley, it's really narrow, huh...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Then why'd you ask me to come too?  
`Tag 4`  
**Mifuyu：**  
I-it's not like I could help it! I was just doing what  
I thought was best in the moment!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ack! {player}, your head is still sticking out!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I-if you don't squeeze in here a bit more,  
they're gonna spot us!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  U-uh, we're really close...  
`Tag 5`  
**Mifuyu：**  
I-I think you're still sticking out a bit.  
The most efficient way for us to hide would be for me to  
wrap my arms around your head like this...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
H-hey, is there a reason your body's getting so hot?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
N-no, this isn't good enough.  
An even more efficient way to hide would be for you to,  
oh gosh...  
p-put your head between my thighs.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  If that's what it takes.  
`Tag 6`  
**Mifuyu：**  
O-okay then.  
J-just, uh, just lower  
your head.  
D-down, um, between... between my thighs...  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Gah, nope, this isn't gonna work!  
  
**Narration：**  
Mifuyu forcefully shoves {player}'s head away,  
causing them to tumble into the open.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Eek!  
Owieee...  
 Wait, this is...  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Hey, there she is!  
Mifuyuuu!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Please, dance with meee!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Th-they found me!  
Run for it, {player}!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
*sigh*... I should've known better than to do something  
so inefficient. I'm getting sloppy...

**Ameth：**  
So, how'd you like it? That was a little present from me.  
See anything nice?  
  
**Ameth：**  
That was a \"dream\" I made using \"Memory Shards\"  
from you and Mifuyu.  
I have to say, you really  
hit the jackpot that time. But enough about that.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Collect more Memory Shards, and I'll have more dreams  
to show you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Dreaming of moments shared with all these girls  
will help you solve the mystery of this world.  
Keep at it! ♪  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway,  catch ya next time! ♪

**Mifuyu：**  
Huh... Was all that... a dream?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
You saw it too, {player}?  
That's really bizarre..  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
What really irks me is how irrationally I acted back there...  
B-but I couldn't really help it, what with you  
trying to stick your head down between my—  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh my! Look at the time. I've got to get to my next job!  
All right then, {player}, see you later!  
  
**Narration：**  
Mifuyu dashed off, looking just the teensiest bit bashful...
