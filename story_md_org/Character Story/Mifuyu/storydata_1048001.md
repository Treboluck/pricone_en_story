**Narration：**  
One day, while fighting monsters out on the plains,  
{player} hears a sudden loud cry right beside him.  
  
**???：**  
Hyaaahhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
Graaarghhh!  
  
**???：**  
All right! Downed with one strike!  
And that's that quest complete!  
On to the next!  
  
**???：**  
*huff, huff...* *huff, huff...*  
  
**Monster：**  
Grrrghhh!  
  
**Narration：**  
A short while later in another location,  
{player} finds himself locked in combat with monsters when—  
  
**???：**  
Hyaaahhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
Graaarghhh!  
  
**???：**  
All right! Downed with one strike!  
  
**???：**  
Hmm. My movements weren't quite optimal there, though.  
I'll have to work on that.  
  
**???：**  
Huh? Say...  
  
**???：**  
Hey, you. I keep seeing you around...  
Are you a bounty hunter? Or maybe a bodyguard?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm not sure what you're talking about.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm just a knight passing by this way.  
`Tag 1`  
**???：**  
So I guess we aren't in the same line of work, huh.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**???：**  
Hmm. Well, that could work.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**???：**  
By the way, what's your name?  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Ahh. {player}, eh? My name's Mifuyu.  
Pleased to meet you. I'm a mercenary from the Mercurius  
Foundation, so I'll conquer any quest... for the right price!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  That's real cool!  
`Tag 4`  
**Mifuyu：**  
I also handle all kinds of odd jobs at an hourly rate!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  That's... not quite so cool!  
`Tag 5`  
**Mifuyu：**  
By the way, we need to talk about your swordplay.  
It's so sloppy I could barely stand to watch.  
What do you think is most important when it comes to combat?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Winning.  
**Choice: (7)**  Elegance?  
`Tag 6`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Mm, winning isn't the only thing that matters.  
  
Jump to tag 8  
`Tag 7`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Close...  
but not quite.  
  
`Tag 8`  
**Mifuyu：**  
The correct answer is... \"efficiency\"!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Minimal movement, maximum efficiency. That, my friend, is what makes  
the ultimate mercenary.  
 Time is money! And time waits for no one!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
In other words, if you've got the time to soak in a success  
after a leisurely monster battle,  
you might as well move  
more efficiently to take out another one.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Do you have a moment? I'll show you how it's done.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
So if you want to take down two foes in one go,  
first you hit 'em hard like this, then spin around and... There!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Heheh, that's how it's done!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh, hold on.  
I just had an idea for an even more efficient way  
of doing things! Maybe  
if I start from here and then go  
like this and this, I can add in a third hit!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
...Urkkk...  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Um... Did you hurt your back?  
`Tag 9`  
**Mifuyu：**  
...No, I'm fine.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I-I said I'm fine!  
Really!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Anyway, those attacks of yours—they've got decent force  
behind them.  
Your swordplay's a little iffy, but with the right training,  
I think you have the makings of a great warrior.  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
I have an idea!  
How about I take you under my wing?  
I'll teach you everything you need to know about  
efficient fighting!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Thanks.  
`Tag 10`  
**Mifuyu：**  
Oh no, heheheh. No need to thank me.  
From now on, you and I will have regular training sessions  
here in this field!  
Like this, and this—  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Urk! Owieee... My back...  
  
**Choice: (11)**  (I'll just pretend I didn't see that.  
`Tag 11`  
**Mifuyu：**  
By the way, I'll cut you a massive deal on my instructor fees.  
Only 750 rupies per hour!  
  
**Mifuyu：**  
Hm? What's the matter? You look absolutely floored.  
  
**Narration：**  
\"Adopted\" as a student and then charged for it,  
{player} was left in awe of the tenacity  
of Mifuyu's entrepreneurial spirit...
