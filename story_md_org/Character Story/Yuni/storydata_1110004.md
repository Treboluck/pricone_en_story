## Subtitle: On Momentary Connections to the Beyond
  
**Narration：**  
Recently, {player} has found himself receiving  
regular invitations to visit Yuni in the Ivory Tower.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, young compatriot.  
Thank you for coming as always. *bow*  
  
**Yuni：**  
I invited you today for an important reason.  
Our research project is on the verge of entering a crucial new phase.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  \"Our\"?  
`Tag 1`  
**Yuni：**  
Indeed. By unraveling various local documents  
and examining a variety of hypotheses,  
we have studied this region's folklore and legends...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  \"We\"?  
`Tag 2`  
**Yuni：**  
Yet this research of ours  
has grown beyond its roots in mere local archeology  
to require the inclusion of perspectives on a far more macro scale.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Spanning the fields of history, anthropology,  
and at times even the realm of philosophy...  
Hrm. More cynical minds might label it a study of religion.  
  
**Yuni：**  
So, our project's new theme will be...  
Drumroll, please. Ta-da!  
  
**Yuni：**  
\"The Primordial Deceits of This World\"!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I've heard that somewhere before.  
`Tag 3`  
**Yuni：**  
Wha...? What nonsense is this, young man?  
I'm unveiling this theme for the very first time—  
  
**Rosetta：**  
Po~ing! Notifying Doctor Yuni!  
Unidentified Luminous Phenomenon Detected!  
  
**Yuni：**  
Huh? What's this mystery light?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Huh? Huh? What is going on?  
Ah! Awa... Guahhh! H-huahh... Wahhh, so intriguiiiing!  
  

---  
  
**???：**  
Ah—that book...  
  
**???：**  
W-wah! S-sorry for prying!  
It's just that I've read that book too, so I just...  
  
**???：**  
U-ummm, just out of interest...  
I don't suppose you... happen to like that author or anything...?  
  
**???：**  
Huh? For a school project? You have to read it...?  
Oh... Right, of course... Ahaha...  
  
**???：**  
Sorry to interrupt. You just keep reading.  
  
**???：**  
Bye-bye now.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Keep reading.  
`Tag 4`

**???：**  
Ahhh...  
  
**???：**  
Mmmm...  
  
**???：**  
Hmmmm...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Do you... need something?  
`Tag 5`  
**???：**  
Wahhh! I'm so sorry!  
It's just, you didn't seem to be making much progress,  
so it was bugging me a bit...  
  
**???：**  
That book's... a bit difficult if you're not used to it...  
It might be a bit hard to get into, that's all...  
  
**???：**  
Oh, you thought so too? I knew it...  
  
**???：**  
Oh... but!  
But listen. Wait a moment.  
There's a trick to it. I promise.  
  
**???：**  
First, Chapter 1 here... it's kind of the trickiest of them all...  
But, um, it doesn't say much that's important, so you can just skip it.  
Honestly it's just like, what're you even saying, Gramps?  
  
**???：**  
Like, he's a good guy really!  
When playing with his grandkids, he's a jolly old grandpa,  
but as a scholar, he likes the sound of his own voice a bit too much...  
  
![111000402.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/111000402.webp)  
**Yuni：**  
Oh, me?  
Sorry. Umm, my name's Yuni Shingyoji...  
Yes... I'm the granddaughter of Prof. Shingyoji, the author. Yeah, sorry.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Give your name in return.  
`Tag 6`  
**Yuni：**  
Oh... {player}, okay. Nice to meet you.  
And you're...  
 hm. I'm older than you, then.  
  
**Yuni：**  
So... can I keep going?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Right, so you see, just skip the first chapter and start from the second...  
For the third and fourth,  
 well, you can probably just skim them. Yeah.  
And once you get past those...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oh, but this is a school thing, right? Is it for an essay?  
In that case, let's bookmark some key points for later.  
D'you mind if I sit here? Let me move your bag.

`image display end`  
**Yuni：**  
...  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Okay, I think that should do it.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ahhh...  
I'm, uh, sorry. I guess I bookmarked half the pages.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I just came out of nowhere and talked your ear off, huh?  
Oh, I'm so weird... Now my face is going red...  
  
**Yuni：**  
You see, I'm basically a shut-in, and I don't really have friends,  
so when I do get to talk to people, I get a bit carried away...  
Especially on my favorite topics.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Today at lunch break, Hoshino...  
 Um, this super pretty girl in my class...  
She came and talked to me, but I just went on and on about this book...  
I think she was just trying to talk about her little brother...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Right. So, like, just... sorry, okay? I've never seen  
someone actually reading my grandpa's book before, so I...  
I got all excited... My head just went \"wahhh\"...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Look, I really am sorry.  
I creeped you out, right? You must've been so confused.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  It was fun.  
`Tag 7`  
**Yuni：**  
Ah... really?!  
That's great! Then how about these other books—  
  
**Yuni：**  
No, wait, Yuni.  
You know you shouldn't take polite comments like that to heart.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ahh... I'm so hopeless...  
Society's way too tricky, online or offline...  
  
**Yuni：**  
'Cause, like... yesterday, I totally screwed up in this online game.  
My in-game friends said it was no biggie, but I...  
*sigh*... I feel so awkward, it's tough to log back in...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Huh? ...User ID? Wait, mine?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Sure... I mean, I can tell you it, but...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Huh? Wait, but does this mean...  
In, like, layfolk's terms, you want to... friend me?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ahhh...  
  
**Yuni：**  
...Eheheh.  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hey. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you saw just now was like a dream.  
And honestly, you'll forget it once you wake up,  
so no need to worry about it too much.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Soon enough, you and Yuni  
will wake right back up in the Ivory Tower.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Yuni has an inquisitive mind,  
so she might not be so quick to accept it as \"just a dream.\"  
All this strange info might even end up piquing her curiosity.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But I'm sorry to say those memories aren't going to last.  
You can't record them, or even think about them too hard.  
  
**Ameth：**  
\"Deceits of the World,\" was it?  
That research topic of Yuni's.  
Too bad for her, but that won't lead anywhere, either.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Neither she nor any other great mind  
can hold on to doubts about this world for very long.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Why?  
 That's just how this world's set up right now.  
There are secrets you just can't reach, no matter how smart you are.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Even so...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Yuni told you something, right?  
That the journey's more important than the results.  
It's the act of learning itself she cares about.  
  
**Ameth：**  
In that case, I'm sure this is still worthwhile to her.  
We shouldn't decide that all her work's for nothing.  
  

---  
  
**Yuni：**  
Huahh... Auhh...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Good morning, world. As always, you deceive me.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, and you too.  
I see we've both awoken. Did you have a pleasant dream?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm. You can't recall.  
Well, yes. Neither can I.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I feel as though I glimpsed a fragment of a great truth...  
As if I witnessed a mundane yet inconceivable interlude...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrmm. I can't note this down...  
Nothing but the sense of discovery remains.  
Such a perplexing sensation.  
  
**Yuni：**  
However, it's a blessing to remember that I don't remember.  
This odd experience actually serves to strengthen my current hypothesis.  
I find myself thrilled and overjoyed. Wahoo.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Now, my compatriot, it's time to return to our previous discussion.  
Our new theme is \"The Primordial...\"  
Hmm? What was it? I've forgotten again...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ehm... What now?  
I know. Let me check my notes...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes, good. \"The Primordial Deceits of This World.\" That's it.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Yes, this is just it.  
This oh-so-frustrating forgetting phenomenon.  
  
**Yuni：**  
It seems that this world is actively adjusting our perception.  
Right now, the world itself is telling us a terrible lie...  
  
**Yuni：**  
Or at least, that's the bold and revolutionary theory I'm proposing.  
So, what say you? Will you assist me with this thesis?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  I don't really understand.  
`Tag 8`  
**Yuni：**  
But of course.  
  
**Yuni：**  
The truth doesn't always bring joy.  
Remaining blissfully ignorant is also a valid choice.  
  
**Yuni：**  
In fact, I don't mind if you have no interest in my research.  
To begin with, the aid I seek from you was never of a utilitarian nature.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I simply wish for you to join me in idle discussions at times.  
After all, the reason I came from the mountain to the city  
is because I held an interest in the academy life I'd read of.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah... To put it more simply...  
  
**Yuni：**  
In the terms of the layfolk, I just want to make friends.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I can't force you, of course. But, hm... What say you?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  I thought we were already friends.  
`Tag 9`  
**Yuni：**  
Huh? Really?  
  
**Yuni：**  
I see... So that's how it is...  
This is friendship... It's less profound than I'd imagined it.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hm? Then does this mean...  
my magical youth has already begun...?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Who knew?  
That would explain why my life has felt more fulfilling lately.  
  
**Narration：**  
As Yuni basked in this new and important discovery,  
{player} just watched and nodded with a smile.
