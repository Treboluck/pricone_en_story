## Subtitle: On the Ramifications of Dietary Routines
  
**Narration：**  
One day, as {player} strolls down the road,  
he hears a young girl's voice coming from a patch of long grass.  
  
**???：**  
Ah, cruel fate. The end is upon me.  
  
**???：**  
What a fool I was. Alas. In the thrill of taking to the field,  
I neglected the basics. Will the elders of my home  
forgive me for leaving this world ahead of them?  
  
**???：**  
In retrospect, mine was a sorry life.  
I took only what I was given  
and wasted my days away poring over literature.  
  
**???：**  
What say you, Rosetta?  
Was I able to leave anything of value in this world?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Approach the source of the voice.

**???：**  
Oh...?  
Someone draws near, Rosetta.  
  
**???：**  
Now then... I lived a life of solitude, without friends or family to  
bid me farewell.  
 Yet if this young passerby might accompany me  
in my final moments...  
 why, that must be the will of a greater power.  
  
**???：**  
Hrm... Say now, young man.  
Would you tell me your name, as a final memento of this world?  
  
**???：**  
Young {player}.  
A fine name. I'll note it down for my next life.  
Memo memo...  
  
**Yuni：**  
I am Yuni.  
A scholar from the Ivory Tower of St. Theresa's Academy  
and a fragile soul fated to expire upon these fields.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You're... a kid, right?  
**Choice: (3)**  Are you... a grown-up?  
`Tag 2`  
**Yuni：**  
Due to my charmingly underdeveloped appearance,  
I'm accustomed to inviting such misapprehensions.  
It has its downsides, but for now, let me accept it as a compliment.

`Tag 3`  
**Yuni：**  
A difficult question.  
I've not lived long enough to give an unequivocal affirmation,  
but nor so short that I feel capable of a confident denial.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Yuni：**  
At present, I'm neither child nor adult; I stand betwixt the two.  
Still within my cocoon, on the path from girl to woman.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Though I concede that my physical body  
lags behind those of my peers somewhat.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Still, I expect I'm your elder, at least.  
Please address me with amicable respect  
as the esteemed Doctor Yuni, young {player}.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  You seem half dead, Doctor Yuni.  
**Choice: (6)**  You seem pretty perky, Doctor Yuni.  
`Tag 5`  
**Yuni：**  
As indeed I am.  
Barring a fortuitous offer of aid from a stranger,  
this feeble life will surely meet its end before long.  
  
**Yuni：**  
By the by, on an entirely different topic,  
have you heard of the notion of willful negligence?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Say one frigid winter's night, a drunkard lay sleeping by the roadside.  
If one were to pass this man by, and he then died of the cold by morning,  
this tenet would hold guilty the one who neglected to wake him.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Ah, but excuse me. I've strayed from the topic at hand.  
None of this is relevant to a passerby like yourself.  
Now, I'll defer to your grasp of social mores.  
 Do as you will.

`Tag 6`  
**Yuni：**  
\"Perky.\" Hrm.  
After all my concerted efforts to frame myself as near death, \"perky.\"  
That's how you would label my rosy countenance?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Trusting in what the eyes perceive...  
Isn't it time we as a society moved past such foolishness?  
  
**Yuni：**  
This is just one cynic's personal hypothesis,  
but I believe this world is mired in deception from its outset.  
As such, we should strive to see what lies beneath the surface.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Choice: (8)**  Meaning... what, exactly?  
`Tag 8`  
**Yuni：**  
I often ask myself that question.  
These fleeting lives we lead... What meaning can they hold?  
  
**Yuni：**  
From another angle, the quest for that answer  
may itself be the purpose of our being.  
A noble search without end; such is the melody to which we dance.  
  
![111000102.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/111000102.webp)  
**Yuni：**  
...Hrm. Your face says \"What's this mad girl on about?\"  
To be direct and use the terms of the layfolk,  
I'm saying I've run out of the strength to move a single muscle.  
  
**Yuni：**  
And to further clarify,  
my stomach is so empty, my brain can barely function.  
  
**Yuni：**  
As such, I'm speaking purely on instinct.  
It may seem as if I'm rambling on aimlessly about very little—  
because frankly, that's precisely the state in which I find myself.  
  
**Yuni：**  
So tell me, young man.  
I don't suppose you'd happen to have on your person  
an item that might trigger a drastic shift in my fortunes?  
  
**Yuni：**  
To be more specific,  
some carbohydrate matter to fit in my stomach,  
or perhaps a potion to reinvigorate a fatigued body.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Hand her a Kokkoro-brand salted rice ball.  
`Tag 9`  
**Yuni：**  
Oh... Ohhhh! This is...!  
That ideal source of urgent nutrition:  
natural grains infused with sodium chloride!

`image display end`  
**Yuni：**  
Phew... Thank you for the meal.  
  
**Yuni：**  
So sorry about all that.  
I never intended to impose, but the way things turned out,  
it's as though I faked illness to appropriate your provisions.  
  
**Yuni：**  
As a result, I'm restored to full health.  
When venturing outdoors, it seems I should partake of physical nutrition.  
\"Eating meals\"...  
 No wonder the custom is ubiquitous in all societies.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hm? Oh, I usually subsist on dietary supplements.  
Don't you know them?  
They're pills containing concentrated supplies of nourishment.  
  
**Yuni：**  
I ventured into the field today for the sake of an expedition,  
but ordinarily I stay within the Tower from morning till night.  
  
**Yuni：**  
My usual exercise consists of little more than lifting a book or pen,  
so I rarely hunger, and I don't care to waste my time on sustenance.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hmm? What now?  
Oh... You claim meals are enjoyable affairs?  
  
**Yuni：**  
True enough, taste stimuli can trigger the brain's pleasure centers.  
This reward system provides a source of contentment for many.  
Though personally, I've rarely had call to perceive it as such.  
  
**Choice: (10)**  It's even more fun if you eat meals together.  
`Tag 10`  
**Yuni：**  
Hrmmm...  
  
**Yuni：**  
I have heard of this theory before, but it strikes me as lacking evidence.  
I'd classify it as either a form of placebo or mere superstition.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Even so, your claim is a valuable piece of counterevidence.  
In the Tower, there are few who challenge my preconceptions.  
I should note that down while I remember. Memo memo.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hm?  
Oh, it's as I just explained.  
I belong to a certain academy.  
  
**Yuni：**  
However, my position differs from the ordinary students.  
We rarely have call to share a classroom,  
let alone go so far as to exchange words.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hrm... Yes, I see.  
Businesslike interactions with the staff who wait upon me aside,  
I suppose I haven't conversed with someone my own age in some time.  
  
**Yuni：**  
You have my thanks.  
To have one's every word rewarded with immediate feedback  
is a rare and stimulating experience that no measure of theses can offer.  
  
**Yuni：**  
...What do I mean?  
 Use your brain a little, lad.  
It pains me to put it in layfolk's terms,  
but in short... I enjoyed this little talk of ours.  
  
**Choice: (11)**  Then there's your proof.  
`Tag 11`  
**Yuni：**  
Huh? Proof...? Of what, exactly?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Oh, I see now...  
So this is your theory of \"enjoyable mealtimes with others.\"  
That's a sharp argument. You may actually have outwitted me.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Still... That said, I don't know...  
With so many factors at play, this is far from solid evidence.  
  
**Yuni：**  
For instance: since beginning life in my home village,  
I've been largely isolated. By any objective measure,  
I must be deprived of social interaction.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Enough to stave off solitude, say, by treating a stone as a pet.  
Isn't that right, Rosetta?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Given this fact, one may deduce that I am starved for human contact.  
A starvation so extreme that any interaction  
might excite me far beyond the ordinary.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Under such conditions, the contribution of the meal itself  
seems negligible.  
 Any scholar would agree  
that we'd need further experimentation to draw conclusions.  
  
**Yuni：**  
As such...  
Just now, I believe I mentioned that I'm on an expedition.  
  
**Yuni：**  
More specifically, I'm working on an archeological assignment,  
and it requires a measure of fieldwork.  
I seek a location referred to in folklore as the Azure Depths.  
  
**Yuni：**  
So... what say you?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Hey. Why did you turn your back?  
Young {player}, I asked you a question.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Let me ask again.  
I, a feeble scholar, am on a solitary adventure.  
So... what say you?  
  
**Yuni：**  
Really, enough of this turning around.  
I'm asking to hear your thoughts.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Naturally, I have no intention of pressuring you to join me.  
The choice is yours to make.  
To come or to go; such is each man's prerogative.  
  
**Yuni：**  
By the by, young man,  
on an entirely different topic,  
in a far-off easterly nation, there exists the following proverb.  
  
**Yuni：**  
\"Companionship makes the journey, and charity the world.\"  
To boldly interpret somewhat:  
\"Help people out, or else!\" would be the essential meaning.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Please excuse me. That was irrelevant.  
I just felt like sharing that utterly random fact.  
  
**Yuni：**  
Well then, I'll return to my solitary and dangerous path.  
Young man, what say you?  
  
**Narration：**  
Swayed by the sheer insistence of Yuni's not-so-subtle hints,  
{player} found himself with little choice  
but to accompany her on her academic expedition.
