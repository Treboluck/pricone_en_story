# Makoto Episode 5
While out picking up trash, Makoto finds {player} collapsed by the wayside. She treats his wounds and enlists his help, but when she sees that he has no idea how to sort garbage, Makoto just shakes her head.
  
## Subtitle: What a Find!
  
**Makoto：**  
 Hmm, hmm, hmm... ♪  
Ugh, more trash.  
  
**Makoto：**  
That windstorm yesterday really blew a ton of junk from town  
out here. I've found signs, shoes, you name it.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Leaves and branches all over the place...  
Food and wrappers some moron tossed on the ground.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ugh. It's made a total mess of my beautiful Esterella Road!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I'm gonna break my back trying to clean all this up myself.  
Oh well. That's the job they gave me for the day.  
I'm just a minimum wage street cleaner.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Esterella Road runs just outside the city.  
If Landosol was a house, this would be the yard.  
  
**Makoto：**  
That means it's part of Caon's house too.  
Gotta keep it clean!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ack!  
What is that? That's definitely not a branch or a wrapper.  
Is that a dead body?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Urgh... Please don't be a dead body.  
I don't need to see that. But if it's just someone who's hurt,  
I can probably save them if I get them to a doctor in time.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I can't turn a blind eye to this.  
H-hello? You alive over there?  
If you're still alive, say something!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh? Wait a second... {player}!  
Why are you dead on the side of the road?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm not dead.  
**Choice: (2)**  A monster got me.  
`Tag 1`  
**Makoto：**  
I see... Thank goodness!  
You were lying there like a pile of litter.  
I thought you might have been a corpse.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Well, I'm glad to see you're alive, but are you okay?  
Why were you passed out there?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Are you injured or something?  
Lemme take a look. I'll try to patch you up.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Makoto：**  
Ungh. I heard there have been monsters popping up  
right outside of town. Guess the rumors were true.  
Unlucky for you, huh?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hmph. That's what happens when weaklings like you  
wander outside the safety of the city. I dunno what you  
were up to, but next time, get a bodyguard or something!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Now, let's take a look at that wound.  
I'll do what I can.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Makoto：**  
Hey, hold still.  
I can't wrap the bandage if you're moving.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh?  
The disinfectant stings really bad?  
Oh, man up.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sorry.  
I'm sure Yui would've been a lot more gentle with you.  
I seem to do everything too rough.  
  
**Makoto：**  
'Kay, you should be fine now.  
Don't mess with the wound too much.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh?  
Nah, you don't need to do anything for me.  
We have each other's backs, remember?  
  
**Makoto：**  
By the way, you never did tell me  
what you were doing out here.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I know Esterella Road is relatively safe,  
but monsters do show up along the way.  
If you're not careful, you'll be their next meal.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Me?  
I'm just picking up litter and debris for Caon.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey, {player}. If you're not busy, you wanna help?  
I'll be here till midnight if I have to clean  
all this up by myself.  
  
**Makoto：**  
In return, I'll be your chaperone!  
I can take out the monsters around here in my sleep.  
  
**Makoto：**  
You scratch my back, I scratch yours. How about it?  
That should work for both of us, right?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Okay?  
All right! It's a deal!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Since you're injured, you take it easy.  
I'll just pick up whatever trash we come across,  
and you sort it and put it in the right bag.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh? You don't know how to sort trash?  
Sheesh, you don't know the first thing about anything, do you?  
Oh, right. The amnesia.  
  
**Makoto：**  
*sigh*  
Fine, fine. I'll teach you everything you need to know  
from the very beginning.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ugh, this is almost as much of a pain as the cleanup.  
I really picked up a hell of a find, didn't I?
