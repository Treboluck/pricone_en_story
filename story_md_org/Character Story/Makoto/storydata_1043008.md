**Makoto：**  
*sigh*  
This is so depressing. Kill me now.  
  
**Makoto：**  
No, no, can't be a downer.  
Not when the weather's this nice.  
The Tower of Sol's crystal clear today.  
  
**Makoto：**  
*sigh*  
Hmm?  
What, {player}?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sorry. You came out to help me pick up trash again,  
and we're getting nowhere because I keep screwing up.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh? Yeah, I'm fine. Don't worry about me.  
I don't want my bad mood to bring you down.  
I'll have forgotten all about it by tomorrow.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Urgh. I always forget really important stuff  
at the drop of a hat. Is she gonna start to hate my guts for that, I wonder?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Whoops! Argh, I dumped the entire bag out!  
Ugh. This is the worst day ever.  
There's not even that much trash. Can we call it a day?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey {player}, it's already past noon.  
Wanna head back and hang out somewhere else?  
  
**Makoto：**  
C'mon, please? I really don't wanna go home today.  
You'd be doing me a huge favor! Pretty please? ♪  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ack! It's that light again!  
It's blinding!  
What is this? It's creeping me out!

**Makoto：**  
*sigh* Ugh.  
This is so depressing. Kill me now.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh? Yo, {player}.  
What're you doing up on the roof?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I could ask you the same.  
**Choice: (2)**  You okay? You look pale.  
`Tag 1`  
**Makoto：**  
Me? Just felt like taking in the view while I had lunch.  
The classroom's too noisy, and I need to do some  
thinking by myself.  
  
**Makoto：**  
You in the same boat?  
The roof's where all the punks  
like me hang out,so don't come up here acting all  
carefree.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Makoto：**  
Don't answer a question with a question, you nerd!  
Don't tell me you followed me up here because I've  
been acting depressed, and you were worried?  
  
**Makoto：**  
I don't get you.  
Are we suddenly best buddies?  
I don't think so.

**Makoto：**  
Eek! That was close! Where'd that wind come from?  
I almost lost my balance and went right over the railing!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey, {player}.  
Did you see them?  
  
**Makoto：**  
My panties, stupid! Did you see them?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
You didn't?  
You're full of it! From where you're standing,  
at that angle, there's no way you didn't get a good look!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Grrr... You really didn't? Hmph. Well, you probably  
wouldn't wanna see my unsexy punk-chick  
undies even if I offered to show them.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Say what?  
I'm plenty sexy in my own way?  
  
**Makoto：**  
I've got a pretty face, and tons of style? Ugh, shut up, creep.  
Flattery's not gonna get you anywhere.

**Makoto：**  
Whatever.  
Shooting the breeze with you kinda cleared my head a little.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I guess it's never a good idea to keep things  
all bottled up, is it?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Nah, it's nothing major... I had a fight with my little sister.  
I promised I'd take her shopping,  
but then I went back on it.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I just had a thing I couldn't get out of...  
But still, I'm one hundred percent in the wrong.  
I know I should just own up to it and say I'm sorry.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I wanna stay on her good side. Maybe I should take her out some  
other time and buy her something nice?  
 But to be honest, I  
don't really know what kinda things girls like.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh? A teddy bear?  
 Hey, what the hell gave you that idea?  
I knew it! You saw them, you bastard! You saw my teddy bear  
panties!  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
T-teddy bear panties!  
Ah ha ha! Makoto's just full of surprises, isn't she?  
  
**Ameth：**  
So, you *did* see them, didn't you?  
Be honest next time.  
And make sure to apologize afterwards.  
  
**Ameth：**  
If you miss your chance, you could end up never  
having the opportunity to say you're sorry,  
and regretting it for the rest of your life.  
Understand?

**Makoto：**  
Eep! Sheesh, what's with you today?  
You fell asleep and woke up like someone was flipping  
a switch!  
  
**Makoto：**  
And now you're on your hands and knees...  
You're... sorry?  
 For what?  
C'mon, why're you begging me for forgiveness?  
  
**Makoto：**  
You've got nothing to apologize to me for, {player}.  
If anything, I should be saying sorry to you. I'm really  
grateful for all the help you give me with my job, you know.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ha ha ha. Actually, I should copy your technique. I'll get on  
my hands and knees and do whatever it takes to be forgiven.  
Angsting and putting off fixing a problem isn't my style.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yeah. I had a fight with my little sister,  
and I feel really bad about it.  
  
**Makoto：**  
When I get home, the first thing I'll do is say I'm sorry.  
And to keep things sweet between us, maybe I'll buy her  
a little present, too.  
  
**Makoto：**  
If you're not busy, come shopping with me.  
We'll hit a few stores, pick out the right gift,  
and make an afternoon of it.  
  
**Makoto：**  
All work and no play makes life pretty lame! ♪
