# Makoto Episode 4
In a dream, Makoto and {player} chat and prepare for a math quiz. But when Makoto feels like they're overly chummy, Ameth realizes the dream is too out of sync with reality, and forces it to end early.
  
## Subtitle: Forced Familiarity
  
**Makoto：**  
Argh, I don't get this!  
My brain's gonna short-circuit!  
  
**Makoto：**  
\"Take care of the accounting,\" my butt!  
What made you think I can deal with all this in-depth math?  
Geez, Mom, way to dump all the annoying, menial tasks on me!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Bwuh?  
Yo, {player}!  
What's up?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Lurking around hoping for another free meal, huh?  
Fine, pay your tab for all the ingredients I used for  
your freebies so far, and you've got a deal.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Actually, forget food for a second.  
I'm glad you're here!  
Come sit down next to me.  
  
**Makoto：**  
{player}, are you any good at math?  
See, I got stuck with balancing the tavern's checkbook.  
  
**Makoto：**  
But like anyone with an ounce of sense can tell,  
I'm the brawn of the outfit, not the brains!  
All this heavy thinking just makes my head spin!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Every time I try to add up all these columns of numbers,  
my skin starts crawling, and I get the urge to smash stuff!  
This bean counting has me ready to blow my stack!  
  
**Makoto：**  
So how about it? Think you could bail me out  
and take care of the accounting instead?  
  
**Makoto：**  
No?  
Oh, right, you have amnesia!  
You can't even do addition or multiplication, can you?  
  
**Makoto：**  
*sigh* All right, I'll grit my teeth and get it done.  
I shouldn't be letting a total stranger look at our  
finances anyways.  
Argh, but it still sucks!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Whoa!  
Wh-what the hell?  
{player}, you're kinda glowing there.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Wait, no, the entire tavern seems like it's shining  
with this blinding light!

**Makoto：**  
*yawn*  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh? Did I just conk out at my desk?  
My mind's all fuzzy...  
Crap, we've got that math quiz in fifth period...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey {player}, did you study? I totally forgot  
we've got that quiz today. Oh man... If I flunk,  
I'm gonna have to stay after for remedial lessons.  
  
**Makoto：**  
My plan was to cram like crazy during lunch,  
but I totally blanked out or something!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I don't even know what's gonna be on this stupid quiz!  
I'm so dead!  
I'm doomed!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Encourage her.  
**Choice: (2)**  Bemoan your shared fate.  
`Tag 1`  
**Makoto：**  
\"If you think you can, you can. If you think you can't,  
you can't.\" What kinda psychobabble is that?  
Was that supposed to be encouraging?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Whatever.  
I guess you're right.  
  
**Makoto：**  
If you give up before the battle starts, you've already lost.  
It's as true for tests as it is for fights, right?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Makoto：**  
Eep! Sheesh, don't shout like that.  
Everyone in class is staring at us now!  
Don't do that again. I'm trying to stay under the radar!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I'm guessing you didn't study either, {player}?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Oh well. Guess we'll have to suffer  
through remedial lessons together.  
My condolences!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Makoto：**  
Whoops!  
I don't have time to be chatting with you.  
Gotta study...  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ugh, but this sucks so bad!  
Forget it, I'm way too hungry. My brain needs fuel.  
Lunch first, then books!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh?  
{player}, I thought you always packed a lunch.  
You forgot yours today?  
  
**Makoto：**  
You're always so absent-minded.  
Here, if you want, I'll split some of mine with you.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Well, dig in. Don't be shy!  
It's just made outta leftovers from my family's place, anyway.  
Here ya go!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Huh?  
Hey... {player}.  
Have we always been this... familiar?  
  
**Makoto：**  
What's going on?  
Everything feels so weird.  
Am I still half-asleep or something?

**Ameth：**  
All right, that's enough!  
Well? Did you enjoy your dream?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Sorry about that.  
I got the feeling that if I let it go any further, things  
would've deviated too much from her real memories.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So I had to shut it down early.  
Makoto's a very perceptive girl.  
She was on the verge of noticing something was amiss.  
  
**Ameth：**  
It seems like you and Makoto had a... complicated  
relationship. Complicated enough that you weren't able  
to be so outwardly buddy-buddy.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I wonder if Makoto wouldn't be happier if she never  
recovered her old memories.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Of course, in your current state, you have no idea  
what I'm talking about.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Regardless, the more of these dreams you see going forward,  
the more your mind will be sorted out and strengthened.  
  
**Ameth：**  
If you got all your memories back in one shot,  
without any advance preparation, well... The discrepancies  
would be so great, your brain would blue-screen.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So we're going to strengthen your mind, step by step,  
by taking your memories with all these different girls  
and reformatting them as dreams.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You can't dream forever, you know.  
Someday, you have to face reality.  
That goes for everyone, and you're no exception.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oops! We don't have time to sit around flapping  
our gums, do we?  
 Bye-bye for now!

**Makoto：**  
*yawn*  
Huh? Did I fall asleep?  
{player}, what time is it?!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Ah! It's already evening!  
 I've gotta get the tavern  
opened up—customers are waiting! Oh crap, I didn't  
get anywhere with the accounting, either!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Guess we'll just have to tackle this mountain one step at a  
time. {player},  
why don't you stick around for dinner?  
Accounting's a pain, so I'll hook you up with the leftovers!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Say what?  
Nah, don't sweat it. What are friends for, right, {player}? ♪
