# Makoto Episode 6
Makoto and {player} practice their swordsmanship while waiting for the garbage collectors. Makoto is delighted that what should've been a boring day turned out to be a lot of fun thanks to {player}.
  
## Subtitle: Tedious to Terrific
  
**Makoto：**  
Whew, I think that's the last of it.  
Trash pickup is officially complete!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Of course, it took all day since you were totally useless  
at the start, and I had to show you the ropes along the way.  
The sun's way below the horizon now.  
  
**Makoto：**  
But whatever. It would've been so tedious if I had to  
do it all alone.  
Being able to talk with you while we worked  
made things a lot more fun. So thanks a lot!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Whoa, why're you flopping down on the ground?  
Tired already? You have no stamina.  
You'd better not be slacking off! Train harder!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hmph.  
I've been wondering what you were doing outside  
the city. Did you come here to train?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sheesh, you don't know anything. You can train just fine within  
the city walls! There are places to lift weights, and plenty of  
dojos that'll teach you martial arts.  
  
**Makoto：**  
No need to bother coming out here.  
Even if you wanted to go for a run, the monsters  
around here make it too dangerous.  
  
**Makoto：**  
What?  
You were gonna fight weak monsters  
and gain experience points?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Experience... points? Look, I agree that there's no  
substitute for real battle experience, but there must be  
a safer way for you to get in better shape!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I know they say \"common sense isn't so common,\"  
but you really take it to another level. You're so weird.  
It's like you come from a whole 'nother world.  
  
**Makoto：**  
{player}.  
How about I train you myself?  
  
**Makoto：**  
I see you've got a sword strapped to your belt.  
I'm a swordfighter myself, so I bet I could teach you a lot.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Of course, I'm a pure brawler, and self-taught to boot.  
I didn't learn swordfighting at some fancy school,  
so I don't really know how to teach other people.  
  
**Makoto：**  
You even hold the hilt weird.  
It's gonna slip right out of your hands like that.  
  
**Makoto：**  
If you need basic stuff like that explaining to you, don't you  
think you'd be better off with a training partner?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Besides, we've got nothing better to do until the  
garbage collectors come to pick up these bags.  
Plus I owe you for helping me out today.  
You up for it?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Right. My job was only to pick up the trash and sort it into  
bags. Another guild handles the actual collection.  
There's no way I could carry all this to the dump on my own.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Yup. The dump is right by that mountain over there.  
A dedicated guild is stationed there, and they use magic  
to incinerate the trash, or bury it deep underground.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Those guys specialize in garbage disposal,  
so they outsource the gathering and sorting to  
other guilds.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Caon is one of those guilds. The garbage disposal guild  
hires us to go out and pick up trash.  
  
**Makoto：**  
If we just asked the princess, she could magically  
erase all this trash in an instant,  
but we'd rather not  
expose her to all this garbage and filth if we can help it.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Anyways, if we want to live in this city, we can't act like  
lone wolves and leave all the responsibility to one guild.  
It only works if we cooperate to solve the big problems.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Just because beastfolk are a minority in Landosol  
doesn't mean we should isolate ourselves.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Like how I want you and me to be good friends, {player}!  
  
**Makoto：**  
And on that note, let's have a little friendship-building spar!  
  
**Makoto：**  
We'll keep this low-key.  
See that branch over there? Grab it!  
 Now, come at me!  
  
**Makoto：**  
I've gotta see how good you are before I can start teaching  
you.  
 C'mon, bring it! Don't wimp out!  
Train and get stronger until *you're* the one teaching *me*!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Go all out.  
**Choice: (2)**  Hesitate.  
`Tag 1`  
**Makoto：**  
Yeah, yeah! That's what I'm talking about!  
See? You can do it if you really try!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Now hold that branch tight.  
If you don't take this seriously, you're gonna get hurt!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Makoto：**  
C'mon! What's wrong? Don't just stand there!  
Fight me like your life depends on it!  
  
**Makoto：**  
What do you mean, you can't hit a girl with a stick?  
You moron! Softhearted fools like you  
are the first ones to die on the battlefield!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Makoto：**  
*sigh* What're you slouching for?  
Lose your motivation  
already? Don't you wanna get stronger? Then gimme all you've  
got! Come at me like you're trying to kill me!  
  
**Makoto：**  
Now what?  
Your wound's starting to hurt?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Sorry, sorry. I totally forgot you were injured.  
It's fine, don't overdo it. We'll call it a day.  
You get an \"A\" for effort!  
  
**Makoto：**  
We'll do this again when you're all healed up.  
Take it easy for the rest of the day.  
Sorry about that.  
When I'm having fun, I tend to forget about everything else.  
  
**Makoto：**  
Lemme check on that wound.  
Oh man, I feel really bad. Looks like it opened up again!  
  
**Makoto：**  
It's not bad though. A little spit will fix that right up.  
Want me to lick it?  
  
**Makoto：**  
I'm kidding! I'm not that much of an animal.  
But laughter's the best medicine, right?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Hey, {player}...  
Thanks. I had a lot of fun today.  
  
**Makoto：**  
I was in a really bad mood because I thought I was in for  
a long, agonizing day of tedious work.  
  
**Makoto：**  
But because of you, it turned out to be a terrific day.  
You probably just feel like I took advantage of you though,  
huh?  
  
**Makoto：**  
Thank you. Really.
