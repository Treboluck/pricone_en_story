## Subtitle: The Fabled Ninpo Chance
  
**Narration：**  
On his way home after finishing his deliveries for the day,  
{player} spots a column of smoke rising nearby.  
  
**Narration：**  
Concerned that there might be a fire, he hurries over,  
only to find Ninon fanning a pile of burning twigs and leaves.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Fwippy-fwoosh!  
Flappity-flap! Foo, foo!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What are you doing?  
`Tag 1`  
**Ninon：**  
Hey! The shogun graces the scene!  
You came so quickly. This new training  
 was a great success!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hm? No, there's no nasty fire.  
This is a smoke signal. A technique from the east!  
You raise a column of smoke to communicate with faraway allies!  
  
**Ninon：**  
The fine weather today seemed good for visibility,  
so I thought I should try it out!  
  
**Ninon：**  
As you see, to make the smoke nice and thick,  
a ninja must gather lots of tiny twigs and dry leaves.  
  
**Ninon：**  
The work wasn't easy,  
but in all things, the key is to take it  
 one small step at a time!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  What did you call me for?  
`Tag 2`  
**Ninon：**  
Oh! Good question!  
I summoned you here today  
to take you to a certain very special location!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Where it lies may be  
 easy to guess from my outfit!  
This is the traditional ninja uniform of the eastern lands!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Well then,  
 let us go forth at once!  
  
**Narration：**  
So saying, Ninon leads the way to a corner  
of the town of Oedo, brimming with traditional eastern culture,  
where many customers are enjoying a shuriken-throwing attraction.  
  
**Boy：**  
Hahhh!  
All right! I hit the bullseye!  
  
**Old Man：**  
Hohohoh. Young man, you are quite skilled.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Here, young and old alike can enjoy the ninja way!  
Isn't it the picture of the perfect city?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Shogun, I know you are very busy with conquering the lands.  
But that's why I think you need rest sometimes,  
so I brought you to this ninja play spot to have fun!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Now, Shogun! Lend me your hands!  
I've booked us the all-you-can-throw plan,  
so shuri those kens to your heart's content!  
  
**Ninon：**  
...Hmm?  
Why are you just standing and staring at the shuriken?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  How do I throw this?  
`Tag 3`  
**Ninon：**  
Oh no! But of course!  
A true shogun needs no weapon but his own glory,  
so naturally you would never have handled a shuriken!  
  
**Ninon：**  
In that case, I will demonstrate  
 the proper technique!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Incredible, Shogun!  
Normally, beginners can't even throw them straight,  
but you managed to hit the target already!  
 Bravo!  
  
**Ninon：**  
With your abilities,  
you may even be able to use Shuriken Ninpo before the day is out!  
  
**Ninon：**  
In a real shuriken contest,  
each contestant has the right to use any one ninja technique.  
This is called the Ninpo Chance.  
  
**Ninon：**  
This important rule can decide the whole match!  
As such, you would do well to learn the ninja ways with me!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Still, I think first you should work on your basic control.  
  
**Ninon：**  
The spot where your shuriken struck just now  
would qualify for third-place Makushita rank in sumo wrestling terms.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Let's aim high  
 and try to hit the Yokozuna Zone in the middle!  
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hmm?! The shuriken you just threw was suddenly deflected?!  
  
**???：**  
Well dang, I'm real sorry.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Wh-who goes there?!  
  
**Shuriken Master：**  
Oh, I'm just a humble master of the shuriken,  
wandering the lands to spread word of my skills!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Deflecting a thrown shuriken from its noble path  
 is awful manners!  
And worse, that was the shogun's shuriken!  
  
**Shuriken Master：**  
Well, it just looked so feeble, you see.  
I thought it was a half-dead insect,  
so I acted on instinct to put it out of its misery.  
  
**Shuriken Master：**  
Hmm. Looks like you're the top shuriken player in these parts.  
What do you say the two of us have a little match?  
Show me what the level's like around here.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Very well! I'll let you taste my shuriken of justice!  
The time is clearly ripe to purge Oedo of evil!  
  
**Narration：**  
Thus begins a contest of shuriken skill. After a thrilling struggle,  
Ninon finds herself slightly behind in the final round.  
Neither contestant has yet made use of their one-time Ninpo Chance.  
  
**Ninon：**  
*pant*... *pant*... You are not without skill...  
  
**Shuriken Master：**  
Yeah, I gotta say you're a worthier foe than I thought.  
Still, you're not beating me!  
I'll finish this with my final throw! Hahhh!  
  
**Shuriken Master：**  
Yeah! With all those points, I've left you in the dust!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Urghh... Impressive indeed.  
But why did you not make use of your Ninpo Chance?  
  
**Shuriken Master：**  
Hahahah. Oh, I'll be using it all right!  
Take this!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ahhh! He spread spiny caltrops on my throwing zone?!  
But now I'll have to throw from even further away...  
  
**Shuriken Master：**  
Why waste my Ninpo Chanceon attacking the target?  
Call me underhanded, but this is my style of play.  
If you want to surrender, now's your chance!  
  
**Ninon：**  
I will never surrender to you!  
  
**Ninon：**  
But winning from this distance won't be easy...  
Can any ninpo really turn this around?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Are you going to lose?  
`Tag 4`  
**Ninon：**  
No! This match is not yet lost!  
If my shuriken strikes the Yokozuna Zone, victory will be mine!  
  
**Ninon：**  
But... how can I strike such a small target from here...?  
This is my last and only chance at victory...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  The key is to take it one small step at a time.  
`Tag 5`  
**Ninon：**  
Oh, Shogun! Surely you jest.  
Shuriken throwing is different from making smoke signals.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hm...?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Smoke signals?  
By burning many small twigs and leaves,  
one can create a single great pillar...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ahh!  
 Shogun, I see the path to victory!  
  
**Shuriken Master：**  
Hm? Looks like you've had an idea.  
But I doubt any ninpo will help your shuriken  
find its mark from that distance!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Deke-deke-den!  
One! Muncher of food, roasted or stewed...  
  
**Shuriken Master：**  
...?!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Two! Lowly ninja though I be...  
  
**Shuriken Master：**  
Wh-what's all this nonsense...?!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Three! My shogun's honor I carry with pride!  
De-de-den! Here I go!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Behold, one and all! Ninpo: Shadow Clone Shuriken Throw!  
Fwippy-fwoosh... Shwababababa!  
  
**Ninon：**  
How's that?! This is my ultimate turnabout ninpo!  
Even the smallest scores, in great number, add up to a mighty total!  
With my shogun, I hereby raise  
 a pillar of victory smoke!  
  
**Shuriken Master：**  
H-hold on! That's not a real technique!  
You just made it up, didn't you?!  
  
**Shuriken Master：**  
Each player gets a set number of throws!  
You can't just go and throw all those shuriken at once!  
  
**Boy：**  
Whoa, you're amazing!  
I've never seen any ninpo that cool before!  
  
**Old Man：**  
'Twas the finest technique I've seen in all my many years.  
I feel truly honored to have witnessed it.  
Now I can die without regrets...  
  
**Attraction Owner：**  
Young miss, no need for payment!  
I can't charge you after that display.  
You and your friend can play all you like for free!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Heheheh.  
It would seem the people of Oedo Town  
have the spirits of true ninjas in their hearts!  
  
**Shuriken Master：**  
I... I'm not convinced,  
 but fine! Have it your way!  
I'll be back to take the win I deserve! You mark my words!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Eat my ninja shorts!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Now! We have defeated that foul ruffian,  
and protected this place of ninja fun.  
I think that counts as a job well done!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Shogun, let us resume  
 our shuriken training!  
  
**Narration：**  
Proud that she had performed a great deed for her shogun,  
Ninon went right back to her day of fun with {player}.
