## Subtitle: Wanna Go on a Date?
  
**Matsuri：**  
*munch*... *munch*... *munch*...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Whew! I'm stuffed now!  
That was delicious!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Man, sorry, {player}...  
I didn't mean to keep you.  
But we ended up hanging out till the sun went down...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
We watched that whole magical girl show  
to the final curtain call...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
By the end, I'd become such a fan,  
we had to hunt the shops for Bella-Lou merch...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But I had barely any cash left,  
so all I could buy was a few trinkets...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
See, I got this Bella-Lou themed eraser,  
and this hanky, and a neat mug, too!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eheheh.  
 They're all pink and cute...  
I've never owned anything like them before.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
My room back home is all full of boyish stuff,  
so I guess these are really gonna stand out.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Anyways!  
I had a really great time today, {player}.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
You're kind of like the big brother I always wanted.  
I'm an only child, see.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Still... I've gotta wonder,  
why are you actually doing all this stuff for me?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I mean, I guess it's fine...  
But you even bought me dinner,  
so I feel kinda bad, you know?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'll always remember what you did for me.  
Defenders of justice never forget, you know!  
 Heheh!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Although... I'd hate to stay in debt to you.  
And it feels kinda weird somehow to let a guy treat me to a meal...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So I'll pay you back for the meal and stuff.  
My next payday's a month from now,  
so can we meet up then?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
And, uh, if you wouldn't mind,  
we could hang out and stuff again...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? {player}?  
I thought you seemed kinda quiet, but...  
Did you fall asleep?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Well, we did walk a bunch today, and had tons of fun.  
I guess it must've tired you out.  
 ...Wahh?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wh-what's all this light?  
It's so bright!  
  

---  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Check it out, Bossman!  
There are so many tigers!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
This zoo is famous for its tigers and lions, y'know!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
That's why they've got all these plushies and other merch!  
See? It's tigers and lions as far as the eye can see!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hahah.  
 Hey, did you know?  
Tigers are actually stronger than lions in a fight!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Like I thought, nothing beats Tora Tiger!  
He's stronger than the king of beasts! The ultimate warrior!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...Bossman?  
Huh? Where'd you go?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? Wait, huh...?  
Don't tell me I've gone and gotten myself lost?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Bossman!  
Where are you?! If you're there, say something!  
Waaaaahhh!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Answer her immediately.  
**Choice: (2)**  Stay quiet a little longer.  
`Tag 1`  
**Matsuri：**  
Whoa?  
Ahh!  
 I can hear Bossman's voice!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But where is he?  
Over here?  
Eheheh... We playing hide-and-seek now?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Aha!  
 Found you!  
Seriously, Bossman, don't just run off like that!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Matsuri：**  
Bossman...?  
I can't see him anywhere.  
I've totally lost him...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Urgh... I'm all on my own.  
Bossman? Bossman!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Waahhh?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
B... Bossman!  
Don't creep up silently behind me like that!  
I get scared easily, you know?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Matsuri：**  
So, uh...  
When you vanished just now,  
where did you actually go?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ahaha.  
I was staring at the tiger plushies for so long,  
you thought I wanted one and went to buy it?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Is that a present for me, then?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
W... Wow, thanks!  
I totally love it, but you really didn't have to...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Still, we can't go and give it back now,  
and I did really want one of those...  
All right then! I'll take good care of it!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Thanks, Bossman!  
You're the best!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eheheh!  
Well, I guess there's no point  
wasting our whole day at the zoo in the gift shop.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
You wanna head off somewhere else, then?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I mean, uh...  
I guess you don't have to come along with me  
if you don't want to.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
It was only coincidence that we met here  
and ended up looking at the gifts together.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hey, actually, what're you doing here  
at the zoo in the first place?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Myself, I came 'cause I heard  
they're gonna be putting on a hero show near here!  
But... I've got some time to kill before it starts.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
The same ticket gets you into the zoo as well,  
so I figured I might as well drop by while I'm waiting.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So... how about you, then?  
Do you just love animals or something?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eheheh.  
Animal lovers are always good people.  
Tora Tiger said that the other day! On TV!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So I guess that makes you a good person too, huh?  
A regular nice guy?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh?  
You sometimes go and help Jun out  
with the hero show she performs in...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
And as thanks, she gave you a free pass that lets you get in  
to all the amusements and stuff around here?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
It's a couples' ticket, so you could've come with a girl if you wanted...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But sadly, you didn't know who to invite,  
so you just came to look around on your own?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ohhh?  
Don't you have, like, a girlfriend or anything?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
That's a surprise!  
I mean, whenever I see you, you always seem to be with a girl...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ahaha.  
Sorry, did I hurt your feelings?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
You know, the heroes on TV are so busy with saving the world,  
they don't usually go out with anyone either!  
Nope, not even a single date!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So it's totally fine!  
No need to get all gloomy! Let's have fun at the zoo!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eheheh.  
I see now... The zoo's full of couples in love,  
so it was getting you down, huh.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Well, I guess the zoo *is* a classic date spot.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hmm...  
All right, let's do this.  
Since you're so lonely, I'll go on a little date with you!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I know I'm just a kid,  
so it's not gonna be like a real date or anything...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But I still like you a whole lot!  
So, uhhh...  
Let's have fun together, yeah?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...Is that no good?  
Am I just making things worse?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wh-whoa!  
 No need for the sudden hug attack!  
\"Thank you, thank you\"?! Are you that grateful?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eheheh.  
Well, helping out people in trouble  
is what defenders of justice do!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So c'mon. Wipe that frown off your face...  
And let's have a great day at the zoo! Just the two of us together!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
What'cha waiting for?  
We can't just stare at the plushies forever!  
Let's go see some *real* tigers next!

**Ameth：**  
Aaaand... welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Everything you just saw was something like a dream.  
  
**Ameth：**  
A special dream I put together for you,  
based on your old memories with Matsuri.  
Sort of like a movie, I suppose.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Don't think too hard about it right now.  
You'll forget it all when you wake up, anyway.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Really, though...  
You were pretty pathetic there, {player}.  
  
**Ameth：**  
A pity date at the zoo?  
And with a grade-schooler, no less?  
That's not something to brag about.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, as long as you had fun, I guess.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's a good kid, that Matsuri.  
Most of the stuff she says is straight out of those hero shows,  
but I think she honestly believes it all.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's positive, straightforward, and incredibly purehearted.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Sadly, though...  
Unlike the idealized world of those shows,  
real life is full of ugly complications.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I can't help but worry  
that she's in for a nasty shock someday.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I hope you'll keep that in mind and watch over her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That little defender of justice  
was there for you when you were feeling down,  
so the least you can do is try to repay her for that.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Be nice to her, consider her feelings,  
and if you ever see a frown on her face,  
it's your turn to change it into a smile.

**Matsuri：**  
Zzz... Zzz... ♪  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...Uhhh?  
Huh...?  
Was I totally out for the count?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Feels like I had a really nice dream just now.  
A bit of a girly one, though.  
I think I was on a date with some really cute guy...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hmmm...  
Honestly, I'd rather dream about being a superhero!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Is that weird of me, do you think?  
...{player}?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Oh, you must've zonked out too, huh?  
See, you've been drooling all over the place!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Me too?  
Waagh! I totally have!  
Urghhh... *rub rub*  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Heheh.  
After that nap, it's really getting super late now, huh?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
If I don't get back soon,  
my mom and dad are gonna be worried.  
I'm such a bad girl today.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh?  
You think I'm... a good girl?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eheheh. Well, thanks!  
I work hard every day to prove I'm on the side of righteousness!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Not that I'm any good at it yet.  
But someday, I'll get there.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I've gotta become a real defender of justice.  
Because that's always been my dream.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So y'see... I don't exactly have time  
to go on dates with cute guys like a normal girl!
