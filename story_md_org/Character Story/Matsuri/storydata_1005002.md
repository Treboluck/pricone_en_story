## Subtitle: Just an Accessory?
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huhhhh...?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
This is weird.  
The path's getting rougher and rougher...  
In fact, I don't think we're even on a path anymore!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
{player}, hang on a minute!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Instead of just taking action,  
we should stop and think first!  
That's what the other knights are always telling me!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hmmm... Uhhh...?  
Yep... I'm pretty sure we're deep in the woods!  
How'd that happen? We must've taken a wrong turn somewhere!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So, uh...  
Let's think back and remember how we got here, OK?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I was on a mission for Nightmare...  
 well, just an errand really...  
to deliver a letter to someone in the next village over.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
It's just down Esterella Road, where there are barely any monsters...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So they figured even a greenhorn like me could handle it.  
Just a simple mission, no real danger involved.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But I had the bad luck to run into a monster...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Which was when you suddenly showed up,  
and thanks to that weird power of yours,  
I was able to fight the monster off.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
That all sounds right, doesn't it?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Then once we beat the monster,  
you said you'd come with me to make sure I was safe.  
Must've been really bored or something, I guess.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But, well, I was actually really happy  
to have some company on the road...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So I kinda stopped looking at the map  
and just kept chatting away while walking...  
And I guess that's how we got lost.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I... I can hear it now.  
\"How could you screw up a mission this simple?\"  
The other knights are gonna be so mad...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
And even besides that,  
the forest's a dangerous place, full of monsters...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wh-wh-wh... What now?  
I think we're in big trouble!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I guess there's not much for it  
but to head back the way we came, right?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Agreed.  
**Choice: (2)**  Are you sure?  
`Tag 1`  
**Matsuri：**  
Y-yeah, that's gotta be our best shot. Uhhhh...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
D'you remember which direction we actually came from?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? Huh?  
Did I say something wrong, {player}?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
If anything I said was weird, you gotta set me straight!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Matsuri：**  
Uwahh?  
{player}, don't pull my hand so suddenly!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
There's like, y'know, sticks and rocks all over the ground here,  
so I'm gonna trip over if I'm not careful!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Uhhh...  
Do you know the way back, {player}?  
You sure seem to be pretty confident where you're going!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
All right then!  
I guess I'll trust you and see where you take us!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hmhmhm~♪  
Comin' through, comin' through~♪  
  
**Matsuri：**  
{player}?  
Umm, is it just me, or are the woods getting denser?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Are you sure this is the right way?  
I'm starting to get really worried over here!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? You saw some footprints,  
so you thought you'd just follow them?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...Ummm.  
I'm pretty sure those aren't human footprints.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
They look... more like...  
some kind of big, scary monster's footprints...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
The sort of monster  
that'd probably gobble us up in two seconds flat...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Aagh! What was that growling noise?!  
It's right nearby! The big, scary monster!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Um, {player}, don't say a word...  
Let's just stay really quiet and slooowly turn and run for it.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
My sixth sense is screaming at me  
that we're in big, big, big trouble right now!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
H-huh?  
O-o-oh heck, I'm sorry!  
My legs just buckled underneath me!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I don't think I can move...  
I'm so ashamed...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
The heroes of justice in stage plays and stuff  
always stay cool no matter how bad things get...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
U-urghhh...  
Am I never gonna be able to be like Tora Tiger after all?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wahhh?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
{player}, are you trying to carry me out of here?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Th-thanks a bunch!  
I'm shaking so bad, I really can't stand on my own...  
Even the fur on my tail's standing on end!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...Ahh, forget I said that!  
It might look like I actually have a tail,  
but this is, uhhh, just, you know, a decoration...?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
It's not real!  
It's like a sort of accessory!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Y-you believe me, right?  
Please! Pretend like you never heard anything!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh?  
\"Forget the tail, we need to get out of this forest\"?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Good point, I guess.  
You're totally right, {player}!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
*sniff sniff*...  
I've got a good sense of smell,  
so I might be able to sniff out the way we came!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I think it's that way!  
I can't let you do all the work, so at least let me guide you!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? That's \"almost like an animal\"?  
D-d-d-don't be ridiculous!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Of course I'm not like an animal!  
What d'you think I am, a beastgirl or something?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eek!  
P-please don't grab my tail like that!  
It's really sensitive, you know!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wait... I mean...  
It's just an accessory, so of course I didn't feel a thing!  
I'm just talking total nonsense, that's all!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So, uh... Uhhh...  
Let's hurry up and get ourselves the heck outta here  
before we run into any monsters!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Less thinking about anything I just said,  
and more running as fast as you can, got that?!
