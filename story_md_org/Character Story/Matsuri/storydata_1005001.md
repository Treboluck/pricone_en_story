**Matsuri：**  
Ta-da-daaaaa!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Feast your eyes!  
It's the fearless superhero of the forest,  
 Tora Tiger! ☆  
  
**Matsuri：**  
If a cry for help rings out far off in the west,  
he'll be there in a flash to clear things up!  
If a villain's schemes cause chaos in the east,  
 he'll—whoaaa?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
A-ahhh!  
 You scared me!  
Please don't leap out of the bushes all of a sudden!  
You'll give me a heart attack!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Honestly... That took years off my life!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
It'd be no laughing matter if I died from a basic jumpscare  
before even becoming a true hero of justice!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...Hmm? Hang on!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I think... we've met before somewhere, haven't we?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
That face looks totally familiar!  
Ummm, so wait... Do you remember me at all?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You're... Tora Tiger!  
**Choice: (2)**  You're... Matsuri!  
`Tag 1`  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh?  
Oh! That's right!  
It's me,  the legendary hero of justice, Tora Tiger...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...'s biggest fan. My real name's Matsuri.  
Tora Tiger is a character who appears in stage plays and stuff.  
A fictional hero of justice.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
He doesn't actually exist.  
I'm not a little kid anymore, so of course I understand that.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But it's precisely because Tora Tiger doesn't exist  
that it's up to me to live by his words and deeds!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'll become a real-life hero of justice!  
The Tora Tiger this world needs!

`Tag 2`  
**Matsuri：**  
Oh,  
 great!  
You actually remembered, huh?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
That's right!  
I'm an apprentice knight and member of Nightmare!  
The name's Matsuri!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Matsuri：**  
Hohoh!  
Still, I didn't expect to randomly run into you here!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wait, what was your actual name again?  
Sorry, I guess I'm the one whose memory needs work!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Real sorry about that.  
I've gotta get better at learning names and faces!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hmmm.  
So your name's {player}, is it?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
That's right, I remember.  
It's all coming back to me now, honest!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Last time we met, we were all in a bit of a rush,  
and I was still kinda sleepy,  
so I don't think I ever introduced myself properly...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So let's just say  
 it's a pleasure to meet you now! ♪  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...Wait, huh?  
{player}, why're you backing away from me like that?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Um, you shouldn't be scared of me!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I get the feeling...  
You don't exactly have the greatest impression  
of us knights of Nightmare, do you?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
After all, you're a mystery guy who popped up out of nowhere.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So I guess we've mostly been grilling you for info  
or trying to take you into custody as a suspected criminal, huh?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'm pretty sorry about all that stuff.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
The others have told me all about you now,  
so I know you're not actually a bad person or anything.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'm not gonna attack you,  
so could you let your guard down a little?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh?  
There's a monster right behind me?  
Ohhhh! *That's* why you were backing away slowly!  
  
**魔物：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
N-n-n-not good!  
Waaagh, there really is a monster!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
G-g-g-get back! {player}!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'll take care of this!  
As a proud member of Nightmare,  
I've gotta protect the innocent!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
H... Hiyaaahhh!  
  
**魔物：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
*huff*... *puff*... *huff*... *puff*...  
I... I... I beat it!  
Whew... I thought I was a goner!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Actually, that's pretty weird.  
To be honest, I'm still just a greenhorn.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Even when facing the weakest monsters,  
I've never been able to do much more than run.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But somehow I actually won!  
Yayyy! This must mean I'm finally getting stronger!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'm one step closer to becoming  
an invincible superhero like Tora Tiger!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh?  
You used some kind of weird ability  
to power me up in battle?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So that's how I won!  
 Right...  
Well, now I feel pretty dumb for getting all excited.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...Hmm?  
What is it now, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Thanks for protecting me.  
`Tag 4`  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh?!  
 Eheheh...  
W-w-w-well, of course!  
Your thanks are unnecessary!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Protecting the citizens of this country  
is what us knights of Nightmare are here for!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But... it makes me super happy all the same!  
This may just be one small victory,  
but it means an awful lot to me personally!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Heck, I should be thanking you!  
{player}, thanks so much for letting me protect you!
