**Matsuri：**  
Zzz... Zzz... ♪  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Mmn... mmnhh...?  
Huh?  
Where... am I?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Uhhhh...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Right, I think it's coming back to me...  
This is the Sarendia Orphanage, right?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I came here to see if I could find {player},  
and try to wipe his memories.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But in the end, he promised he wouldn't tell a single soul  
that I'm really a beastgirl...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So I didn't need to physically whack  
those problematic memories out of his head.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Honestly, that was a pretty dumb idea, even for me.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
It's such a relief not to have to hide anything from him anymore...  
Feels pretty good. All's well that ends well!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But then...  
 Since all that worrying I did  
had been keeping me up at night...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
As soon as I knew it was all over,  
I guess my sleepiness must've caught up with me.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So wait, did {player} carry me over to this bed  
while making sure not to wake me up?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
He really is a super nice guy...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eheheh.  
I guess this must be his bed, huh?  
The smell of the sheets kinda reminds me of him...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hmm? Actually, it's more than just \"kinda.\"  
It smells almost like he's right here next to me!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Don't tell me... he's in the bed too?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
N-n-n-no way!  
That's not right at all! That's a big no-no!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hmm?  
Oh... he's just sitting next to the bed.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I guess he must've gotten sleepy himself  
while he was watching over me.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
He's completely zonked out with his head resting on the sheets.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eheheh. He looks pretty cute, actually.  
Kind of... comforting to look at.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wahh?!  
Huh? What's all this light?!  
Aaargh, it's totally blinding me!  
  

---  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Urghh... I don't wanna!  
Injections are the worst!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wha...?  
Oh! Bossman!  
What're you doing at the clinic?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Oh? You think you've caught a bit of a seasonal cold?  
So you came to get a quick checkup  
and pick up some medicine?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Yeesh, you gotta be more careful!  
Health is king, y'know!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh?  
 No, it's not like I'm sick or anything!  
I just... had to come in for some routine shots...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Actually, I was supposed to have them at school,  
along with all the other kids,  
 but uh...  
I kinda chickened out and ran away.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'd never show fear in the face of evil,  
but injections are different!  
They're the worst!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But they told me I've gotta have this one no matter what...  
My dad picked me up and physically carried me all the way here.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Urghh...  
I bet my dad must've been brainwashed by an evil organization!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
If he was himself, he'd never make his own daughter go through this!  
Right, Bossman?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  R... right.  
**Choice: (2)**  Well, I'm glad you're not sick.  
`Tag 1`  
**Matsuri：**  
Yeah! I knew it!  
You always know where it's at, Bossman.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
This is all the work of an evil conspiracy!  
I can't let them stick their needles in me!  
Waaaahhh... Save me, Tora Tiger!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh?  
Oh... well, yeah.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
No worries there! I'm as healthy as a healthy girl can be!  
I don't even remember the last time I caught a cold! Eheh!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So y'see, I don't need these vaccines!  
Even without those nasty needles, germs are no match for me!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I swear I'll stay healthy  
until I die at the age of, like, a hundred!

**Matsuri：**  
Waaaaghh! This is so not happening!  
You can't make me do it!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Injections are total insanity!  
They stick an actual needle in your arm!  
And then pump you full of chemicals!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
What devil thought that up?!  
It's too scary!  
Stop it, stop it, stop it! I'm not doing it!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Urghh... What's that, Bossman?  
A hero ought to face their fears?  
W-well, that's totally true, but...!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Then... Bossman...  
Can you help me be brave... and hold my hand while they do it?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
If you squeeze my hand really tight,  
I think I might be able to bear the fear and the pain.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hero's Code, Rule the Sixth!  
\"With friends by your side, there's nothing to fear!\"  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So please, Bossman...  
I need you to help me!

**Ameth：**  
Aaaand welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Haha.  
You really did do a good job in there.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She calls you \"Bossman,\" but for a moment there,  
it was more like you were her big brother!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Actually, I don't suppose this matters,  
but why *does* the Matsuri over \"there\"  
always call you \"Bossman,\" anyway?  
  
**Ameth：**  
In \"our\" world, she just calls you by your name, right?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hmm... Looking through your memories,  
it seems like she even called you \"Master\" at one point.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I guess little differences will happen  
when you meet in completely different ways.  
  
**Ameth：**  
At any rate, it's clear that she sees you  
as some kind of role model to look up to.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyone can see she thinks the world of you right now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Haha.  
So you'd better make sure  
you don't do anything to shatter that opinion.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm sure I don't need to tell you this,  
but kids her age can be very vulnerable emotionally.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She might like to act like she's got everything all figured out,  
but as you just saw, she has her weaknesses.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Injections are one, and those ears and tail are another.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Even so.  
When it comes to you in particular...  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's even willing to open up a little  
about those sensitive issues that really hurt her.  
That's how much trust she has in you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So you'd better not betray that trust.  
Not when she cares for you like a brother... a \"best bud\"...  
  
**Ameth：**  
And maybe even something even more special than that.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Huh? You don't know what I mean?  
Well, some things you just have to work out for yourself.

**Matsuri：**  
M-mmnhh...  
Huh? Did I fall asleep again?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Oh! You're awake too now, huh, {player}?  
You were fast asleep a few minutes ago!  
Didja have any fun dreams?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Actually, I think the dream I had just now  
might've had you in it!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wahh?!  
Wh-what's the hand on the forehead for?  
Yeesh, you can be way too touchy-feely sometimes!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Not that I mind, I guess...  
Actually, I kind of like it when you pat my head...  
I get so happy, my tail starts wagging on its own!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But...!  
It makes me feel weirdly excited too, so you should stop.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh?  
I fell asleep really suddenly, so you were worried about me?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
So... you were just trying to check  
if I had a fever or anything?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh?! After you carried me to bed,  
you actually called a doctor?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
That's so over the top...  
I'm just tired from lack of sleep!  
 I don't need to see a doctor!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'm... not exactly good with doctors.  
They always want to stick needles in you and stuff.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Still... it was nice of you to worry.  
I can tell  
 how much you genuinely care about me...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
It's an honor.  
I seriously appreciate it.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eheheh.  
Somehow whenever I spend time with you,  
my life seems way happier than usual...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I feel all warm and fuzzy.  
You know, I really like you a lot, {player}!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I didn't know it was possible to like someone this much...  
But I really do.
