Tra la la~♪  
Tra la la~♪  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Heheheh.  
So this is what it feels like to be on cloud nine!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ahh, it's like my feet aren't even touching the ground!  
I'm not walking with my tail, am I?  
Hahaha!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wait,  
 I shouldn't be saying that!  
Gotta keep my mouth shut!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I can't let anybody know that I'm really a beastgirl!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
After all, throughout history,  
Nightmare has always been an enemy to beastfolk....  
I don't really know the reason why, but...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
It was hard work getting myself a position  
as an apprentice knight in the Nightmare ranks.  
Hiding my ears with a hat, swearing my tail was just an accessory...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
To be honest, I'm shocked that it actually worked...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Well, it's not like they did any physical checkups...  
I guess Captain Jun, who did my interview,  
must've just seen the passion in my eyes!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Still, can't let my guard down.  
If they find out I'm a beastgirl, they might kick me straight back out!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Can't have an enemy race in the ranks...  
I totally wouldn't have a leg to stand on.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
The guild has started to feel like home,  
and I really get along with some of the other members, like Tomo.  
I can't ruin all that by getting kicked out now.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
No way, no way, no WAY  
am I letting anyone know I'm a beastgirl!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh?  
What's up with that crowd over there?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hmmm...?  
What could they be doing?  
 Putting on some sort of show?  
Since I'm so short, I can't see a thing through all those people!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Whoaaa?!  
Ahhh, that surprised me!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? {player}, it's you!  
How's it going? Haven't seen you in a while!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...No, before we get into any small talk...  
Could you maybe put me down?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I thought I was being kidnapped!  
At least say something before you lift me up!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I was so shocked, my legs almost gave out beneath me again!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Though, well, it was actually a bit of a help.  
I can see what's going on over there now! Haha!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hmm?  
 Looks like they really are putting on a show.  
There's people fighting each other in costumes!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ooh!  
Could it be one of those hero shows I love?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hmmm?  
Actually, I guess it's not quite like that.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
The audience is full of little girls,  
and I don't see anyone dressed like a cool hero!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ohhh, now I get it.  
It's a \"Magical Girl Bella-Lou\" show, huh?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Bah, so it's just some girly nonsense.  
Heroes and magical girls are totally different things.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Aren't they both defenders of justice?  
**Choice: (2)**  You're a girl too, aren't you?  
`Tag 1`  
**Matsuri：**  
Hmm?  
It's not like that!  
Ahhh, why don't you get it?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Magical girls are all about \"love\" and \"kindness,\"  
but real heroes are about justice and courage!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? You don't see how that makes a difference?  
They both transform and fight evil and are popular with kids?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hmm...?  
I'm not sure if I can really explain it.  
But they're *so* not the same!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? Well, yeah, I am...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Hang on, {player}...  
You didn't think I might actually be a boy, did you?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
That's kind of harsh!  
I know everyone says I've got a pretty boyish look...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
And my mom and dad  
are always telling me to act a bit more feminine...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
But, well... I just don't really get  
the sorts of things the other girls are into!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
They're all cute, and fuzzy, and sickly-sweet...  
Is it so weird if I don't like that?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Matsuri：**  
Ah well, whatever.  
Point is, Bella-Lou isn't my kinda thing.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'm not gonna stick around to watch her show,  
so it'd be great if you could put me down now.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eheheh...  
Actually, the thing is, today was payday at Nightmare!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I know I'm only an apprentice,  
but they still gave me a little cash!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I mean, it's really not much more than a kid's allowance...  
But I spent it on a cool Tora Tiger action figure!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Check it out!  
This figure's from an older season,  
 so it was going cheap!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
I'm gonna take it home and play the day away!  
I'll make it do all the cool poses, battle against my monster plushies...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
That's why I'm kind of in a hurry today!  
No time to be wasting here!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
How 'bout you?  
You wanna play Tora Tiger with me?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...Well, I guess you're probably a bit too old  
for those sorts of childish games...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? You're totally into that?  
Huh... You think it's 'cause of your amnesia,  
but you seem to find kids' games tons of fun lately?  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Well then, let's play together!  
I'll be Tora Tiger, of course,  
so you can try playing the monsters and villains!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eheh!  
I won't let anyone steal my position as the hero!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...Wait, this is bad. My home's over in the beastfolk quarter,  
and my mom and dad are both blatantly beastfolk.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
If I invite him over, he'll find out my secret for sure.  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Wh-what do I do?  
Playing hero games with {player}  
does sound like so much fun...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Waugh?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ahh, that loud noise really made me jump!  
This Magical Girl Bella-Lou show sure isn't skimping on the effects...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
They're even using real magic... It's a pretty impressive sight!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
And they really go all-out when they fight...  
Almost like real heroes...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ahh! Look out!  
The villain's right behind you, Bella-Lou!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Ahhh!  
 She dodged it at the last second!  
Awesome!  
 She's such a cool fighter! ☆  
  
**Matsuri：**  
...Guehh!  
What am I saying? I almost started cheering for Bella-Lou!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Huh? There's nothing wrong with that?  
Well, I guess not...  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Bella-Lou *is* fighting to defend the peace,  
just like the great hero Tora Tiger!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
She deserves our support!  
Apprentice or not, I'm a knight of Nightmare...  
An ally of justice in the world!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Which makes Bella-Lou my comrade-in-arms, right?!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Go for it! Take 'em down!  
Bella-Lou!  
  
**Matsuri：**  
Eheheh.  
I guess it's not good to discriminate.  
Maybe the stuff girls like  
 isn't so bad after all!
