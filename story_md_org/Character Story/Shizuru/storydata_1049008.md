## Subtitle: Wherever You Go
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yaaagh!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
That was close!  
Are you okay?  
You're not hurt, are you?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh hey,  
it's you!  
Fancy meeting you here!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
No really, I promise! This time, it's an actual coincidence.  
I'm as shocked as you are!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
So what brings you all the way out here?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Wow, a new job, huh?  
You're delivering mail between Landosol and the farm?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You sure do take on a lot of odd jobs.  
I'm worried about you.  
Don't overwork yourself and keel over on me, okay?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Though it's certainly more productive than just  
lazing about at home all day.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Who, me?  
Well, as you can see,  
I came to the farm to practice riding horseback!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But then you came along,  
and I nearly ran you over...  
Oh, my blood ran cold!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yeah.  
Because of all my guild work,  
I have to travel all around the country at times.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I thought horseback riding could be useful,  
so I'm trying to learn!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
After all, it's hard to get to those faraway places by foot.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
See, we tend to run a lean operation,  
so why shell out for a whole cart  
if we could just rent a single horse instead?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
If you'd like...  
I could take you home on him, {player}.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
My contract with the farm  
says I have the horse for a whole month,  
so I can ride him home and everything!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I'm one of those people  
who picks things up right away.  
Those mountain roads will be a cinch!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
So come on up! Go on, don't be shy!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yeah, there we go!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Now, grab on real tight to me.  
Otherwise, you might get thrown off the horse.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Go on, tighter!  
Get nice and snug!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
All right, let's ride! Giddyup!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Eek?!  
Hey, {player}? You're glowing again!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It's so bright!  
Shoot, the mysterious light is startling the horse...!

**Shizuru：**  
Heehee. Isn't this fun?  
Just a nice day out with your favorite sister.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I woke up early  
just to come wake you up and everything...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But you were already awake before I got there!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Darn it!  
I really wanted to wake you up today!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I guess you're a strong, independent man now.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It's a good thing, but it still makes me sad.  
'Cause now you can live just fine on your own...  
No need for your big sister to be around anymore...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I'm just used goods now...  
A sister nobody needs...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh? That's not true?  
You still need me?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yeah, you're right!  
Oh, I'm so glad you're so honest, {player}!  
Let's stay together foreeever! Heehee! ♪

**Shizuru：**  
Oopsie-daisy.  
Let's not make  
too much of a scene in here.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Do you want me to carry some of those bags?  
I got a little carried away and bought too much.  
It's gotta be heavy...  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You sure you're okay?  
Oh, right. You're all big and strong now.  
I guess I didn't need to ask.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Welllll then, I'll have a bit more faith in my big,  
strong brother  
and buy something even heavier next!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I really want some new cookware!  
Let's see what they've got!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I see...  
So  
you broke your rice bowl recently, huh?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Well, now's the perfect opportunity to replace it!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Leave it to me.  
I'll pick out a really nice one!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Let's see, you've liked light blue ever since you were little.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
So what do you think of these?  
Or maybe you'd prefer the Tower Rangers one?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm fine with whatever.  
**Choice: (2)**  I want to find one on my own.  
`Tag 1`  
**Shizuru：**  
Aww, what?  
We've really gotta get you to be more autonomous.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, but wait!  
Maybe this just means you trust my judgment wholeheartedly!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Well then...  
I'll pick something a bit less haphazardly.  
Hmm... How about this one?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
No, that's probably too big for your hands. This one?  
Um... Umm... Ummm!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Shizuru：**  
Huh? It's your bowl,  
so you'll pick it yourself?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, you little stinker!  
You've never been able to decide on these things!  
You always had me pick everything for you!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shizuru：**  
*giggle* Hey, look.  
Notice all these young-looking couples around?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
They must be buying supplies for married life!  
Do you think we look like we're doing the same thing?

`image display end`  
**Shizuru：**  
I'm sure someday...  
You'll be in a place like this  
shopping with your real wife.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Probably buying his-and-her teacups together.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It's okay. I know you.  
You're bound to find someone really special.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I mean, you're my precious little brother.  
You have to.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yeah. I feel like it was only yesterday  
you were this tiny little thing.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But everyone has to leave the nest someday.  
Just thinking about it tears me apart!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
When that happens, we probably won't be able to hang out  
every day. Not like we do now.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
I know it's gonna happen,  
but I'm still kind of sad about it.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But don't you worry, {player}!  
Don't you worry at all!  
You'll never have to miss me.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
No matter how far you might go,  
my love for you will never die. ♪

**Ameth：**  
All right, that's enough of that.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I knew this already,  
but you two sure are close.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You know, even blood-related siblings  
tend to stop being so clingy after puberty.  
  
**Ameth：**  
To be honest, I'd call it a little abnormal.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Shizuru seems determined  
to keep on being your \"big sister,\" but...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Is that really all she wants to be?  
I kiiinda get the feeling there's something more to it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Though I don't think she's fully aware of it either.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What about you?  
Do you only see Shizuru  
as your nice older sister who looks after you?  
  
**Ameth：**  
It's fine, really.  
Believe me, I'm not gonna tell you how to live your life.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I just think that the longer you stay like this,  
the worse it's going to get for you two.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh geez. Looks like I picked a bad time to interrupt.  
Better wake up or you're gonna fall off that horse.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Time to open up your eyes, {player}.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And when you do...  
why don't you give your big sister  
a great, big hug?  
  

---  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Whoa! Oh geez! {player}, are you awake?  
Oh, thank goodness!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Honestly!  
You really scared me,  
conking out on me like that!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Luckily we weren't going too fast,  
so you wouldn't have gotten too hurt if you fell.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But if you got trampled underfoot  
you could even have died!  
Please be careful... You really scared me!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
If you're not feeling well,  
I have a rope I can use to tie us together.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Actually, that might not be too bad.  
Not too bad at all! ♪  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Eep!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Wha— Huh?  
{player}?  
You're squeezing me a bit too tight!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
It kinda hurts...  
What's gotten into you?  
You little softy...!  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Oh, you're just holding tight so you don't fall off...  
aren't you?  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Yeah. I can't think of any other reason.  
Y-you kinda startled me, grabbing me out of the blue.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You've gotten a lot stronger.  
In fact, I'd say you've grown a lot.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Heehee. I know you have amnesia,  
so there's a lot you've forgotten.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
But I definitely think  
you're the same old {player} I've always loved.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
See, we used to go home together like this a lot.  
You'd be so exhausted from playing  
that I'd have to carry you piggy-back all the way home.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Of course, I don't think I could do that now, but...  
You can still count on me.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
You can always hold me.  
Always lean on me.  
Always ask me for help.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
That's what gives me life.  
It brings me joy.  
  
**Shizuru：**  
Because I love you.  
My wonderful, kind,  
sweet {player}. ♪
