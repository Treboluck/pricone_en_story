**Narration：**  
On the way home, {player} and Kokkoro  
are enjoying a leisurely walk and conversation.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The weather is lovely today, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
On days like this, I would like nothing better  
than to lie upon the grass and bathe myself in the rays of the sun.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh? That was a rather large yawn, my lord.  
Perhaps we really should stop for a nap?  
  
**Dog：**  
Woof, woof!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. My doggie lord, meanwhile,  
still seems to be brimming with playful energy.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Go on, then. You can take a little run in the fields.  
Just try not to stray so far that we lose sight of you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well then, as for you, my lord, please come here.  
You may use my lap as a pillow to rest awhile.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. Since you have the same name,  
I find myself repeating it so many times.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But it feels so natural  
that I enjoy saying it over and over.  
My lord... My lord... ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Actually, now that I think back, it has been quite some time  
since I first began calling you this way.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Recalling those early days makes me feel...  
 Oh?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This light...  
 Lady Ameth?  
Mmnh... Thank goodness we are resting on this soft grass...  
  

---  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I apologize for calling you out here, my lord.  
It is I, your faithful attendant—Kokoro Natsume.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Oh...  
 I am terribly sorry.  
You did warn me not to address you as \"my lord\" in front of others.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
There are not many people around, so it's OK?  
Well, that is a relief.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
In truth, being unable to address you as \"my lord\"  
always makes me feel a little uneasy.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
My lord... My lord. ♪  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Still, I must say, the weather is hot today.  
Perhaps that is why there are so few people here.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You should drink this.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokoro：**  
This is... a pleasantly cool soft drink?  
And you are giving it to me?  
  
**Kokoro：**  
*gulp, gulp* Thank you very much, my lord.  
You truly are the kindest of fellows.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Oh, but I see you have only a single bottle.  
At this rate, your own thirst will go unquenched.  
But of course, I can hardly reject your most gracious of offers...  
  
**Kokoro：**  
As such, it seems best for us to share this drink together.  
I have already taken a few sips, so, my lord, it is your turn.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Ah,  
 my lord! You drink it with such zeal...! ♪  
Well then, let me have another sip also.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Now then, with our thirst nicely quenched,  
let us discuss what I called you to speak of.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
My lord...  
Does the name \"Minerva\" mean anything to you, perchance?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Minerva...?  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokoro：**  
Originally resident at Wisdom HQ,  
she went missing a little while ago now...  
But recently, I received word from her.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
A message reassuring me that she is safe...  
  
**Kokoro：**  
...and informing me of Queen Labyrinth's Princess Knight.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Wait, when you say Minerva...  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokoro：**  
Yes.  
It is as you suspect.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I refer to the AI who oversees Legend of Astrum.  
Not a human, but an artificial intelligence.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I am very sorry.  
I should have been more clear. Did I take you by surprise?  
  
**Kokoro：**  
The AI administrating Legend of Astrum, Minerva,  
was developed by a team including my father.

**Kokoro：**  
And as for myself, I often assisted in my father's research  
by taking the role of Minerva's conversation partner.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Conversation... partner?  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokoro：**  
My father claims that an AI must develop  
by communicating with living humans.  
This is why I was asked to speak with her in order to foster such growth.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Happy to be of service to my father,  
I spoke with her at length a great many times.  
For the most part, we simply discussed idle everyday matters...  
  
**Kokoro：**  
But as a result of that,  
I have a unique personal connection with Minerva.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
There is one thing that Minerva would often tell me.  
That I must find the one who I am meant to serve.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
And that by learning many things from him,  
I would be able to grow in many ways  
and someday become a match for my own father.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
When I heard these words,  
my young heart began to race with excitement.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
At the thought, the mere idea, of this yet-unknown man...  
Yes, the \"lord\" who I would someday meet.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Eheh. Do I sound like a foolish maiden dreaming  
of a knight in shining armor?  
Indeed, that is precisely how I felt.

`image display end`  
**Kokoro：**  
In her recent message, Minerva told me  
that she had located the one I must serve—that she had found my lord.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
A pure-hearted man... with a talent for connecting people,  
and an eagerness to offer assistance equally to all who are in need.  
A kind young future hero.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
She told me that this hero would surely lead me to new heights.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
If any could reach the pinnacle of that tower,  
it would be him—Queen Labyrinth's Princess Knight, she said.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Chosen by Queen Labyrinth, and favored by Minerva...  
He would be the one I had long dreamed of;  
the lord I was meant to serve...  
  
**Kokoro：**  
My heart was all aflutter as I awaited that fated meeting.  
I knew my lord would be an incredible person.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'm not all that special.  
**Choice: (6)**  *blush*  
`Tag 5`  
**Kokoro：**  
No need for such modesty, my lord.  
You are all I had dreamed of and more.  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Kokoro：**  
Even in embarrassment, you are enchanting.  
You truly are all I had hoped for, my lord... ♪  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Kokoro：**  
I waited so long... such a terribly long time to meet you.  
The one who would guide me... My one true lord.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
On our first encounter, I failed to explain myself,  
so I expect my actions seemed concerning.  
I sincerely apologize.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
You see, I have never had any close friends,  
so I am unaccustomed to social interaction...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Minerva's your friend, isn't she?  
`Tag 8`  
**Kokoro：**  
What...?  
Minerva, my friend...?  
  
**Kokoro：**  
I suppose it is true  
that I enjoyed every moment of our conversations together,  
and when she went away, I was worried about her...  
  
**Choice: (9)**  That's called friendship.  
`Tag 9`  
**Kokoro：**  
This bond...?  
I have always assumed without question  
that I have nobody whom I can call a friend...  
  
**Kokoro：**  
But I was wrong... I had her all along.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Thank you so much, my lord.  
I do not think my heart has ever felt quite so uplifted.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Just as I expected, you teach me all that I need to know.  
You are truly special... ♪  
  
**Kokoro：**  
In truth, I am hardly more than a child.  
There is still so much I have yet to learn.  
  
**Kokoro：**  
Please let me continue  
to serve close by your side, my lord... ♪  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ahhhh...  
Little Kokkoro's smile just melts my aching heart...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Interesting, though. So Lady Minerva is her friend...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Thank you for helping her to realize that.  
The feelings you have for others are a precious thing.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I hope you'll keep helping her  
to see all the precious things she doesn't notice.  
  
**Ameth：**  
After all, you're her lord,  
 aren't you?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm counting on you, \"my lord\"! ♪  
  

---  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Mnhh... Something is... tickling my face?  
  
**Dog：**  
*whine...*  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My doggie lord... Oh, I see I was asleep on the grass.  
I must have made you worry. Still, you should not lick my face all over.  
I will become utterly soaked.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As for my human lord... He still seems to be sleeping.  
What might he be discussing with Lady Ameth, I wonder?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Eheh. My lord... you look so very peaceful.  
If I were to lick your face as My Lord did mine,  
would you awaken for me, I wonder...? ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am still only a child,  
and there is much I still have to learn.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord... I must beg of you  
to take good care of me in all our days ahead.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
And I too will strive to serve you with all my heart can give.  
My lord... No—  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My precious lord, and mine alone. ♪  
  
**Narration：**  
Stroking her lord's head as he slept,  
Kokkoro whispered into his ear with a smile.
