My lord...?  
You asked to meet me here specially,  
so do you have some urgent business?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Happy birthday!  
**Choice: (2)**  I know I can always count on you.  
**Choice: (3)**  Hand her a present.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Ah! So you remembered the date.  
Does this mean you went to all of this trouble just for me...?  
Well, thank you ever so very much!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Simply spending each day by your side is a joy,  
but to be treated to such celebrations...  
This day will surely be among the happiest of my life.

**Kokkoro：**  
But of course; it is always my pleasure.  
Still, why would you say this so suddenly?  
Ah... It is my birthday today...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It makes me happy to hear you express such appreciation for my work.  
\"Always\"... Eheh. Yes, I hope that will never change.

**Kokkoro：**  
Now, who could this gift be for?  
...Oh? For me?  
Ah...  
 So you remembered that it is my birthday today.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank you most kindly.  
To remain close by your side is already my greatest joy...  
But I am flattered to be paid such special attention.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
If... by any chance you would care to grant me one more wish,  
please allow me to serve you to my heart's content today.  
There is no gift in the world that could make me more happy.
