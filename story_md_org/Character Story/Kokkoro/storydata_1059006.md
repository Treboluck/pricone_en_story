## Subtitle: A Furry Lost Child
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord. I may have troubled you during my illness,  
but thanks to your efforts, I am fully recovered now...  
So could I ask you to stop carrying me on your shoulders?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I am not a small child, so this is quite embarrassing...  
I can walk on my own two feet...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmmm...  
Ever since I caught that cold,  
my lord's kindness has become somewhat excessive.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It makes me happy to have him care for me so...  
But I hate to think that I am a burden on him.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
In the first place, my intended role...  
is that of an attendant, caring for my lord and guiding him.  
But right now I seem more like his pet, or perhaps his daughter...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
While this situation does allow me  
to bask in the warmth of my lord's kindness and affection...  
I cannot simply allow it to go on.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I must make him remember that I am a trusty guide  
who does not require his protection.  
That really, it is I who is here to be relied upon.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm.  
My lord, have you heard of something called a \"bank\"?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Up until now, all the money we have been able to earn...  
Well, it has been little more than a pittance.  
And for the most part, we used it up swiftly on our daily costs.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But now that we have a home at the Sarendia Orphanage  
and need not pay for a room, we have begun to save a little.  
It is hardly wise to carry our entire fortunes in our pockets.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So I think we should make use  
of an institution known as a \"bank,\"  
where one can store one's money more safely.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Of course, my lord,  
you have no means of proving your identity,  
so we will have to open the account in my name.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But I will leave the checkbook and so forth with you,  
so please feel free to withdraw any funds you may need.  
Or if you prefer, I will gladly manage them in your stead.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My task today is to instruct you in the ways of banking.  
Eheh. A job for a reliable guide, wouldn't you say...?  
Well then, if you could proceed to the main street...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...My lord?  
This is not the correct direction; the main street is over—  
...Oh, what's this?  
  
**Dog：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hmm. There is a little doggie over there.  
Is that what caught your attention, my lord?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, could you please set me down on the ground?  
That dog seems to be a pet, so it should not be too dangerous,  
but we can hardly risk you getting bitten.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You can count on me to protect you from harm.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That's right, lower me down gently...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I admit it was convenient to be carried around,  
but I do feel more comfortable standing on my own feet.  
Now no matter what happens, I can fend for the both of us.  
  
**Dog：**  
...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This doggie's spirits seem a little low...  
I fear he has seen better days.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
He is wearing a collar, so I assume he must be a pet, but...  
Perhaps he was separated from his owner somehow?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
He may have become lost  
and struggled to survive on the streets...  
Ahhh, the poor little fellow...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Come over here, little doggie.  
It's all right. I am not going to hurt you.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's cute how you call him \"doggie.\"  
**Choice: (2)**  Are you going to eat him?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, yes... I suppose it may sound a little childish.  
I have always said it this way since I was little,  
so just saying \"dog\" feels less natural to me.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
By the way, in my hometown,  
I grew up surrounded by small animals.  
I used to help my father look after them and the like.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I admit I tend to look after you in the same way,  
so I apologize if it ever seems  
I am treating you like an animal or an infant...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
You must understand I mean no disrespect.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well, there are regions where dogs are raised for food...  
But I am not Miss Pecorine.  
 When I come across an animal,  
my first instinct is not to treat it as a potential meal.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Haha...  
If I were to eat such a sweet little creature,  
I fear the heavens would punish me harshly.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
There, there...  
It's all right now. We will track down your owner for you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
The main street where we are headed is also home to various  
government offices.  
 All pets are required to be officially  
registered, so we may be able to find records of this little one.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Let me carry you in my arms, little doggie.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh... I can feel him trembling...  
He must have been so frightened and lonely,  
all alone away from his owner.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I can understand how he feels.  
I spent many years wondering when I would finally meet my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
However...  
That is precisely why I am filled with such happiness now.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Come along, my lord.  
I can only hope these days will last forever...  
The two of us side by side, travelling the path of life together.
