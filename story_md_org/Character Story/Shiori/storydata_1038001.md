**???：**  
Mmnhhh...  
  
**???：**  
...Hmm?  
  
**???：**  
Huh? U-um...  
Did I pass out?  
  
**???：**  
Eeek!  
S-sorry for aiming my bow at you...  
Um, who are you?  
  
**???：**  
{player}?  
Hello, um, nice to meet you.  
  
**Shiori：**  
My name is Shiori.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes,  
as you can see, I'm a beastgirl...  
I'm a member of the Caon guild,  
which is a part of the Menagerie.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm actually on leave right now...  
I've moved to a different Menagerie guild for various reasons.  
A guild called Elizabeth Park.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Anyway, I guess this isn't the time to be introducing myself...  
Sorry, I just woke up, so I'm still in a bit of a daze.  
You see, I've got low blood pressure.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Err... {player}, was it you who took care of me  
while I was passed out in the street?  
Sorry... to trouble  
you like that. But thank you for helping me out.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Actually, I'm not all that strong physically.  
Sometimes I get... a little lightheaded.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm usually taking it easy at a farm up in the mountains.  
But today I was feeling surprisingly healthy,  
so I thought I'd come down and visit the city.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Besides, there were some books and other things  
I wanted to buy.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I usually ask someone at the farm to buy things for me...  
Or my older sister, who comes to visit me sometimes.  
  
**Shiori：**  
But I feel guilty asking them.  
I can't always be relying on others...  
  
**Shiori：**  
I need to be able to take care of myself.  
I realize that.  
  
**Shiori：**  
But it looks like I used up my strength  
just getting to the city.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh, I'm fine.  
Don't worry.  
I think I'll recover once I rest a little while.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hm?  
What's the matter, {player}?  
You seem like you want to say something...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Pat her head.  
**Choice: (2)**  Tell her you'll accompany her because you're worried.  
`Tag 1`  
**Shiori：**  
*gasp*  
Wh-what's the matter?  
Why did you pat my head?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Do you find my ears unusual?  
Ah, you were trying to take my temperature. I'm okay...  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm still a little dizzy,  
but after chatting with you,  
I feel much more awake.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Shiori：**  
Ahaha...  
You don't have to worry about me too much. I'm fine.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I know it's not very convincing since I was just passed out.  
But I don't want to cause you any more trouble.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shiori：**  
Um...  
Anyway, I can manage now.  
I think I'll be on my way.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Once again, thank you for looking after me.  
I'll return the favor someday.
