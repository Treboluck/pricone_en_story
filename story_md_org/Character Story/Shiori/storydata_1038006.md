## Subtitle: Jealous Nyatt
  
**Shiori：**  
Nyatt?  
Where are you hiding nyow?  
I won't be angry, so come on out... ♪  
  
**Shiori：**  
Hm?  
Did those bushes just move?  
And is that Nyatt crying?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Heheh...  
I've got you cornered nyow... You're mine! ♪  
  
**Shiori：**  
Wa-wahhh?  
Huh, {player}...?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I-I-I'm so sorry.  
I'll let go of you now.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Um, have you seen my feline monster?  
His name is Nyatt...  
And... and...  
  
**Shiori：**  
Wait, putting that aside...  
{player}, what are you doing here?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I came to deliver a letter.  
**Choice: (2)**  Were you just talking like a cat?  
`Tag 1`  
**Shiori：**  
Oh...  
Right, you do deliver the mail  
to Elizabeth Park fairly regularly.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Thank you for your hard work.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Shiori：**  
Wh-what're you talking about?  
I don't remember that. You must've misheard me.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Mmnhhh...  
  
**Shiori：**  
...P-please forget you heard it.  
Please, I'll do anything.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shiori：**  
...Anyway.  
{player}, what're you doing lying there?  
  
**Shiori：**  
You're not feeling well?  
My ward is just over there. I have some basic medicine...  
Um, would you like to rest there?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Oh! I see Nyatt is right here.  
Wait, is he clinging onto you?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I think he likes you.  
He usually doesn't take to anyone besides me.  
  
**Shiori：**  
What?  
You were walking, and he suddenly jumped you?  
  
**Shiori：**  
Is that how you fell over?  
I see.  
Um, I'm sorry my pet bothered you.

**Shiori：**  
Nyatt, {player} is not a bad person.  
You mustn't be naughty to him. Come here.  
There, there... ♪  
  
**Shiori：**  
Heheh... Due to certain circumstances, I've taken  
this little one under my wing.  
But he is a monster.  
And monsters are the nemeses of humankind.  
  
**Shiori：**  
If he's no use to humans, I'm worried he'll be cast out...  
So I'm reading, looking for tricks and tiny jobs he can do.  
But it's been quite difficult.  
  
**Shiori：**  
If he could do the kind of jobs sheepdogs or hounds do...  
Then no one would call him a \"dangerous monster\"  
and chase him away, right?  
  
**Shiori：**  
I was the one who found him,  
so I need to create a place where he belongs.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Everyone at Elizabeth Park tells me  
he doesn't have to do any work.  
They're all kind that way.

**Shiori：**  
But...  
I'm not all that strong,  
 and I don't know how much longer I can live.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I need to teach Nyatt how to survive on his own,  
even if I'm not around.  
  
**Shiori：**  
So, recently, we've been guarding  
Elizabeth Park together.  
  
**Shiori：**  
He must've thought you were a suspicious person  
or an intruder. That's why he attacked you.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm sorry...  
Nyatt is still a baby who doesn't understand anything.  
Please, forgive him.  
  
**Shiori：**  
If someone finds out he attacked a human,  
they'll slay him for being a monster.  
  
**Shiori：**  
What's that?  
You and Nyatt... were just playing?  
  
**Shiori：**  
You're willing to leave it at that?  
Thank you so much, {player}.  
  
**Shiori：**  
It means a lot to me...  
that you forgive him, and that you understand.  
  
**Shiori：**  
You really are a kind person, {player}.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Wh-wha?  
Nyatt? Why are you acting so crazy?  
Oh my, he jumped on you again!  
  
**Shiori：**  
Y-you mustn't...  
That's the second time you did that.  
{player} might not forgive you this time.  
  
**Shiori：**  
What's gotten into him? He usually behaves himself.  
I'm so sorry, {player}.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Maybe Nyatt is jealous...  
He sees me only looking at you and talking to you.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Nyow, nyow, don't you worry.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Both you and {player} are equally...  
important to me.
