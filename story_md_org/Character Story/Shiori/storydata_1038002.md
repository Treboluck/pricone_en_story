**Shiori：**  
I'm sorry, {player}.  
You've ended up helping me with my shopping.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Ahaha.  
I must've been quite a sight, wobbling every few steps I took.  
  
**Shiori：**  
You just couldn't abandon me, could you?  
You're very kind, {player}.  
  
**Shiori：**  
O-oh my...!  
I'm sorry.  
The wind is awfully strong today.  
  
**Shiori：**  
It's like I'm too flimsy to keep my feet planted on the ground.  
A gust of wind is enough to send me toppling.  
Thank you for supporting me.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I've been having dizzy spells over and over again today...  
Every time it happens, you've been there for me to hold on to.  
You're becoming a real pro at this.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I shouldn't keep doing this.  
I'm always relying on others.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Well, my health has been like this since I was born,  
so there isn't much I can do about it.  
I've pretty much accepted it.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Still, I do feel like a dead weight.  
I should exercise more and increase my stamina.  
  
**Shiori：**  
So, um....  
You've been helping me with the books I bought.  
But I can carry them myself, you know?  
  
**Shiori：**  
You want me to let you carry them?  
I appreciate it, but... Why are you going out of your way  
to help someone like me?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I wasn't doing anything else.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm not sure, really.  
`Tag 1`  
**Shiori：**  
I see...  
So it's just your way of killing time.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I feel bad robbing someone of their valuable time...  
But if it's not such a big deal to you, I feel less bothered.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Shiori：**  
Ahaha...  
So you help others without really giving it much thought.  
It must be nice to have that luxury.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Shiori：**  
Hmm, anyway...  
If I buy too many things, I won't be able to carry them back.  
That's enough shopping for now.  
  
**Shiori：**  
Yes.  
I've managed to buy most of the books I wanted.  
  
**Shiori：**  
To be honest, I wanted to buy some clothes...  
and some stationery as well.  
  
**Shiori：**  
But if I buy too many things, I'll have more packages to carry.  
Besides, I'm relying on my parents enough with my medical fees.  
I've told them not to send me any allowance to make up for it.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I sometimes help out at the farm to earn extra money instead.  
I use that money for shopping.  
But I also want to pay back my parents, so I can't splurge.  
  
**Shiori：**  
I'm okay with that.  
All I need are a few precious items I can carry on my own...  
Items I can cherish in my own way.
