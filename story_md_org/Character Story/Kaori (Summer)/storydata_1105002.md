# Kaori (Summer) Episode 2
Kaori finds herself unable to match the melody that the party's organizer has in mind, leading {player} to suggest that they walk along the beach together. The feelings she experiences there give her a eureka moment, after which she dashes off to the venue.

**Narration：**  
With the sanshin's string successfully replaced, {player}  
and Kaori make their way to the dance party's venue.  
  
**Kaori：**  
This is the venue!  
It'll be full of people that love to dance  
later tonight. ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
They told me that we'd be doing rehearsals around this time.  
Oh! You over there!  
Haitai! ♪  
  
**Organizer：**  
Hm?  
Oh, you're the performer we requested.  
Thanks for coming today.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Not at all!  
I'm super stoked that people'll be singing and dancing to my performance!  
  
**Organizer：**  
Hm... Do you mind playing a bit for me?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Sure thing! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
♪  
  
**Man：**  
Oh!  
That sounds pretty fantastic!  
  
**Woman：**  
It's making me want to dance!  
  
**Organizer：**  
...  
  
**Kaori：**  
♪  
And that's about it!  
  
**Man：**  
Good stuff!  
  
**Woman：**  
That was perfect!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Don't sweat it!  
I'll be playing later tonight, so make sure to come!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  They sure loved it.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaori：**  
Yeah!  
Music really is amazing!  
It's so great when everyone's on the same wavelength! ♪  
  
**Organizer：**  
...  
  
**Organizer：**  
No. This won't do.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Huh? How come?  
What was wrong with it?  
  
**Organizer：**  
The performance itself was good, don't get me wrong.  
The audience seemed into it, too.  
It's just...  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's just... what?  
  
**Organizer：**  
I want tonight's dance party to have a certain mood to it.  
  
**Kaori：**  
A certain mood?  
Let's focus on making it fun!  
  
**Organizer：**  
That's important too, yes.  
But I'm aiming for something special tonight.  
  
**Organizer：**  
I want to recreate that tranquil sense of two lovers  
chatting with one another on the beach.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Something special?  
Two lovers chatting with one another?  
  
**Organizer：**  
Yeah. Your performance just now  
certainly would create a lively, enjoyable mood...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  But that would get in the way of the tranquility that I'm after.  
`Tag 2`  
**Kaori：**  
That's not true!  
I just need to play a softer song then!  
  
**Kaori：**  
♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
How's that?  
  
**Organizer：**  
Quiet as it is, there's still that sense of liveliness to it.  
It's not quite what I'm looking for tonight.  
  
**Organizer：**  
I realize this is terribly selfish of me, especially after you came  
all this way, but I think I'll have someone else play tonight.  
Could you play during the afternoon instead?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Okay...  
If you say so.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Kaori can do it.  
`Tag 3`  
**Kaori：**  
{player}...  
  
**Organizer：**  
Oh?  
You think she can replicate what I'm looking for by tonight?  
  
**Kaori：**  
...  
Sure can!  
Gimme some time and I'll knock it out the park!  
  
**Organizer：**  
Interesting. Then I'll wait until sunset.  
If you can't pull it off, I'll find a suitable replacement.  
  
**Kaori：**  
You bet I'll pull it off!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'll play something else, so can you listen for me?  
  
**Kaori：**  
♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
How's that?  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's got a fun sound to it?  
Figures.  
I could tell you were about to break into dance.  
  
**Kaori：**  
I just end up having a bunch of fun whenever I play.  
Maybe that's the issue?  
  
**Kaori：**  
My grandparents always told me that  
feelings are in the music, and music's in the feelings.  
  
**Kaori：**  
What should I do when I don't understand those feelings, then?  
  
**Kaori：**  
The tranquil sense of two lovers chatting on the beach...  
What's that even like?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hm...  
I just can't imagine it.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'll help you figure it out.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kaori：**  
Thanks!  
You're always super reliable.  
  
**Kaori：**  
How're you gonna do that, though?  
Oh, we can go for a walk together? Okay!  
  
**Kaori：**  
The sun's already starting to set.  
All we've done is walk around. You sure that's enough?  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's really quiet now that there's no one else around.  
All we can hear is the sound of the waves.  
  
**Kaori：**  
...  
Sorry. I dragged you all the way here,  
but now you won't even get to hear my performance.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hm? Why'd you stop all of a sudden?  
  
**Kaori：**  
You want me to play here?  
Ahhh. You think I might get it now since it's nice and tranquil?  
Hm.  
Guess I'll give it a shot!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Here I go. ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
...How was that?  
I'm really not that good at slow-paced melodies.  
  
**Kaori：**  
{player}?  
Say something.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Wow. He's really focused on listening.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oops...  
I messed up a bit there.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  No one else is here, so it's okay.  
**Choice: (7)**  Just focus on me.  
`Tag 6`  
**Kaori：**  
True enough.  
I shouldn't let it get to me.  
  
Jump to tag 8  
`Tag 7`  
**Kaori：**  
Got it!  
I know you won't laugh at me if I mess up. ♪  
  
`Tag 8`  
**Kaori：**  
Now that I think about it,  
you're the only one listening to me perform right now.  
  
**Kaori：**  
The way you're staring at me is  
making me feel all shy, though.  
  
**Kaori：**  
I dunno why, but my heart's starting to race.  
I can't perform the way I want to.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Performing for just one person feels so embarrassing.  
Or maybe it's because it's him?  
  
**Kaori：**  
I should calm down and focus on him.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Take a deep breath.  
Settle down, and let your fingers relax...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oh!  
...This is it!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Thanks!  
I think I've got it now!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oh no! The sun's almost set!  
We gotta get back to the venue!  
  
**Narration：**  
With an idea of how to proceed now in mind,  
Kaori returned to her usual energetic self and dashed off.
