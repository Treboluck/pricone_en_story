# Kaori (Summer) Episode 4
A dream conjured up by Ameth shows Kaori unable to play the way she wants to after coming face to face with {player}. She dives into the sea to cool herself off, then strips down to her swimsuit to continue playing in the same manner as she did before.

**Narration：**  
Kaori and {player} have finished  
clearing up the venue following the end of the dance party.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ahhh! This feels great!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Come on over, {player}! ♪  
The sea's a little bit chilly at night,  
but it's the perfect way to cool down after all that dancing! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
You don't have a swimsuit, so you can't?  
Oh. I guess I didn't give you any time to prepare, did I?  
Sorry about that. ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Swish, swish. ♪  
Swimming really does feel nice.  
What a great day!  
I got to play the sanshin, dance a bunch and even swim. ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hm? My chest feels a bit chilly.  
I think the cold might be getting to me.  
  
**Kaori：**  
I don't want to keep {player} waiting, either,  
so I guess I should go back to shore.  
Whoa?! Why's the sea so bright all of a sudden?!

**Man：**  
What a lively tune!  
  
**Woman：**  
For real!  
It's making me want to dance! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hm?  
Is that...?  
It is! {player}!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Haitai!  
Didn't think I'd bump into you here!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Me? We're holding a training camp for the upcoming karate competition. ♪  
Today's an off day, though, so I'm here to perform. ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
You might as well listen now that you're here!  
  
**Man：**  
Oh? Is that your boyfriend?  
Then you gotta play for him up close!  
  
**Woman：**  
Heehee. He's got the best seat in the house.  
  
**Kaori：**  
What do they mean by \"boyfriend\"?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That we're lovers, I guess?  
**Choice: (2)**  That we like each other, I guess?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaori：**  
L-lovers?!  
That's not true at all! Right?  
Now I'm feeling all embarrassed.

`Tag 2`  
**Kaori：**  
Well...  
I *do* like you, but not in a weird way, y'know?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kaori：**  
Uh...  
I guess I'll play, then.  
  
**Kaori：**  
...  
  
**Man：**  
Hm?  
The melody's a lot different now.  
  
**Woman：**  
It's nice and soothing, though.  
I like it.  
  
**Kaori：**  
This is weird.  
I can't play the same way I did a minute ago...  
  
**Kaori：**  
{player} is staring right at me...  
  
**Kaori：**  
This is so weird! I'm feeling all flushed, too...  
Did I say out in the sunlight too long?  
  
**Kaori：**  
...!  
I know what to do at times like this!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Can you hold this for me?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Wahoooo! ☆  
  
**Man：**  
Whoa.  
She just went and dove into the water...  
  
**Woman：**  
And now she's swimming like her life depends on it...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Phew! I needed that!  
But now my clothes're all soaked.  
Off they go! ☆

**Kaori：**  
Aha! Don't worry!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I had my swimsuit on underneath! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
I feel great now that I've cooled off!  
Now to perform some more!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Huh? I should dry myself off with this?  
You really are super thoughtful! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Wipey-wipe. ☆  
Okay! Here I go!

Oh! Here's another lively tune!

Okay, I can't contain it.  
I'm gonna dance! ♪

**Kaori：**  
My face still feels a bit flushed even after cooling myself off, though.  
  
**Kaori：**  
It only started after he showed up.  
  
**Kaori：**  
I wonder why?

**Ameth：**  
Hm? What're you looking at?  
You can't blame me for humming along to her tune, can you?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Feelings are in the music, and music's in the feelings.  
That's a wonderful saying, isn't it? Seems like her feelings have  
undergone a little change, too.  
Did you notice?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Not that you'll remember any of this dream, though.  
But if anything can make up for that, it's music.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, see you arou—  
Actually, hold up!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Close your eyes the second you wake up, okay?!  
You won't remember me saying this, but just make sure you do!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Okay. I'll let you go for real now.  
Catch you later. ♪

**Kaori：**  
Mmm... Did I fall asleep on the beach?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Huh?  
Is this a cape?  
Did you drape it over me?  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'd catch a cold if I slept like that,  
so thanks! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hm? That's not why you did it?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ohhh, right.  
My swimsuit slipped off.  
  
**Kaori：**  
You didn't see anything?  
Aha! I wouldn't have cared if you did.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Huh?  
My heart's kind of racing.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Feels like I could play an entirely new melody now.  
I might be able to discover all kinds of music if I'm with him. ♪
