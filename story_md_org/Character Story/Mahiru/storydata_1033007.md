**Mahiru：**  
...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Uhhh... Looks like it's noon already.  
Oh dear. I just ain't feelin' well recently.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Since bein' taken to the royal palace an' made to  
perform in front of the throne, my body's felt sluggish,  
an' I'm sleepin' in real late.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I might be gettin' a bit depressed...  
I jus' ain't myself. Used to be up first thing in the mornin'.  
I oughtta get up now an' start workin'.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
All them cows are waitin' for me to take care of 'em.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But...  
*sigh* I don't feel like doin' anythin'.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Soon enough, the others livin' at Elizabeth Park,  
like Limalima an' Shioshio, are gonna start worryin' about me.  
Although the two of 'em will probably let me be.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Rinrin, though,  
she'll be all up in my case,  
sayin' things like,  
\"You're always tellin' me I gotta work!\"  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But ain't that the truth.  
\"Do as I say, not as I do,\" as the sayin' goes.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
If I can handle some daily work, I might feel a bit better.  
I gotta get up. Get up an' work.  
Jus' like I've always done, goin' far back as I can remember.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...Hmm?  
What's that? Some kinda commotion comin' from the stables.  
Maybe there's been a scuffle.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But Elizabeth Park  
is supposed to be a peaceful place!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Everythin' feels like its gone haywire.  
How did it end up like this?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Urghh... Well, I can't afford to ignore it.  
I am the proprietor of Elizabeth Park, after all.  
Gotta straighten myself out!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Besides...  
That doesn't sound like fightin' or a monster attack.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ain't that laughter I'm hearin'...?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...What's goin' on,  y'all?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
H-huh?  
{player}!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Mornin'...  
What brings you to Elizabeth Park?  
Not that you ain't always welcome here.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Sorry, I dunno what exactly you're doin' here,  
but I'm feelin' a li'l under the weather.  
I'm prob'ly not gonna make much of a hostess.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
That said, you climbed all the way up here to pay a visit.  
Wouldn't be very polite to ask you to come by another day.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Perform an extra-special joke.  
**Choice: (2)**  Laugh uncontrollably.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mahiru：**  
...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...Hmm?  
Sorry, I don't really understand.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Was that supposed to be a joke?  
A-a pun?  
Whyja choose now to try'n make me laugh?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Sorry I couldn't give you much of a reaction.  
What exactly  
was the punch line meant to be?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Mahiru：**  
Huh?  
Wh-what's got you laughin' all of a sudden?  
Did I say somethin' funny?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
What's that?  
You gotta laugh first before you can make anyone else laugh?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I said somethin' like that before, didn't I?  
Ain't it just like me to say somethin' so arrogant.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mahiru：**  
Hmm?  
What's that, {player}?  
You want me to sit over here?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Now applaud?  
Don't really get it, but okay...  
Clappity-clap! ♪  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I see!  
So you're gonna be performin'  
a special comedy sketch for me, huh?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wh-why are you doin' this?  
Sure, I did always like comedy, but...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But, right now, everythin' is a bit muddled.  
What is comedy? What's the point, the real value in it?  
I've been goin' over these questions in my head.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
O-oh well.  
Looks like he's gone ahead an' started his sketch already!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Don't be tryin' so hard to make me laugh.  
You gotta pick up on the audience's energy!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But it ain't half bad.  
Heh...  
Ahahah!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ahaha... ♪  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Aha! Yeah...That's pretty darn funny.  
Never really took much to get me laughin'.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ohhh... It's been a while since I last had a proper laugh.  
Feels like I got somethin' off my chest!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Thanks, {player}.  
Didja come here to try'n cheer me up?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Didja hear from the others here in Elizabeth Park  
that I was feelin' down?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
No? You got inspired by my comedy  
an' decided to give it a try yourself?  
I see... Even if you're just bein' nice, that means a lot to me!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Tee hee!  
Well, laughter doesn't exactly cure all ailments.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But it does help get your mind away  
from the nasty parts of reality for a moment.  
Sorta like a sweet candy or somethin'.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
It ain't somethin' you need to go on living.  
But I'd be darn lonely without it.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Thanks a bunch, {player}...  
I'm still a li'l down in the dumps, but I do feel better.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Even if that monstrous ruler of ours  
has been shoulderin' the burdens of this whole kingdom for so long  
as to become somethin' other than human...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I gotta feel sorry for anyone who's forgotten how to laugh.  
Whether they want my pity or not.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I hope I'll be able to put a real smile on that face someday.  
Then maybe this world, an' this country, too,  
will be able  
to breathe a sigh of relief.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Tee hee!  
Anyway, {player},  
that skit of yours ain't gonna see its full potential  
'til you turn it into a double act!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wouldja like to partner up with me?  
I've already got the routine down, an' I've thought of  
plenty o' variations!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Let's do comedy together!  
You're a sweet kid, you know?  
Mind if I laugh alongside you?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
And wouldja look at that!  
Everyone from Elizabeth Park  
is startin' to gather 'round.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Humans an' beastfolk, cows an' sheep, come one, come all!  
Gather 'round! Let's get some comedy goin'!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Tee hee hee. ☆
