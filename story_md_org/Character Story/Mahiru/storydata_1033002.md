**Mahiru：**  
Zzz... Zzz...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Mmm... Mmm...  
Elizabeth, don'tcha go anywhere, you hear...?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Mmm.  
H-huh?  
Was I sleepin'?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Huh?  
Where the heck am I?  
*yawn* I'm so darn sleepy it's not even funny.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh?  
Hey, {player}...  
Um, whatcha doin'?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You've got me loaded onto my cart.  
You're not cartin' me off to the monster cart-el, are ya?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm kiddin'... Darn, even my jokes aren't awake yet...  
I sorta get what's goin' on.  
You're carryin' me 'cause I fell asleep, right?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I was in Landosol, pushin' my cart,  
sellin' dairy an' meat as usual.  
On the way home, I got real drowsy an' fell asleep.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You found me passed out while you were passin' by  
an' decided to take me home.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
That's it, isn't it?  
Right, right.  
Shoulda spiced up my answer 'stead of givin' it to ya straight.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Well dang.  
I owe you one, {player}.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You coulda just woken me up,  
'stead of goin' out of your way to get me home.  
Well, I ain't complain'.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ahahah...  
Yessiree, I slept sound as a baby.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm always up real early back at Elizabeth Park.  
So I'm usually in bed aroun' now.  
It's a li'l embarassin', I know. Makes me sound like a kid...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Still, it ain't safe outside the city—there's monsters and stuff.  
Take a li'l nap an' you may never wake up again.  
I really oughtta be more careful.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
*yawn...* That said, ridin' in this cart,  
swayin' to an' fro, it's got me dozin' off again.  
Like one of them baby cradles. *yawn*  
  
**Mahiru：**  
What's that?  
You don't mind if I keep sleepin'?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Geez... You really don't have to push me all the way up.  
It'll be night by the time you get back down.  
I'd hate to bother you like that, {player}.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's no bother.  
**Choice: (2)**  You're light as a feather.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mahiru：**  
Is that so?  
Gosh... You're a real gentleman,  
aren't ya, {player}.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
How reliable. You aren't try'na chat me up, are ya?  
Ain't no point in talkin' up a li'l squirt like me.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
What's that? People oughtta be nicer to children?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hold on, who're you callin' a child?  
I may be scrawny, but I'm already twenty!  
If anyone's a child, it's you!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Mahiru：**  
Geez! It's heavy enough pushin' just the cart.  
I should know, since I get exhausted  
each time I make the trip between Elizabeth Park an' Landosol.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
What's that? You admire how hard I work bein' so young?  
Ahahah! I may be scrawny, but I'm already twenty.  
I mean, a gal oughtta be workin' at that age, no?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mahiru：**  
Hmm... It'll be faster to come with me to Elizabeth Park  
than try'n get back to Landosol from now.  
Now that the sun's gone down, it ain't safe on the mountain trail.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
{player}, you oughtta stay with us for tonight.  
I can give ya food an' boardin' for escortin' me this far.  
I'll even put on a special comedy show for ya!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Now now, lemme help push the cart.  
There's a knack for rollin' it smoothly  
without usin' too much effort.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Way you're pushin' it, you're bound to pull a muscle.  
Come on, lemme show ya how it's done.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Look, jus' like this...  
You see? Moves real smooth!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Heheh. I've been workin' at Elizabeth Park  
since I was a young'un, so this is a walk in the park.  
Everyday, sweatin' it out an' takin' care of the cows.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wasn't 'til recently I started sellin' our goods in Landosol.  
All my years growin' up, I knew nothin' outside of the park.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Occasionally, this troupe of travelin' beastfolk performers  
would come by Elizabeth Park...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Pretty sure they were just makin' a short stop  
before headin' to Landosol to put on a show.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I used to beg 'em to show me some of their stuff.  
I sure enjoyed myself. An', boy, did I admire 'em.  
They were my only contact with the big ol' world out there.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
So ya see...  
I wanna entertain others  
jus' like the travelin' performers did for me.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
At the very least, their performances changed my life.  
'Course, workin' at Elizabeth Park is a lotta fun,  
but I'd love to add a li'l more pizzazz to my life!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm practicin' my comedy with that in mind, but it ain't easy.  
Even today, I performed some of my jokes while sellin' goods,  
but you're the only one who laughed.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You, with your sparklin' eyes, always listenin' to my jokes  
an' laughin' like a kid.  
It makes me real happy.  
You encourage me to keep on goin'.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Thank ya for bein' my...  
Hey, {player}?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
He's gone an' fell asleep.  
Must've been exhausted.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
There now, try'n rest.  
I'll get ya on the cart an' carry you back to Elizabeth Park.  
Jus' leave it to me.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Go on an' get some sleep.  
Today was a swell day, an' I'm sure I'll sleep like a baby.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
That said, I can't overdo it.  
We've got an early morning at Elizabeth Park, after all.
