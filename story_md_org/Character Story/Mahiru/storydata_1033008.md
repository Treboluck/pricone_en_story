## Subtitle: Mahiru's Affair
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hmm...  
So it's not gonna work, huh?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Yeah, if you don't know enough about grass,  
this joke might just fly over your head.  
Ideally it oughtta be accessible to everyone of all ages.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
What may be everyday terms for me...  
ends up being technical jargon for the regular city folk.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Yup, yup!  
Good point.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Thanks, {player},  
for brainstormin' ideas with me.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You've been comin' pretty often to Elizabeth Park,  
even when you don't have deliveries.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Still worried about me after I got down in the dumps  
the other day?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Well, o' course I noticed!  
I'm the proprietor of Elizabeth Park.  
I've got a good grasp of the mail that's coming in.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
If it ain't for deliveries, I figure you must have another  
reason for comin' here...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
An' at the risk of soundin' vain,  
my guess is you're checkin' in on me  
to see if I'm okay.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
'Course, you could just be here visitin' some of the other gals  
in Elizabeth Park.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But even if I ain't the main reason...  
It still makes me happy all the same!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I appreciate it, {player}.  
I've been recoverin' well, thanks to you.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
And I'm startin' to get a lot more comedic ideas!  
Although I'm still a bit rusty.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I feel like a cow who isn't givin' up much milk.  
My comedic inspiration tells me how my physical  
an' mental health are doin'.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I still ain't nowhere near fully recovered,  
an' I'm a little afraid of goin' into town.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But don't you worry!  
I'll be back to my old self soon enough.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Besides, sometimes you tell me things people  
are sayin' about me in town.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
From what I grasp, there's a reasonable number of folks  
lookin' forward to seein' my comedy again.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Makes me feel like I wasn't wastin' my time.  
I've really been givin' folks the smiles that they need...  
That thought alone makes me happy!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
What's that? {player}, you're lookin' forward  
to seein' me perform again too?  
You love my comedy?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ahaha!  
Don't talk me up too much or I'll let it get to my head. ♪  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Yup.  
Don't worry. I'll recover in no time.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm gonna put on such a comedic show,  
you'll be cryin',  
screamin' for it to stop,  
an' dyin' with laughter!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Aaaaghh!  
Like I toldja, cut it out with the flashin' light!  
What is that? Is it supposed to be some kinda act?

**Mahiru：**  
La la laaaa! ♪  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Tee hee!  
Thanks for invitin' me to the zoo again,  
  
{player}.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But we gotta practice our comedy sketch as well!  
I'm gonna make a comeback at the consolation match.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh well.  
I guess everythin' serves as inspiration.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
By the way, I heard this zoo has the most beautiful cow  
in all of Japan.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ya think that's true?  
I'm a li'l skeptical.  
No way there's a cow more beautiful than my Elizabeth.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Well, c'mon then, let's go see it!  
Seems like the cow is at the pettin' farm up ahead.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, is that it?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Whoa... Whoaaa!  
Wha... Wh-what majestic beauty!  
Sh-she's so gorgeous. I'm tremblin' jus' lookin' at 'er!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
What's that? It's just an ordinary cow?  
Are you blind, {player}?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Take a closer look.  
That well-formed mouth, that healthy tongue,  
an' those gently sloping legs!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
*sigh* Who woulda thought a cow like this even existed?  
Not on farms, they don't! I'm flabbergasted!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hmm?  
What's that, {player}?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ooh! They've got a cow milking experience?  
Wanna give it a try?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Yup, let's do it!  
Hm? You want me to show you an example first?

**Mahiru：**  
All righty, leave it to me!  
I'll show ya jus' how it's done!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But the cow an' I are jus' meetin' for the first time.  
You sure it's okay for me to milk 'er?  
Darn, I'm nervous!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But really, it's an honor!  
I'm gonna milk 'er with the utmost care.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Lemme show you some of that farmin' pride!  
You ready? Here goes!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Right then, gonna get my milkin' on!  
Tee hee! I ain't been milkin' cows all my life for nothin'!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Dang, this cow...  
Not only is she lovely, but she milks so fine.  
Jus' beautiful. I've takin' a real shine to ya!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hmm? The feelin' is mutual, is it?  
Ahaha! How about I take you home with me then? ♪

**Mahiru：**  
Oh, gosh!  
Darn it. What've I done?!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I... I've cheated on Elizabeth.  
What I've done is inexcusable...  
Look at me, fawnin' all over another cow.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Elizabeth will forgive you.  
**Choice: (2)**  You were cheating already.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mahiru：**  
Huh?  
How wouldja know that, {player}?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Right, yeah...  
I've talked your ears off with stories about Elizabeth.  
Guess you'd know a thing or two.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But, yeah, it's jus' like you say.  
Elizabeth has a beautiful face an' personality to boot.  
I'm sure she'll forgive me! ♪  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Mahiru：**  
Huh?  
Whatcha talkin' about?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh right,  
yeah.  
I left Elizabeth behind and started a double act with you.  
An' now we're on a date together...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I guess you could call that cheatin'.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But, c'mon, cows an' boys aren't the same,  
are they...?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mahiru：**  
Huh?  
Look at that!  
We've got a huge audience!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Was my milkin' so impressive  
it caught everyone's attention?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Th-this is our chance to perform our double act!  
Let's do our usual routine!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Can't miss a fine chance to bring happiness an' laughter  
to each an' every one of the people we cross paths with!

**Ameth：**  
What a relief!  
Looks like Mahiru is doing much better now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Seriously, it was hard to see how depressed she was.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What on earth were the royals of this country thinking,  
rounding up all the comedians and bards in the city like that?  
  
**Ameth：**  
As far as I know, that royal family was never one to engage  
in such tyranny...  
Something just doesn't sit right.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, let's put that aside for now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
{player}, you need to focus on doing what  
you can to help the people in front of you.  
Or rather, to bring happiness to them.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You're not going to suddenly save the world  
or all of mankind right off the bat.  
  
**Ameth：**  
If you can't make the people close to you happy,  
then you've got no right to call yourself a hero.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Mahiru seems to really understand this.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's always thinking about those around her.  
She does her best to make them laugh.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She's an adult you can respect.  
You could learn something from her, {player}.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Although... I guess that's the kind of person you are, too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Always stay true to the gentle and noble comedian  
that you are.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Huh? You wouldn't exactly call yourself a comedian?  
Really? Aren't you and Mahiru part of a comedy duo?  
That makes you a comedian, through and through.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Why not dedicate yourself to the craft?  
It may turn out to be useful.  
Comedians are pretty popular, you know?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Heheh.  
Well, never mind.  
Anyway, that's enough chitchat for now... Bye-bye! ♪

**Mahiru：**  
Oh... {player}, are you awake?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You startled me, fallin' asleep outta the blue like that.  
Yeah, it was jus' for a few seconds.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Eeek!  
Sorry, try'n not move around too much.  
Or else I might squeal again...  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I didn't want you lyin' on the ground,  
so I put your head on my lap.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Yup. Go ahead an' rest a little more 'til you feel better.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Every single day from mornin' to night...  
You'll go crazy workin' yourself that hard.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You should try an' take it easy.  
Enjoy a laid-back life on a farm like this.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Although jus' lyin' around all day is a problem  
in and of itself.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Life is full of ups an' downs.  
I still got a lot to learn,  
but I can be there to comfort you.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
That's what comedy is for.  
That's what I'm here for.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
...{player}?  
Oh, he's gone an' fell asleep again.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Ahahah... He's even droolin'.  
Sometimes, he's jus' like a baby.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
There now, good boy.  
You're a real good boy, aren't ya, {player}. ♪
