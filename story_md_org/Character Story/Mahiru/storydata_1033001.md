**Mahiru：**  
C'mon, kids, gather 'round!  
It's Mahiru from Elizabeth Park!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm sellin' some fine meat and cheese  
fresh from Elizabeth Park at a real bargain for y'all!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
The cows yielded plenty of milk this mornin'.  
It's fulla nutrients and darn delicious to boot!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You young'uns get free cookies!  
Dads, mamas, grandpas, an' grandmas, too!  
Dogs, cats, an' even all y'all monsters, come one come all!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I reckon I'll even tell you one of my favorite jokes!  
Y'all get to eat somethin' delicious while I crack you up!  
  
**Boy：**  
Oh, it's the cow lady!  
Hey, miss!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Whoa there! Hold your horses, young fella.  
Mindja don't knock over my cart of goods.  
Else you'll ruin the fine wares I carried all the way here!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
That'd put me outta work. Send me packin' tail between my legs.  
No one would get to hear any of my jokes or eat anythin' nice.  
A real night-mare scenario!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
So don't go horsin' around  
if you don't wanna leave everyone  
long-faced!  
  
**Boy：**  
Ahaha! ☆  
You're silly!  
  
**Mother：**  
Come on, don't bother the young lady.  
Sorry, can I buy some meat?  
It's so reassuring to buy directly from the farmer!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Sure thing! Feel free to look around!  
Or look a-square, if round ain't your thing!  
An' to be candid, ma'am, you oughtta try the candy!

**Mahiru：**  
Darn, I feel in tip-top shape today!  
I've got 'em puns comin' one after the other!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
My jokes don't get much of a response  
from the others at Elizabeth Park...  
Explains why I ain't been too confident lately.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Limalima at least laughs outta politeness, but Rinrin jus'  
snickers like she's lookin' down on me.  
Even Shioshio's pretty  
particular about comedy, always givin' *feedback* an' such.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Geez, wish I had friends who really got my humor.  
There's only so much a one gal show can accomplish.  
I'd like to start a comedy duo, if anythin'.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Back at the farm, I've got them cows to riff off.  
But there ain't no way I can bring 'em  
down the mountain to Landosol.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Rinrin is her usual antisocial self.  
Shioshio is too fragile to be puttin' in harm's way...  
And Limalima will scare all them city folks with her looks.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm in a real pickle.  
Hold on, I could pun that with, \"How do I 'dill' with this?\"  
I oughtta use that next time!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Dang, I'm just brimmin' with puns today!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hm?  
Say fella, you've been standin' there silently for some time now.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Is there somethin' you wanna buy?  
You know what they say,  
\"Buy before ya think!\"  
  
**Mahiru：**  
What's that? You're lost?  
I'm well-versed in these parts from pushin' my cart around.  
I can show ya how to get where you wanna go.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
So... Where are you headin'?  
Tell ya what, buy some milk off me,  
and I'll set your mind at cheese  
by showin' you the whey!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Laugh uncontrollably.  
**Choice: (2)**  Don't react.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mahiru：**  
Whoa, what a reaction.  
Never had someone respond like that before.  
Shucks, you got me blushin'!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Gotcha in stitches, did I?  
Right then, I'll be addin' those puns to my comedy routine.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Hold on a sec, let me jot 'em down...  
While I'm at it,  
I'll draw a map to where you're headin'!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'll even throw in some cheese as a thank-you for laughin'.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh... oh gosh.  
Didja not find it very funny?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You see, I made a pun between \"milk,\" \"cheese,\" an' \"whey.\"  
They're dairy puns!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
My, you look stupefied...  
Even after I ate humble pie an' tried to explain the joke...  
The road to comedy gold is a darn treacherous one.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Huh?  
Wh-what's got you rollin' with laughter now?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
What's that? It was funny once you got the joke?  
Ahahah... You're laughin'  
like you've never heard a pun in your life before, mister.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mahiru：**  
You're a funny fella, aren't ya?  
Haven't seen you around before. You from these parts?  
I see... Your name's {player}.  
Nice to meetcha!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Right, the name's Mahiru.  
I run a farm called Elizabeth Park  
situated up in the mountains.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I occasionally come wanderin' down to sell dairy products.  
You know, 'cause it's safe here in town,  
the Landosol folk don't like to leave much.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
So I ain't got no choice but to come down an' sell 'em myself.  
Else all that milk would end up spoiled.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wouldja like to buy somethin', mister?  
I highly recommend the cookies! You'd be nutty not to try 'em  
with a glass of milk. It's a batch made in heaven!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Whoa! Doesn't take much to get you laughin', does it?  
Yessiree, I punned \"cookies\" with \"nutty\" an' \"batch.\"  
Never met anyone who found my puns so funny before!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You're a kind fella, mister.  
Ahahah.  
Now you've got me laughin' with you over nothin'.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
We've got quite the crowd of curious onlookers  
watchin' us laugh our butts off.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Tee hee! My wares are sellin' like hotcakes!  
Like they say, \"Fortune smiles on the merry\"!
