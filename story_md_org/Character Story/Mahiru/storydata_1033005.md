**Mahiru：**  
So then I told her,  
\"Elizabeth, my dear, you're a cow!\"  
  
**Mahiru：**  
All righty, got that punch line down to a tee!  
People'll get bored if I'm jus' doin' puns all the time.  
So now I'm experimentin' with funny li'l stories too! ♪  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Runnin' gags that flow well tend to get the best laughs.  
Proper little skits, like a real double act.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Geez, thanks for lendin' me a hand with the brainstormin',  
{player}!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Yep. I'll be sellin' my wares at the same time,  
so it can't be too lengthy or slapstick.  
That means no trippin' over or runnin' into things.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
So I just gotta keep on chattin' endlessly  
even while I'm sellin' goods.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
That sorta rambling format oughtta be best!  
That's the conclusion I've reached!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
You've been helpin' out a lot with my work lately.  
You even partner up with me for gags sometimes.  
That said, you won't always be there to bail me out.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I gotta branch out and find a style I can perform on my own.  
Yessiree. My own brand of comedy  
is slowly startin' to take shape!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
It's all thanks to you, {player}.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Right now, my comedy is just a tool to attract customers  
an' sell 'em dairy goods.  
But once I build a reputation,  
maybe I can jus' live off my comedy.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Tee hee!  
Well, right now,  
I'm nowhere near good 'nuff to be chargin'  
my customers.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Thank ya kindly, {player}.  
You're always laughin' at my material,  
no matter how borin' it is.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm startin' to build up confidence.  
It's makin' me love comedy more an' more!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Without you, I might've given up on comedy long ago.  
When I'm just sellin' goods, there ain't no need for jokes.  
I used to get strange looks from the other vendors.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
But these days, our original material gets great reactions.  
We're garnerin' a reputation as the milk cart with laughs!  
It's growin' my business.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
That means our hard work is payin' off.  
Boy, am I glad. ♪  
  
**Mahiru：**  
I'm just brimmin' with happiness lately!  
Every day is so darn fulfillin'!  
Wish it could be like this forever.  
  
**Knight：**  
You there!  
Don't move. We are knights of Nightmare!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh gosh...  
Wh-what's goin' on?  
  
**Knight：**  
Are you Mahiru?  
Yes, you match the description... There's no mistake.  
  
**Knight：**  
You're coming with us, girl!  
Best not resist if you don't want to get hurt.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Huh? Wait!  
What did I do?  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Umm, I've got permission to be sellin' dairy goods here...  
All my business is above board.  
  
**Knight：**  
Hmph. We're well aware of that. That isn't the issue.  
We'll discuss it at the Nightmare guard station.  
Now shut your mouth and come with us.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Geez...  
Hey! You ain't gotta force me!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Fine, I'll go with you!  
Don't push like that! You'll knock the cart over!  
 You'll shatter the milk bottles, an' ruin the goods!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Urghh...  
Quit bein' so violent!  
If you waste good food, you'll bring bad luck on yourself!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Help Mahiru.  
**Choice: (2)**  Protect the goods.  
`Tag 1`  
**Knight：**  
Hmm...? Who the hell are you? Did you just draw your sword?  
Do you mean to obstruct the business of Nightmare?!  
Pitiful fool!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh darn, please! No violence!  
Stand down, {player}! They'll hurt you!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Wh-what exactly is it you want from me?  
Take me where you want! I ain't got nothin' to hide!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Mahiru：**  
You stopped the cart from fallin'... Thanks a million!  
I would've hated to see the milk go to waste!  
  
**Knight：**  
I've had enough of your chatter!  
You! Are you an acquaintance of this girl?  
You come with us, too. Resist and we'll throw you in a cell!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Stop! {player} has nothin' to do with this!  
If you're gonna take anyone, jus' take me!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Knight：**  
Hmph.  
Well said. As you wish then. We're taking you in.  
  
**Knight：**  
Due to the recent increase in crime,  
there have been many slanderous individuals  
singing criticism of our glorious monarch...  
  
**Knight：**  
As such, our ruler is rightly furious.  
We're gathering these individuals and punishing them together.  
You are one of them.  
  
**Mahiru：**  
What?  
But I ain't never said nothin' to disrespect no royalty!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
It's all a misunderstandin'!  
Comedy is about makin' others happy!  
I'd never use it to make fun of anyone!  
  
**Knight：**  
Hey, knock it off!  
We'll be interrogating you at the Nightmare guard station.  
Come along now!  
  
**Knight：**  
Idiot... Instead of indulging in the vulgarities of comedy,  
all that's required of you is to sweat and toil for the throne!  
That is our duty as citizens!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Oh, how awful!  
Badmouth me all you like, but don'tcha dare badmouth comedy!  
  
**Mahiru：**  
Even a ruler ain't got the authority to rob the citizens  
of their smiles!
