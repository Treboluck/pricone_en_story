**Misogi：**  
Hey, mister! Morning!  
Feels great to be up this early, right?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
I've got too much energy for this time of morning?  
You think?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Morning or evening, lunchtime or dinnertime,  
I'm always full of energy! Yaaaay!  
  
**Misogi：**  
And anyway, look! Check it out!  
Isn't this outfit the coolest?  
Eheheh... I got my mom to buy it for me!  
  
**Misogi：**  
That's kind of why I called you out here—  
to show it off!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh, but that's not all!  
I've got a really important mission!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Check this out, mister!  
This weird map totally looks like this area, right?  
  
**Misogi：**  
I found it in my dad's room!  
And look—right here! There's a special mark on it!  
I bet my dad put it there!

**Misogi：**  
A mysterious mark like this  
has gotta mean something cool!  
Maybe there's even buried treasure there or something!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's go check it out.  
**Choice: (2)**  I have a bad feeling about this...  
`Tag 1`  
**Misogi：**  
You're my kind of guy, mister!  
C'mon, let's get searching!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Misogi：**  
Ehhhh? What's to be worried about?  
You can be such a downer sometimes!  
C'mon, let's go find the treasure!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Misogi：**  
The mark should be right around here!  
Ummm... Maybe it's a bit further?  
I'm pretty sure this is the place...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? Is it just me, or is the ground...  
...Wahhh! It's collapsing underneath us!  
Aaaaaahhhhh!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Owieee...  
What is this, a pitfall trap?  
D'you think my dad dug it?  
  
**Misogi：**  
You okay there, mister?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I fell on my butt...  
**Choice: (5)**  What about you? Are you OK?  
`Tag 4`  
**Misogi：**  
Ahahah! You're such a klutz, mister!  
You gotta at least stick the landing!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Misogi：**  
Yep!  
I'm used to dealing with pitfalls!  
A little hole like this isn't gonna hurt me!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Misogi：**  
Still, I never thought we'd find a pitfall in a place like this!  
Talk about a surprise!  
  
**Misogi：**  
That's my dad for ya!  
Looks like he's a better hole-digger than even me!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hmmm...  
I wonder, though, why did he leave a map like that  
leading straight to this hole?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hmm?  
Hey, mister, there's something buried over there!  
  
**Misogi：**  
What could it be?  
C'mon, let's dig it out!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hrnghhh... Urnghhh!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Um, is this... a wooden box?  
D'you think my dad left it here?  
What do you think, mister?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Why don't you open it?  
**Choice: (8)**  I'll open it myself.  
`Tag 7`  
**Misogi：**  
All right!  
I'll flip it open straight in your direction!  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Misogi：**  
...Yeah, good idea!  
That's definitely the best plan!  
C'mon, mister, flip the lid right open!  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Misogi：**  
Open sesame!!!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahahahah!  
A boxing glove popped out!  
I knew this had to be a trick box!  
  
**Misogi：**  
I was thinking, if it was me,  
I'd definitely leave a second trick inside the first one!  
  
**Misogi：**  
...Hmm?  
Hey, there's something else inside the box!  
Maybe it wasn't just a prank after all!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ooh! This is a letter from my dad!  
He must have buried it hoping I'd find it!  
Awesome!

**Ameth：**  
What a prankster of a father...  
Who knew these things run in the family?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I have to say, though...  
You've really settled into your role as that little girl's plaything,  
haven't you? Don't you have a shred of pride?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, I suppose it seems like she's enjoying herself...  
So maybe it's not such a bad thing... Right?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, what you just experienced  
was another dream I created based on your and Misogi's memories.  
  
**Ameth：**  
How did you like it? Was it pleasant enough?  
Well then, until next time!

**Misogi：**  
Yayyyy! A secret letter from Dad...  
...Wait, huh? Was that a dream?  
Did I just fall asleep?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hey mister, hey mister!  
I just had the coolest dream!  
I found this map of my dad's, and then I fell right into a pitfall!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? You dreamed about the same thing?!  
Hey, this is just like that other time, right?  
  
**Misogi：**  
It's pretty crazy that we share the same dreams!  
Wahoo!  
  
**Misogi：**  
All right, mister!  
Our new challenge is to build an awesome pitfall  
that's as good as my dad's one!  
  
**Narration：**  
As she set about digging a new hole,  
Misogi was secretly hoping she and {player} could have  
more dreams together.
