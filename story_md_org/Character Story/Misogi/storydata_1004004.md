**Narration：**  
One day when Misogi and {player} are out  
walking in Landosol, they find themselves  
enveloped in a mysterious light.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Whoaaa! Wh-what the?! What's this light?!  
It's hurting my eyes!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Aaaaaahhhhh!

**Misogi：**  
U... Urghhh...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh, hey, mister...  
 I'm afraid it's... too late for me now...  
  
**Misogi：**  
I... I'm so hungry... I can't go on...  
Ahhh, it's been... a good life...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Buy her some candy.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misogi：**  
Seriously?! Yaaaaaaay!  
Thanks a bunch, mister!  
  
**Misogi：**  
*munch munch* Ooh! This stuff's good!  
Y'know, mister, you're such a nice guy!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh hey, over here, mister!  
I really want this water pistol too!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Buy it for her.  
**Choice: (3)**  That's enough buying.  
`Tag 2`  
**Misogi：**  
Yaaaaay! You're the best, mister!  
I can always count on you to know where it's at!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Misogi：**  
Urgh! S-suddenly my stomach hurts real bad...  
Come to think of it, my doctor said something  
about shooting my skin with a water pistol regularly...  
  
**Misogi：**  
But alas... it's too late for me now...  
I'm sorry, mister... Thanks for everything... Goodbye...  
  
**Misogi：**  
...Huh? You're gonna buy it for me after all?  
Wahoooo! You're the best, mister!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Misogi：**  
Hey, store lady!  
Gimme this water pistol and those firecrackers and these water balloons!  
That guy over there's paying for everything!  
  
**Granny：**  
Of course, my dear. My pleasure. That comes to 1,000 yen.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Eheheh!  
 Thanks to you, big bro,  
I don't think I'm gonna die after all!  
Thanks a bunch!  
 *munch munch*  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh, but I guess it's not really fair if I *just* make you buy stuff.  
I gotta think of a special treat to thank you!  
Uhhhh... Ummm...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh! I know!  
Hey mister, hey mister!  
Close your eyes for a sec!  
  
**Misogi：**  
That's right! Now I need you to crouch down here...  
You're pretty tall, so get your head  
down to my height, OK?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Yep, that's perfect!  
Now your head's right where I can reach.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Well, then... I guess it's time... for your special... treat.  
  
**Misogi：**  
...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Take this! Water pistol of love!  
  

---  
  
**Misogi：**  
Aaaaand... Water balloon firecracker combo!!!  
  

---  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahahahahah! It worked!  
Sheesh, mister, you're sopping wet!  
I guess now I've \"given back\" everything you bought me!  
  
**Misogi：**  
You really are the funniest guy, you know that?  
See you 'round! Let's play again sometime!  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Aaaand... welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Really though...  
What were you expecting when you closed your eyes there?  
Hmmm... I might need to keep a closer eye on you...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh, what you just experienced was something like a dream  
that I created  
from your and Misogi's memories.  
  
**Ameth：**  
How did you like it? Did you get all nostalgic?  
  
Well, I guess you wouldn't really understand just yet.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Perhaps if you collect more fragments of your memories,  
I'll be able to show you more dreams like this.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Dreaming of your past with lots of different girls...  
That's your ticket to unravelling this world's secrets.  
So do your best, OK?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, that's all from me!  
  

---  
  
**Misogi：**  
...Uu... Unhhh...  
H-huh? Where am I?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Oh, right, Landosol!  
Ummm... You and me were...  
out on a walk, right, mister?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Are you awake now?  
You know, I just had the weirdest dream.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? You too?  
And I shot you with a water pistol?  
That's totally the same dream I had!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Wow... What a weird dream...  
Why would we both dream about the same thing?  
That place was totally different from Landosol, too...  
  
**Misogi：**  
But somehow it felt kinda nostalgic!  
Isn't that funny, mister?  
  
**Narration：**  
Though difficult to explain, Misogi and {player} agreed  
that their strange experience had been lots of fun.
