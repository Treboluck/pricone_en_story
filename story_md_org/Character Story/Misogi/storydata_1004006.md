## Subtitle: Treasure Map of Peril!
  
**Narration：**  
Once again, Misogi has invited {player} out to play.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hey, mister! Let's go exploring again!  
  
**Misogi：**  
...Huh?  
You're still traumatized from last time?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ah, it'll be fine!  
Randomly stumbling into monster nests  
doesn't happen every day! Probably!  
  
**Misogi：**  
And this time, we have an actual objective!  
Check out this map!  
I found it in my dad's room!  
  
**Misogi：**  
It's gotta be a treasure map, right?!  
Look! There's a little \"?\" mark here, see?  
I bet there's some kind of awesome treasure hidden there!  
  
**Misogi：**  
So there's only one thing for it!  
You and me are going on... a treasure hunt!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hey, mister...  
It looks like the treasure's somewhere inside this cave!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Do you think my dad came here too?  
He put a mark on the map, so he must've, right?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Awesome! We're exploring the same cave my dad explored!  
Wahoo!  
  
**Misogi：**  
C'mon, mister!  
It can't be much further to the \"?\" mark!  
Let's keep moving!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ummmm...  
If I'm reading this map right, it should be right around here...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Uhhhh...? There's nothing here...  
Was this just a boring old map after all?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hey, look at this wall...  
`Tag 1`  
**Misogi：**  
What's up, mister?  
Did you find something?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ooh! That rock's got an \"X\" on it!  
It's... buried in the wall, huh?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Well, you know what X marks! The treasure spot!  
I bet this rock is the switch to open a secret chamber!  
C'mon, let's pull it out!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  This is so exciting!  
**Choice: (3)**  Are you sure that's a good idea...?  
`Tag 2`  
**Misogi：**  
You get it, mister! You totally get it!  
When we find the treasure, I'll let you have half!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Misogi：**  
Whaaa?! We can't come all this way and NOT pull it out!  
I don't care what you say, I'm doing it!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Misogi：**  
Here goes nothing! Heave...  
 HO!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Whoa! That came out easier than I thought.  
But... nothing's really happening.  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh?  
Wh-what's this rumbling noise?  
Is it just me, or is the floor shaking?  
  
**Misogi：**  
W-waaahhh!  
The whole cave is falling apart!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Maybe the \"X\" wasn't to mark treasure...  
it was to mark a dangerous spot?!  
Sheesh, I messed up...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Less talking, more running!  
`Tag 5`  
**Misogi：**  
R-right. Yeah. Running.  
But, um... We came a long way from the entrance...  
Do you think we'll make it back in time?  
  
**Misogi：**  
Ahh! Hey mister, check it out!  
There's a minecart over there!  
  
**Misogi：**  
It looks like it still works!  
Maybe this way, we can make it out of the cave  
before it collapses!  
  
**Misogi：**  
C'mon, mister! Get inside, quick!  
We're getting outta here together!  
  

---  
  
**Misogi：**  
Wahoooooo! This thing's *fast!*  
And minecarts are the most explore-y way to travel!  
  
**Misogi：**  
Huh? This isn't the time to be having fun?  
Don't say that, mister! Live a little, why don't you?!  
  
**Misogi：**  
You don't get to ride a minecart every day!  
You gotta enjoy it while you can!  
Wahoooooo!  
  

---  
  
**Misogi：**  
Whewwww, that was fun!  
Looks like we made it out of the death cave,  
so I'd call today's adventure a success!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  And... the treasure...?  
**Choice: (7)**  W-we almost died...  
`Tag 6`  
**Misogi：**  
Hmm? Actually, that's weird. We never did find any.  
  
Jump to tag 8  
`Tag 7`  
**Misogi：**  
It's not an adventure without danger!  
And it *was* even marked with an X. That's easy mode danger.  
  
`Tag 8`  
**Misogi：**  
Hmmm... What was that map for in the end?  
The only thing we really found at the \"?\" mark was that minecart...  
  
**Misogi：**  
Hang on... Then maybe that map was actually  
just showing the way to the escape route?  
  
**Misogi：**  
My dad must have made it  
as a guide for budding explorers!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  ...What a crazy dad.  
`Tag 9`  
**Misogi：**  
Ooh, look! There's another map inside the cart!  
C'mon, mister, let's go explore here next time!  
  
**Narration：**  
As {player} wiped the cold sweat from his brow,  
Misogi was already raring to set out once more...
