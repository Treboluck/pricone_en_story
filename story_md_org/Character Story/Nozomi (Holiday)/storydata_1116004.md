**Narration：**  
After managing to find each other,  
Nozomi and {player} resume their date.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, look. The star on top of the tree  
is really sparkly.  
It looks like it's wishing us luck on our date. ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But isn't it a bit too bright?  
It's supposed to just be a decoration... Eek!

**Nozomi：**  
How is everyone?! Are you all having a good time?!  
  
**Fans：**  
Yeahhhh!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ahahah! I guess I didn't have to ask.  
Your passion is loud and clear!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
To be honest, I was a bit worried that nobody would come,  
seeing as it's the holidays. After all, it's a time for family and friends,  
lovers, and those dear to you.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I'm absolutely thrilled  
that you chose to spend your time with me!  
  
**Fans：**  
Yeahhhh!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Seriously, I really appreciate you all coming.  
If you hadn't, my manager would've called me out  
to a cafe afterward.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I wouldn't have been allowed to have any tasty cake or hot drinks,  
and my holidays would've ended with a huge scolding...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hey, if that ever happens, will you all come and save me?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Of course!  
`Tag 1`  
**Nozomi：**  
Hmmm. I can't hear you.  
It looks like I'll have to be going now.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  We'll definitely come running!  
`Tag 2`  
**Nozomi：**  
Thank you so much! This time I truly understood how you feel!  
Well then, I'm going to go nonstop until the very end!  
Can you all keep up with me?  
  
**Fans：**  
WOOOOOOOOO!

**Nozomi：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
Sorry I'm late, {player}!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I just got here.  
**Choice: (4)**  Did you get lost?  
`Tag 3`  
**Nozomi：**  
Really?  
Hang on—then what's with the empty plate and cup?  
It's obvious you're fibbing...  
But thanks. ♪

`Tag 4`  
**Nozomi：**  
Of course I didn't!  
Because I'm not you.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Nozomi：**  
Anyway, I'm sorry. And I was even the one who invited you.  
I wanted to get here earlier, but things have been a bit hectic...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But I'm glad you're here.  
I was relieved to see you when I opened the door.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
The fact that you're here means you  
understood my message, right? ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Right. I wanted you to come to our usual cafe.  
I sent a message that only you would understand  
when I was addressing the audience at the show.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
To be honest, on the way here,  
I was worried that you hadn't noticed  
what I was doing.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? Why did I invite you here?  
Really? I thought you got the message. Are you that slow?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Isn't it obvious I wanted to celebrate the holidays with you?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wow, you look like a deer caught in headlights.  
Well, it is pretty much a surprise, isn't it?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Since you gave me such a good reaction,  
I'll give you a present.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? You didn't get me anything?  
Don't worry about it.  
Getting to meet you over the holidays is more than enough.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Well, shall we begin?  
I've reserved the whole cafe, so we can take our time.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...I say that, but because I was late,  
we can't really take as long as we want.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
So let's enjoy ourselves as much as we can in the time we have.  
Happy holidays!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, it's getting late.  
I hate to say it, but I have to go.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Thanks for meeting up with me today. It was a bit short,  
but I'm really happy you came.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? You're still bothered by the fact that you haven't gotten  
me a present yet?  
Geez, you really take things seriously, don't you?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hmm... In that case, if we get to spend time together over the holidays again,  
I want to be with you even longer.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It doesn't have to be that special.  
Like, we could just stroll the  
streets together, enjoy the lights and special events, share a  
festive meal…  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I just want a really simple—and maybe a little romantic—  
day with you. ♪  
  
**Choice: (6)**  It's a date.  
`Tag 6`  
**Nozomi：**  
Really? You swear?  
You can't back out, now!  
Heehee. All right, your next present is going to be handmade. ♪

**Ameth：**  
And... we're back.  
Did you enjoy that little holiday dream?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Sending a message to you during a show  
is a rather bold thing to do. As expected of an idol. She has guts.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And you're not bad yourself,  
getting the message and waiting  
patiently without a word of complaint.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Even inside a dream, a promise is a promise.  
After you wake up, be sure to show her a good time, you hear?  
  
**Ameth：**  
And remember, being with a popular idol  
requires a certain amount of determination.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, it's about time I stop interfering.  
See you around, then. Oh, and happy holidays.

**Nozomi：**  
...Wha—? Was I sleeping just now? In the middle of town?  
My work must be catching up to me.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I had a dream about the holidays.  
Huh? No way! You had the same dream?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Urgh... Even in our dreams it's all \"holidays this,\" and \"holidays that.\"  
It's a bit embarrassing...  
Well, while we're on the subject,  
could you hold out your hands for me?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
What do you think? These gloves are your gift.  
I made them myself...  
I-if you don't like them, you can take them off.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  They're super warm.  
`Tag 7`  
**Nozomi：**  
R-really?  
If you're happy with them, then it was worth it!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...Wait, with this, pretty much all of my dreams have come true.  
Any more would just be excessive.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Where to next?  
`Tag 8`  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh?  
D-does that mean you'll stay with me a little longer?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Then, ummm... If it's okay with you, could you hold my hand?  
N-nothing serious, I just don't want you getting lost again!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, that was quick... You didn't hesitate at all.  
I really admire that about you.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Well then, let's be off. The day isn't over yet!  
  
**Narration：**  
Nozomi and {player}, hand in hand,  
went off into the increasingly lively city.
