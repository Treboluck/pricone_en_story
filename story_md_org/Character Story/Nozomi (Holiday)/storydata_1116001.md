**Narration：**  
Nozomi has just finished rehearsing for her solo concert tomorrow,  
and is preparing to leave.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
All right, it looks like all the staff has gone home already,  
so maybe it's about time I do too.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I should eat a light meal somewhere, take a shower,  
  
and then get to bed early for tomorrow.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...Actually, I think I'll practice a bit more.  
I'm still worried about the choreography.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
One, two, one, two.  
Turn,  
pose!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...Hmmm. Maybe the angle of my hand on the finish  
should be a little higher. And then make the turn a bit faster...  
Yeah, just like that!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I've only been doing Carmina shows lately.  
It's been a while since I've done one of my own,  
so it has to be perfect!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Without Chika and Tsumugi, everything depends on me.  
If I want to be a top idol, I can't do it half-heartedly!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
All right! One more time, from the top—  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Good work.  
`Tag 1`  
**Nozomi：**  
Ahhh!  
{player}? You frightened me...  
What are you doing here?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I see. You're a part-timer helping to set up the venue.  
And you were doing your final inspection, right?  
  
Thanks for working so late.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Are you done rehearsing?  
`Tag 2`  
**Nozomi：**  
Yeah, I was just doing a little extra practice.  
The staff did such a great job on the stage,  
so I have to do my best too.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? You were watching my rehearsal?  
H-how was it?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  It was amazing.  
`Tag 3`  
**Nozomi：**  
Really?  
Thank you!  
Even if you're just trying to flatter me, it's a real confidence boost.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hey, what did you think of my new song? I wrote the lyrics myself!  
Oh, and the setlist was great too, right? It had me stumped for a while.  
Oh yeah, I have loads of new merch as well!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
*sigh* Oh, what to do?  
I'm having such a good time just chatting with you.  
I wish we could talk like this forever.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
About tomorrow's concert, and about the holidays too.  
Yeah, we can continue our chat over a nice dinner together...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I mean, no, no! I'm still rehearsing!  
If I slack off now,  
it will affect the quality of my performance!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Er, I, um...  
Sorry,  
I still have quite a bit to practice for the concert.  
So...  
I'll see you tomorrow.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
......  
  
**Nozomi：**  
And he's gone...  
Did I come off a bit too cold?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But my goal is to become a top idol.  
In order to give a top performance, I need to be at my best.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ahhh, but what should I do if {player} hates me?!  
I want to believe he won't,  
but...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
*sigh...* Best not to dwell on it for now.  
I need to rehearse properly. The only way I can apologize is by doing a great show.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
One, two, one, two  
... It's no use, I can't calm down.  
How pathetic. I can't even do what I've put my mind to.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Still working hard?  
`Tag 4`  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? {player}?! How come...?  
Didn't you go home?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, a hot drink...  
Is that where you went? To get this for me?  
...Thank you.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, leaving already?  
N-no, I'm still rehearsing,  
but you're not a nuisance at all...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...W-wait!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Er, I was actually about to take a break.  
So let's chat until I've finished my drink.  
Okay, sound good?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
*sigh* I guess I'm still quite weak-willed.  
But it's okay to indulge just this once, right?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
By the way, it's already the holiday season, right?  
The town is totally decked in holiday colors,  
and it's so much fun just to look at.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hey, do you have any plans for the holidays?  
I guess you have dates with lots of girls coming up,  
haven't you?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Why do you ask?  
**Choice: (6)**  Not really.  
`Tag 5`  
**Nozomi：**  
I-I was just wondering!  
No particular reason!  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Nozomi：**  
Y-you don't have to put it so bluntly...  
But huh,  
I see... Eheheh.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Nozomi：**  
...Ummm, I'm allowed to have one day off.  
Do you want to go out with me?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Sure.  
`Tag 8`  
**Nozomi：**  
Really?! Are you sure?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wh-whaaa?! What should I do?!  
I can't believe how easily he said okay!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Either way, I want it to be romantic.  
I want to wear cute clothes, have a delicious dinner,  
get close to him while enjoying the lights...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, and I'll have to prepare a present!  
It's a special occasion, so I should make it by hand. ♪  
Whee! I'm getting kind of excited!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? Why am I grinning? I'm not grinning at all!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Well, my break is over. I've got to do one final run-through.  
See you tomorrow!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hey, look! The audience is huge!  
It's a full house! I'm so happy!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hehe.  
Don't worry. Right now, I'm really excited.  
Even the nerves are thrilling.  
I'm so eager to get out there, I'm ready to pop!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Well, here I go!  
Don't forget about our date!  
  
**Narration：**  
And with that,  
Nozomi took to the stage wearing a radiant expression on her face.
