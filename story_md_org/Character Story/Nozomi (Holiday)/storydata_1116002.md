# Nozomi (Holiday) Episode 2
When Nozomi arrives early for her date with {player}, she finds that a promotional event for Carmina is being held nearby. A playback issue with the event's sound system means there is no music, so Nozomi herself sings from behind the scenes in order to help make the event a success.

**Narration：**  
On the day of her date with {player}, Nozomi is on her way to their agreed meeting place.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Urgh... So I did leave too early.  
It's nowhere near the time we agreed to meet.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I was so excited that my feet got itchy,  
and I just had to leave home.  
I'm like a child. How embarrassing.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hmmm. But it's to be expected, isn't it?  
It's my first time spending such a special day with a boy.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I'm all dressed up, I've got his present ready,  
and I've looked up the stores and events I'm interested in!  
As an idol, I must always strive for perfection!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...Wait. Am I overdoing it?  
He won't get freaked out, will he?  
It'll be fine, right?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Well, I made it to the festive tree where we agreed to meet, but...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wh-what's with the large crowd over there?!  
That's too many people to be gathered just because it's the holiday season...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...Hm? Ah! Is that {player}?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
How come? It's still far too early for our date.  
Well, I'm one to talk.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, it looks like they're setting up some kind of event.  
Wait, isn't that a Carmina poster?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? HUH? Nobody told me!  
Just what are they doing in a place like this?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It looks like a Sound Record promotional event.  
I guess they're aiming for the holiday crowds.  
She's shrewd, our producer.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But why is {player} at work right before our date?  
Oh well, it's just like him to do something like that.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I'd love to help out, but I'm afraid I'll make a scene  
and cause a nuisance.  
  
I think I'll just sneak over there and observe how everyone works.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Setting up the stall... Preparing flyers and merchandise...  
Calling in customers and directing the lines of fans...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Even in the cold, they're trying to ensure a great event.  
They're all so hardworking...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Everyone's supporting us from behind the scenes  
so that we can focus on our own job to the best of our ability.  
I need to make sure to thank them properly.  
  
**Staff Member 1：**  
Hey, c'mon, are you for real?!  
The event's about to start.  
What are you gonna do about it?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
H-huh? Did something happen?  
  
**Staff Member 1：**  
A malfunctioning playback system  
at a Sound Record promotional event?  
If the new song doesn't play, then it'll all be pointless!  
Why didn't you test the equipment?!  
  
**Staff Member 2：**  
M-my apologies...  
I'll set up a new playback device immediately.  
  
**Staff Member 1：**  
New device? Are you gonna go get it from the office?  
Do you honestly think there's time for that?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'll go get it!  
`Tag 1`  
**Staff Member 1：**  
H-hey, wait...! And he's gone.  
Does that part-timer even know where the office is?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hold on a minute, {player}!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Huh? It's not time for our date yet.  
**Choice: (3)**  Sorry, I'm in a bit of a hurry.  
`Tag 2`  
**Nozomi：**  
I have nothing to say about that.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Nozomi：**  
Yeah, I know!  
I know you are. Just slow down a sec!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Nozomi：**  
I heard what's going on.  
A piece of equipment's broken, right?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
And you're on your way to get a replacement.  
But it doesn't matter how fast you run,  
you'll never make it back in time.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
So let's just make do with what we have here.  
Trust me, I've got it all figured out.  
This dilemma  
is no match for our combined efforts!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Spread your wings of courage and fly... ♪  
  
**Fan 1：**  
Wow! An a cappella version of Nozomin's song!  
This is so awesome!  
  
**Fan 2：**  
And they're saying we only get to hear it here today.  
It's a super special edition!  
I'm so glad I braved the cold for this!  
  
**Staff Member 2：**  
Whew. For a moment I thought the event was done for, but you  
really came through. And the fans really seem to be loving it.  
Where on earth did you manage to find such a rare demo?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  It's a trade secret.  
`Tag 5`  
**Nozomi：**  
Hee hee. It looks like my plan worked.  
I guess nobody expected the real thing  
to be singing from behind the sales counter.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Thanks to your power, I'm super strong right now.  
Even without a mic, the crowd can hear my voice,  
  
and my throat feels absolutely fine.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Everyone's always doing their best to support me,  
so this time I'm going all out!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Good work.  
I'm so thrilled it turned out to be such a great event.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Thanks, you saved the day.  
`Tag 6`  
**Nozomi：**  
You're absolutely welcome.  
It was all just improv,  
but I'm glad it went well.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Even the customers who weren't fans were interested,  
and you sold out of all the Sound Records.  
It was totally worthwhile.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But don't go thinking we're all done for the day.  
Our real date is just about to begin.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Come on, I'm still riding high from all that singing!  
Let's go and have ourselves a good time!  
  
**Narration：**  
Riding the wave of euphoria that came from surmounting  
an unforeseen challenge, with fresh resolve, Nozomi was  
determined to have the best date ever.
