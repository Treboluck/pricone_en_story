**Chika：**  
Oh, it's {player}.  
Hm? Wait a minute.  
Are those...  
babies that he's holding?!  
  
**Chika：**  
I-I never knew that he was a father!  
Of two, even!  
  
**Chika：**  
But who's the mother, then?  
Curious as I am, I'd rather not pry too much...  
It's probably best to just say congratulations.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hey there.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chika：**  
O-oh. H-hello there.  
Urgh... I didn't expect him to notice me.  
  
**Chika：**  
Umm... C-Can I ask who the mother is?!  
Is it someone I know, perhaps?!  
  
**Chika：**  
Huh? They're not actually yours?  
You're just taking care of the cake store owner's children  
because they're so busy during the holiday period?  
  
**Chika：**  
I-I see!  
That sure was a silly mistake to make.  
I'm so sorry for jumping to conclusions!  
  
**Chika：**  
They're twins, I see.  
Look at them both tugging away at your cheeks.  
It's adorable. Hehe.  
  
**Chika：**  
Huh? You're curious about what I'm wearing?  
It's my outfit for tonight. I'll be performing on stage  
with the children's choir.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It suits you.  
**Choice: (3)**  How beautiful.  
`Tag 2`  
**Chika：**  
Y-you really think so?!  
I figured it was a bit too flashy for me,  
so it's nice to hear that from you.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Chika：**  
Y-you're talking specifically about the outfit, aren't you?  
Ah, sorry. Don't mind me.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Chika：**  
I can't help but blush whenever  
you say something nice about me...  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh no! They're really pulling on your face now!  
That looks like it hurts!  
  
**Chika：**  
A-and now they've got their fingers up your nose!  
They're spreading it far and wide!  
  
**Chika：**  
U-umm.  
I can help out, if you'd like.  
There's still plenty of time until I need to be on stage.  
  
**Chika：**  
I'll take one of them off your hands.  
H-huh? Why did she start crying...?  
  
**Chika：**  
Is it because of me?  
O-oh no! What should I do?!  
She just won't stop!  
  
**Chika：**  
Ah?! Now her brother's joining in!  
There, there. Don't worry.  
There's nothing to be afraid of.  
  
**Chika：**  
{player},  
do you mind if we take them to the Guild Association?  
They'll be much better off somewhere nice and quiet!  
  
**Chika：**  
They just won't stop, will they?  
But what should we even do?  
I'm not nearly experienced enough in dealing with babies...  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh? Their parents left you a note with instructions?  
What a relief! That should help!  
  
**Chika：**  
Let's see here... It says to check their diapers first and foremost.  
Okay! Let's change their diapers!  
First up is the boy!  
  
**Chika：**  
Then again, I've never changed a baby's diapers before...  
Wow, that was quick!  
You're amazing!  
Now to throw away the dirty diaper...  
  
**Chika：**  
Eeek!  
H-his private parts are showing!  
  
**Chika：**  
P-phew... I managed to avoid seeing them.  
But wait...  
I won't be able to take care of him if I let that get to me.  
  
**Chika：**  
Next up is his sister. Let's see...  
Oh! P-please wait!  
  
**Chika：**  
Let me handle her!  
You're not allowed to look! Absolutely not!  
  
**Chika：**  
I just need to copy how he did it...  
S-stay still for me, okay?  
I'll get you all nice and clean.  
  
**Chika：**  
Phew... Wrap it here, tighten it up here... And done!  
Thank goodness. They actually stopped crying.  
  
**Chika：**  
*huff, puff*  
They've gotten their milk too, so we should be good.  
But wow... Taking care of  
babies is even harder than I imagined.  
  
**Chika：**  
Things should be peaceful for a little bi—  
Wait. Huh? Why?  
The boy's started acting up again.  
  
**Chika：**  
There, there. It's nap time, so let's go to sleep.  
Oh no... He's crying again...  
  
**Chika：**  
E-even worse,  
his sister's crying now too, thanks to him...  
  
**Chika：**  
Huh? You think they might settle down if I sing them a lullaby?  
That's a good idea, actually. And it's my forte.  
  
**Chika：**  
There's no reason to feel embarrassed in this situation, either.  
Okay then. Let me give it a shot.  
  
**Chika：**  
Lah-lah-lah. ♪  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh! They really did fall asleep!  
Thank goodness...  
  
**Chika：**  
Hey, wait a minute.  
Even {player} fell asleep.  
I should put a blanket over him so he doesn't catch a cold.  
  
**Chika：**  
Here you go.  
You've more than earned yourself a nap. Sleep tight.  
  
**Chika：**  
I shouldn't have expected any less of him, though.  
We're right in the middle of the holidays, but I guess  
he really can't resist helping those in need.  
  
**Chika：**  
But that's what makes him special.  
Always admirable, always kind.  
  
**Chika：**  
Hehe. Being with him makes this year's  
festive season all the more special.  
  
**Chika：**  
Happy holidays, {player}. ♪  
  
**Narration：**  
Chika continued to hum a lullaby as  
{player} slept away by her side.
