## Subtitle: A Delivery Full of Happiness
  
**Narration：**  
Chika and {player} make their  
way towards the cake shop to return the babies to their parents.  
  
**Chika：**  
Wow... Cake stores are even more  
breathtaking during this time of the year.  
The entire lineup looks delicious.  
  
**Owner：**  
*sigh*  
Dammit... Why now, of all times?  
  
**Chika：**  
H-huh?  
I wonder what's wrong... He looks awfully downtrodden.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Excuse me!  
`Tag 1`  
**Owner：**  
Hm?  
Oh. Hey there.  
Thanks for taking care of our kids.  
  
**Owner：**  
Didn't realize it was this late already.  
Sorry you had to see that. I shouldn't be looking so down  
in front of our customers.  
  
**Chika：**  
Um, we're willing to hear you out if there's some sort of issue.  
  
**Owner：**  
Thanks. We kind of have a big issue on our hands, actually.  
  
**Owner：**  
Truth is, a huge swarm of monsters've appeared on the highway.  
We were supposed to head out of town to deliver some cakes,  
but got told we can't use the main road now thanks to that.  
  
**Chika：**  
That's awful!  
I assume you can't deliver them at all now?  
  
**Owner：**  
Yup. It's especially frustrating because those customers  
made the effort to come all the way to Landosol  
to put in an order for them. Quite a while back, too.  
  
**Owner：**  
And you know how much families look forward to those cakes  
at this time of the year. They're essentially  
another symbol of the holidays.  
  
**Owner：**  
But here I am, left with no choice but to strip them  
of that happiness. It's a terrible feeling, if I'm being honest.  
  
**Chika：**  
...  
  
**Chika：**  
Hey, {player}.  
Do you think we could help him out?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's deliver those cakes.  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm down for free cake.  
`Tag 2`  
**Chika：**  
Agreed.  
I'm sure the two of us can do it if we work together!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Chika：**  
Err... It would be a shame to let them go to waste, sure,  
but that's not quite what I was implying.  
  
**Chika：**  
In fact, I was hoping we could take matters  
into our own hands and deliver them ourselves!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Chika：**  
I don't want to impose,  
but would you be willing to let us handle the deliveries for you?  
  
**Owner：**  
You two?  
I appreciate the sentiment, but I wouldn't want to  
expose you to that much danger.  
  
**Chika：**  
Don't fret. The two of us can manage it together.  
Most of all, we want those families to be happy as well.  
  
**Chika：**  
{player}. I can both distance the monsters  
and put them to sleep with my Song Summoning,  
so reaching our destination shouldn't be an issue.  
  
**Chika：**  
Now then. Let's get started!  
  
**Chika：**  
I realize this is a silly thing to say, but monsters really don't  
concern themselves with holidays, do they? Otherwise there  
wouldn't be such a big swarm at this time of the year.  
  
**Chika：**  
Strange observations aside,  
let's take care not to damage the cakes on our way there.  
  
**Chika：**  
I can only imagine how disappointed the customers  
would be if they opened the box,  
only to find that we'd  
crushed the little Santa adorning them.  
  
**Chika：**  
We're around halfway there, I'd say.  
Thankfully I can just put weaker monsters to sleep,  
but we're bound to run into some stronger ones soon.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Chika：**  
Speak of the devil!  
And it has every intention of coming after us, it seems!  
  
**Chika：**  
Lend me your strength, {player}!  
I should be able to handle it if you power up my Song Summoning!  
  
**Chika：**  
Mmm... I can feel tremendous power welling up from inside me.  
That ability of yours never ceases to impress!  
  
**Chika：**  
Spirit of wind, I beseech you.  
Fend off this vicious beast!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Chika：**  
Phew. Are the cakes okay?  
I noticed the box shaking a bit...  
Oh, they're still fine.  
Thank goodness.  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh! That house over there is our first destination!  
  
**Chika：**  
Excuse me!  
We're here to deliver a cake ordered in Landosol!  
  
**Child：**  
Wow! Look, Mom!  
They brought us our cake!  
  
**Mother：**  
Oh my. We were just talking about giving up this year due to  
the monster situation.  
Thank you so much for coming all this way  
to deliver it! You have no idea how much we appreciate it!  
  
**Child：**  
Thank you so much, Santa!  
  
**Chika：**  
Huh? Err,  
uh... You're welcome.  
  
**Chika：**  
Seeing their smiling faces sure was nice, wasn't it?  
Now then, off to the next destination!

**Chika：**  
And that's the last of them. We really made it to every household.  
  
**Chika：**  
I'm sure they're all having a lovely holiday evening right about now.  
  
**Chika：**  
Hehe. A number of them treated us like Santa Claus, didn't they?  
That was nice.  
  
**Chika：**  
But I'd say you were the real Santa.  
I was more of the trusty reindeer.  
Except my nose isn't red.  
  
**Chika：**  
Personally, though?  
I'm beyond happy that I could use my  
Song Summoning for the sake of others.  
  
**Chika：**  
Hehe. Just remembering how elated they all seemed  
brings a big smile to my face. I'm so glad  
that we offered to help.  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh, right.  
It'd be nice if I could express my gratitude towards the spirits, too.  
  
**Chika：**  
Hm... The only thing that comes to mind is doing it through song.  
What do you think?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Sounds good to me.  
`Tag 5`  
**Chika：**  
Thank you.  
But if I'm going to sing, I'd like it if you listened as well.  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh? The spirits have all gathered around.  
Hehe. There's no need to rush.  
I still haven't decided what to sing yet.  
  
**Chika：**  
Can you give me some time to think?  
I want this to be a present from the bottom of my heart.  
  
**Narration：**  
In that moment, the smile on Chika's face was second to none.
