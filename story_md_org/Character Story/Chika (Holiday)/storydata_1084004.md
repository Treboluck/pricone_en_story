**Narration：**  
With the concert having ended, Chika and  
{player} are letting everything finally sink in.  
  
**Chika：**  
My hands are still shaking...  
  
**Chika：**  
But this time it's a good thing.  
I can still hear everyone's cheers and applause.  
It's sheer exhilaration.  
  
**Chika：**  
Um, so how was the concert?  
  
**Chika：**  
You thought it was amazing? Really?  
I'm happy to hear that, but also a little embarrassed.  
  
**Chika：**  
I really feel like I achieved something today. More so than usual.  
Like I've grown as a person, if that makes sense.  
  
**Chika：**  
Hm? It's getting rather bright,  
isn't it?  
Eeek!

**Chika：**  
Welcome!  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh, {player}! Perfect timing.  
I have a little favor to ask of you.  
Could you take a look at this flyer for me?  
  
**Chika：**  
There's a choir concert coming up soon,  
so...  
Would you like to come see it with me?  
  
**Chika：**  
They're a popular group that's even done lots of performances  
abroad! That, plus they do all sorts of genres, from contemporary  
to pop music!  
I'm really, really looking forward to it!  
  
**Chika：**  
You're free on that day?  
Thank goodness!  
  
**Chika：**  
Huh? You don't get why I haven't gone to see them before?  
  
**Chika：**  
Well, um...  
You'll understand when we get there.  
  
**Narration：**  
On the day of the concert...

**Chika：**  
Nothing but couples, right?  
This is why I avoided going until now.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Talk about a popular date spot.  
**Choice: (2)**  This is a little embarrassing.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chika：**  
I-indeed.  
But well, it *is* that time of the year.  
It makes sense when you think about it.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Chika：**  
R-right?! It's a bit too overwhelming to come alone.  
That's why I've never done it before.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Chika：**  
Um...  
I realize it's a little late to ask,  
but does it bother you, being here together like this?  
  
**Chika：**  
Not at all?  
In fact, you were looking forward to it?  
Thank goodness. That's a load off my mind.  
  
**Chika：**  
I was actually a bit hesitant to invite you, to tell you the truth.  
But I really wanted you to come.  
  
**Chika：**  
Huh? Do I think you were really the right choice?  
Of course I do! I wanted you more than any—  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh! It's about to start!  
  
**Chika：**  
J-just forget about that last exchange.  
Let's focus on enjoying the concert.  
  
**Chika：**  
*sigh* That was fantastic.  
Their voices were so clear and beautiful...  
  
**Chika：**  
The holiday lights around town are so pretty, too.  
They make it feel like we're living in a dreamland.  
  
**Chika：**  
Hm? Did I want to be on stage today?  
Well,  
I won't deny that I'd love to sing in a venue like that someday.  
  
**Chika：**  
But I can't be by your side if I'm up there singing.  
So I was plenty content being part of the audience today.  
  
**Chika：**  
That was the plan, after all.  
I wanted to enjoy the performance together with you.  
  
**Chika：**  
Thank you for coming. Really.  
I'm glad we got to spend this time together.  
  
**Chika：**  
Happy holidays. ♪

**Ameth：**  
And there we have it. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Think of what you just saw as a dream of sorts.  
Chances are you'll forget everything the second you wake up,  
so no need to brood over it too much.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She really went and invited you to a concert full of couples.  
If that isn't a bold move, then I don't know what is.  
And let's not forget what day it was, either! Whew!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Are you ready to face her feelings, my friend?  
You better be. Especially after you wake up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, that's enough chitchat for now.  
Bye-bye. See you around! ♪

**Chika：**  
Mmm...  
H-huh? When did I fall asleep?  
Or I guess "we," by the looks of it.  
  
**Chika：**  
I had a dream. A really lovely one, in fact.  
The two of us went to a concert together  
Huh? You had the same dream?  
  
**Chika：**  
What a delightful coincidence.  
It was just a dream in the end,  
but being able to enjoy the same music together made me happy.  
  
**Chika：**  
Today was a day full of musical experiences, wasn't it?  
It made me realize just how much music  
is woven into even the smallest parts of our lives.  
  
**Chika：**  
I truly hope I can be of help to others in the same way,  
together with the spirits.  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh, goodness. It's gotten pretty late.  
But, um... Could you spare me a little more of you time?  
I'd like you to hear another song of mine.  
  
**Chika：**  
That's right. The one I mentioned after we delivered those cakes,  
as a way of expressing thanks to the spirits.  
I finally settled on a song.  
  
**Chika：**  
There's not that many people around here, so it should be fine.  
Hehe. Almost feels like I'm doing my first recital again.  
  
**Chika：**  
Trough this song, I express my gratitude.  
Please listen.  
  
**Chika：**  
Lah-lah-lah. ♪  
  
**Chika：**  
The spirits seem to be overjoyed.  
They must really like it.  
  
**Chika：**  
Phew.  
Um, how about you? Did you like it?  
  
**Chika：**  
Huh?! You think I sounded like an angel?!  
C-come on. There's no need to say something so embarrassing...  
  
**Chika：**  
U-um... I got to experience all sorts of things today.  
Thanks to you, I can really appreciate the power of song.  
  
**Chika：**  
I always feel so warm and fulfilled when I'm with you.  
More so than when I'm with anyone else.  
That's why I... I want to be with you even mo—  
  
**Chika：**  
A-applause?! B-but why?!  
  
**Chika：**  
Oh... Right. Everyone else was able to hear my song, too.  
  
**Chika：**  
Huh? You think I was able to brighten their day?  
Oh... It wasn't just the spirits, then.  
I was able to influence this many people.  
  
**Chika：**  
Hehe. This is most joyful holiday season I've ever experienced.  
And it's all because I spent it by your side.  
  
**Chika：**  
Thank you for the wonderful day,  
{player}.
