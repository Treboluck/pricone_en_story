**Kaori：**  
Awaahhh...  
Meat... I want meat so bad...  
  
**Kaori：**  
At Caon, we all take turns to do the cooking...  
But Maho's into healthy eating, and Kasumi mostly eats  
veggie stuff, so I never feel quite satisfied on their days...  
  
**Kaori：**  
If it's not enough, I can always make something myself...  
And I do like cooking, so I don't even mind...  
 But if I cook,  
it just ends up being dishes from my homeland every day.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Those ingredients aren't easy to come by in Landosol,  
so it gets pricey... And Caon isn't exactly the richest guild.  
I'd feel bad wasting money.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Besides, after leaving my homeland and coming all this way,  
I'd much rather try lots of the local food!  
When in the city, do as the city folk do, right?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Gotta get my tongue and stomach and all  
nicely in tune with the local tastes!  
If I'm gonna make a life in this city, that is!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Mmmhhh...  
Today was Kasumi's turn for cooking,  
so I've had nothing but veggies since morning...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ahh... My body wants protein...  
Meat... I need tasty meat...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Whoa?  
I-I'm sorry!  
I bumped right into you!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Huh? {player}, it's you!  
Haitai! ♪  
What're you doing around here?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hmm...? You're really hungry, but you've got no money,  
so you were wandering around just savoring the tasty smells?  
Wow, tough break! That's like some kind of trial!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oh, then why don't you come with me to that barbecue  
restaurant?  
 I'm pretty hungry right now too!  
 But y'know...  
Grilling meat all by myself would be kinda sad.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Solo barbecues are like singing with no audience—  
the loneliest thing in the world! That's what Kasumi said!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I don't really get most of the stuff Kasumi says,  
but I agreed with her on that one!  
It's lonely without any friends...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Sure, it can be my treat!  
You helped me pick all those goya-ish veggies before,  
so I owe you!  
 C'mon, let's do it! Let's go fill our bellies together!  
  
**Kaori：**  
And look here! It says there's a discount for couples!  
Isn't a couple just a boy and a girl?  
So me and you are totally a couple! Right?! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha! I've never been to a barbecue restaurant before!  
  
**Kaori：**  
You either, huh?  
Cool! A first for us both!  
Trying something new is always kind of exciting, right? Aha!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hmm... So we don't need to cut our own meat,  
the staff just bring it in slices?  
But we do get to grill it ourselves! I see, I see...  
  
**Kaori：**  
...Hmm?  
Hey, {player}...  
I don't know what these words on the menu mean!  
  
**Kaori：**  
What's a \"misuji cut\"? And this \"offal\" thing?  
Hmmm... It's pretty tricky.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oh well, if we don't know, we can always just ask the waiter!  
Don't sweat the small stuff!  
  
**Kaori：**  
{player}, you should order something!  
What're you wanting to eat?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Anything as long as it's meat!  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm in more of a veggie mood.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaori：**  
Aha! Is that right?  
Sounds just like my mood! We're in sync today! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Right then... there's a bunch of \"chef's recommendations,\"  
so let's order some of those!  
As long as it's meat, it's good! My body needs that protein!

`Tag 2`  
**Kaori：**  
Huh?  
Then why'd you come to a barbecue place?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Was it just because I wanted to?  
That's sweet, but I didn't mean to force you into anything!  
Sorry if I pressured you...  
  
**Kaori：**  
You should be more proactive  
about voicing your own opinions and stuff!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Though I guess I'm always doing nothing but voicing mine,  
so if you average the two of us out, we're just right!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kaori：**  
Aha!  
Anyways, let's get our orders in!  
Hey, waiter! Let's have some of these!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Eheheh... I can't wait!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Meat, meat, meaty meat!  
I'm so excited, I could start dancing right now!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hm?  
You feel just the same?  
That's neat! It's always nice to share the same feelings!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Thanks so much for coming along with me today,  
{player}! ♪
