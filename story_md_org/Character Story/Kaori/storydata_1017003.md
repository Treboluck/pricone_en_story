# Kaori Episode 3
The bandits are powerless in the face of Kaori's karate. But it turns out it was the bandits' boss who was growing the goya-like vegetables. The boss is thrilled by the dishes Kaori cooked, and stops the fighting so that everyone can enjoy Kaori's cooking together.

**Kaori：**  
Oopsie-daisy...  
 Punch! ☆  
  
**Bandit：**  
Aaaaaaghhh!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hmm...? You're all pretty slow off the mark!  
Are you hungry?  
You can always have some of my cooking if you like!  
  
**Bandit：**  
A-are you taunting us?!  
You brat... I'll skin you alive!  
  
**Kaori：**  
A-hup! Why the angry faces? I guess hunger does make  
you frustrated!  
You'll feel better if you eat a tasty meal!  
Let's all smile and be friends, OK?  
  
**Bandit：**  
Shaddup!  
Dammit... What's this girl's deal?!  
She's too strong!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha! My karate is the greatest in the world!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Or maybe you guys are just too weak.  
You've got me outnumbered, and you're all armed,  
so how come you still can't put up a fight?  
  
**Kaori：**  
At this rate, you're all going to get KO'd  
before we even finish the first dance!  
  
**Bandit：**  
Urghh... That does it...!  
Bossman! Help us out here!  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
Ehhhh?!  
The hell's all this commotion out here?  
You lot! Didn't I tell you to steer clear of these parts?!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ooh... This guy looks like a head honcho.  
This might be more of a challenge!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Actually, can I really handle this many?  
If Maho was here, she'd hit them all with a single attack spell...  
Maybe she was right, and I shoulda brought the whole gang...  
  
**Kaori：**  
But y'know, there's no telling what they'll do if I let  
them capture us.  
I've gotta break through their ranks  
and at least get {player} to safety...  
  
**Kaori：**  
It's Caon's job to protect innocent civilians!  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
Hmm?  
Hey! You there! What's that you're eating?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Huh?  
This is called goya champuru! It's a dish from my homeland.  
Umm... Mr. Bossman, would you like to try some?  
  
**Bandit：**  
Bah! We're in the middle of a brawl here, ain't we?!  
Trying to bargain for your life with food?!  
No way you're getting off that easy!  
  
**Bandit：**  
No mercy! You're both dead meat!  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
Shaddup!  
Ahhh... This takes me back...  
This is it! It's the dish I've been looking for!  
  
**Bandit：**  
Boss? What're you talking about?  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
See, I've always lived as a wandering man,  
but long ago, I tasted an amazing dish in some far-off land...  
Ever since, I've been trying to recreate its flavor from memory.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ohhh... So these goya-like veggies...  
You must've grown them yourself, huh?  
I'm really sorry! I didn't know they belonged to someone!  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
That's fine. No one can lay claim to the forest's trees.  
More to the point... That \"goya champuru\" of yours...  
Could you let me have a bite?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Sure thing! You want me to make some more? If you've  
got the ingredients, I could make lots more stuff from  
back home, too!  
 The rest of you can dig in too, if you like!  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
Well, hot dang!  
You lot, put those weapons away!  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
Harm this chick, and I'll slaughter the lot of ya!  
Ahhh, I remember all these dishes!  
The taste... of my youth...! ☆  
  
**Bandit：**  
Wh... whaaaa...?  
Bossman? What are you even saying?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Go on! Eat up lots and lots!  
 Mr. Bossman, you must've  
worked awful hard to grow those goya veggies!  
Did you really breed such a rare vegetable from scratch?  
  
**Kaori：**  
You loved the dishes from my homeland that much, huh?  
That's so great! I'll try to make them the best I can!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Okies, everyone take a seat!  
Let's dance and sing and have a great time together!  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
Ahhh, this bitter taste!  
This is the stuff! Just how I remember!  
It's good... So good...!  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
C'mon boys, tonight we're having a banquet! Gahahah!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha! You guys aren't half as nasty as you look!  
Why're you doing this bandit stuff, anyway?  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
Ah, well... We couldn't stay in the city,  
so we've gotta make a living for ourselves in the forest.  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
We've been making fields to grow our own crops...  
The whole bandit thing is just a big misunderstanding.  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
When folk wander into our territory,  
we do give 'em a bit of a scare so they'll leave us alone.  
But most of the time, we're a totally peaceful bunch.  
  
**Kaori：**  
I see! I'll let Caon know what's going on, then!  
If you like, I could try and set things up  
so you can sell the vegetables you grow here!  
  
**Kaori：**  
If people think you're bandits, they might send someone to  
take you out...  
And it'd be a shame to lose these lovely crops!  
What d'you think? Sounds nice and peaceful, right?  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
You're too kind! Trying to turn good-for-nothings like us  
back into honest members of society!  
Today we celebrate! A toast to this young lady!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha! You guys are pretty fun!  
I'm starting to enjoy myself! C'mon, let's dance!  
  
**Kaori：**  
{player}, come sing and dance with me!  
Take my hand in yours, and skip to the music!  
  
**Bandit Boss：**  
Ahahah!  
Is that fella your boyfriend, girlie?  
You sure do seem close!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Uehh?  
Don't be silly! It's not like that at all!  
Right, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm just a random passerby.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm just her friend.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaori：**  
Y-yeah!  
That's right... We barely know each other!  
Aha!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Mmm... When he talks like we're not even friends,  
it makes me feel... kind of lonely.  
Why is that?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kaori：**  
Mm? Friends?  
That's right! We picked those goya thingies together, after all!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Eheheh...Me and {player} only just met today,  
but I feel like we're gonna be really good friends!  
All the world's one big family! Aha!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kaori：**  
Aha... Anyways,  
 today I got to eat good food and  
dance with you all! It's a good day!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'd better give thanks for this happy meeting  
to the gods of my homeland!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'll offer them my singing and dancing, and pray for plenty  
more happiness in future!  
 Food, dancing, all good things  
are an offering to this wonderful world!  
  
**Kaori：**  
C'mon, {player}...  
You should have fun with us too!  
Let your hair down, and don't sweat the small stuff!
