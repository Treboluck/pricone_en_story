While out on patrol for her guild, Caon, Kaori spots what looks like a goya melon hanging from a tree, and climbs effortlessly up to retrieve it. When {player} passes down below, she calls out to him to ask for his help.

**Kaori：**  
Hmhmhmm~♪  
Strolling along, strolling along, always so much fun~! ♪  
  
**Kaori：**  
Mmmm! It feels good to get out!  
When I'm stuck in the city for ages, it always gets a bit stuffy!  
It's so nice to stroll through the great outdoors for a change!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Better yet, this even counts as part of my Caon work!  
I'm on patrol!  
Keeping the townsfolk safe and happy, that's our job!  
  
**Kaori：**  
This forest here is pretty close to the city!  
So it's good to make sure it's free from danger!  
You never do know when someone might wander inside!  
  
**Kaori：**  
First we protect the city, then the areas around it,  
and soon the whole world will be peaceful!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oh...? Do I spy goya melons hanging from that treetop?  
Those *are* goya, right?  
Why're they up on tree branches, though? Are they a different plant?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha! You never see goya in the city, so it's a while  
since I've had any!  
 I do miss the taste of home!  
Let me grab these ones and make a feast of them!  
  
**Kaori：**  
There's still a good chance they're not real goya at all,  
but that's fine by me!  
 If I play around with seasonings,  
I bet I can get the right sort of flavor!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Only thing is,  
 how am I going to get them down  
from all the way up there?  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'm plenty good at tree-climbing, so it's not like I can't reach.  
But with my hands full of melony goodness,  
it wouldn't be easy to climb back down...  
  
**Kaori：**  
And I came out for a regular stroll,  
so I haven't got anything to carry them home in, either...  
  
**Kaori：**  
I guess I could always  
 bring them down one by one,  
but that would take an awful long time...  
  
**Kaori：**  
But at the same time, I can't toss those goya-looking things  
down to the ground from all the way up there...  
It'd ruin the lot of them for sure... Hmmmm...  
  
**Kaori：**  
Well, whatever! I've got plenty of time to spare!  
Why waste time thinking when I can just give it my best try?  
Once I get moving, it'll work out! Don't sweat the small stuff!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Up I go, up I go...!  
Ooh! The view from up here is just amazing!  
Yahoo! ☆  
  
**Kaori：**  
Oops, I was having so much fun I climbed to the top!  
The goya thingies are growing a bit further down...  
I'd better double back!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hmm?  
Oh... Someone down there's walking right this way!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hey!  
You down there! Haitai! ☆  
  
**Kaori：**  
\"Haitai\" is a greeting! It's part of the dialect we use  
back home!  
 Most people 'round these parts don't  
understand it, though. Makes me a little sad.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hmm?  
What am I doing? I'm climbing trees!  
D'you want to join in?  
  
**Kaori：**  
You'll pass?  
But it's loads of fun, though!  
It's not difficult at all! Let me teach you how it's done!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Mmm...?  
Oh, you want to know my name?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Right, silly me! That's the culture here, isn't it?  
You've gotta say your name and your guild!  
Makoto always gets mad when I forget!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Let's start over. Haitai!  
You can call me Kaori!  
I'm a member of a guild called Caon!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Well, I say I'm a member—I basically had nowhere else to go.  
When I came to this country, those \"Menagerie\" people  
who look out for beastfolk introduced me to them!  
  
**Kaori：**  
They said they'd have use for my skills!  
So that's how I ended up  
joining a Menagerie guild called Caon!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'm stronger than I might look,  
so a guild that defends the peace is just right for me, y'know?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ahaha!  
Yep, my name's Kaori, and my guild's called Caon!  
Kinda similar, aren't they?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha! What's your name, then?  
Ohh? {player}, is it?  
Great—let's be friends! All the world's one big family!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It's nice to meet you.  
**Choice: (2)**  Your underwear is almost showing...  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaori：**  
Yep! It's a pleasure!  
Ahaha... The people in this country are all so polite!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Huh? You don't actually come from this country?  
Wow, you're just like me, then! Visitor pals!  
It's great that we've run into each other, so let's get along!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kaori：**  
Hmm?  
Oh, don't worry! I'm wearing shorts under here, see?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Actually, all these accessories I put on my clothes  
are kinda getting in the way!  
 Maybe I should've taken  
my outer clothes off before I came up here, ahaha!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kaori：**  
Anyway! Do you have a minute?  
If you don't need to be anywhere, I could use a hand here!  
I'll throw these goya-looking things down, so you catch them!  
  
**Kaori：**  
I was just wondering how to get them down from here,  
so you came by at the perfect time!  
Yup yup, kindness is everywhere if you know where to look!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ready? Then I'll throw the first goya thingy now!  
Try to catch it, OK?  
  
**Kaori：**  
Here it comes! Haitai! ♪
