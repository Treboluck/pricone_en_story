# Kaori Episode 2
Kaori cooks the goya-looking vegetable right then and there, and serves some to {player} as a taste-test, but it doesn't taste quite the same as the goya melons from Kaori's homeland. Suddenly, bandits appear, and the two of them are forced to fight to defend their food.

**Kaori：**  
Time to dig in!  
Mmmm... This is good!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha, tastes like home!  
I dunno if it'll be to your tastes, but you should try some too!  
You can eat as much as you like as thanks for helping me out!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Yup yup, it's just like you said, {player}!  
Doing a taste-test first was the right call! The flavor  
isn't quite the same as the goya melons I know, after all.  
  
**Kaori：**  
If they just looked like goya but tasted totally different,  
it would've been a waste to pick a bunch of them!  
 They'd've  
been left to rot, and all that work would've been wasted!  
  
**Kaori：**  
So it made sense  
 to pick a few first,  
then cook them up right here!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Now we know they're tasty enough to use,  
we can go ahead and pick a whole bunch more of them!  
Yup yup, super logical!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Or maybe you just suggested it because you were  
feeling hungry?  
 My belly was starting to rumble too,  
so I can't complain!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha! It was lucky that you had some cooking gear on you!  
You sometimes hunt for your own food in the forest, huh?  
So that's what you were doing there! That's pretty wild!  
  
**Kaori：**  
*munch munch*  
Hmm... Compared to real goya,  
they could do with a bit more bitter flavor.  
  
**Kaori：**  
I'm pretty sure they must be a related vegetable,  
but they're a bit sweet to use for the same dishes!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Hmm... Or maybe it's the seasoning?  
The dishes from back home use lots of local spices,  
so I guess you wouldn't have them handy.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Maybe they're a bit overripe, too... They feel softer than goya.  
Still, they're plenty good enough to eat!  
If I play around with  
the recipes, I bet I can recreate my local dishes no problem!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ooh, I could gather the seeds and grow some of my own!  
A bit of selective breeding, and they'll be even more goya-like!  
I should ask Maho if I can start a garden at the guildhouse!

**Kaori：**  
Huh? {player}, aren't you hungry?  
Your plate's still looking pretty full right now...  
Don't hold back! You can eat as much as you want!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ahhh...  
Could it be... you don't like it?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  No, it's tasty!  
**Choice: (2)**  It's a bit bitter for me.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kaori：**  
Aha! Well, that's good to hear!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Thing is, I've been away from home so long...  
I'm kinda starting to forget how to cook these old dishes.  
So I wasn't very confident that I'd done a good job.  
  
**Kaori：**  
But now, since you liked it,  
I'm sure I must have at least done something right!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Aha!  
It makes me pretty happy  
to know you enjoy the taste of my homeland!

`Tag 2`  
**Kaori：**  
Ahhh, you think so?  
That bitterness is the best part once you get used to it!  
  
**Kaori：**  
If it's too much, try leaving the goya thingies and  
just eat the meat!  
 It's real fresh. I caught a lively  
hare just around here and cooked it up good!  
  
**Kaori：**  
You can always count on a leg of meat! All that umami flavor!  
It's got a bit of a twang, but the goya mellows that out,  
so they go perfect together! *munch munch*  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kaori：**  
Whewww, now that was a meal!  
I've had my fill!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Now my body feels full of energy! Makes me want to dance!  
Let's hold off on picking the rest of the goya,  
and have some musical exercise first!  
  
**Kaori：**  
{player}, that means you too! When everyone  
steps together in rhythm, the smiles of friendship are born!  
Peace around the world! Don't sweat the small stuff!  
  
**Bandit：**  
Well, lookie what we've got here!  
What do you two think you're doing around these parts?!  
  
**Bandit：**  
You're in the middle of our territory!  
Intruders get stripped naked and whipped till they cry!  
Hyahahah!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Awaugh! What's this? We're suddenly surrounded by folks  
who don't look so friendly.  
  
**Kaori：**  
Actually, back at the Caon base,  
I heard something about a group of bandits in this area...  
They've been attacking carriages around here.  
  
**Bandit：**  
Hyahahah! You got it! We're a scary gang of violent punks!  
Everything in this whole forest is ours to steal and plunder!  
If you value your lives, you'll hand over your valuables!  
  
**Kaori：**  
Ohhh... They're shameless villains all right!  
Hmm... What now?  
  
**Kaori：**  
This isn't great... If it was just me, I could get away,  
but I don't want to leave {player} and our  
veggie harvest in the hands of these thugs...  
  
**Kaori：**  
All right, I've decided!  
Instead of dancing, let's do a little fighting!  
I need the exercise after that hearty meal! Aha!
