# Lou Episode 4
Lou is out in town to purchase a souvenir for her friends back home. A monster appears as she's making her way back to the orphanage, however, causing her to square off against it alone. Determined to protect her newly purchased souvenir, Lou finds the strength not just to defeat it, but also to cook and serve it up for Anne and Grea.
  
## Subtitle: Lou's Special Dish
  
**Narration：**  
Pecorine, Lou and {player}  
have made their way into town at the behest of a bored Lou.  
  
**Lou：**  
Wow. The stores here really are amazing.  
There's so much stuff you could never find in Rivenbrandt!  
  
**Lou：**  
And I was bored out of my mind today,  
so window shopping alone is super fun!  
  
**Lou：**  
Pecorine, {player}.  
Thanks so much for taking me out!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Not at all!  
What's the plan for after this, though?  
Wanna go get some more monster ingredients?  
  
**Lou：**  
Hm.  
I didn't really think that far ahead.  
  
**Lou：**  
Oh, right!  
I wanted to get a souvenir for everyone back at the academy!  
  
**Lou：**  
They'll be super happy if I get them something unique to Astraea!  
I know it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhh!  
Good idea!  
Let's go have a look for some exotic finds, then!  
  
**Lou：**  
Let's see... What would make a good souvenir...  
Oh! This book seems good!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hm?  
...\"Reqiuem of the Crimson Wings: Retribution's Blade\"?  
Um. That's quite the title.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
This might not be the best souvenir,  
if I'm being honest.  
Are you really sure about this?  
  
**Lou：**  
It's okay! I have a friend that uses words like this!  
Her name's Buller. She'd absolutely love this.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well then.  
Buller's a unique name, isn't it?  
  
**Lou：**  
Yup.  
Oh, but her full name is, uh...  
Buller,  
B-Blood... Uh...  
Something along those lines!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A unique name for a unique friend, I guess!  
...Um, Lou? Are you buying that doll as well?  
It doesn't look like the sort of thing you'd give to a friend.  
  
**Lou：**  
This? It's for my roommate.  
She studies curses every day so she can win a certain teacher's heart.  
This looks perfect for curses,  
so she'll love it!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I see.  
Well, so long as they're happy, I guess!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That said.  
You've got all sorts of unique friends, don't you?  
  
**Lou：**  
You think?  
Hm… There's someone who always sleeps covered in  
parchment,  
someone whose personality changes when shocked,  
a  
teacher that used to be a magical girl… So I guess you're right.  
  
**Lou：**  
That said, pretty much everyone at Mysteria Academy is like that.  
I'm not attracting weirdos or anything.  
We're just all weird and different in our own way!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hehe. It sure sounds like a fun place. ☆  
Right, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Sounds like a handful...  
**Choice: (2)**  I wouldn't mind being a student there.  
`Tag 1`  
**Lou：**  
Not at all.  
Every day's super fun!  
You should come along someday.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Lou：**  
Really?! It'd be great if you came along someday!  
No doubt it'd be even more fun if you were there as well!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Lou：**  
You as well, Pecorine!  
I'd happily introduce you all to everyone back home!  
  
**Lou：**  
There's so much to see, too!  
Buildings, magical lifeforms, all sorts!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heehee!  
That's one way to get a girl curious! ♪  
  
**Lou：**  
Oh, but you'll need to be careful.  
We've also got places you can never leave after wandering in,  
corridors that eat people, and other crazy stuff.  
  
**Lou：**  
And well. We're all weird and different,  
so there's always something wild going on at the academy.  
  
**Lou：**  
If you want to graduate, then you need to be able to  
fend for yourself. That's what they always say!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha.  
Now that really is crazy. ☆  
  
**Lou：**  
It is, but you never get bored there. ☆  
Feels like I'm making the most of my youth. I love it.  
  
**Lou：**  
Okay, let's get back to souvenir hunting!  
I've got plenty more friends I want to get some for!  
  
**Lou：**  
Oh! This big book should be great for Anne!  
And Grea would suit this cute brooch!  
I bet they'll love it!  
  
**Lou：**  
Ehehe.  
I'm gonna be a souvenir pro by the end of the day!  
  
**Lou：**  
O-oof...  
Th-this is getting heavy!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You sure bought a lot, didn't you?  
Lemme help you out. I'll take—  
  
**Man：**  
H-help! There's a monster on the highway!  
The carriages are all stuck! Someone do something!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh?! Well that's not good.  
Lou, {player}! Let's go!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let's take it down quick and prevent any further damage!  
—  
Wait, huh? Where's Lou?  
  
**Lou：**  
*huff, huff*  
*pant, *pant*  
W-wait up!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You brought all the souvenirs with you, too?  
That must've been tough. You okay?  
  
**Lou：**  
*huff, puff*  
I'm... fine...  
W-waugh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whoa!  
That sure was a big tumble!  
  
**Lou：**  
Urgh, that hurt...  
I'm fine, I'm fine.  
But what about the souvenirs?!  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh! It's headed right for her!  
Leave the souvenirs for now!  
Get out of the way!  
  
**Lou：**  
I can't do that!  
I bought these for my friends!  
I don't want them to get destroyed!  
  
**Lou：**  
I'll protect them, no matter what!  
Mr. Gawker! Lend me your strength!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wow, amazing!  
Mr. Gawker got huge!  
  
**Lou：**  
Go get it, Mr. Gawker!  
Protect those souvenirs with everything you've got!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wooow!  
You did it, Lou!  
You took it down all on your own!  
  
**Lou：**  
Huh?  
Whoa, you're right!  
Did I really do this?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yup!  
All by yourself!  
  
**Lou：**  
Wooooo!  
I really can do it if I try!  
Ehehe. Praise me some more. ♪  
  
**Lou：**  
Urgh... But now I'm starving.  
I could go for a delicious meal.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hm...  
Oh! I've got an idea!  
Lou, how about trying your hand at monster cuisine again?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You defeated this on your own,  
so think of it as a celebration!  
Anne and Grea'll be super happy, too!  
  
**Lou：**  
Monster cuisine?  
Yeah, I wanna try it again!  
Cooking the very same monster I defeated...  
That'll make it a truly special,  
unique dish!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yup!  
Me and {player}'ll back you up, too!  
Let's make the best meal ever!  
  
**Narration：**  
The three of them get to work right away,  
leading to the creation of Lou's special dish.

**Lou：**  
Anne, Grea.  
I've got another monster-based dish I want you to try!  
  
**Lou：**  
I worked super hard this time!  
I even defeated the monster itself on my own!  
  
**Anne：**  
Wait, really?  
That's incredible!  
  
**Grea：**  
There's no smoke or anything coming from it this time, either.  
It actually looks delicious.  
  
**Anne：**  
It smells really nice, too.  
You really went all out, didn't you?  
Good stuff!  
  
**Lou：**  
Ehehe.  
This is my very own  
special dish!  
Please, dig in!  
  
**Anne：**  
Hehe. Thanks.  
No point in wasting time, then!  
  
**Grea：**  
Likewise.  
  
**Anne：**  
*munch, munch*  
Wow! It's delicious! I mean it!  
  
**Grea：**  
The flavor's rich, but subtle.  
It really is delicious.  
I wouldn't mind having this every day.  
  
**Lou：**  
Really?!  
I wasn't sure if you'd like it, but I'm really glad you do!  
  
**Lou：**  
Okay, everyone!  
Don't hold back! There's enough for you all!  
  
**Lou：**  
Oh, right.  
There's one more thing.  
I got a souvenir for the two of you as well!  
  
**Anne：**  
You did?!  
Wow! Thanks so much!  
  
**Grea：**  
Hehe.  
You really did give it your all today, didn't you?  
  
**Narration：**  
Lou couldn't help but smile over how pleased Anne and Grea seemed  
over their meal and souvenirs, which made a great day even better.
