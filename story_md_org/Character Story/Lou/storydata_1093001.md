## Subtitle: A Monstrously Delicious Strategy
  
**Narration：**  
Left with no choice but to wait for the Guild Association to prepare a  
magic tracer for them, Lou and co. spend the time checking out  
Landosol. Today's events take place on a certain day during that period.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Now then. What should we do today?  
If you're fine with leaving it to me,  
I can take you around a few places—  
  
**Lou：**  
Oh, oh, ohhh!  
I've got an idea! I wanna give monster food a shot!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Monster-based cuisine, is it?  
That's an excellent idea,  
Lou. ♪  
  
**Grea：**  
H-Hm... Hey, Lou.  
You realize how difficult that is to prepare, right?  
Getting the ingredients themselves isn't easy,  
either...  
  
**Anne：**  
You need to actually defeat said monsters, first and foremost.  
We'd love to help, but we've already made other plans...  
  
**Lou：**  
Heh heh heh.  
Worry not! I've got a super secret plan!  
  
**Grea：**  
A super secret plan?  
  
**Lou：**  
Yup!  
Pecorine and co. gave me the idea the other day.  
I hope you're all looking forward to my big moment!  
  
**Anne：**  
I'm super confident, but also...  
A teeny, weeny bit anxious...  
  
**Grea：**  
Just remember that we can't join you, though.  
  
**Lou：**  
Oh, right!  
I want you to come with me,  
{player}!  
  
**Lou：**  
You're the most crucial part of my super secret plan!  
So please help me out!  
  
**Anne：**  
Well, if {player}'s also with you...  
  
**Grea：**  
It... should be okay?  
  
**Anne：**  
Can we leave her in your care, {player}?  
  
**Grea：**  
She's, uh. How do I put this...  
A bit of a handful?  
It'd be great if you kept a close eye on her.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm the man for the job.  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
We've got this!  
She'll be extra safe in our care!  
No need to worry!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Even better, we'll treat you to a delicious monster-based meal too!  
You're gonna be crazy surprised! ☆  
  
**Anne：**  
Great! Thanks!  
Well then. We'll leave Lou in your care.  
  
**Grea：**  
Take care, Lou.  
Don't get separated from the others, okay?  
  
**Lou：**  
Leave it to me!  
You're not gonna believe how delicious this dish'll be!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Lou, {player}.  
First up is procuring our ingredients!  
Let's do this!  
  
**Lou：**  
Okay-dokie!  
Is this forest our hunting ground?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yup!  
It's the perfect little spot for easy and delicious prey!  
  
**Lou：**  
Nice!  
Heh heh heh.  
Watch out, monsters!  
I'm gonna cook you all up!  
  
**Lou：**  
I got past the dreaded V group's retakes!  
There's nothing that'll faze me now!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wow!  
You're sounding crazy reliable! ☆  
We could learn a thing or two from you.  
Hm?  
  
**Lou：**  
Pecorine? What's up?  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Lou：**  
Oh no!  
I-it's a monster!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yup! That's our first target.  
Let's take it down nice and quick...  
Wait. Lou?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Um.  
Is there a reason you're stomping your feet so vigorously?  
  
**Lou：**  
What?  
That's obvious. I'm getting ready to flee!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh?  
We can't cook it if we don't defeat it, though.  
  
**Lou：**  
That's why I brought the two of you!  
I've got a good feeling here.  
So long as you're here, I can leave the fighting to you!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I... see?  
Is this your super secret plan?  
  
**Lou：**  
It's an easy strategy.  
Let the right people do the right work!  
I'lll run around! You two'll fight!  
The perfect monster fighting plan!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You're not gonna fight along with us?  
**Choice: (3)**  Now that's an incredible plan.  
`Tag 2`  
**Lou：**  
Oh, please! Don't be crazy!  
I can't fight such a scary monster!  
Look at all its claws and teeth and stuff!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Lou：**  
Heh heh heh! I bet you're surprised!  
Feel free to call me a master strategist!  
I insist, even!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Pecorine：**  
You're a student at the Mysteria Academy,  
right?  
Shouldn't a monster like this be easy for you to handle?  
Just fire off a bit of magic. Ta-da.  
  
**Lou：**  
Ahahaha!  
Don't be silly!  
  
**Lou：**  
Lemme tell you how much I know about magic—nothing!  
Can I use it? Nope.  
Can I defeat monsters with it? Definitely not! Count me out.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? For real?!  
Is that, uh,  
okay though?  
Education-wise.  
  
**Lou：**  
Definitely not!  
That's why I'm the Empress of Retakes. The Queen of Failure!  
It's probably a miracle that I've made it this far.  
  
**Lou：**  
So yeah. No fighting for me.  
In fact, it's time for me to run.  
Later!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hey! Lou!  
Wow, she sure is fast at least!  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Lou：**  
Ha ha ha ha ha!  
Is that all you've got, little monster?  
You'll never catch me like that!  
  
**Lou：**  
They call me the student that fled (from retakes) 1 million times!  
If you come at the queen, then you best not miss!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh? She's doing a great job at distracting it!  
This is as good a chance as any!  
Yoo-hoo!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Lou：**  
*huff, puff*  
D-did you get it?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Sure did! All thanks to your distraction!  
Let's keep it up!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh-ho. Here comes another one.  
Do your thing, Lou!  
  
**Lou：**  
Got it!  
I'll run as far as need be!  
Woooooosh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahaha.  
They just leave themselves wide open thanks to her!  
That's some crazy baiting,  
if you ask me! ☆  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Right then, {player}.  
Let's take it down while we can.  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Lou：**  
Amazing!  
Who knew you could gather so many ingredients  
just by running around a lot!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Your distractions made it super smooth and easy!  
Thanks so much,  
Lou!  
  
**Lou：**  
Ehehe. That's... entirely true!  
I should be able to cook up something delish with this much!  
  
**Lou：**  
You guys did all the fighting,  
so I'll do all the cooking. Fair deal!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Someone's all fired up, aren't they?  
Makes me more excited to teach you!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Right then! Let's get cooking!  
Can you prepare the meat first, Lou?  
  
**Lou：**  
Leave it to me!  
Let's see... You sprinkle the salt...  
  
**Lou：**  
Let's have a taste...  
Ugh! Way too salty!  
Guess I'll add some sugar to balance it out.  
  
**Lou：**  
Hm. Feels like something's missing...  
Oh. This slimey stuff should give it a good punch!  
  
**Lou：**  
Heh heh heh.  
The chef within me is stirring! My talent's awakening!  
This slimey stuff is officially my secret ingredient!  
  
**Lou：**  
Phew! Perfect!  
What should I do next, Pecorine?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Once prep's done, you start cooking it!  
Keep it on a low flame.  
Nice and slow, just to really bring out the flavor!  
  
**Lou：**  
Got it!  
Low flame... Nice and slow...  
  
**Lou：**  
Well this kind of sucks.  
Feels like it'd be better to just roast this bad boy.  
  
**Lou：**  
Whatever! I'm doing it!  
More fire, more wood!  
Burn baby, burn! All the way!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
How's it going, Lou?  
Whoa! Th-things are looking kind of crazy over here!  
  
**Lou：**  
Hey, Pecorine! I'm almost done!  
All it's missing is my secret, special sauce!  
  
**Lou：**  
Whoa! It blew up!  
The meat must be really kicking!  
  
**Lou：**  
Voila!  
I call this a Lou Special!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wow! Look, {player}!  
I've never anyone make a monster-based dish like this before!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I can't even think of a way to describe it!  
So I'll rely on my usual catchphrase.  
How crazy is that? ☆  
  
**Lou：**  
Anne! Grea! Welcome bacl!  
I cooked up a great dish,  
so let's dig in right away!  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh?!  
Th-this is... definitely a special dish, Lou!  
It's very, uh, avant garde?  
  
**Grea：**  
It's definitely a new take on the concept of food.  
Almost like it wasn't made with the idea of eating it in mind...  
  
**Grea：**  
Or, uh.  
Maybe it just isn't meant to be eaten at all?  
  
**Lou：**  
I thought of you two the whole time I was making it!  
  
**Anne：**  
Well then.  
Yeah, that's nice to hear! Thanks, Lou!  
Well, Grea. Get ready. This is a meal we can't say no to!  
  
**Grea：**  
Yeah. You're right.  
I-I guess it's time to dig in...  
  
**Grea：**  
*munch*  
H-hm...?  
  
**Lou：**  
How is it? Tasty?  
  
**Anne：**  
How do I put this? It's salty,  
but also kind of sweet.  
Also, there's this sort of gooey texture to it?  
It's just kind of lingering in my throat!  
  
**Anne：**  
But... there's something about it!  
Something that kind of just...  
makes me want a bit more!  
  
**Grea：**  
To be honest, just eating it is a struggle.  
And yet, there's something that makes you want to keep going.  
It's really strange!  
  
**Lou：**  
Wow, really?!  
I didn't think you'd like it that much!  
I'm super happy!  
  
**Lou：**  
I can feel it, friends!  
The day I become a top monster cuisine chef is near!  
You can bet on it!  
  
**Narration：**  
Lou watched over Anne and Grea with glee as they continued to savor her dish, puzzled expressions on their faces.
