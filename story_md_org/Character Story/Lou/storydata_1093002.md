# Lou Episode 2
Lou is over the moon when asked to teach magic to the children. Though full of confidence, her own academic capabilities come into doubt when she's unable to even answer their questions. The children then teach her instead, which leads Lou into a fit.
  
## Subtitle: Ms. Lou's Magical Lessons
  
**Narration：**  
Lou watches from afar as Anne gives  
magic lessons to the children of the Sarendia Orphanage.  
  
**Lou：**  
Wow...  
She's amazing.  
  
**Lou：**  
Oh, {player}!  
I was just watching Anne teach the kids magic!  
  
**Lou：**  
She really is amazing!  
Using magic's one thing, but she can teach it as well!  
  
**Lou：**  
All the kids really look up to her, too...  
I'm kind of jealous.  
  
**Girl：**  
Hey hey, Lou!  
You go to the same academy as Anne, right?  
  
**Lou：**  
Huh?  
Oh. I do!  
We're both students at the Mysteria Academy of Magic!  
  
**Boy：**  
Oh, ohhh! Then please teach us more magic!  
The same way Anne did!  
  
**Lou：**  
Uh. You want... *me* to teach you?  
Hm... I'm not really the best at academic stuff.  
I'm kind of allergic to it, I guess?  
  
**Boy：**  
Aww, come on! Please!  
  
**Girl：**  
I bet you're just as good as Anne! Super good!  
We want lessons from Ms. Lou!  
Right now!  
  
**Lou：**  
Super good...  
Ms. Lou...!  
  
**Lou：**  
Heh... Heh heh... Heh heh heh!  
You leave me with no choice!  
I'll just have to show my cool side!  
  
**Boy & Girl：**  
Woooooo!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You sure about this?  
`Tag 1`  
**Lou：**  
Well. You never know until you try!  
It'll all work out!  
  
**Lou：**  
They don't know much about magic, plus they're kids!  
Even I should be able to teach them a thing or two!  
  
**Lou：**  
Right then! Time for class!  
Gather around, everyone!  
  
**Boy：**  
Yaaay!  
This'll be so good!  
  
**Lou：**  
Heh!  
Just leave it to Ms. Lou!  
  
**Lou：**  
Hee hee.  
This feels great.  
I never realized being a teacher would be such an ego boost.  
I could get used to this!  
  
**Lou：**  
Right then. Where should I start?  
Hm? Are these...  
notes from Anne's lessons?  
Perfect! I'll gladly use them!  
  
**Lou：**  
Uhh... Let's see here...  
...? ...?  
  
**Girl：**  
Ms. Lou? What's wrong?  
  
**Lou：**  
E-err,  
uh...  
I was just... a bit surprised.  
You're learning pretty tricky stuff, huh?  
  
**Boy：**  
Really?  
Anne made it all super fun  
and interesting!  
  
**Lou：**  
Urgh... She really is amazing.  
But, well...  
I just need to go all out!  
It'll be fine if I do that!  
  
**Lou：**  
Uhh... Basic foundations... of magic...  
Th-the three... prin... principles?  
Is that how you read it? Urgh...  
  
**Boy：**  
Hey.  
How come you're struggling to read it?  
  
**Girl：**  
Are you one of those students that isn't good at studying,  
Lou?  
  
**Lou：**  
N-No way, no way!  
I'm one of Mysteria Academy's best students!  
  
**Girl：**  
I knew it!  
You have to be good if you're at the same academy as Anne!  
  
**Girl：**  
Hey hey.  
Anne taught us something earlier that I wanna ask about.  
Is that okay?  
  
**Lou：**  
Something that Anne taught you?  
Erm. O-  
Of course! Bring it!  
  
**Girl：**  
So there's these herbs that help replenish your magic.  
Anne said there's lots of them.  
But just how many are there?  
  
**Lou：**  
Huh?!  
Err, um!  
  
**Lou：**  
Th-there's tons of them!  
You can even replenish magic with snacks, if you wanted to!  
Just look at me! I do it all the time!  
  
**Girl：**  
Huh? Really?  
  
**Boy：**  
Okay then!  
Teach us how to draw a summoning circle for water spirits!  
  
**Lou：**  
W-well, that's...  
uh...  
I-I don't really do summoning magic,  
so I kind of... forgot!  
  
**Boy：**  
Oh...  
Then how about those greater spirits Anne told us about?  
Tell us what those are!  
  
**Lou：**  
Greater... spirits?  
Err...  
Well... O-  
of course I know what they are!  
Just wait a minute!  
I'll give you a proper explanation!  
  
**Lou：**  
{player}!  
Tell me the answer to that question! Sneakily!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You're asking the wrong guy.  
**Choice: (3)**  You should just tell them you don't know.  
`Tag 2`  
**Lou：**  
Then make yourself the right guy!  
Give me something! Anything! I just need a hint!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Lou：**  
No way! Are my five minutes of teacher fame over already?!  
I want five more!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Lou：**  
Urgh... I get it. This isn't right.  
I should just let it go.  
  
**Lou：**  
Hey. I need to tell you all something.  
Something really important.  
  
**Narration：**  
Lou reveals the truth to the children.  
  
**Girl：**  
So... you're actually a terrible student,  
and you don't know anything about magic?  
  
**Lou：**  
Th-that's one way to put it, yeah.  
  
**Girl：**  
Aww! Come on, Lou!  
You shouldn't have pretended, then!  
  
**Lou：**  
I got a bit... carried away.  
Also,  
being called Ms. Lou just felt really good,  
you know?  
I'm sorry for lying!  
  
**Girl：**  
I'm more worried about if you're going  
to graduate or not at this point.  
  
**Lou：**  
Urgh...  
Your words slay me.  
  
**Girl：**  
Oh! Everyone, I've got a great idea!  
Let's teach Lou magic ourselves!  
  
**Boy：**  
Yeah!  
Let's teach her everything we know!  
  
**Lou：**  
Teach me?! Everything you know?!  
I, uh, well.  
I'd kind of rather not!  
  
**Boy：**  
You as well, {player}!  
You should both learn about magic!

**Lou：**  
Waaahhh!  
Why'd it come to this?!  
  
**Girl：**  
Come on, Lou.  
You gotta focus!  
  
**Lou：**  
I-I am focusing!  
Look at my focused scribbles!  
  
**Girl：**  
You were just doodling last time you said that!  
Show me your notes!  
  
**Lou：**  
Ahhh!  
You can't look yet!  
  
**Girl：**  
I knew it! You're doodling!  
Come on, Lou! Take this seriously!  
  
**Girl：**  
{player} hasn't even written anything in his notes!  
You're both as bad as each other!  
  
**Lou：**  
Urgh!  
I can't! I can't take this torture anymore!  
  
**Boy：**  
We're giving you a test later, too!  
So pay attention!  
  
**Lou：**  
A test?!  
Impossible... This can't be...  
  
**Lou：**  
A test means resits...  
Resits means more resits... They never end...  
I'll be trapped in an endless recursion of resits...  
  
**Lou：**  
I'll grow old, and they'll still haunt me.  
The shadow of resits, constantly following me...  
Never letting up, until I turn into a skeleton...  
  
**Lou：**  
How terrible... I'm shaking in fear...  
This is too much for someone allergic to tests.  
It's over. I'm finished!  
  
**Girl：**  
L-Lou?  
She's kind of just mumbling away now... Is she okay?  
  
**Lou：**  
Actually. This isn't Mysteria Academy.  
It's not even Rivenbrandt.  
Why do I need to suffer this inhumane torture?!  
  
**Lou：**  
Yeah!  
This is all messed up!  
  
**Girl：**  
L-Lou?  
  
**Lou：**  
AHHHHHH!  
Tests are unhealthy! I'm against them!  
In fact, I'm gonna rid the world of them entirely!  
  
**Lou：**  
Being stuck doing resists all by yourself is a lonely, lonely experience!  
  
**Lou：**  
I never, ever wanna go through it again!  
If you all wanna call me the Empress of Retakes,  
then witness my true power!

**Lou：**  
Do your thing, Mr. Gawker!  
And come forth, Mr. Jumbo Gawker!  
  
**Girl：**  
Eeek?!  
That thing's huge!  
  
**Boy：**  
Whoa?!  
You can do that, Lou?!  
  
**Lou：**  
So long as tests exist in this world,  
my rage will never subside! I'll eradicate them all!  
  
**Narration：**  
Lou's rampage continued on,  
until Anne and Grea arrived to help calm her down.
