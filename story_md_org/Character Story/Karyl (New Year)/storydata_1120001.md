**Narration：**  
The bustling streets of Landosol are enveloped in the New Year mood.  
{player} is out delivering mail when he bumps into Karyl,  
who is carrying a mountain of packages.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I really didn't need to buy so many spellbooks  
just because they were on sale for New Year's...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm sick of all these crowds.  
I just wanna get home and relax.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You bought a ton of books, huh?  
`Tag 1`  
**Karyl：**  
Whoa?!  
Don't sneak up on me like that!  
You scare a life outta me every time you do!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hm? Why did I buy so many books? I found them on sale at bargain-bin  
prices on my way home from the shrine, so I bought them. That's why.  
  
It's not like I plan on studying right from the start of the year or anything.  
  
**Karyl：**  
What about you? You're carrying a heck of a lot of stuff too.  
You're delivering New Year's cards?  
  
Wow, do you usually deliver that much mail?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? You're not just delivering your own share, but you're also helping  
out a colleague who's off sick?  
You really are a soft touch, aren't you?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Need help carrying those books?  
`Tag 2`  
**Karyl：**  
I literally just called you a soft touch...  
I've got it, so just worry about your own work.  
Go on, get a move on.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hold on, you're gonna collapse under all that weight.  
It's way too much for one person to deliver alone.  
Wait right there!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Here, I'm gonna lend you a hand, so gimme half of that mail.  
What about my books?  
I dropped them off at the guildhouse.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Make sure you properly compensate me for the help I'm gonna give you,  
yeah?  
I've gotta make up for all the money I sank into those spellbooks  
somehow.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You're pretty kind, huh?  
**Choice: (4)**  Show me your resume first.  
`Tag 3`  
**Karyl：**  
Don't be getting the wrong idea!  
I'm doing it for the money. *For the money*.  
Keep it up and you can forget my help.

`Tag 4`  
**Karyl：**  
What do you need that for? All I'm gonna do is carry mail.  
Do I need a degree for that?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? I'm a lifesaver?  
H-hmph. You could've just said that in the beginning.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Karyl：**  
Look, just hand over half your load.  
  
Hngh, it actually is heavy...  
But it's no problem.  
I can handle a heck of a lot more than this.  
  
**Karyl：**  
All right, let's be off.  
Lead the way.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Delivery!  
`Tag 6`  
**Karyl：**  
................  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Karyl, you give it a go.  
`Tag 7`  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? Why do I have to say it?  
...Whatever. If there's no way around it, then fine.  
  
**Karyl：**  
................  
  
**Karyl：**  
D-delivery.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? My voice is shaky?  
I-it's my first time! What'd you expect!  
  
**Young Man：**  
Happy New Year, miss.  
I've been looking forward to getting my New Year's cards!  
Ohhh! I can't believe how big my sister's kids are getting!  
  
**Young Man：**  
Well, I guess I'm getting older too.  
Sorry, you're probably not interested, are you?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't worry about it.  
Well then, we've still got more to deliver...!  
  
**Young Man：**  
Thanks.  
Take care on your rounds!  
  
**Karyl：**  
The next address is over there.  
Huh? He's already waiting in front of his house...?  
  
**Thug：**  
................  
  
**Karyl：**  
Is he that excited to get a greeting card? Looks can be deceiving, huh?  
Well, If he's looking forward to it, best deliver it to him.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Delivery!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Perfect this time, wouldn't you agree?  
Heheh. ♪ It's easy once you get the hang of it!  
  
**Thug：**  
Thanks.  
  
**Thug：**  
Good. My subordinates remembered to send me New Year's cards.  
I look forward to the New Year's card lottery more than anything.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, *that's* what he's so enthusiastic about.  
Makes sense.  
  
**Thug：**  
Hm? What was that, little miss?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I didn't say anything.  
Well, best be off. We've got more deliveries to make.  
  
**Thug：**  
Right. Thanks.  
It must be tough, but hang in there.  
  
**Karyl：**  
*sigh* It looks like we're finally almost finished.  
How can you do such hard work so early in the year?  
  
**Karyl：**  
It makes people happy? What's that all about...?  
...Or so I wanna say,  
but seeing people smile isn't such a bad thing.  
  
**Karyl：**  
If I gave New Year's cards to Pecorine and Koro,  
I wonder if it would make them happy.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  You could write them now.  
**Choice: (9)**  What about my card?  
`Tag 8`  
**Karyl：**  
I didn't say I was gonna do it, did I?  
  
But, you know... I'll think about it.

`Tag 9`  
**Karyl：**  
What? You're standing right in front of me, dummy.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ahhh, okay, okay. You're trying to say that's not what New Year's cards  
are about, right? Whatever. I'll think about it.  
  
`Tag 10`  
**Karyl：**  
Anyway, enough of the silly talk. Let's hurry up and finish this delivery  
job. The next card is going to...  
Huh? What the heck?  
There's no address on this one.  
What are we supposed to do with it?  
  
**Choice: (11)**  Someone's looking forward to receiving it.  
`Tag 11`  
**Karyl：**  
I mean, you're right, but if there's no address, we can't deliver it.  
...Huh? Where are you going? Do you know the address?  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're gonna ask people in the street?  
There's no way that'll work.  
You're just gonna keep asking until you find someone who knows?  
That'll just be a nuisance to the people you ask.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...But you're just that type of guy, aren't you?  
All right. I'll help you look for someone who knows.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Here, let me see that card.  
\"Grandma, Happy New Year.\"  
Hmmm... Well, it was obviously written by a kid.  
  
**Karyl：**  
And the picture's of an old lady selling candy from a stall...  
Nah, I'm not getting any clues...  
Hm?  
Wait, could it be...?  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Want a stick of lucky candy?  
It has the same picture inside no matter where or how many times you  
cut it!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Do you have a minute?  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Welcome!  
How many sticks of candy do you want?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Uh, no,  
I'm not after candy.  
I was wondering if this New Year's card was meant for you.  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Ohhh! This is from my granddaughter!  
She always does things  
in a hurry, so I reckon that's why she forgot to write my address.  
I'm impressed you figured out it was for me.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It was because of the picture.  
I remembered this one time when I was out walking with my foodie  
friend, and she bought some candy from you.  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Thank you ever so much.  
If you hadn't figured it out, my New Year's would have been very lonely.  
  
**Karyl：**  
I'm glad we got it to you safely.  
Well, we've gotta get back to work.  
  
**Old Lady：**  
Ah, just a second.  
Please take this candy for your efforts.  
Here.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Whoa!  
There's no way I can finish all this on my own!  
  
**Old Lady：**  
You can share it with your little foodie friend.  
I promise it tastes great.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeah, I know it's good.  
Well, this time we're really going.  
I'm sure I can make my friend happy with this candy.  
  
**Choice: (12)**  That was really nice.  
`Tag 12`  
**Karyl：**  
Right?  
Pecorine's gonna puke rainbows.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? Not the free candy, but because the old lady was really happy?  
Well, yeah...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I mean, the old lady was being nice, not me! No way!  
So quit smiling like that!  
  
**Narration：**  
Face beet red, Karyl waved her candy around wildly.
