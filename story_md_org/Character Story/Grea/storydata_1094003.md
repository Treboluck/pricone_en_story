# Grea Episode 3
Grea takes the children out on a picnic, which is soon interrupted when some ruffians try to abduct one of them. Infuriated, Grea chases them off through use of her draconic flames, but panics over the idea of having terrified the children in the process. The children, however, express their gratitude, taking a massive burden off of her shoulders.

**Narration：**  
{player} is approached by Grea outside of the orphanage.  
  
**Grea：**  
Um, {player}.  
Is there anything I can help with?  
  
**Grea：**  
Truth is,  
Anne just told me that  
I can't go inside the orphanage for a bit.  
  
**Grea：**  
She had an excited look on her face, so no doubt she's  
got something interesting planned, but now I'm left  
trying to find something to do until I'm allowed back in.  
  
**Boy：**  
Oh! Grea!  
  
**Girl：**  
Hey hey, let's play!  
  
**Grea：**  
Oh! H-hey, everyone.  
Um...  
Are you sure you want to play with me?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  They've all warmed up to you.  
`Tag 1`  
**Grea：**  
Y-you think?  
  
**Girl：**  
Yeah! I really love you, Grea!  
You're so good at the piano, and you're really kind!  
  
**Boy：**  
Same here!  
  
**Grea：**  
Oh...  
Hehe. Thank you.  
It's a bit embarrassing to be told that, but it makes me really happy.  
  
**Grea：**  
Well, uh... Anne told me not to go inside the orphanage,  
so how about we all go for a picnic?  
  
**Boy：**  
A picnic!  
That sounds fun! Let's go!  
  
**Grea：**  
That settles that, then.  
Would you like to join us, {player}?  
It'd be nice if you showed us some ideal picnic spots, too.  
  
**Grea：**  
You would?  
Thanks. That's a big help.  
  
**Grea：**  
Wow, this is amazing.  
It's so pretty.  
Thank you for bringing us here, {player}.  
  
**Boy：**  
Hey hey!  
Let's play tag!  
  
**Girl：**  
Wait up! I wanna play too!  
  
**Grea：**  
Hehe. They're all so lively.  
D-don't stray too far away!  
  
**Grea：**  
Phew... The wind feels great today.  
It's very... relaxing.  
  
**Grea：**  
I never thought I'd feel like this in a whole different world, to be honest.  
It's all thanks to you and everyone else.  
  
**Grea：**  
Um, well...  
Thank you for all your help.  
And for looking out for me.  
  
**Grea：**  
...Hehe. I guess that was a bit too formal, wasn't it?  
But I really do appreciate it.  
  
**Grea：**  
I couldn't have asked for better people to meet after coming here.  
  
**Grea：**  
...Huh?  
They look like they're rushing back, don't they?  
Did something happen?  
  
**Girl：**  
Waaahhh!  
Grea! Help!  
  
**Grea：**  
Huh?!  
  
**Boy：**  
Waaahhh! Let me go!  
My arm hurts!  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Heh heh heh.  
What sorta parent lets their kid wander around here on their own?  
Not that I'm complainin'.  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Gyahaha!  
This'll be an easy job!  
Just gotta hop across the ocean and sell him off,  
right boss? ♪  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
You betcha.  
Now let's boost, and make sure no one notices.  
  
**Grea：**  
Wait!  
Let him go right this instant!  
  
**Boy：**  
Oh... Grea! {player}!  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Who the heck are you two? You want us to give this brat back?  
Hah! Keep dreaming!  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
How about we catch and sell you all off, huh?!  
Gyahahaha!  
  
**Girl：**  
Waaahhh!  
Grea! I'm so scared!  
  
**Grea：**  
Don't worry.  
Just stay behind me!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Give him back!  
**Choice: (3)**  Let's talk this out like adults.  
`Tag 2`  
**Grea：**  
{player}!  
You should stay back! It's dangerous!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Grea：**  
Huh?! U-um, {player}!  
I don't think they're willing to talk!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Ruffian 2：**  
You serious, punk?  
Think you can take us lightly, huh?!  
  
**Grea：**  
Watch out!  
{player}! Are you okay?!  
  
**Grea：**  
You're going to pay for this!

**Ruffian 1：**  
Whoa?!  
What's her deal?!  
  
**Grea：**  
Drop your weapons and give him back.  
Once you do, get out of here and never come back!  
  
**Grea：**  
If you don't, then...  
You'll suffer the consequences!  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Eeeeeek?!  
L-look at her arm! It's on fire!  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Yeouch! That's hot!  
Her magic's off the charts...  
We're goners if we get hit by that!  
  
**Grea：**  
How astute of you.  
A dragon's flames would reduce you to ashes in an instant.  
  
**Grea：**  
So? It's fight or flight for you. How will you play it?  
And my patience is wearing thin,  
so I'd suggest you choose quickly.  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
I ain't ever met anyone this terrifying!  
D-drop the kid, quick! We're outta here!  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
G-got it!  
Someone help us!  
  
**Grea：**  
...  
  
**Grea：**  
Phew.  
That's them gone. What a relief.

**Girl：**  
G-Grea, your hand...  
  
**Grea：**  
Ahhh?!  
Th-this is just, um...!  
  
**Grea：**  
S-sorry...  
I... I just...  
...!  
  
**Girl：**  
Oh! Grea!  
  
**Grea：**  
...  
  
**Grea：**  
I'm... I'm just the worst...  
  
**Grea：**  
All I wanted was to protect them,  
but instead I let myself lose control and scare them.  
  
**Grea：**  
I really am beyond pathetic...  
I bet they all hate me now...  
  
**Grea：**  
...?  
Who's there?  
  
**Grea：**  
Oh... {player}...  
  
**Grea：**  
U-um, did the children all get home safely...?  
...  
Really? That's a relief.  
  
**Grea：**  
I'm sorry for running off on my own.  
And for, well, what happened back there...  
  
**Grea：**  
I was finally getting along with everyone thanks to you and Anne,  
but then I... I just went and ruined it all.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  You really are kind, aren't you?  
**Choice: (6)**  You protected them. That's a fact.  
`Tag 5`  
**Grea：**  
Kind? Me?  
Not at all. What you saw back there was my real self—  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Grea：**  
I wanted to, at least.  
But that wasn't the right way to—  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Girl：**  
Oh, Grea! There you are!  
  
**Boy：**  
You went and ran off,  
so we were looking all over for you!  
  
**Grea：**  
...!  
E-everyone...  
  
**Girl：**  
We were so, so, so worried!  
It looked like you might haved burned yourself!  
  
**Grea：**  
Huh? Burned myself?  
  
**Boy：**  
Yeah!  
Your hand was all covered in fire and stuff...  
  
**Grea：**  
Oh.  
Th-that's what you meant?  
  
**Grea：**  
Um... Don't worry, then.  
That was my dragonic power.  
It's... sort of like magic, so I'm perfectly fine.  
  
**Girl：**  
Really?  
Well if you're not hurt,  
then that's great!  
  
**Grea：**  
Y-yeah.  
...  
Um. Is that all?  
  
**Girl：**  
Huh? What do you mean?  
  
**Grea：**  
I mean... I scared you all, right?  
I looked like, well, a monster...  
  
**Grea：**  
So...  
  
**Boy：**  
What?! No way!  
You were so cool!  
  
**Girl：**  
Yup!  
The flames were all like, wooosh!  
You looked super strong!  
  
**Grea：**  
C-cool? I looked cool?  
  
**Boy：**  
You did! You're the coolest!  
Thanks so much for helping us!  
  
**Girl：**  
Thanks!  
  
**Grea：**  
Everyone...  
  
**Grea：**  
HeH... Hehe.  
Ahahaha!  
  
**Grea：**  
Ahaha... Ha...  
...Hey, {player}.  
  
**Grea：**  
Was I just overthinking things on my own?  
Not just about myself, but about everyone else as well.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Better not to think than overthink.  
`Tag 8`  
**Grea：**  
Ahaha!  
You sure told me.  
  
**Narration：**  
Grea's expression told the entire story.  
A huge burden had been lifted from her shoulders that day.
