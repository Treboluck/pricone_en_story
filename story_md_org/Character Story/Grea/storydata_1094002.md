**Narration：**  
Anne has recently started magic to the children at the orphanage.  
Proving to be a resounding success, today is another day of teaching.  
But from the distance peers the shadow of a dragoness...  
  
**Grea：**  
Hehe.  
She looks like she's having a lot of fun.  
  
**Girl：**  
Anne!  
Show us more magic!  
  
**Anne：**  
Sure thing!  
What else should I show you?  
How about a fireball that doesn't feel hot?  
Or maybe I can make some water float!  
  
**Boy：**  
Oh, fire sounds cool!  
Show me a big fireball!  
  
**Anne：**  
Got it!  
...  
Actually, that gives me an idea.  
  
**Anne：**  
Hey, Grea! You're good at fire magic, right?  
How about you come over and show them?  
  
**Grea：**  
Huh?! M-me?!  
  
**Anne：**  
Yup!  
Let's teach them together!  
  
**Grea：**  
Um...  
Sorry. I think I'll pass.  
  
**Grea：**  
The way we use magic is different.  
I do it based more on intuition than logic.  
The last thing I want is to slip up and surprise them all.  
  
**Grea：**  
Sorry.  
I can't teach them like you can.  
  
**Anne：**  
Hold up, hold up!  
That's not true at all—  
  
**Boy：**  
Hurry up, Anne!  
I wanna see some fire!  
  
**Anne：**  
Huh?  
Whoa,  
wait a minute!  
Don't tug!  
  
**Grea：**  
...Hehe.  
You really are Miss Popular.  
  
**Grea：**  
Look. They're all waiting for you, so hurry along.  
I'll go grab snacks for them all.  
  
**Anne：**  
Hey, Grea!  
And off she goes...  
Ahh, man. She's always so reserved at times like this.  
  
**Boy：**  
Come on, Anne!  
We're waiting!  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh, sorry! I'll be right there!  
...  
U-um, {player}  
Mind if I ask you to tag along with Grea?  
  
**Anne：**  
She kind of lets her thoughts get the  
better of her whenever she's alone.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Got it.  
`Tag 1`  
**Anne：**  
Thanks!  
I appreciate it!  
  
**Grea：**  
...  
  
**Grea：**  
Hm? {player}? What's wrong?  
I thought you were with Anne and the children.  
  
**Grea：**  
Did you tag along for my sake?  
I'm sorry if so.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Aren't you going to help Anne teach?  
**Choice: (3)**  Are you hungry?  
`Tag 2`  
**Grea：**  
It's less a case of not doing so and...  
More a case of not being able to do so, I guess.  
  
**Grea：**  
Like I said,  
I use magic based on intuition rather than logic.  
My dragon's blood might stir if I'm not careful.  
No doubt I'd terrify the children if that happen.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Grea：**  
H-hey, you're teasing me over what happened the other day!  
I'm just here to get snac ks for the children...  
  
**Grea：**  
Wait. That was a joke, wasn't it?  
Your way of trying to cheer me up, I guess?  
Well...  
Sorry, but thanks.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Grea：**  
I'll be honest.  
I do wish there was something I could do.  
  
**Grea：**  
I owe the Sarendia Orphanage a lot,  
and all the children here are so wonderful.  
  
**Grea：**  
So, I do want to give something.  
I really do,  
but I just can't think of anything.  
  
**Grea：**  
I really am pathetic, aren't I?  
  
**Grea：**  
Huh? You want to know what I like?  
Th-that's a bit sudden.  
Um...  
  
**Grea：**  
Well.  
I do like playing the piano...  
  
**Grea：**  
Mysteria Academy has a building called the concert hall.  
There's a piano in there that I'd always play.  
  
**Grea：**  
Recently, I've even played for the other students along with Anne.  
  
**Grea：**  
Being and playing in front of people felt embarrassing at first,  
but it was so fun. I was really happy then.  
  
**Grea：**  
...O-oh, sorry!  
I didn't mean to give you a monologue!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  You should play the piano for the children.  
`Tag 5`  
**Grea：**  
Huh? Me?  
Play the piano for everyone at the orphanage?  
  
**Grea：**  
I-I don't know how that would go...  
I mean, I can play, but it's more of a hobby.  
Would they really enjoy it?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  If you enjoy it, they'll enjoy it.  
`Tag 6`  
**Grea：**  
If I enjoy it...  
  
**Grea：**  
Oh... I get it now.  
If I enjoy it,  
then those feelings should come across to the audience.  
That's what you mean, right?  
  
**Grea：**  
Wait. Is this why you asked me what I like?  
Hehe. That's amazing.  
  
**Grea：**  
...Okay. I can't say I'm confident that they'll enjoy it,  
but I'll give it my best shot.  
  
**Grea：**  
Hehe.  
Now I need to come up with a song to play for them!  
  
**Girl：**  
What's going on, Grea?  
  
**Grea：**  
Well. Um...  
I want you to listen to me play the piano.  
  
**Boy：**  
Wow! You can play the piano?! Really?!  
That's amazing!  
I wanna hear!  
  
**Grea：**  
I-I'm not really at it or anything.  
But, well...  
  
**Grea：**  
Music's just... such an incredibly fun thing.  
  
**Grea：**  
It can sooth you when you're feeling down.  
It can help you share your joy with someone else.  
  
**Grea：**  
It can even lead to new bonds and discoveries.  
  
**Grea：**  
I figured it would be nice to teach you all about that, so... I'm going to play as best as I can.  
  
**Anne：**  
Hehe. Good luck, Grea!  
Our ears are gonna be wide open!  
  
**Grea：**  
I don't doubt it.  
Thanks, Anne.  
  
**Grea：**  
...Phew.  
U-um. How was it?  
  
**Boy & Girl：**  
That. Was. AMAZING!  
  
**Grea：**  
Wahh?! Th-thank you...  
I'm just happy you enjoyed it.  
  
**Girl：**  
It was super-duper amazing!  
You're such a musician, Grea!  
  
**Grea：**  
A musician?! Th-that's a bit of an overstatement.  
But I'm glad you feel that way...  
  
**Girl：**  
I wanna hear more!  
Come on, come on! Play for us some more!  
  
**Grea：**  
Woah?!  
P-please don't touch my tail!  
  
**Girl：**  
Huh? Is your tail all ticklish?  
Ahaha! That's so funny! ♪  
I'll touch it some more!  
  
**Grea：**  
Eeek?!  
No, I mean! My tail's off limits!  
  
**Anne：**  
Heh. Hehe. ♪  
What a sight!  
Grea playing around with the kids!  
Adorable beyond belief! ♪  
  
**Grea：**  
Th-this isn't a laughing matter, Anne—  
Eeek?!  
I-I'm begging you! Please spare me!  
  
**Narration：**  
Having proven that she's both adorable and  
great at playing the piano, Grea found herself as  
the children's new source of infatuation.
