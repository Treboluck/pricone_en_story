**Lou：**  
*burp*  
I sure am stuffed. ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Same here. ♪  
  
**Karyl：**  
So much for \"please dig in.\"  
You two almost ate the whole lot.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Your singing was wonderful, Miss Anne.  
  
**Anne：**  
Really?  
That's a relief!  
Ehehe.  
How about you, Grea? Did you like it?  
  
**Grea：**  
Anne...  
Of course I did.  
It was lovely. Thank you for letting me hear it.  
  
**Anne：**  
Good to hear, good to hear!  
Always happy to know you enjoyed it!  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh, right!  
Hey hey, how about we do a duet?  
  
**Grea：**  
A-a duet?  
But I'm, um, not that confident about singing...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What say you play an instrument, then?  
We just happen to have an accordion.  
  
**Anne：**  
An accordion!  
Now that's a great idea, Kokkoro!  
Come on, Grea! Play the accordion for me!  
  
**Grea：**  
Oh, Anne... Fine, fine.  
This is kind of sudden, though, so I might not be able to harmonize with you.  
  
**Anne：**  
Don't sweat it!  
The two of us can manage anything together!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus the party becomes even livelier.

**Narration：**  
The faint sound of humming rings from outside.  
Guided by the lovely voice,{player}  
traces it to its source...  
  
**Grea：**  
Phew...  
  
**Grea：**  
...Huh? Oh, {player}!  
...  
Y-you didn't happen to hear that, did you?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You sounded wonderful.  
`Tag 1`  
**Grea：**  
Urgh, you did.  
This is so embarrassing...  
  
**Grea：**  
Tonight was really fun. The ellation's been keeping me up.  
I decided to go for a walk, but it's such a quiet,  
peaceful night that I kind of let go...  
  
**Grea：**  
...It really is a lovely song, isn't it?  
I heard that Kokkoro's the one who taught it to Anne,  
so I should thank her for it tomorrow.  
  
**Grea：**  
You as well, {player}.  
You helped Anne practice, right?  
  
**Grea：**  
Thanks. You helped make some precious memories.  
Tonight was special. So fun, so exciting, so dazzling...  
  
**Grea：**  
It's always like that when I'm with Anne.  
  
**Grea：**  
I told you about what I used to be like, right?  
How I was still afraid to interact with everyone at the academy,  
so I'd shut myself away in the concert hall.  
  
**Grea：**  
One day, I was playing the piano by myself.  
And then, out of nowhere,  
Anne turned up.  
  
**Grea：**  
She made the effort to talk to me.  
She even played the piano with me.  
  
**Grea：**  
I remember that day like it was yesterday.  
It's like my whole world burst full of color.  
It was dazzling.  
  
**Grea：**  
...That sounds like an exaggeration, right?  
But I mean it. She really did change everything for me.  
  
**Grea：**  
Everything I have now is thanks to her.  
Piano duets, going out together, sleepovers. All of it.  
  
**Grea：**  
That includes today's gift, too.  
Hehe. There really is just too much to list off.  
  
**Grea：**  
I wish I could repay her somehow.  
Hm...  
  
**Grea：**  
Um, {player}... Do you have any ideas?  
Sorry for relying on you again,  
but I just get the feeling you'd come up with something good.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Give her something she likes.  
**Choice: (3)**  Give her a present as thanks.  
`Tag 2`  
**Grea：**  
Something she likes?  
Yeah,  
that makes sense.  
I should give her something'll make her overjoyed.  
  
**Grea：**  
Hm.  
A few things come to mind—  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Grea：**  
A present, huh?  
She might like something you can only find in Landosol.  
But deciding from there is the hard part...  
  
**Grea：**  
Oh... I've got it!  
A book!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Narration：**  
The next day...  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh, Grea!  
I thought you'd went and diappeared again.  
Did you and {player} go out together?  
  
**Anne：**  
You weren't there when I woke up,  
and then I saw that note you left saying you're going into town.  
You had me worried for a bit!  
  
**Grea：**  
Sorry, Anne,  
Um...  
I actually got a present for you.  
  
**Anne：**  
Hm? Let's see here...  
\"The Fundamentals of Magic\"?  
Wait. I know this book!  
  
**Anne：**  
It was at that store we went to a while back!  
How'd you get your hands on this?!  
  
**Grea：**  
I went to said store early this morning and helped out.  
Once done, I asked for that book over regular pay.  
  
**Grea：**  
Yesterday was really, really fun, so...  
I wanted to repay you somehow,  
and that's what came to mind.  
  
**Anne：**  
Grea...  
  
**Grea：**  
So,  
well... Yeah.  
Would you be willing to accept it?  
  
**Anne：**  
Ahhhhhh! Grea! Thanks so much!  
I'll treasure this book forever!  
  
**Grea：**  
Eeek?!  
A-Anne, you're kind of choking me...  
  
**Anne：**  
Can you blame me?! I'm over the moon here!  
How could I not hug the life out of you?!  
  
**Anne：**  
Oh!  
I gotta go brag about this!  
I'll tell the whole wide world that you bought this book for me!  
  
**Grea：**  
Huh?!  
P-please don't! That's too embarrassing!  
Oh. She's already run off.  
  
**Grea：**  
*sigh*  
I guess that's Anne for you.  
...Heehee.  
  
**Grea：**  
Thanks, {player}.  
This was all due to you.  
  
**Grea：**  
I really can't express how much I appreciate it.
