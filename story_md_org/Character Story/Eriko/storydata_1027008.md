## Subtitle: Eriko's Love Exam
  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee. My love.  
Today is the day I will finally have you drink my potion.  
  
**Eriko：**  
I put my heart and soul into making it.  
Once you drink this, your heart will become mine alone...  
Teeheehee...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Now then, go ahead.  
Please drink every last drop.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Wh-why are you hesitating to drink it?  
I went to all that trouble to make it for you!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Hmm? What's this light?  
I believe this has happened once before...  
  
**Eriko：**  
I-it's blinding me!  
Eeeeek!  
  

---  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee.  
It's almost ready.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ah, my beloved {player}.  
I have taken the liberty to drop by.  
I'm also using your kitchen for a moment.  
  
**Eriko：**  
How did I get into your house, you ask?  
Teehee. Don't worry about that.  
  
**Eriko：**  
There is no obstacle that cannot be overcome by love.  
That's right. Not even a locked front door  
can hope to keep us apart.  
  
**Eriko：**  
I'm terribly sorry,  
but I need a few more moments to prepare.  
Please wait patiently until then.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Now, take a whiff of this.  
You're getting sleepy now, aren't you?

**Eriko：**  
Teehee. Are you awake now?  
  
**Eriko：**  
I couldn't let you run away,  
so I tied you up just a tad.  
Tying people up is actually a talent of mine!  
  
**Eriko：**  
The food's just about ready now.  
I made some Mediterranean-style risotto.  
It's a specialty of mine.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It looks delicious.  
**Choice: (2)**  Did you... spike it with anything?  
`Tag 1`  
**Eriko：**  
I may not look it, but I am rather good at cooking.  
It's not so different from concocting potions...  
Teehee.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Eriko：**  
Oh my! That would have been a fine idea.  
An irresistible banquet  
with just a dash of love potion...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Eriko：**  
But don't worry.  
I didn't add anything strange into this particular dish.  
I made it to taste great, just for you!  
  
**Eriko：**  
If you're having trouble trusting me,  
I'll take a bite to prove it.  
*munch*  
  
**Eriko：**  
Mmm, delicious.  
I hate to boast, but it's frankly divine.  
  
**Eriko：**  
See? I'm perfectly fine, am I not?  
Now do you believe me?  
  
**Eriko：**  
However, I can't feed you this for nothing.  
This will be your reward.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Actually, I was thinking I would help you  
with your studies today, my love.  
  
**Eriko：**  
I hear that you have been struggling  
to study for your exams.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Your pain is my pain, my love.  
As such, I've decided to help you study.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Which is where this food comes into play.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Rewards and punishments are effective when studying.  
If you answer my questions correctly,  
you will be allowed to eat this food.  
  
**Eriko：**  
If you get even one question wrong...  
Teehee. Perhaps it's best I don't say.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Right then, time to start this quiz.  
I'm concerned about what will happen to your body,  
so please try not to answer incorrectly.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Okay, let's start with a basic question.  
What is the surface area of a sphere with  
a ten-centimeter diameter?  
  
**Eriko：**  
What? That's not what you'd call basic?  
Don't be ridiculous. For a smart guy like you, my love,  
this should be an absolute walk in the park.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Well? Your answer, please?  
  
**Eriko：**  
100π. Yes, that's correct.  
On to the next question.

**Eriko：**  
My dearest love, I expected no less.  
You've answered everything correctly up to this point.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Well then, next is the final question.  
It's about Fermat's Last Theorem.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Why are you so startled?  
What? That's not in the high school curriculum?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ah, but my love,  
you are so much more than an ordinary high school student.  
As such, I'm still going to ask you this question.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Here are two statements about Fermat's Last Theorem.  
One of them is sadly incorrect.  
Which is the error? Is it A or B?  
  
**Eriko：**  
Well, my love? What's your answer?  
You'll run out of time unless you hurry up.  
3, 2, 1...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I can't possibly choose...  
`Tag 4`  
**Eriko：**  
My love, you're a genius!  
That's correct!  
  
**Eriko：**  
In fact, both statements are correct.  
To deduce that at first sight is truly impressive!  
Now then, time to reward you with this dish.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Huh? Oh, my love!  
Are you crying tears of joy?  
You must've really wanted to taste my cooking.  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
And that's that. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That Eriko...  
She really is terrifying, isn't she?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Trying to help you study is all well and good,  
but tying you up and threatening you...?!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, I suppose she only did what she did  
because she truly loves you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
In a sense, I suppose I could say I'm jealous.  
Even if her love is a bit overbearing.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm sure she'd be a really lovely girl  
if she just toned things down a little,  
so it's worth putting in the extra effort, don't you think?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, I'll leave it at that for now.  
Buh-bye!  
  

---  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee.  
My love, are you awake?  
  
**Eriko：**  
No, no, I haven't done anything to you.  
I, myself, was asleep until just now as well.  
  
**Eriko：**  
I had such a lovely dream.  
I cooked a wonderful meal for you!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Hm? A reward for studying, you say?  
It seems as though we had the same dream.  
  
**Eriko：**  
That would make the second time this has happened.  
It just goes to show that  
our fates are, indeed, connected.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Huh? You woke up before you got to eat the food?  
If that's the case, shall I cook something for you now?  
Let me borrow your kitchen.  
  
**Eriko：**  
While I'm at it,  
I can add the potion I made today to the food...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee, just kidding.  
Since you personally requested it,  
I'll cook up something delicious for you, my love.  
  
**Narration：**  
And so the two of them proceeded to enjoy  
Eriko's delicious cooking together.
