## Subtitle: True Feelings
  
**Narration：**  
{player} finds himself lost in a forest.  
  
**Eriko?：**  
{player}, are you OK?!  
  
**Eriko?：**  
I guess you got lost in this thick fog.  
Don't worry! I'll save you!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You seem different somehow...  
`Tag 1`  
**Eriko?：**  
Huh? You think?  
Well, if I seem different to you,  
that's probably your fault, {player}.  
  
**Eriko?：**  
It's kind of like, I can't speak to you normally,  
the way I used to, anymore...  
  
**Eriko?：**  
B-because... Because I... I l... love...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Silence, wretch.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You split into two?!  
**Choice: (3)**  You have a twin sister?!  
`Tag 2`  
**Eriko：**  
Humans cannot physically split apart.  
It appears as though I must provide you with  
more appropriate education as my soulmate, my love.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Eriko：**  
I am not a twin.  
  
You would do well to remember the family structure  
of your own soulmate.  
 Otherwise, I shall punish you.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Eriko：**  
My love. That Eriko there is a fake. She is most likely  
an illusion born from this fog.  
It appears to be the work  
of a monster who lures weary travelers to suck out their life.

**Eriko?：**  
Wh-what are you talking about?!  
You're totally the fake one!  
C'mon {player}, trust me here!  
  
**Eriko?：**  
Are you kidding me right now? I'm the real Eriko!  
If you keep spitting out such nonsense I'mma bust you up!  
  
**Eriko?：**  
No, I'm the real Eriko!  
Isn't that right, Mister?  
  
**Eriko?：**  
{player}, I'm the real Eriko!  
I'll make you feel ever so good if you trust me! ♪  
  
**Eriko：**  
They just keep multiplying.  
And worse, they're all crude lumps of worthless trash.  
Trash. Scum. Junk. How wretched this is.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Besides which, they all speak in different manners.  
It seems this monster may be creating illusions  
with different personalities to capture my love's tastes.  
  
**Eriko?：**  
Argh, how irritating! All of this arguing between us  
will get us nowhere!  
  
**Eriko?：**  
Why don't we let {player}  
choose for himself who the real Eriko is?!  
  
**Eriko?：**  
I totally agree! C'mon, Mister, which Eriko is your fave?  
  
**Eriko?：**  
Obviously me, right?  
I lovey, love, looove you, {player}!  
  
**Eriko?：**  
Me too! I love you too, for real!  
You're just so cool,  
and suave, and handsome, and good-looking!  
  
**Eriko?：**  
Idiot! Can't you see his greatest assets  
are his Princess Knight abilities?!  
He's the one who brings out my true powers!  
  
**Eriko?：**  
I love Mister {player} because, umm...  
he's *my* Mister {player}!

**Eriko：**  
Absurd.  
  
**Eriko?：**  
What did you say?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Absurd, absurd, absuRd, abSurd,  
aBSurd, abSuRD, ABsURd, ABSurD,  
aBSuRD, ABSuRD, ABsURD, ABSURD!!  
  
**Eriko：**  
No matter how ghastly your appearance,  
or what manner of mysterious powers you may possess,  
nothing would change my feelings for you.  
  
**Eriko：**  
You are the love foretold for me. My soulmate.  
That is all I need.  
  
**Eriko：**  
That... is what I truly believed.  
  
**Eriko：**  
However, somehow, I understand now.  
These feelings I have for you, this love, runs deeper than that.  
  
**Eriko：**  
People call me \"the Destroyer\" and fear my very name.  
I am hated by one and all.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Yet you, my love, you treated me  
almost as though I was just a regular girl.  
  
**Eriko：**  
When danger befell me, you came to protect me.  
Even though you're weaker than me.  
You really are something.  
  
**Eriko：**  
You were even happy about the excessive gifts I gave you.  
  
**Eriko：**  
You put up with my extremely jealous ways.  
  
**Eriko：**  
You helped me when I was unconscious.  
  
**Eriko：**  
As long as I'm by your side, I don't have to be the Destroyer.  
I can just be a regular girl.  
  
**Eriko：**  
My darling {player}...  
These feelings I have for you can only be love.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Whether you are my soulmate of destiny,  
or whether you are not.  
It doesn't matter to me.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Because I love you with all my heart. That's all that matters.  
  
**Eriko：**  
I don't love you because you're my soulmate.  
You're my soulmate because I love you, my love.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I think this is the real Eriko.  
`Tag 5`  
**Fake：**  
Tch! Saw right through it, huh?  
I was gonna make you wander  
through the forest and suck all the nutrients out of you.  
Now I'll just have to kill you for my feed!  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Not only did you confuse my love,  
but now you have the audacity to attack him?  
I must punish you most harshly for your insolence!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Hmph. Pathetic.  
If you have the nerve to mimic the Destroyer,  
you could've at least put up a bit more of a fight.  
Teehee.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Thanks.  
`Tag 6`  
**Eriko：**  
Oh, no. No need to thank me.  
It's only natural for me to dispose of those  
who would seek to harm you, my love.  
  
**Eriko：**  
I mean, you are my soulmate, after all.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh, how embarrassing. I-I'll be leaving now.  
  
**Narration：**  
Somehow, Eriko found herself hoping  
that {player} also saw her  
as his own soulmate.
