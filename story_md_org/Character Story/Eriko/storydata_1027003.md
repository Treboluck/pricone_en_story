**Narration：**

**Woman：**  
Um. Here! Take this love letter!  
  
Please read over it when you can! I wrote it just for you!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Read it.  
**Choice: (2)**  Wh-what should I do?

No, my love... I will read it on your behalf.

`Tag 2`  
**Eriko：**  
You should obviously throw it out at once.  
Please tear it up, discard it, abandon it, dispose of it,  
and incinerate it.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Eriko：**  
Oh? This...  
appears to be... a... love... letter.  
  
**Eriko：**  
No, no, no... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!  
How dare she leer at my love like that!  
  
**Eriko：**  
This... this absolute filth must be disposed of at once!  
My love, let's go and burn this scrap paper.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Filthy scrap of trash. You will burn in the volcanic hellfires  
until not a cinder remains.  
Burn, bUrn, buRN, BUrN, BURn, BURN, BURN, BURN...!  
  
**Eriko：**  
All trash must go to its rightful place...  
Now then, my love, shall we be on our way?  
  
**Eriko：**  
To the meeting place written in the letter, of course.  
I will punish the hussy for coming within a five-mile radius  
of you, my love.  
  
**Eriko：**  
I will ensure that she never bats an eyelash at you again...  
by pummeling her into oblivion. Teehee.  
  
**Eriko：**  
According to the map,  
it should be somewhere around... this cave...?  
  
**Woman：**  
Muahahahah! He actually showed up!  
The loser fell for it!  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
It's because you're so attractive, ma'am.  
We knew you'd pull it off!  
  
**Woman：**  
*giggle* That's enough flattery.  
Huh? There's some broad tagging along with him.  
Well, whatever.  
Boys, go mess them up!  
  
**Ruffians：**  
On it, ma'am!  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Listen up, punks!  
Give up all yer money if ya want us to spare ya!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Who exactly are you all?  
I'm only here to see that woman over there.  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
What are you, slow on the uptake?!  
Just cough up everythin' you've got!  
If you don't, we'll just have to force you—  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
GUWAH?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
You're in my way.  
  
**Ruffians：**  
GUWAHHH!  
  
**Woman：**  
N-no way! You took them all out?!  
C-could it be? Are you Eriko the Destroyer?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Now, my dear.  
At last, we can have a little heart-to-heart.  
Teehee.  
  
**Woman：**  
E-eeeek!  
Wh-wh-wh-what do you want from me?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
You are deserving of instant death for leering at my love.  
He is not somebody who should be approached by other women.  
  
**Eriko：**  
{player} belongs to me. Me and me alone. And nobody  
else! His eyes, ears, nose, mouth, hair, neck, chest, hips,  
stomach, back, hands, legs... Everything!  
  
**Woman：**  
Wh-what are you talking about?!  
That love letter was just a trap!  
I'm not interested in a dope like him!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh? Is that so?  
  
**Woman：**  
Y-you understand me now?  
Thank goodness, now I'm sa—  
  
**Eriko：**  
Not interested?  
How dare you insult my love... You must pay.  
  
**Woman：**  
You've got to be kidding!  
S-somebody, help!  
  
**Eriko：**  
There's no use in running.  
Any woman who approaches my love...  
will not live to tell the tale!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teeheeheeheeheeheeheeheeheehee...  
  
**Narration：**  
While Eriko had saved {player} from thugs,  
the overwhelming terror of the sight  
did not help to put his mind at ease.
