**Narration：**  
One day,  
while {player} is out on a stroll on his own...  
  
**???：**  
My love. Oh, my love.  
  
**Eriko：**  
It's me, your darling Eriko.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Why am I dressed like this, you ask?  
I thought that might concern you.  
  
**Eriko：**  
No, I haven't joined up with Nightmare.  
In fact,  
I'm not actually wearing this suit of armor.  
  
**Eriko：**  
The thing is, while I was experimenting with alchemy,  
I accidentally transferred my soul into this suit of armor.  
That's why I look like this right now.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Have a look. As you can see,  
there is nothing inside of here.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee.  
Now you have gazed all the way into my insides...  
This is quite a wonderful experience in itself.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Please don't act so flustered.  
Failures come part and parcel with experiments.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Well then, I must continue with my tests.  
So I'll excuse myself here.  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day...  
  
**Narration：**  
.........  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Thank goodness. You're back to normal.  
**Choice: (2)**  Has your body been okay since last time?

Meow.  
  
**Eriko?：**  
Mewwww, mewww,

**Eriko：**  
My love. I'm over here.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Down here. Look down by your feet.  
  
**Cat：**  
Yes, I may look like a cat.  
But it is none other than I, your beloved Eriko.  
  
**Cat：**  
Another failed experiment of mine.  
My mind has switched places with this cat's.  
  
**Cat：**  
Mew! Nya!  
*rub, rub*... *lick, lick*  
  
**Cat：**  
What?! What are you doing?!  
First you rub up against my beloved {player},  
th-then you proceed to lick him?!  
  
**Cat：**  
That beast of Carnivora Feliformia Felidae Felinae Felis!  
Fawning over him like a cat!  
Not even I have done such a thing yet!  
  
**Cat：**  
While that may be my body, I won't stand for this!  
I must find a way to reverse this as soon as possible!  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day...  
  
**Monster：**  
My love.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Nothing surprises me anymore.  
**Choice: (5)**  Whoa, a monster?!  
`Tag 4`  
**Monster：**  
No less from you, my love.  
This isn't enough to faze you, I see. Teehee.

`Tag 5`  
**Monster：**  
Please calm down.  
Despite my appearance, I am still your beloved Eriko.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Monster：**  
This is another failed experiment.  
This time my soul and this monster—  
  
**Passerby 1：**  
EEK! A m-monster!  
A monster's found its way into town!  
  
**Passerby 2：**  
Call for Nightmare, or Caon!  
Someone needs to defeat this thing!  
  
**Monster：**  
Oh dear, that's not good. I seem to have caused a commotion.  
What a pain.  
  
**Monster：**  
What? You want me to follow you somewhere?  
I see, you mean for us to escape this situation.  
  
**Monster：**  
Very well. I will go anywhere,  
as long as I'm with you, my love. Teehee.  
  
**Monster：**  
We managed to escape unscathed.  
Thank you very much, my love.  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Monster：**  
What a noisy monster you are.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Eriko?!  
`Tag 7`  
**Monster：**  
My love.  
While it may look like me, it's actually a monster.  
Please pay it no mind.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Oh? My soul has returned to my proper body.  
It looks as though the effects of the potion have worn off.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Right then, I'd better begin my next experiment.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Why are you trying to stop me?  
One must dance with danger to make scientific advances.  
I will continue my experiments.  
  
**Eriko：**  
What? I should take care of myself?  
I see you are deeply concerned about me.  
How very kind you are.  
  
**Eriko：**  
However, be it a request of yours or not,  
this is one thing I cannot be convinced to stop.  
If this experiment succeeds...  
  
**Eriko：**  
Then I will be able to restore your memories, my love.  
  
**Eriko：**  
I wish to bring you joy with these hands of mine  
by restoring your memories.  
  
**Eriko：**  
For that goal, it does not pain me to subject my own body  
to any number of experiments.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee... I hope you look forward to the success  
of these tests,  
my love...  
  
**Eriko：**  
What?! In that case,  
you will offer your own body up to experiment on?  
Why would you even suggest that?!  
  
**Eriko：**  
I won't allow it.I won't subject you to such danger!  
  
**Eriko：**  
Ah, I see... You must feel the same  
as I do right now.  
  
**Eriko：**  
You can't bear to see the person you love  
placed in such danger.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Very well.  
I will abandon this experiment, then.  
  
**Eriko：**  
However, I do have another experiment I'd like to perform  
if you're willing to be my test subject.  
  
**Eriko：**  
Teehee... Don't worry.  
I won't let you die.  
Teehee. Teeheehee.  
Teeheeheeheeheehee!  
  
**Narration：**  
Upon seeing Eriko's newfound motivation for research,  
{player}'s urge to escape only grew stronger.
