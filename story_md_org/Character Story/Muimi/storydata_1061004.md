In a dream, Muimi and Eito work to protect the accounts of Hiyori, Rei, Yui and {player}. Reminiscing fondly over the days she spent with Octo both in and outside of Astrum, Muimi settles back down to sleep.

**Narration：**  
The night before their attack on the capital,  
Muimi is taking care of some last-minute weapon maintenance.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I've left it beat-up for long enough.  
This mission's gonna be all action, so I need my equipment in top form!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hm...? What's all this light?  
  
**Muimi：**  
It's super bright, but somehow... I feel... sleepy...  
  

---  
  
**Narration：**  
On Minerva's instructions, Novem and Octo are traveling here and there  
on a mission to protect the accounts of players  
who might conquer the Tower of Sol.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Which one is she?  
Oh! I see her now!  
  
**Muimi：**  
\"Hiyori Harusaki\"...  
 So that's the real Hiyori.  
  
**Eito：**  
She looks just as peppy as over in Astrum...  
Now let's use the admin privileges Minerva gave us to access her mimi...  
There. That should keep her account safe.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Next is Rei, then.  
  
**Eito：**  
Our intel placed her at Orindo High, right?  
Novem. Walking's a pain, so let's leap there directly.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Oh, come on...  
If you can't even be bothered to move,  
you'll turn into an old man before you know it.  
  
**Eito：**  
I get more exercise than you, my dear Novem.  
Oh yes, how's that online martial arts course of yours going?  
  
**Muimi：**  
W-well, of course it's going great!  
C'mon, next target! Let's move!  
  
**Eito：**  
Okay, okay...  
  
**Eito：**  
Has she actually been slacking off on her training?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Rei must be...  
 that one, I guess?  
  
**Eito：**  
...Looks like it, yes. Her personal data is a match  
for the account linked to Rei's mimi.  
  
**Eito：**  
Just as I thought...  
 She seems the likeliest target.  
Let's give her account a little extra protection.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Why's that?  
  
**Eito：**  
Given her real-life position, she'll have met the Seven Crowns.  
Which could render our precautions completely meaningless.  
  
**Eito：**  
We can protect her account from attacks on Minerva,  
but if the enemy finds her in real life, like us,  
that won't help a bit, will it?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Good point. I hate to sound like you,  
but that would be a pain in the ass.  
  
**Eito：**  
Well, only fate can tell how things will play out.  
Now, we're done here, so let's move on.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Next is Yui, huh. What d'you think she'll be like?  
What if she's a total nutcase in real life or something?!  
  
**Eito：**  
At the very least, I doubt she's a bad girl.  
  
**Muimi：**  
You think?  
 Well, whatever.  
No point wondering when we can see for ourselves!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Now, which one's Yui? Where's she at?  
  
**Eito：**  
She's right there.  
 Look, over there.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Ohhh, that one! She looks pretty gentle.  
  
**Eito：**  
And I do believe... that's {player} beside her.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Huh? What're you talking about, Octo? Why would he be here?  
We're not in Astrum now, you know!  
  
**Eito：**  
I'm quite aware of that.  
But listen, Novem. That boy is Akira's Princess Knight.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Wait, for real?! How do you know a thing like that?!  
  
**Eito：**  
I've gathered the account data of every student  
who's logged in to Astrum from this school's network.  
  
**Eito：**  
And one account happened to be protected  
by some ridiculous security.  
In a style I recognized, no less.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Spying, huh?! You really are a bad egg, Octo!  
...  
You haven't told Mana or the others, have you?  
  
**Eito：**  
Oh, no. He's on Minerva's list of accounts to protect.  
I'll keep that boy hidden even better than the others.  
  
**Eito：**  
I set up a data broadcast from a dummy account,  
so they won't be able to find him without some serious effort.  
  
**Eito：**  
But that account was created by Akira anyway,  
so it barely needed my help.  
 Don't worry about him.  
  
**Muimi：**  
All right! I won't worry!  
Was that the last of the things Minerva wanted us to do?  
  
**Eito：**  
No, we're not done yet.  
There are plenty of other players we should investigate.  
  
**Eito：**  
But right now, I'm hungry,  
 so let's go grab a crepe.  
  
**Muimi：**  
At Akira's place?!  
 That sounds great!  
C'mon, let's get going, Octo!  
  
**Eito：**  
Hey—wait up, Novem!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hey! Akira!  
  
**Eito：**  
...Looks like she's not around.  
  
**Muimi：**  
But the stand is here! Which means...  
She must've noticed Christina was snooping around here.  
  
**Eito：**  
Sounds about right. A perfect vanishing act.  
Doesn't miss a trick, that woman.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Bah... Just when I thought I might actually see her again.  
  
**Eito：**  
You really miss her that much?  
You're more sentimental than I thought, Novem.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Shaddup! It's not like I'm lonely or anything!  
If Akira's not here, I'm going home! Later, Octo!  
  
**Eito：**  
Welp... Off she goes.  
...  
Now then. We've done our duty, so I guess I'll head home and log in.  
  
**Novem：**  
Why the heck are you following me?!  
  
**Octo：**  
Well, it is my job. You're not still mad, are you?  
C'mon, cheer up already. Please?  
  
**Novem：**  
Nuh-uh! I'm not falling for your sweet-talking!  
Just leave me alone!  
  
**Octo：**  
Ehhh~?!  
 No need to be like that!  
  
**Octo：**  
...Aha.  
 Look, Novem. I think that's our latest target.  
  
**Novem：**  
Oh, right! Great timing. I need to let off some steam!

**Novem：**  
Hey! You guys over there!  
Fight me, now!  
  
**Player 1：**  
Huh? What's this all of a sudden?  
  
**Octo：**  
We can't tell you the reason,  
but would you have a battle with us?  
  
**Player 2：**  
Uhh...?  
  
**Octo：**  
I know, it's a pain, isn't it?  
So we'd appreciate it if you could lose quickly.  
  
**Octo：**  
By the way, if you lose, you'll never be able  
to log in with that account again, so good luck!  
  
**Player 1：**  
Don't tell me you're from... that PK guild...?!  
  
**Novem：**  
You guys don't stand a chance against me and Octo,  
so this is your chance to surrender!  
  
**Player 2：**  
Two of you against all of us? You've got some nerve.  
Let's get 'em, guys!  
  
**Novem：**  
Heheh. Now we're talking! That's just what I wanted to hear!  
Get ready, Octo! We're gonna tear this whole party apart!  
  
**Octo：**  
You really do love to fight, don't you?  
I guess I'll back you up, so have fun.  
  
**Novem：**  
Yeah! Let's do this, partner! You've got my back, right?  
  
**Octo：**  
Sure, I'll keep you safe, partner.

`image display end`  
**Ameth：**  
...I guess this is as much as I can replay  
of that girl's memories of the past.  
  
**Ameth：**  
By tracing the bonds he's formed, I finally found a way in,  
but there are still limits.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I really thought I might find some useful info...  
But I guess her ability's protection was too tough to break.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Even though they're important memories worth safeguarding,  
I guess she doesn't want to remember what happened back then.  
  
**Ameth：**  
...It wouldn't be wise to force her to recall it.  
There's no telling what effects it might have.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That girl's memories from before she entered Astrum  
were nothing but painful to watch...  
  
**Ameth：**  
But I suppose these particular days alone  
shine so bright in her mind that she likes to remember them.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Terminate access. Initiate reboot.  
We were enemies once, but I hope we can be friends now... Novem.  
  

---  
  
**Muimi：**  
Mnnhh... Huh? Did I fall asleep...?  
  
**Muimi：**  
I hadn't dreamed about those days in quite a while...  
...  
Well, whatever.  
  
**Muimi：**  
*yawwwn...*  
Tomorrow's the big day,  
 so I'd better get some proper sleep.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Good night, partner...  
  
**Muimi：**  
...  
  
**Narration：**  
And with those words to a partner still beyond her reach,  
Muimi slipped once more into the land of dreams...
