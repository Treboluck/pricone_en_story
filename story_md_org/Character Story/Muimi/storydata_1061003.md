# Muimi Episode 3
As the big operation approaches, Muimi finds herself plagued by worries. Though Octo isn't around to cheer her up, Rajraj, Daigo and Masaki—her current companions—step in to fill his shoes. Reassured that she has friends at her back, Muimi sets out to play her part.

**Narration：**  
After receiving word that Kokkoro has awoken from her coma,  
Muimi and her allies prepare to kick off the two operations ahead—  
their attack on the palace, and the rescue of Pecorine.  
  
**Muimi：**  
There, that should do it.  
 We've sent the crow back,  
so all that's left is to prepare for the big day.  
  
**Muimi：**  
We have our positions. We have our timing.  
That just leaves...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Uhhh... Ummmm...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Dammit... Is this really going to work?  
Will this plan really be enough to defeat Mana?  
  
**Muimi：**  
If only Octo was here right now. I know he'd do better.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I can just see him now, dreaming up some clever plot,  
while complaining the whole time...  
  
**Muimi：**  
Octo... Where are you, and what are you doing now?  
Won't you walk in with a sigh like you've been here all along?  
  
**Daigo：**  
What's up?  
  
**Rajraj：**  
You seem concerned, Novem.  
  
**Muimi：**  
I-I'm not concerned!  
Why would I be worried about whether our plan's gonna work?!  
  
**Daigo：**  
Ehhh? Don't tell me you're scared, kid.  
You better not bail on us after coming this far!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Like heck I'd run!  
  
**Rajraj：**  
If you have worries, let us help, Novem.  
We rely on you to show us the way forward.  
  
**Masaki：**  
Quite right! Until my mistress Neneka is safe and sound,  
your assistance is utterly indispensable!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Rajraj... Masaki...  
 Thanks, you guys.  
  
**Daigo：**  
Hah! That's more like it!  
Just stick to that face, why don't ya?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Why you... Daigo!  
What's that supposed to mean?!  
  
**Masaki：**  
Ah, allow me to elaborate!  
 With his provocative words,  
young Daigo is attempting to spur you to action!  
  
**Daigo：**  
Wha—?! Dammit, Masaki!  
Don't just come out and say it!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Spurring me to action...?  
 Ohhhh! You were cheering me up?  
Then just say so, why don't you?! What a dummy!  
  
**Daigo：**  
Why, you little...!  
 Fine! Be like that!  
I won't do it again! Not ever!  
Mope your damn life away, for all I care!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Why're you getting angry?!  
I never said I didn't appreciate it!  
  
**Daigo：**  
R-really...?  
 Then that's fine, I guess...  
Anyway, Masaki! You hold still a sec!  
  
**Masaki：**  
Ha ha ha! Why do you raise your fist, young Daigo?  
It looks almost as though you are about to knock me flying!  
  
**Daigo：**  
Smart one, ain't ya?  
Try not to bite your tongue when I do!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Oh geez, there they go again. Don't make too much noise, OK?  
And try not to break anything!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Sheesh... Those two never did get along, did they?  
Even in the Tower of Sol, they were at each other's throats...  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Ah, excellent. Your smile has finally returned.  
  
**Muimi：**  
...Did I look that awful before?  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Of the expressions I have seen on your face,  
it was certainly darker than most.  
  
**Muimi：**  
It was, huh...?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Up 'til just recently,  
I was trying to sort out everything by myself,  
and I thought that was fine.  
  
**Muimi：**  
But now, I've gotta work with all you guys.  
And yet for some reason... I feel more nervous than ever.  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Nervous, you say...  
I only hope they are worries we can help you to deal with.  
  
**Daigo：**  
What are you, stupid?  
 Quit getting hung up on weird stuff!  
We'll all fight, and we'll win!  
 That's all there is to it!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Daigo...  
  
**Masaki：**  
I quite agree with young Daigo!  
Overthinking matters only leads to self-paralysis!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Masaki...  
  
**Rajraj：**  
Do not worry, Novem. You are no longer alone in this world.  
We are all ready to fight by your side.  
  
**Muimi：**  
Rajraj...  
  
**Muimi：**  
How could I have been so stupid? I'm an idiot.  
Daigo's totally right.  
So like an idiot, I'll just fight 'til I win!  
  
**Daigo：**  
Yeah! Let's go wild out there!  
  
**Masaki：**  
A clear plan of action indeed! I too will wield my blade with gusto!  
  
**Muimi：**  
I went through a lot to get here, but I'm glad I found these guys.  
  
**Muimi：**  
With them behind me, I'll be fine.  
Octo, I'll get you back no matter what it takes!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Guys... Thanks a bunch. I'm lucky to have allies like you.  
I hope you'll stick with me to the end!  
  
**Daigo：**  
...You say something, brat?  
  
**Muimi：**  
Excuse me?! Don't play dumb, Daigo!  
I know you heard every word!  
  
**Daigo：**  
Hah! Well, *someone* called me a dummy back there  
when I tried to help!  
 So this is payback!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Wh-why, you...!  
 I won't forget this!  
  
**Muimi：**  
I won't let anyone forget anything anymore!  
I'll defeat Mana and get it all back!  
Everyone's memories, and my partner too!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so the day of the big operation arrives,  
and Muimi takes up her role providing a distraction in the city.  
  

---  
  
**Muimi：**  
Think you can take me? Bring it on!  
I'll give you all a real beating! With my Spiresbane Blade, that is!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Now, who's up next?!  
 If you don't attack, then I will!  
  
**Soldier：**  
H... haaaaahhhh!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Scared, are you? Well, that means you've lost!  
Huuuaaarrghhh!  
  
**Soldier：**  
Nguaaaaggghhh!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Hahah! That all you got? Come on! Give me more!  
You're looking at Novem! The greatest villain in the world!  
  
**Muimi：**  
Even on my own, I'll hold out as long as it takes!  
So go get 'em, guys!  
 You just wait, Octo!  
  
**Narration：**  
Though Muimi was fighting alone like she always had,  
her trust in her allies spurred her on to greater heights.
