**Narration：**  
{player} is out on a walk one day,  
when he spots Tsumugi standing outside her store.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh, Mr. Knight...? Good morning...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I stayed up all night doing design work, so please don't look at me...  
I'm closing up shop early today...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ahhh... Even the sun seems to be blinding me...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Huh...? That's not the sun? What is all this light, then...?  
Ahhh... It's no use... I'm so sleepy, I can't... think straight...

**Rei：**  
Though it was only brief, it was good to see you.  
Well then, see you tonight in Astrum.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Hold it! Stop right there!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'm talking to you! You, right there!  
Don't you dare get any closer to Rei! You dirty stalker!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Me? A stalker?  
**Choice: (2)**  There must be some mistake.  
`Tag 1`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Yes, you! Who else would I mean?!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Tsumugi：**  
A mistake?! I saw the twisted look of desire on your face  
as you talked to Rei just now!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tsumugi：**  
I watch over Rei every hour of every day!  
You can't fool me for an instant!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Wait, which one of us is the stalker?  
`Tag 4`  
**Tsumugi：**  
A-are you calling *me* a stalker?!  
I see you're just as rude as you are creepy!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I know Rei better than anyone!  
On a deeper level than you could ever understand!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
So why is it that she opens up to a shabby nobody like you...?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
In fact, Rei needs to be more careful in general!  
She's been spending too much time with Mr. Knight in Astrum, too...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Hey! I'm still talking here! You're not getting away!  
Take this! Tape Measure Bind!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
How's that? Can't move an inch, can you?  
That's what you get for trying to run from me!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Isn't this an Astrum skill...?  
**Choice: (6)**  I know this binding sensation...  
`Tag 5`  
**Tsumugi：**  
That's right! I trained hard until I could use it in real life too!  
...Huh? W-wait, don't tell me...?!  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Huh? Hold on a minute!  
That reaction... it couldn't be...  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Are you actually \"Mr. Knight\" from Astrum?!  
Making moves on Rei in real life as well as in the game?!  
  
**Rei：**  
Hello, you two. Might I ask what you're doing?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
R-Rei?! I-I mean, Miss Shijo!  
G-good day... I thought you were on your way home?  
  
**Rei：**  
I remembered something I'd forgotten to ask of {player},  
so I came back to find him.  
  
**Rei：**  
Instead I see both of you making a scene in public,  
and for some reason shouting my name at the top of your voice?  
  
**Man 1：**  
Hey... Isn't that...?  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Shh! This looks like bad news! Better to stay out of it!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
When did all these onlookers gather around?!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
They were saying something about stalkers... Is that guy a stalker?  
Huh? But she seems to have settled down now...  
  
**Man 2：**  
Was the guy cheating on those girls? No, I guess not.  
Maybe they're both stalkers fighting over that other girl?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Rei, you don't understand! I was just trying to take out this nasty stalker!  
I had no idea he was the real-life identity of Mr. Knight!  
  
**Rei：**  
Enough excuses! That goes for you too, {player}!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Yes, ma'am! I'm very sorry for everything!  
Go on, Mr. Knight, you apologize too!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  But this is your fault, right, Tsumugi?  
`Tag 8`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Rei is lecturing both of us right now, isn't she?!  
And did you seriously just recognize me from my binding techni—  
  
**Rei：**  
Enough of your bickering! Kneel down and listen! Go on, now!  
Honestly... If this was Astrum, I'd be slicing you in half right now!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
No waaaay! I'm so sorry, Rei!  
Please forgive me!

**Ameth：**  
Aaaand welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Everything you just saw was basically a dream.  
You'll forget most of it once you wake up,  
so don't worry yourself about it too much.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, that Tsumugi's a funny girl, isn't she?  
Especially that technique... What the heck did she learn it for?  
  
**Ameth：**  
She works hard, but often at completely the wrong things.  
Perhaps you could help to point her in the right direction.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But you'd better tread carefully—  
you don't want to get tied up again, right?  
Unless of course... you're actually into that now?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Just kidding.  
Well then, I'll see you another time. Bye-bye!  
  

---  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Huh? Was I... asleep just now?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
You were asleep too, Mr. Knight?  
Even though *you're* not the one who stayed up all night?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
What's going on here?  
I feel like I saw that blank face of yours  
in my dreams just now, too...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I think we were arguing about Rei or something...?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Th-that dream must've been your fault  
for getting far too friendly with Rei!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'm not going to say you can't be friends with her,  
but you could, you know, try to be a little more considerate...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Maybe it's because of the dream,  
but for some reason, I feel like I need to apologize to him...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Huh...? M-Mr. Knight! Your clothes are fraying! See, right here!  
You're so hopeless sometimes. I'll sort that out for you!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Just so you're aware, these threads of mine...  
Tying people up isn't their main purpose, all right?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
For some reason, when I talk to him,  
I can never seem to say what I mean.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Maybe someday I'll be able to fix up my relationship with him  
just like I'm fixing up these clothes...  
  
**Narration：**  
Noticing that Tsumugi's face looked a little less stern than usual,  
{player} decided to let her be for the moment.
