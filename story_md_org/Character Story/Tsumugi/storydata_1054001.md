## Subtitle: Part-Timer Knight
  
**Narration：**  
Responding to a promising-looking offer of part-time work,  
{player} makes his way to a certain tailor's shop.  
  
**???：**  
Thank you for your patronage!  
We hope to see you again!  
  
**???：**  
Hey, you there! What are you doing? Have you got business at my shop?  
You've been standing outside the door for a while now!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I saw your job posting.  
**Choice: (2)**  Is the part-time opening still available?  
`Tag 1`  
**???：**  
Oh, you're here about the position? Well, you should've said so sooner!

`Tag 2`  
**???：**  
Opening?  
 ...Oh, of course!  
I almost forgot I'd posted that job request!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Sorry for thinking you were some suspicious loiterer.  
I'm Tsumugi, your client. Thank you very much for coming!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
He's not exactly brimming with muscle mass,  
but I do need an extra pair of hands, so let's call him hired!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
All right, let's see what you can do, Mr. Part-Timer Knight!  
I've got work for you right off the bat!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I need to gather some fruit to make dyes for a new outfit,  
so let's head to the forest! We can do introductions on the way there.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'm a member of a guild called Carmina.  
It's an idol group that puts on musical performances,  
but I'm not an idol myself.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I play a behind-the-scenes role, making the outfits and organizing  
concerts.  
 Thanks to the reputation of my outfits, I've managed to  
go independent with my tailoring business!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
If you ever need a snazzy outfit of your own, be sure to drop by!  
And it would be great if you could spread the word, like Rei does!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh, right! I need to tell you all about Rei too, don't I?!  
  
Now, listen closely! Rei is my very best customer,  
and I owe her so much!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Our objective today is to gather materials for her latest perfect outfit!  
So first I ought to fill you in on exactly what she's like!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...And that was when Rei leapt in to protect me from the monster!  
Even though she's a demongirl, she's the most purehearted of souls,  
who shows nothing but kindness to a human like myself!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
After that day, I swore that I'd do just about anything for her!  
I joined her fan club too! We're always talking about  
what makes Rei so wonderful...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Wait, huh? I guess we're here already.  
Don't tell me I ended up talking for the whole journey?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'm very sorry... I know I can be a bit of a chatterbox sometimes.  
But at any rate, let's get down to work!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
The material I need you to collect is a fruit that grows on this tree.  
There's a trick to picking it, so watch closely!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
See, if you grip the stem like so,  
and give it a gentle twist...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Voila! It comes right off!  
This plant is very soft and fragile, so be careful how you handle it.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Now, Mr. Knight, it's your turn to try!  
That's right, nice and gently.  
 Wait, if you squeeze that hard—  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ahahah. Well, you've dyed your face a fine purple.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Is this guy really gonna be okay?  
He seems kind of clumsy, or unsure of himself...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
W-well, I guess you're still learning!  
Let's give it another go, shall we?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
That's much better! You're a quick learner!  
Maybe I can leave you to your own devices now...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'll go pick some fruit from the tree over there,  
so you carry on with this one!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
The dye from this tree's fruit is an absolute must for the outfit,  
so I have to get it, no matter what!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
But why does it have to be so high up...?!  
Nghh... It's *just* out of my reach! Arghh!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'm not going to lose to a plant!  
Hahhh! Yahh! C'mon, you! Hyahh! Grahhh!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Don't overdo it, now.  
**Choice: (5)**  Is this what you're after?  
`Tag 4`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Aaahhh! Wh-what do you want all of a sudden?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
\"How do you pick this fruit?\"  
Just twist the base of the flower right there...

`Tag 5`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Huh? O-oh, um... Yes! Please go ahead and pick it!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Thank you... very much.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Th-that was a real shock! When did he creep up behind me?!  
And he was leaning in so close, too...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Wait a minute! Why am I getting so flustered  
just from having a guy's face close to mine?!  
Calm down, Tsumugi! Get a hold of yourself!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
A monster?! Talk about bad timing!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'll tie you up in a jiffy! Hahh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRUOOOOGGGHHH!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
It dodged my threads?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Now I can't stop it! At this rate, it's going to—  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Protect Tsumugi with your sword.  
**Choice: (8)**  Use yourself as a decoy.  
`Tag 7`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Wow, Mr. Knight! You're like a real knight!  
Wait, was that one hit enough to tire you out?! Step aside!  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Tsumugi：**  
M-Mr. Knight?!  
I know you want to help me, but don't do anything rash!  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Still, if we strike now...!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Come on, Mr. Knight! Let's deal the finishing blow!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGGRRRAAAOOGGGHHH!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
*pant*... *pant*... W-we did it, huh?!  
Ahahahaha...  
 H-huh? I can't stand...  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Lend Tsumugi your hand.  
`Tag 10`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Th-thank you very much...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
He was all worn out a moment ago,  
but his grip still felt surprisingly strong just now...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
N-now then!  
We've gotten all the fruit we need,  
so let's head back to town!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Mr. Knight... Thank you for all your help!  
This is your payment for today.  
Umm... If you'd like, you can rest here for a bit.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I've given him his pay, so I could've sent him home...  
Why am I suggesting he stick around?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
He didn't seem like much, but he was really helpful...  
And he saved me from that monster, so I'd like to thank him properly...  
  
**Rei：**  
Hey, Tsumugi. Good afternoon.  
 Oh...?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh—hello! Welcome to Tsumugi's—  
 Whaaaaa?! R-Rei?!  
I-i-i-it's such a pleasure to see you! What are you after today?  
  
**Rei：**  
I came to see how the outfit I ordered is coming along,  
but I didn't expect to run into {player} here.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Huh? Wait, I know that name...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
That's the suspicious man everyone in the fan club's been talking about,  
who's been getting all chummy with Rei!  
  
**Rei：**  
Still, this really is a surprise.  
I didn't know you were acquainted with Tsumugi too.  
If you ever have any clothing needs, trust me, you can rely on her.  
  
**Rei：**  
She can be a little...  
 Well, more than a little eccentric,  
but her skills are the real deal.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Wh-wh-wh-wha...?! Then Mr. Knight is the suspicious man himself?!  
No way... I mean, surely I'd have recognized the name...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh, heck! I never did ask him his name, did I?!  
If I'd known, I would have turned him away in an instant...!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
But he seemed so kind and harmless in the forest...  
He doesn't really come across as a dangerous parasite  
with his eyes on Rei...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Unless... He was only pretending to be a gentleman today,  
just like he did to get into Rei's good books?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
That must be it! What a shocker!  
Hmph! If he thinks that'll work on me, he's got another thing coming!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Hmmm... But how can I know for sure...?  
  
**Rei：**  
Tsumugi? What's up? Are you all right?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh! I-I'm terribly sorry, Rei!  
 What did you want?!  
  
**Rei：**  
As I just said, I was wondering about the outfit I ordered.  
I don't suppose it's ready yet, is it?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Mr. Knight and I just fetched the materials we need for the dye!  
It should be complete in a few days' time!  
  
**Rei：**  
I see. Then I'll drop by sometime next week, if that's all right.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Of course! That would be perfect!  
  
**Rei：**  
Now, {player}. I hope you'll be nice to Tsumugi.  
You play nice too, Tsumugi. Well then, I'll see you next week.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Always a pleasure to have you here, Rei!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I can't believe you were the suspicious man hanging around my Rei!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
You're so...!  
I-I don't like you one little bit, you got that?!  
  
**Narration：**  
Tied up in thread by a suddenly aggressive Tsumugi,  
{player} couldn't understand why he found himself  
suddenly thrown out onto the street.
