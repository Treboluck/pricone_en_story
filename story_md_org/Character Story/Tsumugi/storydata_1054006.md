# Tsumugi Episode 6
Tsumugi and {player} work together to capture a suspicious individual who's been following the Carmina members around. He confesses that he has a crush on Tsumugi, and asks her out. Tsumugi turns him down, saying she already has her eye on someone else—and then proceeds to criticize his stalking technique.

**Narration：**  
Responding to a message saying Tsumugi has a request for him,  
{player} heads to the remote outskirts of Landosol.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Mr. Knight. Thank you for joining me here today.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I didn't want anyone else to know about this,  
so I picked somewhere we wouldn't be overheard.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Mr. Knight. Um... The thing is...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Someone's been following the members of Carmina around,  
so I need to take them out! Will you help me?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'm sure you remember our debut concert—well, ever since then,  
we've all had this feeling that someone's watching us.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
They must be plotting to harm Nozomi and Chika!  
The two of them are really popular, and anyone can see why!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
But as the manager of the group, it's my job to keep them safe!  
If I leave this threat unattended to,  
who knows what might happen to them?!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What about you, Tsumugi?  
**Choice: (2)**  You're a member of Carmina too, right?  
`Tag 1`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh, don't worry about me.  
Heck, if someone was following *me* around, I'd be the first to notice.  
What do you take me for?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I haven't watched over Rei all this time for nothing.  
I know a thing or two about people-watching.

`Tag 2`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh, I'm not all that popular in the first place!  
But it's nice that you'd worry about me... Thank you for that.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Anyway, we can't wait until something happens.  
We have to track down the culprit proactively!  
  
**Narration：**  
Starting the next day, {player} takes charge of  
Carmina's on-site security on Tsumugi's instructions.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I need you to keep a close eye on the area around Chika and Nozomi!  
If we keep them under a tight guard, the culprit might give up and leave!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
But just in case the scoundrel shows himself,  
I've set up a number of traps around here to capture him!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Careful you don't get caught in them yourself!  
Though if you take the culprit down with you, I'll allow it!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
That should do it...  
I'll make that creeper regret he ever tried to mess with Carmina!Now! Whenever you're ready, bring it on!  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Bring it on!  
  
**Narration：**  
The day after that...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Bring it on!!!  
  
**Narration：**  
A few days later...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Nothing's happening at all...  
I haven't even felt his eyes on me for a while.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ahh! Could it be he actually sensed danger  
and fled with his tail between his legs?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  That would be for the best.  
**Choice: (5)**  You might be right.  
`Tag 4`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Yes, I'm sure that's it! Whew, thank goodness!

`Tag 5`  
**Tsumugi：**  
You think so too, huh?  
I guess our unparalleled security efforts did their job!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Tsumugi：**  
I have a dance lesson soon, but now I can practice in peace!  
Mr. Knight, thank you for all your hard work!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Here you go—your payment for this job!  
Well then, I should get going! See you around!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Whew...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Today's lesson was pretty tough, but I think  
I've gotten the hang of the steps now!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...Hm?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I feel like someone's watching me... Mr. Knight?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Yes, it *is* him. He's such a worrywart.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Wait, huh? He's not the only one?  
Must be a random passerby behind me.  
If I stand still, they'll walk right past. Three, two, one...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...They're not walking past. Who's there? Who is it?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
They're coming closer?! Wh-what now?!  
Oh no, oh no, oh no...! I've gotta run!  
  
**???：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I hear footsteps! They're chasing after me!  
There really was someone else watching me!  
Could it be... the culprit out for revenge?!  
  
**???：**  
*pant*...! *pant*...! *pant*...! *pant*...! *pant*...! *pant*...!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ah... A dead end?!  
Of all the terrible luck...!  
  
**Man：**  
*pant*... Ts... *pant*... Tsumugi...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Somebody help! Mr. Knight!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I'm here to save you!  
**Choice: (8)**  Phew, I made it in time...  
`Tag 7`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Mr. Knight! Thank goodness...!  
C-couldn't you have shown up just a *little* bit sooner?!  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Tsumugi：**  
You call this \"in time\"?! I-I was really scared!  
But it's great you're here! I might even thank you later!  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Man：**  
Wh-who the heck are you?! Ugh! Outta my way!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Aaahh?! Stay back! Get away from meeee!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Catch him with your threads!  
`Tag 10`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh, right! This is my chance...!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Surrender yourself at once! Haaaahhh!  
  
**Man：**  
Waaaaaghhh! My body's... tangled in threads...!  
I can't move! Urghhh...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I... I did it...  
 All right! I captured the creeper!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Mr. Knight! Did you see?! I actually did it!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Wait, stooop!  
Did I almost just go and give him a massive hug?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Talk about a close one! This was a dangerous situation to start with,  
but that's a whole different flavor of dangerous!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Calm down, Tsumugi!  
Picture the face of your beloved Rei and take deep breaths!  
*huff*... *puff*... *huff*... *puff*... Ahhh, Rei...!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
*sigh*...  
 Oh, Rei... You're such a beauty...  
Whew. I'm all calmed down.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
So, um... Mr. Knight, what are you doing here?  
  
**Choice: (11)**  I followed you because I was worried.  
`Tag 11`  
**Tsumugi：**  
I suppose that makes sense...  
 Thanks for that, I guess.  
You really saved my hide.  
 Now then...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Now that we're all nice and settled down...  
You, on the ground! Why were you chasing after me?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
If I'm not mistaken, you're the one who was after Nozomi or Chika...  
So you've got totally the wrong girl!  
  
**Man：**  
Huh? I've been watching my beloved Tsumugi.  
And you were finally on your own, so...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I see, I see. So it's your beloved Tsumugi you were...  
 Wait, me?!  
You don't mean... You're actually a fan of mine?!  
  
**Man：**  
That's right! I'm your biggest fan!  
At the concert, you were shining brighter on that stage  
than anyone else!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Whaaaa?!  
 N-no... Th-that can't be...!  
  
**Man：**  
You're my goddess, Tsumugi!  
Please... go out with me!  
I'll do anything!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ehhhh?!  
I-I've never had a guy ask me out like this before...  
So, um... ahhhh...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (12)**  What's wrong?  
`Tag 12`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Th-that's none of your business! Don't look at me right now!  
Turn 180 degrees! And another 360 for good measure!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Um, listen! There's...  
There's actually someone I'm interested in right now...  
So I'm afraid I can't go out with you! I'm sorry!  
  
**Man：**  
N-no way...!  
I thought you were my one and only goddess...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Urghh...  
This guy sort of reminds me of how I act around Rei...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
When I'm caught up in emotions I don't know how to express,  
I start acting selfish, and forget to consider her feelings...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
It makes me happy that you feel that way, but I think  
you picked the wrong way to express those feelings.  
  
**Man：**  
The wrong... way...?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
So think that over in your jail cell.  
And next time you have a crush, don't creep up from behind—  
approach her directly and tell her how you really feel.  
  
**Man：**  
Yeah...  
I'm sorry, Tsumugi...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'm glad you seem to understand.  
Besides, I wouldn't have gotten the wrong idea if your skills  
weren't so hopeless!  
 You need to work on that as well!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Were you even *trying* to conceal your presence?!  
If you hide like a total amateur,  
of *course* you're going to get yourself caught!  
  
**Man：**  
I'm sorry...  
 Wait, huh?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
And another thing! If you call yourself a fan,  
you need to work on staring more subtly!  
Your gaze is way too blatant!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
A fan's job is to watch over their goddess lovingly from afar!  
If your eyes are practically drilling holes in her,  
what's the use in that?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
You should gaze like you're cradling a precious flower!  
Blend in with the crowd, and become one with the nature around her!  
Watching isn't a crime, but you have to do it delicately, understand?!  
  
**Man：**  
Um, actually... I think I'd rather...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
You need to relearn your whole staring technique from scratch!  
Hey, don't run away! Sit down! Come on, now!  
Mr. Knight, you'd do well to listen too!  
  
**Narration：**  
As he watched Tsumugi give her own stalker a lecture on technique,  
{player} just felt glad that she was back to her usual self.
