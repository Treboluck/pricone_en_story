## Subtitle: Secret Stage
  
**Narration：**  
{player} has been hired to help with  
the stage construction for a concert to be held  
in Landosol the following day.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh, Mr. Knight. What are you doing here at this busy time?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh... I suppose they did say there was another helper on the way.  
So it was you, of all people... Honestly, why does this always happen?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh well, whatever. I'm sure there are simple tasks you can take care of,  
so go ask one of the staff members for instructions.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
By the way, I'm in charge of organizing this concert,  
so if you have any questions, you can ask me or another staff member.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
That covers the basics, so go ahead and get to work now!  
No breaks until lunchtime, you got that?  
  
**Man 1：**  
Miss Tsumugi! The third song needs blue lighting, right?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
That's right! We go to blue before the intro!  
Plus some smoke at foot level!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Miss Tsumugi! About the mic stands...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
There's a talk segment after the third song, so you can take care of them then!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Whew...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
This is actually kind of wearing me out...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Huh? Mr. Knight... What are you here for?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Ask if she's okay and hand her a candy.  
**Choice: (2)**  Greet her casually and hand her a drink.  
`Tag 1`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Wh-what's all this out of nowhere?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Wouldn't it be more normal to bring a drink?  
Oh well, whatever. That's very nice of you.

`Tag 2`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Oh, thank you...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Wait, why's this so sweet?! It's all gooey, too...  
But I am pretty tired, so I guess the sugar'll do me good...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Thanks for that. I needed a little breather.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Why the double take?!  
Is it that strange for me to thank you?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Just so we're clear, it's still not break time yet!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
You should get back to your work.  
C'mon, get moving already!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Still... I should thank you for being concerned about me.  
...And he's already gone.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Well, then! If I finish up early, I'll have time to spare,  
so let's get to it!  
  
**Narration：**  
That evening, on the completed concert stage...

**Tsumugi：**  
One, two, three, four!  
One, two, three, four!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
And finish up with a slick pose!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Then hold this position until the music ends!

**Tsumugi：**  
Whew... I actually danced through tomorrow's whole setlist...  
I'm spent... I can't move a muscle...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
My brain must be tired too... I'm seeing visions of Mr. Knight...  
I should clear up and head home...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'm actually here, though.  
`Tag 4`  
**Tsumugi：**  
For real?! Wh-what are you doing here?!  
More to the point, did you see anything?!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I was so careful to make sure nobody saw me...!  
There's nothing for it. I'll have to tie him up and secure his silence...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Um... Did I say that out loud?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Ahhh... Why don't we go out for a meal?  
All that dancing, singing and shouting has made me pretty hungry...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Um... This meal will be my treat, OK?  
So promise me you won't tell a soul about what you just witnessed!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Especially Nozomi and Chika! Don't breathe a word to them!  
You have to promise me!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  All right.  
**Choice: (6)**  I won't blab.  
`Tag 5`  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'll hold you to that! If you break your promise,  
I'll tie you up and hang you outside the city gates!

`Tag 6`  
**Tsumugi：**  
I'll hold you to that! If you say anything to anyone,  
I'll tie you up and feed you to the monsters!  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Well, you're not exactly a gossip, so I guess it'll be fine...  
Excuse me! Two bowls of ramen, please!  
  
**Staff：**  
Coming right up!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Have you ever had ramen before, Mr. Knight?  
 It's really good!  
Well, while we wait for our food, I guess I should explain  
what I was doing back there.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
As the costume designer, I need to advise the idols on their dancing.  
And to advise them properly, I need to understand the moves myself.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Same goes for the singing. There are lots of points we need to work on.  
But you know, compared to the other two,  
I'm an amateur at singing and dancing.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Even if I can't dance like Nozomi or sing as beautifully as Chika,  
I want to at least understand them, so I can discuss their performances  
and help them however I can.  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
No matter how hard it is, that's what I need to do right now.  
To help them shine even brighter in the costumes I design,  
I can't spare any effort!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I mean, I'm incredibly proud  of these latest costumes!  
The hip ribbons and flowing skirt create such a sense of motion!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
I can see Nozomi in my mind, whirling in that costume...  
Shining like the sun... Ahhh... Such perfection...!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  You're amazing, Tsumugi.  
**Choice: (9)**  You were shining just now, too.  
`Tag 8`  
**Tsumugi：**  
...Amazing? Who, me?  
I'm not the amazing one!  
I just got to where I am with a lot of hard work...

`Tag 9`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Huh? Shining? Me?  
Is that how I looked to you, up on the stage just now?  
  
`Tag 10`  
**Tsumugi：**  
Wh-wh-what's this all of a sudden?!  
Compliments won't earn you anything!  
  
**Choice: (11)**  You could be an idol too.  
`Tag 11`  
**Tsumugi：**  
...Mr. Knight...  
Um, are you seriously sayi—  
  
**Staff：**  
Here's what you ordered! Enjoy your meal now!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
...Actually, forget it.  
Look, this is the ramen I was talking about!  
Better eat up while it's nice and hot!  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Me... an idol...? Performing up on that stage for real?  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
Maybe I could give it a try...  
Mr. Knight sounded really sure, after all...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
No, no, no, I'm just a backstage supporter!  
I can't suddenly be an idol just because some guy tells me I can...  
  
**Tsumugi：**  
But... If I could really shine up there by their side...  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} quietly watched over Tsumugi  
as she struggled with her conflicting feelings.
