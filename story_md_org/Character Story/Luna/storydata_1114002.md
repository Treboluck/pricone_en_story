## Subtitle: Hide-and-Seek
  
**Narration：**  
Ever so curious about Luna,  
{player} finds himself back at the forest where they first met.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
You came back?  
I thought I told you to stay away...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
......  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...*sigh*  
  
**Old Woman：**  
No, I'm sorry.  
I was wrong.  
Old age and cynicism truly do seem to go hand in hand...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
To tell the truth... I wanted you to hear my story.  
Not just mine... but hers as well.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
It's a long tale, but would you be willing to listen?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Yes.  
`Tag 1`  
**Old Woman：**  
...Thank you.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Be warned though,  
there's no hope to be found in this story.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...To be blunt, I killed that little girl's parents.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
It feels like a lifetime ago at this point.  
The little girl and her parents moved here to this forest together.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Deep in the woods, they built a wonderful manor.  
Rumors about them being nobles spread in no time.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
But they were good, honest people.  
They helped many of us out when they first arrived, too.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
One night, though...  
Monsters began to rampage through the forest.  
And then they reached that house.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
By chance...  
I was nearby when it happened. I saw it all.  
I hid in the bushes, fearing for my life.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...I couldn't even stand.  
I knew I should go and call for help,  
but I couldn't...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
By the time I could force myself to move...  
it was all over.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
That little girl, by some miracle she managed to survive...  
But her parents didn't.  
Ever since that day, she's been alone.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
It's pathetic, really.  
I never quite realized what age could do to a person until then.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It's not your fault.  
`Tag 2`  
**Old Woman：**  
...How shameful.  
I've been waiting so long for someone to tell me that.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
But...  
I don't believe it's not my fault.  
Not one bit, no...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
The girl seems to have taken a liking to you.  
Please be kind to her.  
  
**Narration：**  
After the old woman leaves, {player} decides to  
head toward the manor deep in the woods.  
  
**Narration：**  
After a while, the scenery changes.  
The area looks just like a cemetery.  
  
**Narration：**  
Beyond the rows of gravestones, the manor stands silently.  
{player} knocks on the door.

**Luna：**  
...Who's there?  
  
**Luna：**  
......  
Why are you here...?!  
This is my house!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I was worried about you.  
`Tag 3`  
**Luna：**  
......  
I hate liars.  
  
**Luna：**  
They all tell me they'll come on my adventure...  
But then they run away. I hate them.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Why did you attack me?  
`Tag 4`  
**Luna：**  
What a strange thing to ask.  
...It's so you could become my friend.  
That way we could adventure together forever.  
  
**Luna：**  
Don't you know?  
If you died, we'd always be together.  
That's what Mother and Father said.  
  
**Luna：**  
......  
...Go away.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  If I die, I can't go on your adventure.  
`Tag 5`  
**Luna：**  
...Such a liar.  
  
**Luna：**  
Why does everyone lie to me like that?  
All I want is to play with everyone...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Then let's play.  
`Tag 6`

**Luna：**  
......  
  
**Luna：**  
............  
  
**Luna：**  
...Do you want to play with me that much?  
Why?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Because I'm worried about you.  
`Tag 7`  
**Luna：**  
......  
...I don't understand.  
  
**Luna：**  
Well... fine.  
I suppose I can play with you...  
  
`image display end`  
**Narration：**  
As she says so, Luna nervously steps outside.  
  
**Luna：**  
...Hide-and-seek.  
  
**Luna：**  
...Let's play hide-and-seek.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Sure.  
`Tag 8`  
**Luna：**  
...Good.  
  
**Luna：**  
Then I'll hide.  
You won't find me—  
I'm too good.  
  
**Luna：**  
Close your eyes and count to ten.  
Here I go...  
  
**Narration：**  
When {player} opens his eyes, Luna is nowhere to be seen.  
{player} considers where to look...

**Choice: (10)**  Look in the bushes.  
**Choice: (11)**  Look behind yourself.

Jump to tag 12  
`Tag 11`  
**Narration：**  
{player} quickly looks behind himself.  
As he does...  
  
**Luna：**  
Ah!  
You found me!  
  
**Luna：**  
Wow, wow!  
I thought if I followed close behind you...  
you would never find me.  
  
**Luna：**  
But you did find me!  
Amazing, mister!  
  
**Luna：**  
Well, this time it's my turn!  
You go and hide, mister!  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} plays until Luna grows tired of the game.  
  
**Luna：**  
Ahhh.  
That was fun!  
So next...  
  
**Choice: (13)**  I should get going.  
`Tag 13`  
**Luna：**  
...Really?  
......  
  
**Luna：**  
...Oh well, fine.  
I have a sandwich to eat anyway.  
It is dinnertime.  
  
**Luna：**  
...I'm not lonely.  
But...  
  
**Luna：**  
...Will you come and play with me again?  
  
**Choice: (14)**  Sure, let's play again.  
`Tag 14`  
**Luna：**  
Great!  
It's a promise!  
I'll be waiting for you!
