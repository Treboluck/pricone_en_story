**Narration：**  
{player} has come to the forest to meet Luna.  
  
**Luna：**  
...Ah.  
You came back!  
  
**Luna：**  
Hey, what should we play today?  
I want to play...  
tag!  
  
**Luna：**  
...Oh, we played that last time.  
And I'm tired of hide-and-seek too.  
  
**Luna：**  
...It's so boring here.  
There's nothing to do...  
  
**Luna：**  
Even so, I was always fine.  
But now...  
Ever since you came to play with me, this place is just dull.  
  
**Luna：**  
I wonder why.  
Even on my own, I was fine until you came along.  
  
**Luna：**  
I want to do more fun things with you.  
Am I weird?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  No, you're not.  
`Tag 1`  
**Luna：**  
Really?!  
So what do you want to do?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Do you want to go to town?  
`Tag 2`  
**Luna：**  
......  
  
**Luna：**  
......  
It's a bit scary.  
  
**Luna：**  
I'm not scared...  
But it's scary.  
  
**Luna：**  
Because it's full of people I don't know.  
I...  
  
**Luna：**  
...!  
What's happening?!  
It's so bright...!

...Brother.  
Hey, big brother.  
  
**Luna：**  
Hey, are you okay?  
Are you sleepy?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm fine.  
`Tag 3`  
**Luna：**  
Are you sure?  
If you're sleepy, you should take a nap.  
Picking me up from school must be tiring.  
  
**Luna：**  
Although, you did tell me that you would  
take me out  
to have fun today...  
  
**Luna：**  
But I'm a good kid.  
So I'm not selfish at all.  
  
**Luna：**  
...Not one bit.  
Even though you're supposed to take me out today...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I'll take you out.  
`Tag 4`  
**Luna：**

You're so kind!  
In that case, this way!  
  
**Luna：**  
Wow!  
There's so much here!  
It's amazing!

Where to, big brother?  
I'm fine with anything—it all looks fun!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  The arcade.  
**Choice: (6)**  The hamburger joint.  
**Choice: (7)**  The supermarket.

The arcade?  
Hee hee. It looks fun!  
Let's go, let's go!  
  
**Luna：**  
Wooow!  
There are so many games!  
  
**Luna：**  
Which one first, big brother?  
I want to see you play!  
  
**Luna：**  
You're so good at this!  
You're a total pro!

**Luna：**  
Wow!  
Just look at it all—there's so much stuff!

Vegetables are so pretty.  
I love the color of tomatoes!  
  
**Luna：**  
Ah! Canned food!  
I love that too.  
Did you know that, big brother?  
  
**Luna：**  
I know what your favorite is...  
...It's this!  
Hee hee. Am I right?  
  
**Luna：**  
When I get bigger,  
I'm going to cook all sorts of things for you.  
  
**Luna：**  
Because I know everything that you like!  
So I'm sure I'll be able to cook loads of tasty dishes for you.  
  
**Luna：**  
...Right now I can't, because kitchen knives are too dangerous.  
But I'll get big soon!  
  
**Luna：**  
When I do, come shopping with me again!  
Promise?

Hey, next we should...

`Tag 9`  
**Luna：**  
...You're right.  
I need to go home, don't I?  
  
**Luna：**  
But that's okay.  
Going out with you is so fun.  
Take me out again, okay?  
  
**Luna：**  
Promise me!  
Whatever you do, don't forget!

**Ameth：**  
Hello there. Good work.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just saw now was like a dream.  
But this time it was a little different.  
  
**Ameth：**  
This dream was based on a wish that Luna made.  
She wanted a day out with you,  
so that's how the dream went.  
  
**Ameth：**  
As soon as you wake up, you'll both forget...  
...But surely there's a reason for it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, good luck.  
...I'll see you around. ♪

**Luna：**  
...Huh?  
What was I doing?  
  
**Luna：**  
...How strange.  
  
**Luna：**  
......  
  
**Luna：**  
...Big brother?  
  
**Luna：**  
...Hee hee.  
Whoops.  
Silly me, mister.  
  
**Luna：**  
...Hey, you know...  
Next time you come to visit, we can go out.  
Even into town...  
  
**Luna：**  
...But I'd rather go somewhere without as many strangers.  
So next time,  
let's go out at night.  
  
**Luna：**  
Promise me.  
Whatever you do, don't forget.  
  
**Narration：**  
Seeing Luna's sweet smile,  
{player} was reminded of the fun dream he had.
