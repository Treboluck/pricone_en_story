Thanks for the sandwiches!

You're welcome.

Um... Thanks for waking me up this morning!  
And um, um...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Hey.  
Are you messing around?  
  
**Luna：**  
Hehehe...  
Yeah, I'm a bad kid today.  
Right, mister?

Goodness...  
Take care, you hear?  
You too.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's go.  
`Tag 1`  
**Luna：**  
See you later!  
  
**Luna：**  
Tee hee.  
It's so bright out, isn't it?  
  
**Luna：**  
It's been a long time since I've been out during the day.  
It feels weird.  
  
**Luna：**  
You know, I don't hate the brightness.  
Not anymore!  
  
**Luna：**  
Come on!  
Hurry up, mister!  
  
**Luna：**  
Wow...!  
  
**Luna：**  
Mister!  
Look! It's absolutely huge!  
And it's sparkling!  
  
**Luna：**  
Whoa!  
The sand is so soft!  
I wonder why!  
  
**Luna：**  
Hee hee, this is fun.  
The sea is amazing.  
  
**Luna：**  
...Eeek!  
I-it's moving!  
The sea...!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  They're waves.  
`Tag 2`  
**Luna：**  
Waves...?  
Huuuh...? The sea is alive?  
How interesting.  
  
**Luna：**  
Hey, come over here!  
Let's play!  
  
**Luna：**  
Hee hee.  
You're all wet, mister.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Because you splashed me.  
`Tag 3`  
**Luna：**  
Yeah!  
I'm all wet too!  
How fun!  
  
**Luna：**  
...Hee hee.  
So fun.  
  
**Luna：**  
Mother and Father... made a promise to me.  
That when I got big, they would bring me to the beach.  
  
**Luna：**  
So I ate lots and lots of food.  
I wanted to get big!  
  
**Luna：**  
...Mother and Father can't talk anymore.  
But they're definitely having fun.  
  
**Luna：**  
...Yes.  
I'm certain.  
  
**Luna：**  
You know... mister.  
I still don't really understand.  
  
**Luna：**  
Why Mother and Father had to die...  
Why they don't talk to me...  
Why I can't make friends...  
  
**Luna：**  
I don't understand.  
But...  
But, you know...  
  
**Luna：**  
Even though Mother and Father don't talk to me...  
I'm not alone.  
  
**Luna：**  
I'm not lonely anymore.  
Even the bright outdoors don't scare me anymore.  
And I'll be a good kid.  
  
**Luna：**  
...But mister.  
Just for today, I'm a bad kid.  
That's what we promised.  
  
**Luna：**  
So...  
  
**Luna：**  
Can I ask you something?  
  
**Luna：**  
Ummm...

**Luna：**  
I want us to become like Mother and Father.  
  
**Luna：**  
That way, whether we live, or whether we die...  
We'll always be together.  
And because of that, I'll never be lonely.  
  
**Luna：**  
We'll go out, smile,  
eat together...  
  
**Luna：**  
And when we go out together,  
maybe you won't notice what's different about me...  
But we'll have so much fun.  
  
**Luna：**  
I want us to become like Mother and Father.  
If we do, I'm sure...  
Mother and Father will smile for me.  
  
**Luna：**  
That's why, mister...  
  
**Luna：**  
You're my living friend.  
My special friend.  
  
**Luna：**  
But...  
When I get bigger...  
  
**Luna：**  
If I'm a good kid...  
  
**Luna：**  
Mister.  
Hold my hand tight, okay?  
  
**Luna：**  
I want you to be my family.
