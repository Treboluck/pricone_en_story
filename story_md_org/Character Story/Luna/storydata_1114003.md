**Narration：**  
{player} goes to the manor in the woods to pay Luna a visit.  
  
**Luna：**  
...Ah.  
  
**Luna：**  
It's you!  
Hey, did you come to play?  
  
**Luna：**  
Actually, I was  
playing here until just now.  
So I'm about to eat.  
  
**Luna：**  
Do you want to eat with me?  
I'm having a sandwich.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's eat.  
`Tag 1`  
**Luna：**  
Yay!  
  
**Luna：**  
Here, I'll give you half!  
Eat up!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  It's good.  
`Tag 2`  
**Luna：**  
Hee hee.  
Isn't it?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Did you make it?  
`Tag 3`  
**Luna：**  
No!  
I always find them by the front door.  
  
**Luna：**  
See, I know.  
The old lady, she's the one who leaves them.  
I've seen her, through the window.  
  
**Luna：**  
But I think the old lady hates me.  
She always leaves right away...  
I just want to play...  
  
**Luna：**  
But I really like these sandwiches!  
They're just like the ones Mother used to make.  
  
**Luna：**  
That's why...  
when I eat them, I don't feel lonely.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Do you live here alone in this mansion?  
`Tag 4`  
**Luna：**  
I'm not alone.  
  
**Luna：**  
Mother and Father are here too.  
  
**Luna：**  
...They're not talking right now though.  
  
**Luna：**  
Mother is really good at cooking!  
Me too—I can cook a little!  
I only help though...  
  
**Luna：**  
And we go on walks together.  
I really...  
like going out with Mother and Father.  
  
**Luna：**  
...You know,  
Mother and Father told me...  
  
**Luna：**  
Even if they died, they would always be with me.  
  
**Luna：**  
...That's why we'll always be together.  
  
**Luna：**  
But Mother and Father won't speak to me...  
So I get lonely...  
  
**Luna：**  
That's why I need friends for my adventure...  
But...  
  
**Luna：**  
...Why won't you die for me?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  If I die, I won't be able to go on your adventure.  
`Tag 5`  
**Luna：**  
...Liar.  
  
**Luna：**  
I told you, Mother and Father said that if they died,  
they would be with me forever.  
So they're always with me.  
  
**Luna：**  
But the old lady, and you too...  
You'll both go to some other place eventually.  
I won't get sandwiches anymore...  
  
**Luna：**  
...You won't play with me anymore.  
But if you die, we can be together forever...  
That way I'll never be alone.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I don't need to die to be your friend.  
`Tag 6`  
**Luna：**  
...Really?  
  
**Luna：**  
......  
...I don't understand.  
  
**Luna：**  
But will you be my friend forever?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Forever.  
`Tag 7`  
**Luna：**  
......  
  
**Luna：**  
...Then let's play.  
Tag, you're it.  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} plays with Luna.  
  
**Narration：**  
On the way back to Landosol,  
{player} bumps into the old woman.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Oh... It's you.  
By the look of it... things are going well with the girl.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...Wonderful.  
I'm so relieved now that you're here.  
  
**Narration：**  
As the old woman speaks, there's a pleasant scent about her.  
It smells familiar...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  You're the one leaving Luna those sandwiches.  
`Tag 8`  
**Old Woman：**  
...That's right.  
I know it's not much, but I hope it helps.  
It's the least I can do to atone for my sins.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
But it doesn't matter how much bread I bake...  
...I can't make up for what I did.  
I know that, but I have to try.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...You met her parents, didn't you?  
That girl is a necromancer.  
But she doesn't seem to realize it herself.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
The moment her parents died...  
she must have used her powers.  
That's how they ended up like that...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...To her, death means being together for eternity.  
It's my fault it became that way.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  She told me she likes your sandwiches.  
`Tag 9`  
**Old Woman：**  
......  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Sorry...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
That little girl, she looks like her.  
My granddaughter, that is.  
Just like her.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...  
...Forgive me.  
Old folks shouldn't be so gloomy.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
Keep up the good work looking after that girl.  
Please come back to see her.  
  
**Narration：**  
The old woman disappeared out of the forest.  
Wondering what he could do for Luna and the old woman,  
{player} also made his way out of the woods.
