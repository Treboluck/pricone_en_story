**Narration：**  
{player} is going to meet Luna  
in order to take her into town.  
  
**Luna：**  
Mister!  
Hehehe, sorry.  
I was getting ready.  
  
**Luna：**  
...I look a little different from usual.  
Can you tell?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Y-your hair?  
**Choice: (2)**  Y-your clothes?  
`Tag 1`

No!  
My hair is the same as always!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Luna：**  
No!  
I always wear these clothes!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Luna：**  
Argh, you're hopeless.  
A man needs to pay attention to a lady's appearance,  
Mother told me.  
  
**Luna：**  
...Tee hee.  
But Father never used to notice either.  
So Mother and I were always angry at him.  
  
**Luna：**  
So I'll let you off.  
In exchange...  
  
**Luna：**  
...Will you hold my hand like Father used to?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Hold Luna's hand.  
`Tag 4`  
**Luna：**  
...Tee hee!  
Your hand is so big!  
  
**Luna：**  
Let's go!  
I'm a little scared though...  
  
**Luna：**  
...But excited too!  
  
**Luna：**  
Wow...  
That over there, what is it?  
And this over here?  
  
**Luna：**  
Oh!  
Look at those flowers!  
I love flowers!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Pull Luna's hand.  
`Tag 5`  
**Luna：**  
...Hehehe.  
Sorry.  
  
**Luna：**  
It's... kind of quiet here.  
I wonder why.  
  
**Luna：**  
Quietness makes me feel lonely.  
That's why... I love the forest. Rustle, rustle,  
tweet, tweet—I can hear so many things.  
  
**Luna：**  
And the sandwiches are tasty!  
That's why I love the forest.  
  
**Luna：**  
But...  
When we're together, the quietness doesn't bother me.  
  
**Luna：**  
I might even start to like this road.  
Because you're here with me!  
  
**Luna：**  
...Is this it?  
  
**Luna：**  
......  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Squeeze Luna's hand.  
`Tag 6`  
**Luna：**  
...Ouch.  
  
**Luna：**  
...I wonder what everyone's doing.  
When I'm at home, I'm always... playing with my dolls at this time.  
  
**Luna：**  
The dolls aren't my friends though...  
...But if I talk to them,  
I feel a bit less lonely.  
  
**Luna：**  
...Everyone's talking.  
I can hear them a little...  
  
**Luna：**  
......  
  
**Luna：**  
...Why did I become lonely?  
  
**Luna：**  
...Mother and Father promised me.  
They... promised.  
They promised to take me out.  
  
**Luna：**  
But...  
Now they don't talk to me.  
  
**Luna：**  
They also can't take me out anymore.  
  
**Luna：**  
....I'm the only one.  
Everyone else  seems to be... having so much fun together outside.  
  
**Luna：**  
......  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I'm here with you.  
`Tag 7`  
**Luna：**  
...Yeah.  
But are you really?  
  
**Luna：**  
...You're really kind.  
But... is that forever?  
I wonder...  
  
**Luna：**  
...You know,  
when I'm feeling lonely...  
I think of you.  
  
**Luna：**  
I wonder why.  
But.... when I do, it makes me giggle.  
And then I can sleep soundly.  
  
**Luna：**  
I think of the fun we've had together...  
and the talks we've had...  
All of it...  
  
**Luna：**  
......  
  
**Luna：**  
...But when I wake up, I feel lonely.  
More than before. Much more...  
  
**Luna：**  
It's all your fault.  
Your fault...  
  
**Luna：**  
......  
  
**Luna：**  
...I'm really alone, aren't I?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  You're not alone.  
`Tag 8`  
**Luna：**  
...Because you're here?  
  
**Luna：**  
......  
  
**Luna：**  
...Yeah.  
You're right.  
  
**Luna：**  
...Being outside is scary after all.  
I'm starting to feel lonely...  
  
**Luna：**  
Let's go home.  
I'm a little less lonely in the middle of the forest.  
And I still have today's sandwich...  
  
**Luna：**  
I wonder what kind of sandwich it is.  
I bet it's another tasty one.  
I wish I could share a sandwich with the old lady.  
  
**Luna：**  
...Why does she hate me?  
...I'd like to ask, but she always runs away.  
What should I do...?  
  
**Luna：**  
...Let's go, mister.  
The more I think of sandwiches, the hungrier I get.  
  
**Luna：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Luna：**  
It's the old lady.  
Did she bring me a sandwich...?  
  
**Luna：**  
...Hey.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...?!  
Wh-who's there?!  
  
**Luna：**  
It's Luna.  
And mister.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...  
You two...  
  
**Luna：**  
Is that today's sandwich?  
You know, I...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
No, it's not...!  
I... um...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...Pardon me, I have somewhere to be.  
  
**Luna：**  
......  
  
**Luna：**  
...She's gone.  
I knew it, she hates me.  
  
**Choice: (9)**  She doesn't hate you.  
`Tag 9`  
**Luna：**  
...I'm sure she does.  
That's why I can't do it...  
It has to be you...  
  
**Luna：**  
...You know, that's enough for today.  
I'm fine.  
  
**Luna：**  
So you can go after the old lady.  
If I go after her, she'll just run away.  
  
**Luna：**  
I'll be right here, so don't worry.  
I won't follow you or anything...  
  
**Luna：**  
I don't tell lies.  
I'm a good kid.  
  
**Luna：**  
Um... mister, thanks for today.  
As I thought, the town is a bit scary...  
But going out with you was lots of fun!  
  
**Luna：**  
See you later, mister!  
I can't wait to see you again!  
  
**Old Woman：**  
....What's the matter?  
Why did you follow me all the way out here?  
  
**Old Woman：**  
I hope I didn't worry you...  
That wasn't my intention.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...When I saw her, my mind went blank.  
I just can't face her...  
because I did something so unforgivable...  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Luna is worried about you.  
`Tag 10`  
**Old Woman：**  
...  
She's a sweet child, that girl.  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...But she has no reason to be kind to me at all.  
After all, I...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
I was the one who caused her parents' deaths.  
I watched as they lost their lives...  
I just watched...  
  
**Old Woman：**  
...I can't apologize to her. That would be the easy way out.  
Therefore this is all I can do...  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} watches the old woman as she disappears from sight.  
Once she can no longer be seen, {player} leaves the area.  
  
**Narration：**  
Then, when no one is around—  
  
**Luna：**  
......  
  
**Luna：**  
...The old lady...  
  
**Luna：**  
...The old lady killed Mother and Father?
