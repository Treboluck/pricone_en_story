## Subtitle: All's Fair in Friendship and War
  
**Aoi：**  
{player}!  
Today, I came up with a strategy to make friends!  
In fact, I even prepared something to help!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Take a look!  
Ta-daaa! This is... my secret weapon!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Clothing... made out of springs?  
`Tag 1`  
**Aoi：**  
I call it the Cocoon of Friendship!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Go on, {player}, try holding it!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  So... heavy...  
`Tag 2`  
**Aoi：**  
But of course. I used plenty of iron and steel, after all!  
It's the toughest thing you ever saw!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? \"How do you actually use it?\"  
Well, allow me to explain in detail!  
  
**Aoi：**  
First, let's say I meet a random guy,  
and I ask him \"Would you be friends with me?\"  
  
**Aoi：**  
Naturally, he refuses immediately.  
Since my worth as a person is less than a stray eyebrow hair.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  That premise seems faulty.  
`Tag 3`  
**Aoi：**  
But then! I casually remove my shirt...  
Thus revealing this full-metal Cocoon underneath!  
  
**Aoi：**  
So he's like, \"Th-this girl! Can she really have been wearing  
something that heavy this whole time?!\" His jaw drops!  
\"Please become my friend!\"  
 he begs in awed admiration!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Your conclusion also seems faulty.  
`Tag 4`  
**Aoi：**  
No, no, this kind of thing happens a lot in manga,  
so I'm sure it must be true!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh...?  
Actually, can I even move in such a heavy thing,  
you ask...?  
 Good question! I should try it on now!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Hrnghh... Nngh... Ahh...  
Th-these springs... are stronger... than they look...  
  
**Aoi：**  
{player}...  
I think... these springs might be... a bit... too...  
 Uwahh!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  She rolled up like an armadillo...  
`Tag 5`  
**Aoi：**  
H-help me, please...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Wh-whew... You're a lifesaver...  
Th-this Cocoon is too dangerous, so I will seal it away...  
  
**Aoi：**  
However! I won't give up! My Cocoon may have failed,  
but in fact, I prepared more than one strategy!  
  
**Aoi：**  
My next plan, I call...  
\"Behold Your Friendly Gallant Rescuer!\"  
  
**Aoi：**  
Let's say I'm strolling through the city.  
Now, the city is crawling with scary delinquents.  
Nasty sorts who steal people's lunch money and the like.  
  
**Aoi：**  
That's when I appear out of nowhere  
and save whoever they're trying to rob.  
  
And you see, they'll be so thankful, we'll be friends forever!  
  
**Aoi：**  
That's the plan, {player}!  
Now, will you help me practice?  
  
**Aoi：**  
I'll play the part of the delinquent, so your role  
is to be the person getting robbed!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Grrrr... *spit*  
Gahhh! Heckin' heck! I'mma return my library books two days late!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  That's your idea of a delinquent?  
`Tag 6`  
**Aoi：**  
Ohhh, yo, yo!  
You there, big fella! I bet you've got some cash!  
Jump so I can hear it!  
  
**Aoi：**  
H-huh...? I don't hear any jangling...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Harder! I need you to jump harder!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Again! More jumping! Jump higher!  
Even higher! Gimme another!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Keep it up! *pant*... *pant*...  
Huh? {player}?  
Is something the matter?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Don't we need a rescuer too?  
`Tag 7`  
**Aoi：**  
Ahh...! I forgot about that part!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Y-you're a sharp one, {player}!  
Like some kind of genius detective...  
  
**Aoi：**  
I guess my second plan was a failure too...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ah! W-wait, don't start leaving yet!  
I have one last idea! This one's the best!  
It's my Operation: All-Out Friend-Making Death Race!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Here you see we have a switch.  
Once I activate the switch, ten seconds later,  
a gigantic log will come flying directly toward me.  
  
**Aoi：**  
If I say \"Please be friends with me!\" before it arrives,  
the log will stop in its tracks.  
  
**Aoi：**  
If I fail to say the words and allow the log to arrive,  
it will punt me into a ten-meter pitfall trap!  
I will surely die!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? I'm incredible for building this thing?  
No, no. Compared to making friends, this is nothing.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Now, let us begin!  
The All-Out Friend-Making Death Race starts here!  
Watch and learn!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Swiiiiitch... ON!  
  
**Aoi：**  
P-please be... fr-fr... frappucino...  
I mean... fr... fren... frenemies with...  
  
**Aoi：**  
With m... m-m-m-m-  
monkeys!  
 Aaaahhhh, it's all oveeeer!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Save Aoi.  
`Tag 8`  
**Aoi：**  
Waahh!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ahhh... You knocked the giant log right off course.  
I guess this means my life isn't forfeit.  
Thank you very much...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ahh! I forgot!  
Right over there  
 is where I left My Little Buddy Mk I  
just minding his own business!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Aaaaaghhh!  
My Little Buddy Mk I  
has been knocked into oblivion by the giant log!  
  
**Aoi：**  
U... urghhh... He's gone...  
My one and only precious homemade friend-making partner...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ahhh... Now my chances of making friends  
are lower than ever...  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Why do you want friends so badly, anyway?  
`Tag 9`  
**Aoi：**  
The Elven Forest is... not exactly central.  
I can go days without meeting anyone here.  
It gets pretty lonely.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh, well, there is Forestier, a little guild of elves like me.  
I'm actually a member myself, and everyone's so nice to me.  
I love them a lot...  
  
**Aoi：**  
But it's not like I see them every day, and besides,  
I don't want to be the one to hold them back...  
I have to make my own friends for myself.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh...? I'm a pure and admirable girl...?  
No no, I'm just a stubborn idiot...  
And I'd say the emphasis is mostly on the \"idiot\" part, too...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Poor My Little Buddy Mk I...  
How long will it take to rebuild you, I wonder...?  
  
**Choice: (10)**  I could practice with you instead.  
`Tag 10`  
**Aoi：**  
Whaaaaaa?!  
Th-that's the captain of the BB Brigade for you!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I... I'd like that very much!  
 In fact, maybe from now on  
I could call you \"My Little Buddy Mk II\" and—  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? Y-you wouldn't like that?  
I'm sorry! I was being a presumptuous idiot again...  
  
**Narration：**  
And so, Aoi and {player}'s  
friend-making struggles continued...
