## Subtitle: A Starlit Miracle
  
**Narration：**  
Though the monster that invaded the Elven Forest has been  
taken care of, the problem of the broken barrier remains.  
Aoi suggests heading to the forest entrance to investigate.  
  
**Aoi：**  
This is the place where the barrier usually takes effect.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Yes... I thought so.  
It looks like the barrier really is damaged.  
I think the problem isn't here, but in the city...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  In the city...?  
`Tag 1`  
**Aoi：**  
Yes. Long ago, two powerful mages—an elf and a human  
who were close friends—worked together to cast a barrier  
connecting this forest to the city.  
  
**Aoi：**  
An elf and a human... Close friends...  
I'm kind of jealous...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ah! I-I mean, I'm sorry!  
 That was kind of off-topic...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Anyway, thanks to the barrier connecting the Elven Forest  
to the city of Landosol, both locations are protected  
from the vast majority of monster attacks.  
  
**Aoi：**  
However, since the city end of the barrier  
seems to have been damaged,  
the balance between them is breaking down.  
  
**Aoi：**  
To properly restore the barrier, someone needs to take  
the Elven Wand passed down in our village,  
erect a huge altar in the city, and pray atop it for three days.  
  
**Aoi：**  
And quickly, too... If we don't restore the city barrier soon,  
forest and city alike will be exposed to the monster threat.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Shall I go take care of it?  
`Tag 2`  
**Aoi：**  
Oh, no, ehmm... It's strictly forbidden for any non-elf  
to lay hands on the Elven Wand...  
So I'd have to take it into the city myself...  
  
**Aoi：**  
But I... I've never actually been to the city before...  
It sounds scary...  
  
**Aoi：**  
U-um, {player}...  
W-would you be able to come along with me?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  That's what the BB Brigade's for!  
`Tag 3`  
**Aoi：**  
Ahh!  
 Th-thank you so much!  
Well then, off to the city we go!  
  
**Narration：**  
After retrieving the Elven Wand,  
Aoi and {player} head straight to the city.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Wowww... S-so this is the big city!  
A-all these people everywhere... It makes me dizzy...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Awahhh... I-I'm not used to people...  
I think I'm starting to feel peoplesick...  
I'm sorry... Let me rest a moment...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Whew... You know,  
 wouldn't it be amazing  
if I became friends with all these people here?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh! There's an ice cream stand...  
Huh? You'd really buy one for me? Th-thank you...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Mmmm! Th-this is really good!  
The city is a wonderful place, huh?!  
  
**Narration：**  
By asking around, {player} and Aoi learn that  
the city's Chief of Defense is at a restaurant,  
so they head there at once to find him.  
  
**Chief of Defense：**  
I see, I see. A barrier, eh? I do remember hearing about that  
in the old stories. We knocked down the old shrine recently  
to build some housing, so I guess that must've done it...  
  
**Chief of Defense：**  
All right, let me help! I'll sort out the admin work.  
So you just get on the altar and work your magic, yeah?  
It sounds pretty tough, praying for three days, but good luck!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Right! I'll do my best!  
  
**Aoi：**  
To think they'd have the perfect materials for our altar  
left over from a recent festival stage!  
Isn't that incredible timing, {player}?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Hammer, hammer, hammer...  
Heheh. I bet this is what it feels like  
preparing for a school festival...  
  
**Aoi：**  
It's complete! I've fixed the Elven Wand in place too...  
For the next three days, this altar will be my castle!  
  
**Narration：**  
So from that day forth, Aoi sits atop the tall, tall altar  
and continues her prayers, come wind or come rain.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Whew... My second day atop the altar...  
It's tougher than I thought, casting this barrier...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh—is that {player} I see over in the plaza?  
It's okay if I wave to him, right?  
D'you think he'll notice me?  
  
**Aoi：**  
...Huh? What's he doing?  
He's... chatting happily with lots of other people...  
Could they be his friends?  
  
**Aoi：**  
If {player} makes lots of friends...  
Could that mean the end of the BB Brigade?  
  
**Aoi：**  
...  
  
**Narration：**  
And finally, the night of the third day arrives.  
  
**Aoi：**  
The sky is so clear... It's a beautiful starry night.  
If I made a wish, it might even come true...  
  
**Aoi：**  
...But... I'm sure {player}  
is having lots of fun with someone else right now.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Everything all right?  
`Tag 4`  
**Aoi：**  
Ah! Awahh... {player}! Good evening!  
Aren't the stars beautiful tonight?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Now that it's almost over...  
  
I think I'm actually going to miss this place.  
  
**Aoi：**  
But... I still don't have any friends...  
Compared to you, I'm just a...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ah! No,  
 I didn't say anything!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Umm... Look... I-I was...  
on my own for a long time...  
  
**Aoi：**  
So even if I end up alone again, I'll be totally fine...  
You should go and find happiness...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  What are you talking about?  
`Tag 5`  
**Aoi：**  
Oh, nothing!  
Now, just a little longer until the barrier is complete!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Wait, whaaa? What's all this? Why's it shaking?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Wh-what just...  
 Ahh!  
There's a monster down at the base! Where did it come from?!  
And look! It's trying to destroy the altar!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I-I won't... let you do that!  
 Hahh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOAAAGGGHHH!  
  
**Aoi：**  
...Whew. I think I actually defeated it somehow...  
H-huh?  
  
**Aoi：**  
The altar is still shaking...! Aaahh!  
  
**Aoi：**  
W-waahh! I'm gonna fal—

**Narration：**  
Aoi almost tumbles from the top of the altar,  
but {player} grabs her arm just in time.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Th-thank you, {player}...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  This thing's gonna fall apart. We should get to safety.  
`Tag 6`  
**Aoi：**  
...No. I have to see this through to the end.  
If this altar is doomed to fall, I'll fall with it!  
  
**Aoi：**  
You may have plenty of friends now...  
But me, I still don't have anybody.  
So even if I die, it won't be a problem for anyone...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  You're wrong.  
`Tag 7`  
![104000702.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/104000702.webp)  
**Aoi：**  
Wrong...? I'm not sure what you...  
  
**Aoi：**  
R-right, of course. I know my life is all wrong!  
I mean, normal people have friends.  
Like you! I saw you yesterday!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Talking to all those people in the plaza...  
I'm sure they're all your friends, right?  
So you don't need the...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? What was that?  
There was a reason why you were talking to everyone?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Look down below...? Huh?  
  
**Townsfolk：**  
Hey there, little lady!  
Once your job's done, everyone here wants to be  
friends with you, so you better come down safe!  
  
**Aoi：**  
All the city people...!  
But then... Were you only talking to them  
so you could ask them to talk to me...?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Everyone here is really grateful to you.  
`Tag 8`  
![104000703.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/104000703.webp)  
**Aoi：**  
H... haha... You're our leader through and through...  
You're amazing...  
 I feel ashamed of myself for doubting you,  
even for a second.  
  
**Aoi：**  
...Huh?  
\"Besides, haven't you already made a friend of your own?\"  
  
**Aoi：**  
D-don't say such crazy things!  
E-even I'm not as gullible as that! Someday, maybe...  
But right now, where do I have a single friend?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Right in front of you.  
`Tag 9`  
**Aoi：**  
Huh...? {player}...? You're my...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Are you really willing to call me an actual friend?  
Someone... like me? A total weirdo?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ahaha...  
This is like... some kind of miracle!  
The wish I made... actually came true!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? We should head down quickly? O-okay!  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} takes Aoi in his arms  
and carries her down from the altar.

`image display end`  
**Aoi：**  
Ah... the altar's falling apart...  
I was so close to completing the barrier...  
  
**Aoi：**  
But I guess I can always just do it over again.  
More importantly, {player}...  
  
**Aoi：**  
I-I guess I have a friend now, do I?  
  
**Aoi：**  
And what's more, my first friend is you...  
That makes me so happy. Um... is it okay...  
if we stay like this for a little while?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Just for now, I'd like to savor this feeling a little longer...  
  
**Narration：**  
That day, Aoi finally found her very first friend.  
But surely this was only the beginning  
of a whole world of friends for the BB Brigade...
