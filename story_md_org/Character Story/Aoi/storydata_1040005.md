# Aoi Episode 5
Hoping to raise awareness of the BB Brigade's activities, Aoi decides they need a theme song. Aoi and {player} struggle to write the lyrics, but eventually succeed. Sadly, they then realize they have nobody to compose the tune.
  
## Subtitle: Theme Song Time!
  
**Aoi：**  
{player}!  
Thank you for coming to the forest  
for another day of BB Brigade activities!  
  
**Aoi：**  
There's something I've been thinking lately!  
It might be time we worked harder  
to raise awareness of the BB Brigade.  
  
**Aoi：**  
If the BB Brigade becomes more famous,  
lots more people who want to make friends  
will surely come to the forest to join us!  
  
**Aoi：**  
If we find more friend-seekers like ourselves,  
we'll be able to compare notes on making friends  
and increase our overall efficiency!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  But how would we become famous?  
`Tag 1`  
**Aoi：**  
Heheh... Actually, I have a plan!  
What do you think about making ourselves  
an official BB Brigade theme song?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I'm thinking we need a really catchy melody  
that you can't stop humming!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? That's a good idea?  
Y-you really think so?!  
Th-thank you so much!  
  
**Aoi：**  
W-well then, today...  
It would be nice if we could write the lyrics together...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Y-you'll really write them with me?  
Thank you! Thank you!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Well then, I suppose... we should start with a draft.  
Give me some ideas, and I'll try writing something!  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} and Aoi spend about three hours  
coming up with a first draft of the lyrics.  
  
**Aoi：**  
It's complete!  
Well then, let's sit down and read through it, shall we?  
  
**Aoi：**  
BB Brigade Harmony of Friendship (WIP)  
  
**Aoi：**  
If you want to make friends,  
take our hands, la la la!  
  
**Aoi：**  
We're not scary at all!  
We're the BB Brigade, lu lu lu!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Sounds good to me.  
**Choice: (3)**  Ummm...  
`Tag 2`  
**Aoi：**  
...Ummm... Are you sure?  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Aoi：**  
You don't look impressed.  
I guess we're both thinking the same thing, huh?  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Aoi：**  
It feels... lacking in universal appeal to me.  
  
**Aoi：**  
It could do with more... youthfulness?  
A style that appeals to young people these days.  
That's what we need, isn't it?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Maybe we could add a rap section!  
Stringing words together based on rhyme and rhythm!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  A rap section?!  
`Tag 5`  
**Aoi：**  
That's right. In the city, there's a youth culture  
of competing with ad-libbed rapping.  
I want a song that appeals to that audience too.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Also... Something's bugging me about the first line.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  If you want to make friends, take our hands?  
`Tag 6`  
**Aoi：**  
Yes. I think... The word \"friends\" seems to come up  
a bit too suddenly.  
We might need to clarify what we mean by that...  
  
**Aoi：**  
I mean, what counts as a \"friend\"  
is a very subjective and personal issue,  
so it'll be clearer if we define it properly.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Then, in the third line, \"We're not scary at all\"...  
I think such a blunt denial of our scariness  
might actually have the opposite effect.  
  
**Aoi：**  
If we really want to sound extremely not scary,  
it might be better to take a positive approach  
and demonstrate how kind we are.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  How would we do that?  
`Tag 7`  
**Aoi：**  
Let's see... When I was cooking dinner at home recently,  
I left my pan on the heat for too long, and the broth inside  
boiled over onto the stove.  
  
**Aoi：**  
I remember thinking if someone had been there to warn me,  
that would have been the kindest thing in the world.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Let's see if we can fit that into the song somewhere!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Also... talcum powder is kind to the skin, isn't it?  
Oh, but wait, we don't want to focus *only* on kindness,  
so let's use some cool words like \"thunder\" too!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Oh! And we should point out the double meaning in the title!  
It would be a real shame if people didn't notice!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  I'm starting to feel worried...  
`Tag 8`  
**Aoi：**  
It's finally finished! I think it's perfect this time!  
Well then, let me read the whole thing out!  
  
**Aoi：**  
...Ahem. Here goes nothing.  
  
**Aoi：**  
\"BB Brigade Harmony of Friendship  
(Please note: the \"harmony\" does not just refer to the music.)\"  
  
**Aoi：**  
Hey YO! You there, bro!  
Gotta make friends!  
Don'tcha know!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Diggety-wop! Clippety-clop!  
Soda pop! Belly flop!  
On the treetop! Beat don't stop!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Go go go!  
Join the show! Me and you, bro!  
Making so! Many friends like a pro!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Open bracket. NB: Hereafter, \"friend\" is to be defined as a  
person spoken with, including through mail or other methods such as telepathy, once a week at minimum. Close bracket.  
  
**Aoi：**  
Moving on from that,  
Boiling broth! Boiling broth!  
Boiling broth! Boiling broth!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Look out, bro! On your stove!  
Broth is boiling over, yo!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Boiling broth! Boiling broth!  
Don't let it boil over!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Boilingtastic High-Voltage Thundeeeeer!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ohhhh, nothing in the world could be more kind... ♪  
Than talcum powder and the BB Brigade! ♪  
  
**Aoi：**  
...  
  
**Choice: (9)**  (Wh-what did I just witness?  
`Tag 9`  
**Aoi：**  
Don't you think it turned out amazing?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
A classic for the ages, full of friendship and kindness!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Y-yeah, sure it is...  
`Tag 10`  
**Aoi：**  
I couldn't have done it without all the help  
you gave me, {player}!  
 I guess this is like  
our first achievement together as a team!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Ahaha! This is wonderful...  
Such beautiful lyrics...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Anyway, now we just need to put them to music!  
{player}, please do the honors!  
  
**Choice: (11)**  I don't know how to compose music...  
`Tag 11`  
**Aoi：**  
Huh?  
  
**Aoi：**  
I-I thought... as long as we had some lyrics,  
the rest would sort itself out...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Well, of course I don't have anyone to turn to...  
Those sorts of helpful connections don't really happen  
when you don't have any friends...  
  
**Aoi：**  
.........  
  
**Narration：**  
Staring at their meticulously-crafted lyrics with no tune,  
the two of them stood hopelessly in the forest for a while...
