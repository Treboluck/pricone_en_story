**Narration：**  
The day after the BB Brigade's formation,  
{player} revisits the Elven Forest to see Aoi.  
  
**Aoi：**  
La la laaaa, BB Brigade! ♪  
When will it be time for the BB Brigade? ♪  
  
**Aoi：**  
...Oh! {player}!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I... I was hoping you'd come!  
I've been longing for this day!  
I've been waiting for what feels like my entire life!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  We only just met yesterday...  
`Tag 1`  
**Aoi：**  
Then, um, I've been waiting since yesterday!  
Hot diggety!  
  
**Aoi：**  
W-well then... let's start brainstorming!  
Wh-what do you think we should do t-to make  
lots and lots of friends?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's start with a little jab.  
**Choice: (3)**  Become one with the Friend Universe.  
`Tag 2`  
**Aoi：**  
Oh, right. Float like a little moth, sting like a wasp, you mean?  
Incredible! You're the Friendmeister!  
Not that I really get it!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Aoi：**  
Oh, I see! Know your enemy, and victory shall be yours!  
That sounds right!  
Amazing, {player}! You're a genius!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Aoi：**  
Still, as I thought, this whole making-friends thing  
is going to be an uphill battle...!  
  
**Aoi：**  
So, um, next...  
Ehm... There's a more specific question that I've been  
wanting to ask you...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Let's say one day I were to randomly  
run into a human on the street...  
How would I go about talking to them?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  You could say \"Let's be friends?\"  
`Tag 5`  
**Aoi：**  
S-s-s-s-say whaaaaaaaaat?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Th-th-that's... way too high level!!!  
The highest of the high!  
  
**Aoi：**  
It... it's so high... so high...  
 high so high so...  
 HIGH SOCIETY!!!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I-I'm sorry, I panicked and started  
talking complete nonsense again...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Huh? Why don't I try practicing with my doll first,  
you say...?  
  
**Aoi：**  
Good point... If it's just me and My Little Buddy Mk I,  
we chat together a lot, so I might be able to do it!  
You have the best ideas, {player}...  
  
**Aoi：**  
W-well then, me and My Little Buddy Mk I  
will try it out now!  
If I do anything wrong, let me know immediately!  
  
**Aoi：**  
H-he-he-hel... ...ello... hell... hel...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Healthy eating is the key... t-to a long and fulfilling life,  
so our recommendation is to maintain a balanced diet...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  You make a good presenter.  
`Tag 6`  
**Aoi：**  
Ahh!  
 I-I'm sorry...  
I lost sight of my place in society...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Let's keep things more personal, yeah?  
`Tag 7`  
**Aoi：**  
P-personal...? Personal...  
Personally, I like vegetables better than meat!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Don't forget the friend thing!  
`Tag 8`  
**Aoi：**  
Right! Pop quiz time!  
What do you get if you add a \"fri\" to the \"end\"?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Is this the time for riddles?!  
`Tag 9`  
**Aoi：**  
U-urghh...  
I don't think I'm ready for this today...  
  
**Aoi：**  
I knew all along a loner like me couldn't hope to make friends  
without a hundred thousand years' training...  
I'll never say \"let's be friends\" until the day I die...  
  
**Aoi：**  
Maybe \"friends\" was too much too soon...  
If only I could find a good method  
to start a conversation...  
  
**Choice: (10)**  You could talk about the weather?  
`Tag 10`  
**Aoi：**  
I... I see! Even I could probably...  
You just watch, {player}!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Hello there! The weather is nice today, isn't it?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
You think I'm doing great? Really?!  
A-are you sure?!  
  
**Aoi：**  
A-amazing! This is all thanks to you...  
Thank you so much, {player}!  
  
**Aoi：**  
I... I'm so happy... so happy... Ahhh!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Hey, did you know, {player}?  
The weather is nice today!  
  
**Aoi：**  
It might be a bit cloudy,  
 but the weather's nice today!  
  
**Aoi：**  
To change the subject completely, the weather's nice today!  
  
**Aoi：**  
It's getting rather late... and the weather's nice today!  
  
**Aoi：**  
It's so dark I can't see a single thing,  
but the weather's nice today!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Today, and tomorrow, and the day after that...  
I'm sure the weather will be nice!  
  
**Aoi：**  
Old Macdonald had a farm!  
 And... the weather's nice today!  
  
**Narration：**  
Aoi continued to gleefully talk about the weather  
until the sun rose once more over the horizon...
