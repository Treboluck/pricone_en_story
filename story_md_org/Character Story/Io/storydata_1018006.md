**Narration：**  
A sudden clamor on the streets catches {player}'s attention.  
  
**Resident 1：**  
It's a monster!  
There's a wild monster right on the edge of town!  
  
**Resident 2：**  
What're we gonna do? If we let it be,  
there's no telling what it'll do.  
  
**Resident 1：**  
We'll have to kill it. If we all fight together, we should be  
able to take it down!  
  
**Resident 1：**  
All right, everyone! Let's do this!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Follow them.  
`Tag 1`  
**Monster：**  
SKRRREEE!  
  
**Resident 1：**  
That thing's incredibly ferocious.  
It's gonna take all of us fighting together!  
  
**Io：**  
Please, wait!  
This little one doesn't mean us any harm!  
  
**Resident 1：**  
How do you know?  
You do realize it's a monster, right?  
It could strike at any moment!  
  
**Resident 1：**  
It's a danger to everyone, including you. Now get away from it!  
  
**Io：**  
I will not!  
If you intend to attack this poor creature,  
I'll do whatever I have to to protect it!  
  
**Resident 1：**  
H-hey, what should we do?  
  
**Resident 2：**  
Lost your nerve, sonny? We can't let a violent, ferocious  
beast like that wander around here. There's no option  
but to kill it.  
  
**Resident 1：**  
Sorry lady,  
but we'll get you out of the way by force  
if we have to. C'mon!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Hold it!  
`Tag 2`  
**Io：**  
{player}?  
  
**Resident 1：**  
What is it, kid?  
You gonna get in our way, too?  
  
**Resident 1：**  
Huh?  
If it was gonna attack someone, it would've started  
with the woman, since she's closest to it?  
  
**Resident 1：**  
Y-you have a point...  
But still, we can't just let it roam  
around this close to town!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  We'll chase it away.  
`Tag 3`  
**Resident 1：**  
Chase it away?  
All right, have it your way.  
If you can actually do that, then we won't kill it.  
  
**Resident 1：**  
That's the better option all around.  
Now we won't have to fight, either.  
  
**Io：**  
I'll bring it back to the forest! I promise, I'll do whatever  
I have to to keep it safe and unharmed.  
  
**Resident 2：**  
Very well.  
It's all yours, young lady.  
  
**Io：**  
Thank you very much.  
And thank you too, {player}.  
  
**Io：**  
Huh? You'll help me?  
I really appreciate this.  
Let's go, shall we?  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Io：**  
Hmm?  
Why did I protect this little one?  
  
**Io：**  
Actually, I found it caught in a monster trap.  
  
**Io：**  
It was injured and in pain.  
I couldn't abandon it just because it happens to be a monster.  
  
**Io：**  
So I freed it from the trap and healed its wounds.  
  
**Io：**  
And apparently it took a liking to me.  
It must've wandered all the way to the edge of town  
trying to find me.  
  
**Io：**  
See? Notice how docile it's being while following us?  
You can tell it's a kind, sweet little monster.  
  
**Io：**  
By the way, {player}.  
Why did you believe me?  
  
**Io：**  
It might've only been a coincidence that it wasn't  
attacking me at the time.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  It didn't look like it meant any harm.  
**Choice: (5)**  Because you wouldn't lie, Io.  
`Tag 4`  
**Io：**  
Right?  
You have a talent for looking at things  
from multiple viewpoints. Impressive, like usual.

`Tag 5`  
**Io：**  
Hee hee. I'm happy that you trust me  
so much.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Io：**  
And thanks to your faith in my judgment,  
this little one got home alive.  
  
**Io：**  
Once again, you came to my rescue.  
And once again, all I can say is thank you.
