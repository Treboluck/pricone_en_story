## Subtitle: Forbidden Love?!
  
**Io：**  
Umm, I'd rather not.  
  
**Flirt：**  
Aww c'mon, why not?  
You're single, right?  
Come with me and we'll have lotsa fun together.  
  
**Flirt：**  
You know you want to.  
Why else would you dress like that?  
  
**Io：**  
S-somebody, please help!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hold it!  
`Tag 1`  
**Io：**  
Huh? {player}?  
  
**Flirt：**  
What's your problem, punk?  
Take a hike.  
What, you this chick's brother or something?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Try boyfriend.  
`Tag 2`  
**Io：**  
B-boyfriend?!  
  
**Flirt：**  
So I'm s'posed to lay off because she's your woman, huh?  
Yeah, right.  
Are you two really a couple?  
  
**Io：**  
Coup-what?!  
Us, a couple? Of course n—  
  
**Io：**  
Huh? It'll be easier if he thinks that?  
Oh, r-right.  
  
**Io：**  
Of course!  
We're b... b... boyfriend and girlfriend!  
  
**Flirt：**  
You don't sound too convinced.  
  
**Io：**  
What do we do?  
He doesn't believe us.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Act like a couple would act.  
**Choice: (4)**  Talk like a couple would talk.  
`Tag 3`  
**Io：**  
Oh, right!  
But how are couples supposed to act?  
I've never been in a relationship before.  
  
**Io：**  
Let me think, if this were a girls' manga...  
What if you act manly and slam your hand on the wall?  
{player}, lean in close and give the wall a good \"wham!\"  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Wham!  
`Tag 5`  
**Flirt：**  
Ah! What the hell are you doing?  
  
**Io：**  
Not to him!  
Do it to me!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 4`  
**Io：**  
Oh, right!  
But what do boyfriends and girlfriends usually  
say to one another?  
  
**Io：**  
Let me think, if this were a girls' manga...  
Maybe a l-love confession? You could tell me,  
\"I really like you!\"  
  
**Io：**  
I-it's never happened to me before, but I've always thought  
love confessions were so romantic.  
If you were to say that to me, I...  
  
**Io：**  
Huh? Couples confessing makes no sense?  
Oh, good point.  
If we're already dating, then that would be doing things  
backwards, wouldn't it!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Io：**  
Hmm, what should we do?  
This is trickier than I thought.  
  
**Io：**  
Hey, {player}!  
Don't make me do all the thinking!  
You try to come up with an idea, too!  
  
**Io：**  
If you had a girlfriend, what would you do with her?  
  
**Io：**  
You don't know?  
*sigh* Clearly I need to educate you about more than just  
academic subjects.  
  
**Io：**  
Like girls' manga and romance novels.  
I'll bring in a bunch of my favorites to our next class!  
  
**Flirt：**  
Hey, damn it! You got some nerve ignoring me  
and yammering on by yourselves!  
  
**Io：**  
Oh, sorry. Once  
{player} and I start talking,  
I have so much fun I lose track of what's going on.  
  
**Flirt：**  
Son of a...  
Acting all lovey-dovey?  
Guess they are a couple.  
  
**Io：**  
Whew, finally.  
Looks like he fell for it.  
  
**Io：**  
Sorry? Why are you apologizing?  
For pretending to be my boyfriend?  
  
**Io：**  
You've got nothing to be sorry for.  
I was so happy when you stepped in to help me.  
  
**Io：**  
And when you said you were my boyfriend...  
  
**Io：**  
N-nothing! I didn't say anything!  
Yes, thanks again for getting me out of a bad situation.  
  
**Io：**  
Looks like I owe you again.  
I need to repay you somehow.  
  
**Io：**  
Ooh, there's a fancy-looking pastry shop right over there!  
Let's go get something to eat.  
My treat!  
  
**Io：**  
Actually, this is more or less a real date now, right?  
Hee hee. How exciting! ♪
