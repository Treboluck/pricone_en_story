{player} and Io are practicing for a cooking session. Although Io is enthusiastic about showing off her solo cooking skills, she decides to let  help her prepare after things don't go as planned.
  
## Subtitle: Hectic Day of Grocery Shopping
  
**Narration：**  
One weekend, Io and {player}  
go out to buy ingredients  
for a cooking session at Lucent Academy's Parents' Day.  
  
**Io：**  
Hmm, I'm in a dilemma...  
Everything looks so good, I just can't make up my mind.  
Hey, what do you think we should buy?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Everything looks so good.  
`Tag 1`  
**Io：**  
Hey! That doesn't help at all!  
  
**Io：**  
I really hope the students can learn to enjoy the culinary arts more  
through the upcoming cooking session.  
  
**Io：**  
But to achieve that, we'll need to gather up some delicious ingredients.  
So let's put our heads together and think.  
  
**Io：**  
Still, although you're not from my class,  
it's very helpful having you here.  
  
**Io：**  
Buying ingredients for the whole class  
would be really tough for me to do on my own.  
  
**Io：**  
Hehe, even though we're just grocery shopping,  
I'm having lots of fun because I'm with you.  
  
**Staff：**  
Hello there!  
Are you two lovebirds preparing for a cooking date at home tonight?  
  
**Io：**  
Wha—?! It's nothing like that.  
He's one of my students, and we're just  
buying ingredients for a cooking session at school.  
  
**Staff：**  
Oh what, you're a teacher?  
You two seem so close, I totally assumed you were a couple.  
You must get that a lot, right?  
  
**Io：**  
Yeah, we do get told that often...  
But I wonder if we really do seem that way.  
  
**Io：**  
Wait. \"That way\"... As in...  
like you're my boyfriend.  
I mean, it would be nice if my first partner  
was someone kind like you...  
  
**Io：**  
But we're just teacher and student...  
Right? You think the same, don't you?  
  
**Staff：**  
Well, if that's what makes you two happy.  
Putting that aside, it seems like you're having a bit of trouble.  
If you want, shall I help you choose some ingredients?  
  
**Io：**  
Yes, that'd be great...  
  
**Staff：**  
All right, leave it to me!  
  
**Staff：**  
Here! Sorry for the wait!  
  
**Io：**  
Wha—? This much?  
  
**Staff：**  
So the name on the receipt is... \"Lucent Academy.\"  
Thank you, guys!  
  
**Io：**  
...We bought too much!  
But I'm sure the principal will reimburse us, so it should be fine, right...?  
  
**Io：**  
Yeah, let's say it's fine. But even with the parents joining in,  
we won't be able to use up all the ingredients in one session.  
  
**Io：**  
Since we bought so much food, we shouldn't let it go to waste.  
...  
I've got it!  
  
**Io：**  
Well then, let's start practicing for the cooking session.  
For some reason, going grocery shopping with you  
makes me wanna cook.  
  
**Io：**  
Hey, {player}! What's with that worried look on your face?  
You're thinking that I can't cook, aren't you?  
  
**Io：**  
Sorry to say, but even I can cook, okay?  
Well, I'm not great at it,  
but now that I'm an adult living alone,  
I can cook to some degree.  
Trust me!  
  
**Io：**  
Sooo, you can just sit and watch.  
I'm going to absolutely blow your mind  
with the food I'm going to serve you.  
  
**Io：**  
Ah, not like that!  
Now we really do look like a couple having a cooking date at home!  
  
**Io：**  
All we're doing here is cooking practice!  
On the day of, I'll need to cook while teaching the students, right?  
So today we'll rehearse by using up all the excess ingredients!  
  
**Io：**  
Anyways!  
Just leave it to me!  
  
**Io：**  
Lalalala~! ♪  
  
**Io：**  
Hmm?  
Oookay...  
Nngh! Huh?  
This veggie... It's so hard, I can't cut through it.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll cut it for you.  
`Tag 2`  
**Io：**  
No, no, no.  
Right now, I'm supposed to be showing you how to cook instead.  
  
**Io：**  
Nnnngh!  
...Oh, it's just no use.  
  
**Io：**  
I really can't seem to cut this,  
so I guess I'll need your help just this one time.  
Here, take the knife. Be careful, okay?  
  
**Io：**  
Wow, oh gosh!  
I know I told you to just sit earlier, but I guess I do need your help after all.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Leave it to me!  
`Tag 3`  
**Io：**  
Hehe,  
I'm glad you said that.  
Just as I thought, you're really reliable.  
  
**Io：**  
All right, you're in charge of this knife.  
Here, take this.  
Next, please cut the fruits for the garnishes.  
  
**Io：**  
Oh no!  
You squirted me with the juice! I'm soaking wet from head to toe!  
  
**Io：**  
You got it all over yourself too.  
We can't have you getting sick, so let me wipe it off for you.  
Come over here. Just like that... *wipe, wipe*  
  
**Io：**  
All right, next, help wipe my body.  
Hey, come on. Hurry up, okay?  
If you don't, I'm going to catch a cold.  
And also, the juice is getting all sticky... It's really uncomfortable.  
  
**Io：**  
Ahhh!  
That tickles!  
Hahaha...  
Can you... please just do it properly?  
  
**Io：**  
Hey! I'm still in the middle of cooking, you know?  
Now we really seem like a couple fooling around...  
  
**Io：**  
Thank you—it's all good!  
I'm all cleaned up now!  
Okay, let's get back to cooking!  
  
**Io：**  
And we're done!  
It's all thanks to you. You've been so helpful.  
  
**Io：**  
The teacher's performance will be important in the real session too.  
If you don't mind, can you help on the day of as well?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Of course!  
`Tag 4`  
**Io：**  
Yay! Thanks!  
Oh, if only we could always cook together like this, every day would be so much fun.  
  
**Io：**  
Ah!  
Um, never mind!  
Okay then, I'll see you on Parents' Day!  
  
**Io：**  
All right, everyone, are you all seated?  
  
**Students：**  
Yes!  
  
**Io：**  
Okay, let's start cooking.  
After you finish, we'll share your tasty treats with your parents.  
So good luck, and pour your hearts into them.  
  
**Io：**  
First, we'll prepare some as an example for you, so watch carefully.  
All right, {player}, let's start with cutting the vegetables.  
  
**Io：**  
Everyone, are you watching closely?  
You'll have to cut like him.  
  
**Students：**  
Okayyy!  
  
**Io：**  
Hehe, they're so focused on following your example.  
Well, as a teacher, I need to show them my skills as well... Here goes!  
  
**Io：**  
Ahhhh!  
My eyes are tearing up! Silly onions!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'll wipe them for you.  
`Tag 5`  
**Io：**  
Ohh, thank you.  
  
**Io：**  
Hmm? Your eyes are bright red too.  
Let me wipe yours.  
  
**Female Student：**  
Iooo, question!  
When you said you'd be setting an example, you didn't mean about cooking, but being a married couple, right?  
  
**Io：**  
Huh?  
  
**Female Student：**  
Well, you two  
look just like my dad and my mom cooking at home.  
  
**Female Student's Mother：**  
Oh my! Please excuse my child!  
  
**Female Student's Father：**  
Hey, no more allowance for you if you keep saying strange things like that.  
  
**Io：**  
No, we're not like that!  
  
**Female Student：**  
But it looks like it!  
You're just like my parents!  
  
**Io：**  
Well, just say we're like a regular couple instead!  
  
**Io：**  
Wait, that isn't right either!  
You should stop laughing and say something too, {player}!  
  
**Narration：**  
While being bombarded with questions regarding their relationship,  
they all finished eating the dishes, and Parents' Day was finally over.  
  
**Narration：**  
Days later, their school principal gave them a lecture about going over the budget.
