# Io Episode 7
Io, lover of all things romantic, lets it slip that she hopes her first boyfriend will be like {player}. Flustered with herself, she tries to walk it back by reminding him, as well as herself, that they're student and teacher.
  
## Subtitle: If You Were My First
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is studying once again,  
under Io's watchful eye.  
  
**Io：**  
Hee hee. You've picked up a lot lately.  
Let's keep up the pace and continue learning together, okay?  
  
**Io：**  
What do you want to work on today?  
  
**Schoolboy：**  
Miss Io!  
  
**Io：**  
Oh, one of our friends from class.  
 Is everything going well?  
Was there something in the last lesson  
you had a question about?  
  
**Schoolboy：**  
Umm, actually I wanted to ask about something else.  
You and him have been hanging out a lot lately, haven't you?  
  
**Io：**  
{player}?  
You've seen us, then...  
For some reason, I feel a little embarrassed now.  
  
**Schoolboy：**  
So, umm, are you two dating?  
  
**Io：**  
Bwhuh?  
Me and {player}? Dating?!  
  
**Io：**  
N-no, no, no!  
It's not like that! Not one bit!  
  
**Io：**  
I'm just tutoring him.  
We're teacher and student, nothing more!  
Yes, that's right. That's the extent of our relationship.  
Got it?!  
  
**Schoolboy：**  
Y-yes, ma'am.  
I'm sorry, ma'am.  
  
**Io：**  
Whew. That caught me off guard.  
How could anyone mistake us for a couple?  
  
**Io：**  
I know we pretended to be one the other day, but I guess even  
sitting here tutoring you could look like it's something more  
from another point of view.  
  
**Io：**  
Oh, I'm sorry!  
I rejected the idea pretty harshly, didn't I?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That really hurt.  
**Choice: (2)**  It's the truth.  
`Tag 1`  
**Io：**  
Oh, please don't say that.  
We don't have that kind of relationship...

`Tag 2`  
**Io：**  
R-right.  
We're... just friends.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Io：**  
When he thought you and I were boyfriend and girlfriend, I...  
  
**Io：**  
Well, never mind.  
It's nothing.  
  
**Io：**  
*sigh* A boyfriend...  
I've never actually dated someone before.  
  
**Io：**  
Going out on dates, spending time together  
with just the two of us...  
How romantic.  
  
**Io：**  
I can't help but wonder sometimes what kind of person  
my first boyfriend will be.  
  
**Io：**  
I'd love for him to be just like you.  
Someone who's kind, who I always have fun with!  
  
**Io：**  
*gasp*  
Oh, geez, what am I saying?  
  
**Io：**  
The thought just popped into my head.  
Don't read too much into that!  
  
**Io：**  
Argh,  
why can't I stop blabbering?  
This is mortifying!  
  
**Io：**  
Listen, {player}.  
You're my student and I'm your teacher.  
Now, open that book—we've still got material to cover!  
  
**Io：**  
Until your education's complete and you can learn on your own,  
I'll be here to teach you with every fiber of my being!  
So let's buckle down and do our best together!
