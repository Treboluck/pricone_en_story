**Narration：**  
One day at Lucent Academy,  
{player} stays behind with Io for some after-school lessons.  
  
**Io：**  
Mhm, yup.  
  
**Io：**  
Yes, just like that.  
All right, to solve the next question...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  But this is a quiz, right?  
`Tag 1`  
**Io：**  
Oh no!  
That's right, you were supposed to solve it by yourself.  
  
**Io：**  
And the calculation for this is...  
Ah.  
  
**Io：**  
Darn!  
You're working so hard, but I can't even teach you at all.  
  
**Io：**  
Huh? This light, I've seen it several times...  
Ahhhh!!  
  

---  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I can't find it...  
`Tag 2`  
**Io：**  
Wh-who's there?!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  It's me, {player}.  
**Choice: (4)**  I'm not anyone suspicious.  
`Tag 3`  
`Tag 4`  
**Io：**  
Ah! {player}!  
  
**Io：**  
Why are you in school at this time...  
Ah, for the homework you forgot?  
It's good you're trying to do your homework, but don't forget it at school.  
  
**Io：**  
You still can't find it?  
Shall I look together with you?  
  
**Io：**  
All right...  
Eeek!

**Io：**  
Ouch...  
  
**Io：**  
I fell!  
I couldn't see the chairs because it's so dark.  
  
**Io：**  
Y-yes. I'm okay.  
I made such a big mess, but it doesn't hurt as much as it looks.  
  
**Io：**  
I stayed behind to grade the tests till late,  
then went to patrol around the school...  
  
**Io：**  
Can't believe I made a mess in the classroom.  
And I still have so many other places to check, too!

**Io：**  
Oh, you found your homework?  
That's great!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I guess I'll get going.  
`Tag 5`  
**Io：**  
...  
  
**Io：**  
Tell you what, I'll go with you.  
After all, I'm sure you'd be scared in the dark.  
  
**Io：**  
...You'll be fine? Walking around the school in the dark alone?  
Are you sure about that?  
  
**Io：**  
Okay... well, if you say so...  
  
**Io：**  
Ahhhh...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Are you scared of the dark by any chance?  
`Tag 6`  
**Io：**  
...I don't do well with darkness...  
Even though I'm a teacher...  
Wait, how does that change anything?!  
  
**Io：**  
I usually do it by myself, you know!  
I'm an adult. Seriously!  
  
**Io：**  
But since you're here today, maybe...  
  
**Io：**  
Please, can you come patrol with me?  
After all, I helped you look for your homework, right?  
  
**Io：**  
Since the school is so big, it's going to take a long time to patrol,  
but I feel reassured having you with me.  
  
**Io：**  
Walking around the school together at night  
feels like we're on an adventure. It's exciting!  
  
**Io：**  
When I saw a shadow in the classroom earlier,  
my heart totally stopped, you know?  
I thought it was an intruder!  
  
**Io：**  
But since I'm a teacher, I just had to call out,  
and I was so relieved it was you!  
  
**Io：**  
Now that I'm with you, even if there's an intruder, I won't be scared!  
  
**Io：**  
...Ah!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  You found an intruder?  
`Tag 7`  
**Io：**  
No!  
Look, it's a full moon tonight.  
  
**Io：**  
Oh, I know!  
Can you stick around a little longer to patrol with me?  
  
**Io：**  
Sorry, this will be the last place to patrol.  
Well, all that's left to check is the key to the rooftop...  
  
**Io：**  
There's a girls' manga that I like,  
where they drink tea while viewing the full moon on the rooftop.  
  
**Io：**  
That's why I also wanted to come to the rooftop,  
and do the same on a night with a full moon.  
  
**Io：**  
You see...  
usually, I'd go home right away once it gets dark,  
but since you're with me today, I finally get to come here for the first time.  
  
**Io：**  
This is even more romantic than I imagined!  
If high school students were to gather up here,  
I'm sure they'd all be falling in love!  
  
**Io：**  
Imagine them ditching cram school and gathering on the rooftop after class.  
They'd study together under the moonlight in the dark...  
  
**Io：**  
And then, and then!  
They'd look into each other's eyes,  
like this...  
  
**Io：**  
Ahhhh!  
This is what I've always been dreaming about since I was in girls' school,  
so I got carried away!  
  
**Io：**  
To be alone with a boy, and do something like this from a girls' manga,  
I feel like one of my wishes came true!  
  
**Io：**  
Teachers are supposed to help their students' dreams come true,  
but it seems like you made mine come true instead.  
  
**Io：**  
But I... I want to grant your wish too.  
I'll do anything within my power, so let me know anytime, okay?  
  
**Io：**  
Well, since I'm still a new teacher, I'm not sure how much I can do...  
Meanwhile, you're so reliable  
even though you're only a high school student.  
  
**Io：**  
I'm so, so glad that I started working at this school,  
because it allowed me to meet you.  
  
**Io：**  
...In the manga that I like,  
there's a fairy that makes the heroine's wish come true,  
so to me,  
maybe you're that fairy.  
  
**Io：**  
If you could keep granting my wishes...  
the dreams I always wanted to achieve...  
I think I'd like that an awful lot.  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hello, and welcome back!  
  
**Ameth：**  
You being called a fairy like that is kinda funny.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well,  
even though you helped grant her wish from her school days,  
she's still too oblivious toward her own feelings, isn't she?  
  
**Ameth：**  
The relationship between teacher and student...  
Is it really that difficult to overcome?  
To do so, you'll need to show more of your reliable side to her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Take good are of Io, Mr. Fairy.  
  

---  
  
**Io：**  
Mm, mm...  
Uwah...  
  
**Io：**  
Huh? When... did I fall asleep...  
  
**Io：**  
...You too?  
Did we fall asleep together and have the same dream again?  
  
**Io：**  
It's so weird how it keeps happening.  
But I was hoping to have another dream with you,  
so it's nice.  
  
**Io：**  
Wait!  
We're in the middle of a quiz.  
Shouldn't you be focusing?  
  
**Io：**  
Oh my, you already finished all the questions?  
Let me see...  
  
**Io：**  
...Good!  
Perfect! That's amazing!  
As a special reward, I'll give you a huge A+!  
  
**Io：**  
When I first met you, you weren't even able to read or write...  
I hope you'll keep it up  
and learn many other things from now on.  
  
**Io：**  
...As for me, I need to become an even better teacher!  
I can't lose to you.  
I'll be even stricter than before, so be prepared!  
  
**Narration：**  
Days later, Io's lessons suddenly became harder,  
and the whole class went into a panic mode.
