Oh, thank goodness.

Umm, as you can see,

**???：**  
Whew. What a relief.  
I can finally move again.  
  
**???：**  
I promise I tried my best to get out on my own,  
but every  
time I moved, the vines just crawled all over my body and  
wrapped me up even tighter.  
  
**???：**  
If you hadn't shown up, I might never have gotten loose.  
  
**???：**  
My name is Io.  
What's yours?  
  
**Io：**  
{player},  
thank you again.  
You're my hero!  
  
**Io：**  
There are all sorts of monsters around here,  
so frankly, you saved my life!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  S-so soft...  
`Tag 5`  
**Io：**  
Huh? What's soft? Oh, my chest?!  
  
**Io：**  
Ahh! Sorry for hugging you like that without asking.  
I didn't squeeze too tight, did I?  
  
**Io：**  
Anyways, again, thanks a million!  
  
**Io：**  
I'll be more careful not to let any monsters get the drop  
on me.  
I don't want to trouble you again.  
  
**Io：**  
I have to get going now.  
Bye bye!  
  
**Monster：**  
GROOOAAARGHHH!  
  
**Io：**  
Eeek!  
Another plant monster?!
