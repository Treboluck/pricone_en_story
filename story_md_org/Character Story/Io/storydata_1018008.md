**Narration：**  
{player} and Io are out shopping.  
  
**Io：**  
Hee hee. I'm happy you were able to come with me to run  
errands. It kind of feels like a little date.  
  
**Io：**  
Huh? Hey, isn't this the light from last time?  
Ahh, it's so bright!  
  
**Io：**  
Aieee!

**Io：**  
Oh, {player},  
you're awake?  
Thank goodness.  
  
**Io：**  
Do you remember what happened?  
You and your friends were horsing around,  
and you fell down a flight of stairs.  
  
**Io：**  
I've been so worried. I was afraid you might not open your  
eyes again.  
  
**Io：**  
No, don't try to get up!  
You have to lie down.  
  
**Io：**  
B-besides, when you shift around like that, it tickles.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Am I... lying on your lap?  
`Tag 1`  
**Io：**  
Yes. You were sleeping very restlessly, though.  
Is this uncomfortable?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm in heaven.  
**Choice: (3)**  I could lie here forever.  
`Tag 2`  
**Io：**  
What? No, no!  
Don't go into the light, or your eyes will stay closed forever!  
  
**Io：**  
Huh? You didn't mean it literally?  
So you're comfortable, then.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Io：**  
Hee hee. That's good.  
I'm glad you think I'm comfy.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Io：**  
All right, we'll stay like this a little longer.  
Just until you've settled down.  
  
**Io：**  
You don't have to be tense. No one else is here.  
Lie down, relax, and let me take care of everything.  
  
**Io：**  
Oh! Your finger's bleeding.  
You must've scraped it when you fell.  
  
**Io：**  
Let me see it.  
A scratch like this usually just needs a little lick.  
  
**Io：**  
*lick*  
  
**Io：**  
Mm-hmm. That should do it.  
Uh-oh. {player}, are you still hurting?  
Your face is beet red.

**Schoolboy 1：**  
We come to check up on you,  
and this is what we find?  
  
**Schoolboy 2：**  
Not only are you lying in Miss Io's lap,  
she's sucking on your finger?!  
  
**Schoolboy 1：**  
You dirty dog. I sentence you to death!  
Get him, guys!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Run for it.  
`Tag 5`  
**Io：**  
Oh, {player}?  
Where are you going?!  
  
**Schoolboy 2：**  
After him!  
Don't let him get away!  
  
**Io：**  
Ha ha ha. Well, this is a relief.  
If he's got the energy to run around with his friends,  
he must be fine now.

**Ameth：**  
Well, what'd you think of my present?  
Did you enjoy your dream?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I crafted that dream based off Io's and your memories,  
but who'd have guessed you'd play it like that?  
I had a lot of fun watching how things unfolded.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway, that's it for now!

**Io：**  
{player}, are you awake?  
  
**Io：**  
No, I just woke up a second ago myself.  
I had a weird dream again.  
What about you?  
  
**Io：**  
You dreamed I was nursing you back to health?  
Then they were the same again. No matter how many times  
this happens, it still feels otherworldly, doesn't it?  
  
**Io：**  
Come to think of it, we were going out to buy supplies for the  
Lucent Academy nurse's office, weren't we?  
Maybe that's why  
we had that dream.  
Let's hurry over to the store.  
  
**Io：**  
And {player}?  
Be careful. Don't fall and get hurt like you did in our dream.  
  
**Narration：**  
As she returned to running errands with  
{player}, Io secretly hoped they'd have  
identical dreams again soon.
