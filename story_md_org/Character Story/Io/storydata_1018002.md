# Io Episode 2
After learning about {player}'s memory loss, Io offers to be his teacher. But she becomes so engrossed in her work that her habit of leaning in extra close while teaching causes them both to lose their focus.
  
## Subtitle: Class Is in Session
  
**Narration：**  
Io finds {player} reading a book in the plaza,  
and comes to talk to him.  
  
**Io：**  
Oh, hi {player}!  
What a coincidence.  
What're you up to?  
  
**Io：**  
Studying? Oh, you're reading a textbook.  
Good for you, studying in your free time.  
  
**Io：**  
Huh? Wait, this book only covers the most basic basics.  
At your age, this should be way below your level.  
  
**Io：**  
Huh? Amnesia?! You lost all memory of everything you  
ever learned, and you had to start over from scratch?!  
  
**Io：**  
Oh, wow.  
I had no idea.  
  
**Io：**  
I know! If you're okay with it, I could probably tutor you.  
What do you think?  
  
**Io：**  
Believe it or not, I'm a fully licensed schoolteacher!  
Do you want to join my class and be one of my students?  
  
**Io：**  
I haven't forgotten how you saved me. I'd love to be able to  
repay you somehow. How about it?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That would be great.  
`Tag 1`  
**Io：**  
All right!  
Follow me.  
  
**Io：**  
Come on in! This is the school where I work,  
Lucent Academy.  
  
**Io：**  
Since it's Sunday, it's empty right now, but normally we've got  
lots of students of all different ages and races here  
working hard on their assignments! ♪  
  
**Io：**  
So even with your amnesia, you'll fit right in with the  
rest of our student body.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Should I call you Miss Io?  
`Tag 2`  
**Io：**  
Err, being addressed so formally still makes me feel  
a little funny.  
I'm still brand-new as a teacher, you see.  
  
**Io：**  
Just call me Io, okay?  
  
**Io：**  
Now, let's get started with our first lesson.  
  
**Io：**  
I'm primarily a language arts teacher, but I can tutor  
you on the basics for your other subjects.  
  
**Io：**  
I guess the first step should be to gauge where you're at.  
What subject should we start with?  
  
**Io：**  
Is there anything in particular you want to prioritize,  
{player}? What were you  
reading when I ran into you earlier?

**Io：**  
Oh, perfect—a grammar textbook.  
Was there anything you didn't understand?  
  
**Io：**  
This comprehension question? \"Describe what the character is  
feeling.\"  
All right. Read this passage very carefully.  
Now, what would you say if you were that character?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  When you're that close, it makes my heart race.  
**Choice: (4)**  I can't concentrate.  
`Tag 3`  
**Io：**  
Yes, excellent! Well done.  
Hmm? You were talking to me?

**Io：**  
Oh, I'm sorry! I was leaning on you too hard, wasn't I?  
Sorry, I just get so focused when I'm educating.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Io：**  
Huh? Why?  
I'm too close?

`image display end`  
**Io：**  
Whoops! How long have I been nestled up to you like that?  
Of course you can't concentrate like this.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Io：**  
I'll try to watch what I'm doing.  
  
**Io：**  
Now, on to the next question.  
Can you answer this one for me?

![101800201.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/101800201.webp)  
**Io：**  
Yup, yup. Keep going.  
  
**Io：**  
Oh, that's not quite right.  
But watch, if you change this to...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  ...Too close.  
`Tag 6`  
**Io：**  
Oops! I'm sorry, {player}!  
*sigh* I keep letting myself get too comfortable around you.  
I need to stay in teacher mode.  
  
**Io：**  
Now for this one, if you turn your book to page...  
  
**Io：**  
Ack! I'm right in your face again!  
Argh, what is wrong with me?

**Narration：**  
Io's habit of snuggling up while tutoring  
made it impossible for {player} to focus on his education.
