# Emilia Episode 3
When Kokkoro gets sick from overwork, Emilia takes it upon herself to look after her. Utterly soothed by her earnest, motherly efforts, Kokkoro falls fast asleep on Emilia's lap, and Emilia's heart is warmed by the thought that {player} and Kokkoro are like younger siblings to her.
  
## Subtitle: Like a Little Sister
  
**Narration：**  
One morning, the birds are singing happily outside.  
{player} lazily rubs his eyes and sits up in bed.  
  
**{player}：**  
...  
  
**{player}：**  
...?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Where's Kokkoro? She always wakes me up...  
`Tag 1`  
**Choice: (2)**  Kokkoro~?  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah... my lord...  
A good morning to you.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I really must apologize for failing to awaken you...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Somehow I feel terribly woozy this morning...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Careful!  
`Tag 3`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah... Thank you very much, my lord...  
You prevented me from collapsing on the floor...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh?  
Good morning, you two. Is something up?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Huh? Kokkoro isn't feeling well?  
How awful! Let me take a look at her!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh, wow. She really is sick.  
She has a fever, and her body's aching...  
 Mm.  
  
**Emilia：**  
The Mana in her body still seems OK.  
I think she must have built up too much exhaustion.  
  
**Emilia：**  
She always does work ever so hard, after all.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Now, now!  
I know you're worried, but panicking isn't going to help anyone.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Try to stay calm,  
and see if you can find me some fever medicine.  
  
**Emilia：**  
With all these children here,  
I'm sure the Orphanage has a supply somewhere.  
  
**Emilia：**  
While you do that, I'll carry Kokkoro over to her room.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Up we go!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Y-you must not, Miss Emilia...  
I cannot bear to make you burden yourself...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh, no. I won't hear it.  
Silly girls who work till they drop  
don't get to push themselves any harder.  
  
**Emilia：**  
You need some proper rest, and once you're all better,  
maybe I'll let you work again.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh... My lord...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Sleep tight, Kokkoro.  
`Tag 4`  
**Emilia：**  
Yes, very well done.  
Now then, hold on tight to me, OK?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, Miss Emilia...  
I am terribly sorry to trouble you...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Friends help friends in trouble.  
**Choice: (6)**  It's no trouble at all.  
`Tag 5`  
**Emilia：**  
Mm, that's right. Very well said.  
Don't you worry either, Kokkoro.  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Emilia：**  
Yes, that's right.  
It's no trouble to help someone you care about.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Thank you... very much.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Mm, you're very welcome!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh, did you find the medicine?  
Wait, why are you covered in bruises?!  
  
**Emilia：**  
While you were searching, lots of things fell off the shelf?  
  
**Emilia：**  
But you made sure to protect the medicine...?  
You really do turn everything into an adventure...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Mm-hm, thank you.  
Now then, we just have to get her to drink this.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Let's see...  
Mm, Kokkoro, can you lift your head for me a little?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My head, you say?  
Of course...  
 But then what...?  
  
**Emilia：**  
We do this.  
...Up you go, now!

**Kokkoro：**  
Ah... ehm... Miss Emilia? Is this...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Yes, it's my lap.  
See? It's much easier to feed you the medicine now.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Now, say \"ah\"!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A-ahhh...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Mm, well done.  
Next, try to swallow. Ready, go!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Mmlgh... *gulp*  
I have swallowed it...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Excellent work!  
Well then, now you just need to rest.  
  
**Emilia：**  
A little sleep, and you'll be better in no time.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes... Thank you... very mu... ch...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Zzz... Zzz...  
  
**Emilia：**  
I knew it. You really were exhausted.  
Just look how fast you fell asleep...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Thanks for your help, too.  
I'm sure Kokkoro will be better before you know it.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Ah! Now, now! Don't do that.  
I know you're happy, but you can't jump around while she's sleeping!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Honestly, really....  
Still, I can understand exactly how you feel.  
  
**Emilia：**  
You and Kokkoro are family, aren't you?  
It's totally natural to get happy or worried about family.  
  
**Emilia：**  
We talked about family once before, didn't we?  
I'm... actually a little jealous of you and Kokkoro.  
  
**Emilia：**  
I mean, I have Puck, so it's not like I'm lonely.  
But I never had anyone like a brother or sister.  
  
**Emilia：**  
So, sometimes I do kind of wonder  
what it would be like to have siblings.  
  
**Emilia：**  
If I had a big brother or sister,  
or maybe sweet younger siblings, how would that feel?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...ster...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh... Is she talking in her sleep?  
Kokkoro, what did you say just now?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Big Sister...

**Emilia：**  
Ah...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  We're all family here, you know.  
`Tag 8`  
**Emilia：**  
All family...?  
You mean everyone here at the Sarendia Orphanage?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Are you... even including us in that?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Everyone here is family...  
Eheh, I see. Family, huh.  
  
**Emilia：**  
What a shock. All my dreams just came true at once!  
  
**Emilia：**  
This means not just Kokkoro,  
but Suzume, Ayane and little Kurumi too...  
All the children are my little brothers and sisters, right?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Miss Saren... is younger than me too,  
but she seems much more like a big sister somehow...  
  
**Emilia：**  
But that's a lovely thought too!  
And I even have a sweet little brother like you!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  I'm... not a big brother?  
`Tag 9`  
**Emilia：**  
Hee hee. Sorry, but no.  
After all, look how you were panicking about Kokkoro just now!  
  
**Emilia：**  
After seeing that,  
I can't imagine you as a big brother at all.  
  
**Emilia：**  
So, you get to be my cute little brother instead.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Don't forget, you can always come to me for help with anything!

**Kokkoro：**  
Mmn... mnhhh...  
  
**Emilia：**  
There, there. You little sweetheart.  
Have a good rest, and come back to us feeling much better.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Until then, enjoy your peaceful dreams...  
  
**Narration：**  
And the Sarendia Orphanage was filled with a warm stillness.
