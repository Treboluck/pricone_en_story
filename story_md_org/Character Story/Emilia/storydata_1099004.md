**Narration：**  
Another night draws to a close, and morning arrives.  
At this point, it's difficult for our visitors to recall  
exactly how many mornings they've awoken in this world.  
  
**Emilia：**  
...Mm... Morning already?  
  
**Emilia：**  
*yawn*...  
Must be time to get out of bed...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Mmnhhh...  
  
**???：**  
Lia~!  
Is going back to sleep the best use of your time~?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Wahhh!  
Oh, Puck...  
 Mm, good morning.  
  
**Puck：**  
Mm-hm! Morning, Lia.  
Here, look outside! The weather's great today.  
  
**Puck：**  
A perfect day for lazing around!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Ohhh, don't be such a naughty tease.  
I'll get up now, wash my face, and then...  
  
**Emilia：**  
And then...  
  
**Emilia：**  
...  
  
**Puck：**  
Hm?  
Lia, is something wrong?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Hey, Puck.  
Is it just me, or have I been super useless lately?  
  
**Puck：**  
What's this out of the blue?  
You're cute, so don't worry.  
After all, cute is justice! Who would blame you for anything?  
  
**Emilia：**  
I wasn't asking for silly reasoning!  
No, I mean... It's like I've been letting everyone take care of me.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Since we arrived at this orphanage,  
I've just been going on walks or playing with the kids.  
I have tried to learn a little about this world...  
  
**Emilia：**  
But even that's just because I was curious.  
I haven't been able to help anyone else at all!  
  
**Puck：**  
Hmm, you think?  
But look, didn't you take those used plates to the kitchen?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Even Ayane and Kurumi do that much!  
  
**Emilia：**  
I don't mean like that.  
I want to really help the others out, like Ram and Rem.  
  
**Emilia：**  
...No, that's not it either.  
Listen, since we got here, everyone's helped us so much, haven't they?  
  
**Emilia：**  
So, I just want to repay them somehow.  
After all, who knows when we'll end up going home...  
  
**Puck：**  
I see, I see. Repaying favors, huh.  
You've always been a dutiful girl, so I get that.  
  
**Emilia：**  
What do you think?  
Will I just end up being a nuisance?  
  
**Puck：**  
Honestly, I doubt that.  
With a little luck, they'll appreciate how you feel.  
  
**Puck：**  
I'll be cheering you on with a mewly-meow!  
Lia, you go get 'em!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Yes! I'll do my best!  
You just wait and see!  
  
**Emilia：**  
All right! Time to get thinking  
and work out what I can do for everyone!  
  
**Puck：**  
...  
  
**Puck：**  
Hmm... Repaying everyone, huh?  
Here's hoping she doesn't do anything too weird.  
  
**Puck：**  
Being a dad is tough at times like this!  
  
**Emilia：**  
So... I told Puck I'd come up with something, but...  
  
**Emilia：**  
What actually is there that I can do?  
It's never easy to find the right answer to these things...  
  
**Emilia：**  
I could try helping out  
with everyone's work around the orphanage...  
  
**Emilia：**  
No, no.  
Ram and Rem are already taking care of that.  
  
**Emilia：**  
I doubt I'd have any chance  
of doing the housework better than Ram and Rem...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh—manual labor, then?!  
...No, Rem can handle that by herself, too.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Urgh...  
Maybe I really am just a useless girl...  
  
**Emilia：**  
There's mabeasts... I mean, monsters?  
If there are jobs fighting those, I'd probably be good at them.  
  
**Emilia：**  
But fighting monsters elsewhere  
wouldn't really help me repay the people here...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Hmm... Ahhh...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Why all the worried noises?  
`Tag 1`  
**Emilia：**  
{player}...  
Actually, I'm trying to work out a tricky little issue right now.  
  
**Emilia：**  
If you wouldn't mind, could I ask you for advice?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Really?  
 Thank you, that's so kind!  
  
**Emilia：**  
The thing is, I want to do something to repay everyone.  
  
**Emilia：**  
You see, it's been a while since we all arrived here, hasn't it?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Everyone here at the Sarendia Orphanage...  
The Gourmet Guild's members...  
Even the ordinary townsfolk have done so much for us.  
  
**Emilia：**  
So I'd like to thank them all somehow,  
but I'm not sure how exactly I'd be able to do that.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Nothing's coming to mind,  
so I'm stuck in a bit of a rut right now.  
  
**Emilia：**  
I haven't done anything like this before,  
so I just can't think of a single thing. I really am useless.  
  
**Emilia：**  
If only I had some way to make all those people happy...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  What things have made you happy before?  
`Tag 2`  
**Emilia：**  
Huh? My own happy memories?  
I could try doing the same things, you mean?  
  
**Emilia：**  
I see... I didn't think of it like that.  
What have other people done that made me happy...?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Something the people here don't know,  
so they'd be delighted if I taught them...  
  
**Emilia：**  
...Oh!  
I think I might actually have an idea!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Hey, {player}.  
Could you give me a hand setting this up?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Of course!  
`Tag 3`  
**Emilia：**  
Hee hee. Thank you.  
Well then, first we'll need plenty of potatoes!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Then once it's all ready,  
I'll need you to help me gather everyone!  
  
**Narration：**  
A little while later...  
  
**Ram：**  
This was all very sudden.  
What exactly is Miss Emilia planning, I wonder?  
  
**Rem：**  
I have no idea, either.  
But it looks like a large crowd has gathered from around the city.  
  
**Ram：**  
All these people...  
How did our shy Miss Emilia  
meet so many of them in such a brief time?  
  
**Rem：**  
Recently, Miss Emilia has been taking many walks in the city.  
I imagine that must be when she met them all.  
  
**Ram：**  
Ah, with {player}.  
I do remember seeing them together.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ah! There you are!  
I finally found the two of you!  
  
**Ram：**  
Why, if it isn't Karyl.  
  
**Rem：**  
Miss Pecorine and Miss Kokkoro seem to be with her, too.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heyas~! ☆  
Long time no see, Ram and Rem!  
  
**Rem：**  
Yes, it's good to see you.  
What brings the two of you here today?  
  
**Karyl：**  
What do you think?  
Your pampered little princess invited us.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It was a pretty sudden thing,  
but since I was with these two, I got dragged along...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You're so silly, Karyl!  
Why do you always complain when you're embarrassed?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Actually, my lord is involved in this event.  
I also took the liberty of helping out a little.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So, I felt I had a duty to ensure that Miss Karyl attended.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I've gotta say, there sure are lots of people here!  
Did Emilia really invite everyone in this whole crowd?  
  
**Ram：**  
So it seems.  
What in the world is Miss Emilia planning...?  
  
**Rem：**  
Dear sister, I think it's about to begin.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh, there are so many...!  
They really did all come here for me!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Hm? Aren't I scared?  
I am a little nervous, but more than that, I'm excited.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Thank you for your help, {player}.  
Okay, here goes. Let's get started!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Um...  
 Everyone, thank you for coming!  
I called you here to say thank you for all your help.  
  
**Emilia：**  
I've been treated with nothing but kindness since I arrived in this city.  
  
**Emilia：**  
So with the help of {player} here,  
I thought of a way to repay you all.  
  
**Emilia：**  
And what {player} said  
was that I should try thinking back  
to things that made me happy before I arrived here.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ohhh? Guess the kid does have a few brain cells.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, my noble lord.  
Your words of wisdom bring me nothing but pride.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hmmm, things from her old world?  
I would be pretty interested to hear about that!  
  
**Ram：**  
...  
  
**Rem：**  
Dear sister? Is something wrong?  
Personally, I agree that Miss Emilia's idea is a splendid one.  
  
**Ram：**  
Yes, it is. I certainly can't deny that.  
  
**Ram：**  
It's just... well.  
I suddenly had a nasty premonition.  
  
**Ram：**  
A feeling that Miss Emilia might follow Barusu's bad example...  
  
**Emilia：**  
So, I want to help everyone have a wonderful time!  
And to do that, I'd like to teach you all...  
  
**Emilia：**  
...the ways of the Radio Exercises!  
  
**Karyl：**  
R... \"Radio Exercises\"...?  
  
**Ram：**  
...I knew it.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Radio Exercises  
are a kind of dance that everyone can enjoy together!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Everyone, watch closely and follow me!  
  
**Emilia：**  
One, two, three, four!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  One, two, three, four!  
`Tag 4`  
**Ayane：**  
Whoa! She started dancing!  
What's she doing?  
 It looks funny!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
H-hold on, Ayane...  
U-ummm... One, two...?  
  
**Ayane：**  
Three, four!  
  
**Karyl：**  
D-dancing?!  
Y-you can't just start these things out of nowhere...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? Is something the matter, Karyl?  
Are you not good at dancing, or something?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Is that the case, Miss Karyl?  
If you are unsure, perhaps you should take a step aside...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, good call. That would be safer!  
Why don't you just stand over there and watch?  
  
**Karyl：**  
I-I didn't say I can't do it!  
Obviously it's no problem for me!  
  
**Karyl：**  
See, how's this?!  
One, two, three, four!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh, you're really getting into this, Karyl! ♪  
I knew you could do it! I'd better work hard to keep up! ♪  
  
**Pecorine & Kokkoro：**  
One, two, three, four!  
  
**Rem：**  
Look, dear sister!  
Everyone is enjoying the radio exercises together!  
  
**Ram：**  
...Yes, it looks like they are.  
  
**Rem：**  
All these people doing Subaru's radio exercises...  
It would be no exaggeration to call this a grand victory for Subaru!  
  
**Ram：**  
...That is an exaggeration.  
  
**Ram：**  
But even so... *sigh*  
Regardless of who's teaching it,  
why does everyone always love this strange dance?  
  
**Ram：**  
I'll never understand it.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Your plan made everyone happy!  
`Tag 5`  
**Emilia：**  
Yes, you're right!  
Well then, everyone! To finish, raise both arms high and say...

**Emilia：**  
\"Victory!\"  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? Say what...?  
Wait, do we have to do that too?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Sure looks like it!  
 Ready, and...  
  
**All：**  
Victory~!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Waahh... B-Big Sis Suzume...?!

**Emilia：**  
Thank you for coming, everyone.  
I hope this helped to express a little of my gratitude to you all.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Also, I have one final gift.  
It's a special way to celebrate the Radio Exercises.  
  
**Ayane：**  
Ohh! Are those potato stamps?  
Awesome! They're carved with pictures!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You're right...  
Potatoes with pictures on them...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I helped craft them also. Together with Miss Emilia,  
I believe we created something to be proud of.  
  
**Emilia：**  
That's right!  
Kokkoro and I made them as a team!  
  
**Ayane：**  
A team...  
Um, but  
 what actually is this?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Eheh. Can't you tell?  
As you can see, it's a cute picture of Puck's face!  
  
**Ayane：**  
\"Puck\"...  
 You mean, that kitty?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
This is supposed to be that cat?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Yes! Isn't it just a perfect likeness?  
  
**Kurumi & Ayane：**  
A... ahahah...  
  
**Emilia：**  
...?  
I'm not sure I understand,  
 but I'm glad you seem happy!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  What a smashing success.  
`Tag 6`  
**Emilia：**  
Oh, {player}!  
We couldn't have made all of these without you, either!  
  
**Emilia：**  
You kindly ate all the potatoes where we messed up, right?  
  
**Emilia：**  
You ended up full to bursting,  
but you still did the radio exercises!  
I was so happy to see that!  
  
**Emilia：**  
\"Family doesn't let family down\"?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Mm, you really are such a very good boy.  
So this is a token of my heartfelt thanks!  
  
**Emilia：**  
It's supposed to be one each,  
but as a treat, I'll give you two potato stamps!  
  
**Emilia：**  
...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Thank you so much for all your help.  
I really don't know what I would have done without you!  
  
**Emilia：**  
I was worried to begin with,  
but now I'm so, so happy that we did this.  
  
**Emilia：**  
I don't just mean the radio exercises.  
From the very start, you've done ever so much to help me.  
  
**Emilia：**  
At the start, when I didn't know this world at all,  
I was so nervous, even with Puck, Ram and Rem by my side.  
  
**Emilia：**  
But thanks to everyone's help, I was totally OK!  
It's all because you were here for us.  
  
**Emilia：**  
I'm just so glad we were able to meet you here.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Next time, I hope you'll come and visit us in our world.  
  
**Emilia：**  
When you do,  
let's get everyone together and do radio exercises again!  
  
**Emilia：**  
It's a promise, OK? ♪
