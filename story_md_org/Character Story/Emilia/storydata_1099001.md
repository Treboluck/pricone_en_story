**Narration：**  
One afternoon in Landosol, a certain silver-haired girl  
is standing in the street and glancing around nervously.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Umm, I took a right turn here, so...  
Huh? This... isn't where I ended up last time?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Then if I retrace my steps...  
Wait! Which way did I come from just now?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Ohhh... which way was it?  
I'm right-handed, so... I would probably have turned right...  
  
**Emilia：**  
But without actually asking myself,  
I can't feel all that sure about it...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What are you doing?  
`Tag 1`  
**Emilia：**  
Huh? Oh, {player}!  
What a funny coincidence meeting you here.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Actually, I should ask what *you're*...  
 Wait, I know!  
  
**Emilia：**  
You must be lost, right?  
And so you came to me to ask for directions!  
  
**???：**  
Really now, Lia.  
Of course he isn't lost.  
 Don't say such silly things.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh—Puck!  
Why would you call it silly?  
  
**Puck：**  
Isn't that obvious?  
This boy clearly saw you panicking in the street.  
He came over because he was worried about you.  
  
**Emilia：**  
I-I was not panicking at all!  
I was... just a little bit unsure which way to go...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Just the tiniest bit  
 unsure where in the world I was. That's all.  
  
**Puck：**  
It's cute how she tries to act tough, this daughter of mine!  
Don't you think so too?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Puck!  
  
**Puck：**  
Yes, yes, don't get angry.  
Really, it's your fault to begin with.  
  
**Puck：**  
You're the one who insisted on proving  
you could get by without my help for once, aren't you?  
  
**Puck：**  
And yet, you've done nothing but make me worry!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Well... it's been a while since we got here,  
so I thought it would be wrong  
to keep relying on all of you for everything...  
  
**Puck：**  
The sentiment's admirable, but it's not safe.  
Still, let's see...  
 Oh, I just had a good idea!  
  
**Puck：**  
Hey there, kid.  
You got some time?  
 Could you help Lia out for a bit?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Hold on! Puck, wait.  
We can't make trouble for {player}!  
  
**Puck：**  
It's not trouble, it's a proposal!  
You don't want to rely on me today, right?  
Then why not try relying on him for a while instead?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Hmm...  
But that feels a bit too much like cheating...  
  
**Puck：**  
No worries, no worries.  
So, what do you say, kid? You up for the job?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll do it.  
`Tag 2`  
**Puck：**  
See? He's a good boy, this one.  
Well then, take care of Lia for me! ♪  
  
**Emilia：**  
Ohhh, why does Puck have to say these things...?  
  
**Emilia：**  
I'm sorry for mixing you up in this.  
If you're busy, you really don't need to worry...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh...? You really aren't busy at all?  
Well, then...  
 Mm, I suppose I'll accept your help.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Actually, it was lonely walking alone,  
so I was starting to wish I had someone to talk to.  
  
**Emilia：**  
That's right.  
 It's been days now since we all arrived here, hasn't it?  
  
**Emilia：**  
If we're going to stay here for a while,  
I'd really like to learn a little more about this world.  
  
**Emilia：**  
But I just ended up getting myself lost...  
I tried to use signs and maps,  
but the writing you use here is nothing like ours...  
  
**Emilia：**  
I should do what Subaru does  
and at least try to learn some simple writing.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Well then, shall I show you around?  
`Tag 3`  
**Emilia：**  
Yes, Mr. Guide!  
I'll be relying on your expert knowledge!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Heheh... This feels kind of funny.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh,  
 are they selling appas over there?  
Huh? Those aren't appas, they're \"apples\"?  
  
**Emilia：**  
They look just the same,  
and even the names sound alike? How strange...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Still... \"apples\"?  
 Hee hee.  
That's such a funny-sounding name. It's sort of cute.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh, a cat!  
The animals here are mostly the same as ours.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Here, kitty kitty...  
Myahh... Myahh...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Myahh~!  
 Ah—oh dear...  
 The kitty ran away...  
I never have been very good with animals...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Huh?  
 Oh, you're right.  
I'll always have Puck,  
 so I should ask him to let me pet him later.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Ahh, that was fun.  
It's so exciting seeing all these new things.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Shall we take a little rest, {player}?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Here we go...  
I'm tired out from all that walking.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Still, I was really surprised.  
Wherever we went, you seemed to find people you know!  
You really do have a lot of friends.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Is this city where you grew up?  
  
**Emilia：**  
You don't think so?  
\"Think\"... That's a funny way to put it.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Well, I lost all my memories.  
`Tag 4`  
**Emilia：**  
Oh, you lost your...  
Huh?! You mean you don't remember anything?!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Nothing about your past, or even your family?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh...  
 I had no idea...  
  
**Emilia：**  
...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Mm... That's another big surprise.  
But thank you. For sharing it with me.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Actually...  
 I'm not all that different myself.  
  
**Emilia：**  
There was a time when I slept for years and years.  
And I still don't remember much from before then.  
  
**Emilia：**  
That's why  
 I'm so lucky to always have Puck by my side.  
  
**Emilia：**  
I guess it's like how you are with Kokkoro.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Like family.  
`Tag 5`  
**Emilia：**  
Yes! We're family!  
  
**Emilia：**  
It's so strange watching you.  
 When I can't remember things,  
it makes me all nervous,  
 but you seem fine and dandy!  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh? You're still learning lots of things?  
Yes, I guess you would be...  
  
**Emilia：**  
...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Hey, {player}.  
If you wouldn't mind, could we get together for walks like this again?  
  
**Emilia：**  
Watching how hard you try  
makes me feel like I have to work harder myself, too!  
  
**Emilia：**  
You're such a very good, very hardworking boy!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I do always try my very best.  
**Choice: (7)**  Thanks for saying that.  
`Tag 6`  
**Emilia：**  
Mm-hm! You should be proud of yourself.  
I want to be more like you!  
  
Jump to tag 8  
`Tag 7`  
**Emilia：**  
It's good to hear praise when you've worked hard.  
And anyone can see you've earned plenty of it.  
  
`Tag 8`  
**Emilia：**  
I think I'll make working hard like you a goal of my own!  
  
**Puck：**  
Maybe you should start  
 by working on your sense of direction.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Ohhh~!  
Why do you come out at the silliest times?!  
  
**Emilia：**  
You big tease, Puck!  
You nincompoop!  
  
**Narration：**  
And moments later, all three of them broke out laughing.
