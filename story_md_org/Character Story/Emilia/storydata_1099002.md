## Subtitle: Problems with Pepples
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, my lord. The weather is so fine, and the breeze is soft.  
What perfect weather for shopping.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Our good friends at the Orphanage always treat us with such kindness,  
it is only right that we help them with these things.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, this was a fine suggestion you made.  
I must praise your kind consideration.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Mm, mm! That's right.  
He's such a good boy, isn't he?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, I too am filled with pride.  
By the by, what brings you here, Miss Emilia?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This is not a difficult task,  
so my lord and I would be quite capable of handling it alone.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Me?  
I just thought it would be nice to go for a walk together.  
Besides, I have plenty to repay Miss Saren for as well.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Or am I just getting in the way...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh no, most certainly not.  
It makes me happy to have you accompany us, Miss Emilia.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Really?  
Hee hee. Thank you, Kokkoro!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wait, ah... There is no need to embrace me... Mglmph.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You two get along so well.  
`Tag 1`  
**Emilia：**  
Mm. We're both elves, after all!  
Besides, Kokkoro is just so adorable!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Y-you are making me blush...  
Still, you are right. It is nice to meet a fellow elf.  
I seldom see my own kind outside of the forest.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
As such, I am glad that you are so willing to spend time together.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Although, if I may...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Hee hee. It's OK, I know.  
I love you lots too, Kokkoro!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I-I don't think you *do* know... Mglmph...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Okay, let's get shopping!  
**Choice: (3)**  Let me have a turn next!  
`Tag 2`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, my lord! Can you aid me?  
Miss Emilia has a surprisingly strong grip...

`Tag 3`  
**Emilia：**  
Of course! I shouldn't keep her all to myself.  
Kokkoro is just so soft and warm to cuddle.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, could you fetch those vegetables for me?  
Yes, these will do nicely.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh, Kokkoro, you're so good at shopping.  
Efficient and decisive... You're just like Rem.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
To be compared with Miss Rem is most flattering.  
Though I fear I am not yet worthy of such praise.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Besides, from what Miss Rem tells me,  
her sister, Miss Ram, is yet more proficient.  
I must work hard if I am to reach their level.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Ahaha. That's true.  
Ram can do anything if she puts her mind to it.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Here, I brought these.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah, my lord!  
 Thank you very much.  
I believe this is everything we need now.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Oh, that's good!  
Let's see, what did you fetch?  
 ...Oh.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
...Hm?  
Miss Emilia, why did you return those peppers?  
They are a necessary ingredient...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Huh? Were there pepples here?  
I didn't see them anywhere! Isn't that curious?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Emilia, we were speaking of bell peppers, not \"pepples\"...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Could it be... you don't like peppers?  
`Tag 6`  
**Emilia：**  
Urk...!  
A-actually, no, I don't...  
 B-but! Really, who does?!  
  
**Emilia：**  
I mean, they're pepples, right? The green devils!  
They fill your mouth with nasty tingles! It's awful!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh my.  
I had no idea Miss Emilia disliked peppers so terribly.  
My lord, how shall we proceed?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Hm, I see. You like peppers, my lord?  
But of course. You have never been a picky eater.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But that is thanks to my fine cooking, you say?  
Ahh... You praise me too much, my lord.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Still, though...  
 perhaps you do have a point.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Huh? Is the point that you're very good at cooking?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Not exactly. It is about preparation.  
Perhaps the peppers you have eaten in the past  
did not represent the best of what peppers can offer.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Th-then, do you mean...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  You might be able to get over it!  
`Tag 7`  
**Emilia：**  
...Ah!  
  
**Emilia：**  
All right! I'll try it... I'll do battle with the green devil!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Wonderful!  
Then I will do all I can to assist!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So, as you can see, it is complete.  
A pepper stir-fry, pepper-stuffed peppers...  
Peppers upon peppers for the good of pepperkind.  
  
**Emilia：**  
I-it's all bright green!  
  
**Rem：**  
Miss Kokkoro was working so passionately,  
I took it upon myself to assist, but...  
  
**Ram：**  
You certainly created quite the emerald platter.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I tried every manner of seasoning under the sun.  
You will surely find a pepper to your liking among them.  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Mm, it's all so good.  
**Choice: (9)**  It's a pepper lover's dream come true!  
`Tag 8`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh, my lord.  
You are digging in with such gusto...  
  
**Emilia：**  
H-he's eating already!  
I can't run from this, either...!

`Tag 9`  
**Rem：**  
Indeed! I am awed and inspired by the sight!  
  
**Ram：**  
Really?  
 This seems a bit much, even for fans of the stuff.  
  
`Tag 10`  
**Emilia：**  
I-I suppose I'll dig in now!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, do go ahead, Miss Emilia.  
  
**Emilia：**  
*gulp*...  
 Here goes nothing.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, do go ahead, Miss Emilia.  
  
**Emilia：**  
Umm... Yes... I'll try some now.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes! Do go ahead, Miss Emilia!  
  
**Rem：**  
Dear sister, dear sister.  
It seems Miss Emilia is struggling to begin.  
  
**Ram：**  
Rem, Rem.  
Kokkoro is beginning to look like a cruel taskmaster.  
  
**Emilia：**  
...Hrmlph!  
  
**Emilia：**  
*munch*... *munch*...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
H-how is it, Miss Emilia?  
  
**Emilia：**  
...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Ahhh... You liar.  
  
**Choice: (11)**  She's scowling through tears...  
`Tag 11`  
**Emilia：**  
I knew it. No matter how they look, they're green devils...  
I want to try, but I can't...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh... I see.  
How very sad. Still, I suppose it cannot be helped.  
  
**Emilia：**  
K-Kokkoro...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I did everything in my power  
to aid you with your difficulty, Miss Emilia,  
but if you dislike them so much, I can do no more.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Feel free to leave the peppers.  
I will not blame you for anything...  
  
**Emilia：**  
A... aaahhh...!  
  
**Rem：**  
Dear sister, dear sister.  
I think I may understand what you meant just now.  
  
**Ram：**  
Rem, Rem.  
Miss Emilia's royal potential is being tested.  
  
**Choice: (12)**  It tastes good, really.  
`Tag 12`  
**Emilia：**  
Yes! Yes, of course!  
Don't worry! It's all delicious! Thank you so much, Kokkoro!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Are you certain?!  
But just now, you...  
  
**Emilia：**  
No, no! Th-that was just...  
 Yes!  
I was only trying to surprise you a little!  
Well? Did I give you a shock?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh my! That was your intention?  
I must confess, I was entirely fooled by the act.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
But thank goodness.  
I still have seconds ready to serve, after all...  
  
**Emilia：**  
Huh? Seconds...?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes. For you, Miss Emilia,  
I could not resist using all the pepper knowledge I possess!  
  
**Emilia：**  
H-haha... Th-thank you!  
 I'm... very happy.  
Very happy to hear that...  
  
**Emilia：**  
I'll eat...  
 all the pepples my stomach can hold!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh, how wonderful!  
  
**Narration：**  
That night, the green devil haunted Emilia in her nightmares...
