## Subtitle: What's Dear to Me
  
**Narration：**  
Saren and {player}  
are taking a stroll down the beach.  
  
**Saren：**  
Ahh. That was so much fun.  
Now then... The sun's about to set, so let's go meet up with everyone else.  
  
**Man 1：**  
Listen up!  
This rescue operation needs to be swift,  
otherwise the passengers might begin to panic!  
  
**Man 2：**  
B-but what if any monsters appear?  
The two of us can't handle them alone!  
  
**Saren：**  
Well that sounds rather worrying.  
Hey, do you mind if I ask what's going on?  
  
**Man 1：**  
We got an emergency distress call just now.  
One of our tour boats is stranded on a nearby island.  
  
**Man 1：**  
Ideally we'd head out to rescue them immediately,  
but it's an area where monsters appear frequently.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's help them.  
`Tag 1`  
**Saren：**  
We're on the same page there.  
I can't stand by idly while others are in trouble.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hey.  
We'll go with you, so let us help out!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Really?!  
Th-thank you so much!  
We really appreciate it!  
  
**Saren：**  
I take it that's the boat in question.  
Let's get started, shall we?  
  
**Saren：**  
Everyone!  
Please get off of the boat for now!  
Follow instructions and make your way onto the rescue boat!  
  
**Woman：**  
Thank you so much!  
Come on. Daddy's waiting for us back at the beach.  
  
**Girl：**  
Thanks so much, miss!  
  
**Saren：**  
Doesn't seem like any monsters are around.  
Hopefully we can make it back to the beach without any issues.  
  
**Saren：**  
All right, we're the only ones left now.  
Thanks for guiding everyone along, {player}.  
  
**Woman：**  
Eeek?!  
  
**Man 2：**  
The boat's shaking?!  
What's going on?!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Girl：**  
The boat's surrounded by monsters!  
Help!  
  
**Saren：**  
What?!  
They couldn't have chosen any worse timing!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Leave it to me!  
`Tag 2`  
**Saren：**  
Leave it to you?!  
You're not planning on luring them away yourself, are you?!  
Look at how many there are!  
  
**Saren：**  
Argh! Fine!  
Quick, set sail!  
We'll buy you some time!  
  
**Man 1：**  
W-wait a minute!  
What about you two?!  
  
**Saren：**  
Don't worry, we'll be fine!  
You'll make it if you leave now, so hurry!  
  
**Man 1：**  
...Sorry!  
We'll definitely come back to rescue you!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Saren：**  
You're in for a bad time if you try and destroy that boat!  
Let's go with the usual plan, {player}!  
  
**Saren：**  
Mmm... That power of yours really is amazing!  
Leave the rest to me! Haaahhh!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Saren：**  
One more, while I'm at it!  
Yah!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Saren：**  
Perfect! Let's clear them all out!  
  
**Saren：**  
Phew... That went well.  
Now we just need to wait for the boat to come back.  
  
**Saren：**  
Sheesh. Talk about a wild vacation.  
  
**Saren：**  
A-achoo!  
It's getting a bit chilly now that the sun's setting.  
  
**Saren：**  
Huh? You're sorry about not being able to lend me anything to wear?  
That's obviously not your fault.  
Thanks, though.  
  
**Saren：**  
More importantly...  
Why did you charge at them all on your own?  
  
**Saren：**  
Don't give me that look. I'm serious here.  
Seriously angry, to boot.  
  
**Saren：**  
Knowing you, you probably just wanted to save everyone.  
  
**Saren：**  
But there are people that would be upset if  
you got hurt, or even worse.  
Please don't forget that.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  I'm so sorry...  
**Choice: (4)**  Would you be upset as well?  
`Tag 3`  
**Saren：**  
Urgh...  
D-don't give me those puppy eyes.  
I was a bit too stern myself.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Saren：**  
Of course I would.  
In fact, you had me in a panic back there.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Saren：**  
But, well...  
I genuinely find that side of you incredible.  
  
**Saren：**  
I mean, not everyone can put themselves  
at risk to try and help other people out.  
  
**Saren：**  
Seriously.  
You're kind and bold—  
  
**Saren：**  
...  
  
**Saren：**  
Huh? What am I thinking about?  
J-just that the sunset looks really pretty.  
Don't you agree?  
  
**Saren：**  
Hey.  
I asked you about our relationship earlier, didn't I?  
  
**Saren：**  
When I think about it now...  
I'd say I consider you my partner.  
  
**Saren：**  
Sometimes we have each other's backs.  
Sometimes we cause trouble for each other.  
But at the end of the day, we're together. I want that to continue.  
  
**Saren：**  
When you put it that way, nothing sums it up better. Right?  
  
**Saren：**  
And, well...  
This is a selfish wish of mine, but...  
  
**Saren：**  
If possible, I—  
  
**Saren：**  
I want to stay together with you.  
Is that a creepy thing to say?  
  
**Saren：**  
Huh? There's a light out on the ocean?  
Oh, so there is. It must be the rescue boat.  
That's a relief.  
  
**Saren：**  
Sheesh.  
I'm not sure if that's good or bad timing.  
  
**Saren：**  
I guess it's a bit too early to be having this conversation.  
Especially when his amnesia's still a factor.  
  
**Saren：**  
I truly do hope  
we'll be able to talk it out one day, though.  
  
**Narration：**  
Saren lent herself to her thoughts  
as she stared at the light out on the ocean.
