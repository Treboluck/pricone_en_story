# Saren (Summer) Episode 4
Saren recalls playing in a wading pool together with {player} when they were children, only for him to reveal that he still has said pool. Though embarrassed about it at first, Saren agrees to play in it for old time's sake.
  
## Subtitle: Our Wading Pool
  
**Narration：**  
As Saren and {player}  
are waiting for the rescue boat to arrive—  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm?  
This is odd, isn't it?  
  
**Saren：**  
There's no sign of the boat, but the light keeps drawing closer.  
What's going on?  
  
**Saren：**  
Mmm... It keeps getting brighter...!  
It's way too bright! What is this?!  
  

---  
  
**Saren：**  
Mmm!  
You really can't beat this sensation!  
  
**Saren：**  
Getting ice cream from the candy store is what summer's all about!  
There's ramune and gelatin, too! The perfect summer retreat!  
  
**Saren：**  
And it's all cheap to boot.  
Candy stores really do fulfill everyone's each and every need. ♪  
Oh, can't forget about shaved ice! Now I want some!  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm? I'm going to get a stomachache?  
Don't worry. I'm not that frail.  
  
**Saren：**  
Besides, it's been a while since I last came.  
It'd be a waste to not make the most of it.  
  
**Saren：**  
Maybe I'm getting too ahead of myself, though.  
Coming here always gets me so excited.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, look!  
The kids over there are using a wading pool!  
That sure brings back memories!  
  
**Saren：**  
We had our own one too, didn't we?  
The one at your house.  
  
**Saren：**  
Huh? You remember as well?  
Hehe. That's nice to hear.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  We still have it.  
`Tag 1`  
**Saren：**  
Wait, really?!  
That's amazing!  
Taking care of things like that really is important!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's use it again.  
**Choice: (3)**  How about we take a little dip?  
`Tag 2`  
**Saren：**  
Use it? You mean, right now?!  
That doesn't sound realistic...  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Saren：**  
I-in that very same one?!  
No way, that's too embarrassing!  
You realize we're high schoolers now, right?  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Saren：**  
B-but, well...  
I am a bit curious.  
We've got some fond memories of it, after all.  
  
**Saren：**  
If we take it to my house, then...  
But only for a bit! Just a bit.  
That should be fine...  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, wow! It really is the same one!  
This sure brings back memories!  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm? What's wrong?  
Do I have something on me?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Your swimsuit's really cute.  
`Tag 5`  
**Saren：**  
Huh? Oh. Um...  
I'd be lying if I said that didn't make me happy. Thanks.  
  
**Saren：**  
I've had this swimsuit for a while, though.  
I figured I'd still be able to wear it,  
and thankfully I was right.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh.  
D-don't get the wrong idea there.  
It's not like I haven't been, um, developing or anything!  
  
**Saren：**  
I bought a few sizes up to make sure it would last!  
If anything, the fact that it fits perfectly  
is proof that I'm growing!  
  
**Saren：**  
A-anyway!  
Let's just get to wading already!

**Saren：**  
Mmm! This feels great!  
  
**Saren：**  
If anything, I'd argue that this might be more elegant  
than being packed in like sardines at the beach.  
  
**Saren：**  
It really takes me back, too.  
Come on, you should join me!  
  
**Saren：**  
Huh? It's two small for the both of us?  
  
**Saren：**  
That's true, yeah.  
And to think  we used to be able to squeeze four or five of us  
into it back when we kids.  
  
**Saren：**  
In that case, allow me the pleasure of cooling you off.  
Hyah!  
  
**Saren：**  
Hehe. Took you by surprise, didn't I?  
But there's more where that came from! Take this! ♪  
Ahahaha!  
  
**Saren：**  
Huh? Hey, where are you going?  
W-whoa, wait a minute! Using a hose isn't fair!  
  
**Saren：**  
Ahhh?!  
Ahaha! Come on, quit it! It's so cold!  
You're making me squeal here! ♪  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm gonna get you back for this.  
You'll be dripping wet soon enough!  
  
**Saren：**  
Hee hee!  
This is so much fun. ♪

**Ameth：**  
Aaand welcome back.  
How was that little trip down memory lane?  
Sure looked like you were having a good time.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Saren sure showed off her inner child this time around.  
And I just have to say, she was adorable.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm sure you're not just a childhood friend to her.  
You're something much, much more—  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oops.  
That's not information I should be divulging.  
It's something she'll have to tell you directly one of these days.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Either way, stick by her side, will you?  
That's enough from me today. Catch you around.

**Saren：**  
Mm... Mmm.... Huh?  
When did I fall asleep?  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh. Looks like you fell asleep as well.  
We must have been exhausted for that to happen at the same time.  
Hardly surprising, considering the circumstances.  
  
**Saren：**  
What's with that grin on your face?  
You must have had a good dream.  
  
**Saren：**  
Funnily enough, so did I.  
Though it was a bit strange, too.  
  
**Saren：**  
It was a dream about days long past.  
Except they weren't memories of my own childhood.  
  
**Saren：**  
It almost felt like I was seeing my past life.  
Something along those lines.  
  

---  
  
**Saren：**  
Hey,  
it's getting bright again!  
Is that light back?!  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh,  
guess not.  
I can see the rescue boat this time.  
  
**Saren：**  
*sigh*  
Now we can finally go back home.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh! The sunscreen!  
Yup, it's done its job!  
No prickly pain.  
  
**Saren：**  
I need to get started on making it a proper product once I get home.  
This is going to sell loads. I can feel it!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Sounds like you'll be really busy.  
`Tag 6`  
**Saren：**  
Hehe. Probably.  
I'm glad I was able to make some summer memories before then.  
  
**Saren：**  
And that's all because of you.  
Thanks.  
  
**Saren：**  
Let's come again if we get the chance.  
  
**Narration：**  
Saren had a smile of satisfaction on her face  
during the entire trip back to the orphanage.
