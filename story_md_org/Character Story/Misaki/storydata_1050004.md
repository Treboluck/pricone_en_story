**Narration：**  
{player} meets up with Misaki.  
The moment they see one another, they're blinded  
by a strange light.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Huh? Where's that light coming from?  
AIEEEE!  
  

---  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hrrgh!  
C'mon!  
Shoot.  
Why can't I get moving?  
  
**Misaki：**  
C'mon, c'mon!  
How about this?!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Darn it.  
I'm going nowhere.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Want me to give you a boost?  
**Choice: (2)**  Use your legs more.  
`Tag 1`  
**Misaki：**  
Really?  
Sure, thanks!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Misaki：**  
Legs?  
Oh, that makes sense. Lemme try.  
  
`Tag 3`

**Misaki：**  
Hey, it's you!  
How long have you been back there?!  
  
**Misaki：**  
J-just a second?  
You mean it?  
You must have nothing to do if you're hanging around here.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Huh? What am *I* doing?  
I'm, uhh... Just, you know.  
I'm not playing, if that's what you're trying to say!  
  
**Misaki：**  
I'm a mature, adult lady, you know!  
I'd never play on the swings just for fun!  
That would be totally childish.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Like I was saying. I was, err...  
Oh yeah!  
I was teaching the kids how to swing!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  No one's here.  
`Tag 4`  
**Misaki：**  
What? No way!  
This is a huge park—how is there not  
a single kid around?  
  
**Misaki：**  
A-anyway, I'm not just playing on  
the swings like some kid.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hmm?  
What do you mean, \"Then I want a turn?\"  
On the swing? Why?

**Misaki：**  
*sigh* He's actually doing it.  
Look at you, getting excited about a silly swing set.  
You really are a child, you know that?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Huh? Swings are the new hot trend among grown-ups?  
Y-you're lying!  
I'm not falling for that!  
  
**Misaki：**  
B-but...  
It does look sorta fun.  
  
**Misaki：**  
What is it?  
You want me to swing with you?  
I told you, I'm not into little kids' games.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Although I suppose it would be rude of me as an adult  
lady to refuse such a polite request from a man.  
All right, you win. I'll indulge you!  
  
**Misaki：**  
B-but in exchange,  
you have to teach me how to swing  
on my own!

**Ameth：**  
\"Swings are the new hot trend among grown-ups?\"  
Pfft. At least try to make your lies realistic.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Then again, it got Misaki to let go and have fun on the swings,  
so I guess the ends justified the means. Who'd have guessed  
Misaki would have trouble swinging on her own, though?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hmm? Oh, right. What you just saw  
 was a dream I crafted  
based off Misaki's and your memory fragments.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'll show you another dream once you've gathered enough  
memory fragments.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Having lots of these dreams with lots of different girls...  
That's your path to learning the truth about this world.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Do your best, okay?  
Until next time!  
  

---  
  
**Misaki：**  
Mmph...  
Whoa.  
What  
was I doing?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Did I fall asleep?  
Hmm. You look like you just woke up, too.  
How did we both fall asleep outside like that?  
  
**Misaki：**  
I had the most wonderful dream, too.  
We were swinging on a swing set together.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Huh? You had the exact same dream?  
Wow, that's so strange.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Yeah, yeah! Wasn't that the most fun dream—  
  
**Misaki：**  
Wait, no! No it wasn't!  
Like I'd ever get all excited about swinging on a dumb swing!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Continue what? The dream?  
Are you saying you wanna play with me?  
I-I told you, I'm not interested in childish games.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Oh, but I guess as an adult, I've got the freedom  
to indulge you if I want!  
All right, you win. I'll play with you!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so the two played and played until the sun went down.
