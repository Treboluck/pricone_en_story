**Narration：**  
{player} waits for Misaki in a small corner of Landosol.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Oh, there you are!  
Sorry to keep you waiting, honey bun!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  H-honey bun?!  
`Tag 1`  
**Misaki：**  
Shut up. Don't get flustered.  
Act natural and follow my lead for today.  
  
**Misaki：**  
By now they're all out there, watching me like hawks.  
  
**Misaki：**  
The truth is... I was trying to show off for my friends,  
and I kinda went too far. I said I was going on a date  
with my super-hot boyfriend.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Then they didn't believe me and said they wanted to see  
him for themselves,  
and here we are.  
  
**Misaki：**  
So for the rest of the day, you've gotta act like you're  
my real boyfriend. Got it?  
  
**Misaki：**  
But since I can't imagine you putting together a proper  
grown-up date,  
I'll take the lead.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Okay, honey bun.  
Let's start with a trip to our favorite cafe!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Then after that...  
Hee hee! ♪ Let's finally go shopping  
for those promise rings!  
Remember how you said  
you wanted us to get a pair?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hee hee. This is going to be such a lovely date!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Ooh, honey bun,  
you have to try a sip of this!  
It's their new cafe latte, and it's fantastic!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Oh, uhh...  
  
**Misaki：**  
If he drinks from my cup, that's an indirect kiss...  
  
**Misaki：**  
N-nothing.  
They're gonna get suspicious. Hurry up and drink!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Honey bun, look in here! The promise rings they sell here  
are all the rage with young couples!  
  
**Misaki：**  
*gulp* What now? We actually came here.  
I-if he and I get promise rings, then we're...  
  
**Misaki：**  
N-nothing.  
Quick, buy the rings before they start suspecting us!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Whew.  
Looks like we managed to pull it off.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Thanks a lot for today.  
You weren't exactly the most reliable boyfriend,  
but I'll give you a B-minus.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm exhausted.  
**Choice: (3)**  That was a lot of fun.  
`Tag 2`  
**Misaki：**  
What do you mean, exhausted?!  
  
**Misaki：**  
You got to spend a whole day as my boyfriend,  
you should be more fulfilled than you've ever been  
in your life!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Or what, are you trying to say  
that I wasn't good enough  
for you?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Personally, I had a lot of fun.  
  
**Misaki：**  
I-I didn't say anything, dummy!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Misaki：**  
R-really?  
W-well, that's great!  
  
**Misaki：**  
The, umm, the truth is... I had a lot of fun, too.  
Thank you for doing this.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Misaki：**  
Hmm? What's that?  
You have something to give me  
before we call it a day?  
  
**Misaki：**  
Hey, what's in the box?  
I hear something rattling around inside.  
  
**Misaki：**  
Oh! It's the mug from the cafe  
 I said I liked!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Wow, I don't know what to say.  
This is such a nice surprise! I'm so happy!  
  
**Misaki：**  
Thank you so much!  
This is why you're such a great boyfr—  
  
**Misaki：**  
Ahh! I-  
I mean pretend! Pretend boyfriend!  
Yes, as my pretend boyfriend, I appreciate your generosity.  
  
Just don't get the wrong idea!  
  
**Misaki：**  
It'll be a million...  
No, that's too harsh. Umm...  
It'll be ten years before I consider going out with you,  
you doofus!  
  
**Misaki：**  
B-but I am kinda happy.  
I promise I'll take good care of it.
