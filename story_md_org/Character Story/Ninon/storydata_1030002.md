## Subtitle: Conquering the Outskirts!
  
**Narration：**  
To fulfill their ambition of conquering all the lands,  
Ninon and {player} visit the city outskirts  
to train in the use of a new ninja technique.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Shogun! Here I go!  
Time to test my new technique... The Monja Cross Slice!  
Watch and learn!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Huh? No no, not Ninja Cross Slash.  
It's the Monja Cross Slice!  
  
**Narration：**  
So saying, Ninon pulls out a searing-hot teppan grill.  
Grasped in her hand... a bowl filled with batter.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hiyahhh!  
Let's make monja-yaki!  
Batter on the grill! And add the vegetables!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Sizzly...! Monja... Sizzly monja!  
Mmmm, smells so good...!  
Ahh! Time to strike!  
 One slice, straight across!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Ahhh! The base collapsed into pieces!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Muerghhh... This time was a failure...  
It might take time to master, this Monja Cross Slice...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Maybe it would be better  
to work on perfecting my Pickled Kombu Inferno technique first...  
  
**Narration：**  
As Ninon ponders her ninja training,  
a few children rush over to confront her.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hmm? What's up, little ones?  
Are you a mini ninja platoon?  
  
**Child 1：**  
What's the big idea, you two?!  
Who gave you permission to train around here?!  
  
**Child 2：**  
This turf belongs to us, the Phoenix Family!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Awawah!  
Looks like we wandered into these kids' favorite hangout...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's apologize and go somewhere else.  
`Tag 1`  
**Ninon：**  
W-wait one moment please!  
  
**Narration：**  
Giving a meaningful nod to {player},  
Ninon takes a bold step forward.  
  
**Ninon：**  
The time has come to reveal the truth!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Stand back, stand back!  
Do you not know the true identity of the one you face?!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Tremble in fear, for he is none other than the shogun!  
De-de-den!  
  
**Child 1：**  
\"Shogun\"...?  
Sounds lame! Never heard of him!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Urgh... To think the name of the shogun has no effect...  
These kids have mastered their  
\"Shameless Insolence no Jutsu\"...  
  
**Ninon：**  
Sh-Shogun!  
You must demonstrate your power to them!  
  
**Child 1：**  
Wh-what's that mean?!  
You gonna beat us up when we're just kids?!  
  
**Child 2：**  
Y-yeah, you brutes! If you hit me... I'm gonna cry!  
I-I'll tell my mom on you and everything!

**Child 1：**  
Whoaaa! This shogun dude's awesome! All hail the shogun!  
  
**Narration：**  
Soon enough, all the children's hands are filled  
with a variety of colorful candies.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Heheh... Now you understand.  
My great shogun, you never cease to amaze!  
So this is the legendary Candy Bribe no Jutsu!  
  
**Child 2：**  
Mmm, that was really good!  
We'll let you guys off just this one time!  
  
**Child 1：**  
Bye now! Let's play again sometime,  
Big Sis Ninon and rich shogun dude!

**Ninon：**  
Farewell, little ninjas!  
Try not to get assassinated on the way home!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Eheheh... Maybe those kids are pretty sweet after all!  
  
**Ninon：**  
What's wrong now, Shogun?  
Why are you sighing so deeply?  
Because we didn't make much progress with our training?  
  
**Ninon：**  
No need to look so sad!  
We just established our authority over the city outskirts!  
It's a step towards our goal of conquering the lands!  
  
**Narration：**  
Ninon looks {player} straight in the eyes  
with a kindhearted smile.  
  
**Ninon：**  
So no need for any sighs of sadness!  
Ninon is here for you!  
Smiles make the world go round, not square!  
  
**Ninon：**  
...Huh?  
Since you spent so much on that candy,  
we're going to have to go without dessert tonight...?  
  
**Ninon：**  
It's all necessary for our ambitions?  
T-true enough, but...  
  
**Ninon：**  
I did not expect this kind of suffering.  
The path of a samurai is filled with terrible sacrifices...  
  
**Narration：**  
Giving a massive sigh of her own,  
Ninon trudged home with her head hung low.
