# Ninon Episode 3
Ninon joins a group mission to take out a dangerous monster, but it turns out to be stronger than she anticipated. Even her secret weapon (prostrating herself in apology) has no effect, and she's forced to retreat to fight another day.

**Ninon：**  
Shogun! Shogun!  
 Big news! Big news! It's awful!  
  
**Narration：**  
Ninon comes rushing towards {player}  
in a very excited state.  
  
**Ninon：**  
Recently, a monster's appeared in the canyon,  
and it's causing big trouble for traveling merchants!  
  
**Ninon：**  
It's a problem for the whole town, so they're organizing a  
big operation to work together and take the monster down!  
  
**Ninon：**  
They're going to set off tomorrow at noon!  
  
**Ninon：**  
If we beat that monster, I'm sure  
they'll give us a castle of our own!  
It will be our first of hundreds!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Our great conquest will progress in the blink of an eye,  
leaving us to reap the rewards!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Huh...?  
 That monster is supposed to be very strong?  
No guarantee that we'll be able to beat it?  
You think it's dangerous?  
  
**Ninon：**  
Hmmm...  
 B-but! If we all work together,  
our powers combined will surely be enough!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Besides...  
Just recently,  
 I learned a very, very powerful new technique  
for perilous situations!  
  
**Ninon：**  
I am ready to use it if necessary,  
 so worry not!  
You are safe in the hands of the invincible Ninon!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Holding my shogun in my hands...  
Sounds very romantic!  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day, the extermination squad arrives at the canyon  
where the dangerous monster is lurking.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAGHHHH!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Urghh... Such strength...  
I've never seen such a strong monster before...  
  
**Ninon：**  
At this rate, the whole squad will be defeated...  
Everyone's morale is falling quickly as well...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Keep it up, Ninon!  
**Choice: (2)**  What about your secret weapon?  
`Tag 1`  
**Ninon：**  
Thank you, my shogun!  
You are right, I can't let it get the better of me!  
I have to come up with a plan...  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Ninon：**  
Secret weapon...?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Ninon：**  
Ah...! Of course!  
This is the time to deploy the special technique I learned!  
  
**Narration：**  
Ninon takes a bold step forward,  
turns to the rest of the squad, and calls out to them.  
  
**Ninon：**  
My bold comrades in battle!  
I'm going to use a secret ninja technique,  
so I'd like to ask everyone to lend me their strength!  
  
**Ninon：**  
The more people who take part, the greater the effect!  
So please, help me if you can!  
  
**Soldier 1：**  
Whoa! Is she gonna use some kind of high-level magic?!  
  
**Soldier 2：**  
All right! Girlie, let's see what you've got!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Right then, everyone!  
Watch me  and perform the exact same movements!  
Here goes nothing!  
  
**Narration：**  
Swiftly descending into a crouch, Ninon falls to her knees  
and thrusts her head roughly onto the ground, shouting...  
  
**Ninon：**  
I beg your forgiveness!!!  
  
**Ninon：**  
See how I expose my shame!  
Ninpo: Eastern Traditional Dogeza!  
  
**Soldier 1：**  
Heyyyyyy!  
No way in hell that's a ninja technique!  
  
**Ninon：**  
But it is. Long ago, a traveler from a far eastern land  
imparted this ultimate prostration technique to my people.  
  
**Ninon：**  
When it is unleashed, even the most terrible of foes  
should be forced to retreat!  
  
**Narration：**  
Upon witnessing this great prostration,  
the monster's movements freeze for a moment.  
  
**Soldier 2：**  
N-no way... Can it be... It actually worked...?  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAARGHHH! (Roaring even louder than before.)  
  
**Soldier 1：**  
Aaaaaghhhh!  
It wasn't any use at all!  
  
**Ninon：**  
Wh-why didn't it work?!  
F-for now, let's run away fast!  
  
**Narration：**  
Having learned their lesson to come up with a better plan,  
the adventurers fled in the face of the rampaging monster.
