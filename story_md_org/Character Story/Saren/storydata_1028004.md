**Saren：**  
Mm... Hmmm...?  
  
**Saren：**  
O-oh, {player}!  
I just keep running into you. Are you on a shopping trip as well?  
  
**Saren：**  
Yes, I'm just picking up some groceries for dinner.  
Look at this, would you? Bean sprouts for a hundred rupies.  
Everything's getting so expensive nowadays... Oh well.  
  
**Saren：**  
Landosol is a city surrounded on all sides by high castle walls,  
so it can't expand its borders at all.  
  
**Saren：**  
It wasn't built with any farms or fields within those walls,  
so it has no means to produce its own food.  
  
**Saren：**  
Landosol subsists on importing food from surrounding farms,  
and capitalizing on its position in the middle of the continent  
for trading purposes.  
  
**Saren：**  
To be frank...  
Our food situation depends significantly on outside forces.  
  

---  
  
**Saren：**  
That's why it was such a big deal yesterday when a bunch of  
monsters spawned on the Esterella Road and caused a  
huge pandemonium.  
It scared all the traders away.  
  
**Saren：**  
If Landosol were a human body, this would be like cutting off its carotid  
artery. No, maybe not quite that bad. More like a cyst forming and  
restricting blood flow.  
 You won't live long if you leave it unaddressed.  
  

---  
  
**Saren：**  
We can't bring in new stock,  
so we can only trade what we already have—and that raises prices.  
  
**Saren：**  
The balance between supply and demand has been upset.  
Our best plan of action is to ride it out until the situation improves.  
  
**Saren：**  
I want to serve good, nourishing food for the children at the Sarendia Orphanage.  
How else will they grow big and strong?  
  
**Saren：**  
The Orphanage itself still isn't stocked  
with the basics we need.  
  
**Saren：**  
So here I am, shopping to cover the gap.  
I have to think on my feet if I want us to get by.  
  
**Saren：**  
What's that old saying, though? \"You get what you pay for\"?  
Ugh. This is some terrible luck.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oof.  
Sorry for all the grumbling.  
  
**Saren：**  
It's hard not to grumble in this situation, but I'll just have to make do.  
Let me know if you find anywhere selling cheap goods, all right?  
  
**Saren：**  
Whaaat?!  
Wh-what's happening to you?  
You're... glowing!  
  

---  
  
**Saren：**  
Hee hee hee! ♪  
Today's shopping trip was a huge success!  
  
**Saren：**  
I assumed smaller shopping precincts like this would have pricier stock,  
especially compared to wholesale retailers.  
Turns out I was wrong.  
  
**Saren：**  
The grocer grows vegetables as a hobby,  
the baker sells misshapen loaves and crusts,  
and there are lots of clearance goods that were damaged in production.  
  
**Saren：**  
This street is overflowing with rare finds!  
  
**Saren：**  
Look at this!  
I bought so much shopping I can barely carry it in both hands, all for a single 500-yen coin!  
  
**Saren：**  
I get such a rush from a good haul.  
It's better than acing a test, in my book.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh?  
Hey, {player}!  
Fancy running into you here. What's up?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  What are YOU doing here, young lady?  
**Choice: (2)**  Those bags look heavy. Want a hand?  
`Tag 1`  
**Saren：**  
\"Young lady?\" Pfft... Where'd that come from?  
You sound like my father!  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm not a fan, to be honest.  
Where's the regular {player}?  
  
**Saren：**  
We've been friends forever. You don't need to act like some stuffy gentleman around me.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Saren：**  
Hweh?!  
Um,  
pardon me.  
  
**Saren：**  
Where did this come from? You aren't usually this generous.  
What have you been eating  
that made you suddenly grow manners?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Saren：**  
Hmm.  
There's something decidedly un-{player}-like about how you're acting today.  
  
**Saren：**  
Am I wrong?  
We played together in the mud as little kids, y'know.  
Feels pretty weird for you to start dropping cheesy lines now.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hmmm?  
Yeah, I'm shopping. Obviously.  
  
**Saren：**  
Usually I have Suzume do it, 'cause I'm so busy,  
but there's no student council meeting today and I don't have a shift at work.  
  
**Saren：**  
I have to check in on grocery prices for myself now and then,  
otherwise I'll worry about sending Suzume to shop for me.  
It'd be awful if I didn't give her enough to cover the cost.  
  
**Saren：**  
I can get a basic idea of prices online,  
but you have to go in person for the full experience.  
Especially when it comes to little precincts like this one.  
  
**Saren：**  
What?  
You're saying girls my age don't usually go alone after school  
to do market price comparisons?  
  
**Saren：**  
So I must not have any friends who want to hang out... with me? Huh?!  
You've got a lot of nerve!  
I'm extremely popular at school, I'll have you know!  
  
**Saren：**  
In fact, all that hustle and bustle is exactly why  
I need a breather every now and then!  
  
**Saren：**  
It's relaxing to walk around checking prices,  
haggling for good deals...  
It chills me out.  
Guess I'm weird that way.  
  
**Saren：**  
Anyway, you're the one wandering around aimlessly  
by yourself after school. Tragic, really.  
I'll hang out with you if you like! ♪  
  
**Saren：**  
Oho.  
They put a new cabinet up at the arcade near here?  
  
**Saren：**  
No wonder you're here, then. Hmm.  
Now I'm a teeny bit curious about what kind of game it is.  
  
**Saren：**  
Want to check it out? I can stay out a bit longer.  
Hee hee... It'll be just like when we were kids.  
  
**Saren：**  
Wait, these shopping bags are gonna get in my way.  
That's a bummer.  
Maybe there's a locker or something I can store them in?  
  
**Saren：**  
H-huh? You said...  
You'll carry them for me?  
Th... thank you...?  
  
**Saren：**  
Ahahah, you ARE acting odd today.  
Don't be too nice to me, now. I'll get embarrassed. ♪  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Whew. You had me sweating bullets there.  
You're supposed to be childhood pals though, so I guess it makes sense  
that she knew something was up, despite how briefly you talked.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You may be the same person you were back then...  
But I guess you did lose your memory,  
and had a bunch of new experiences afterward...  
  
**Ameth：**  
So, you could be significantly different from how you used to be.  
  
**Ameth：**  
That's why I'm showing you these dreams,  
in the hope I can merge your past and present selves.  
And fine-tune some other things along the way, too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Gosh,  
look at me, talking your ear off.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Not sure why I spilled all that to you.  
I wouldn't worry too much about this now, anyway.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Everything you saw just now will feel like a dream.  
You'll forget about it as soon as you wake up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm really curious as to why this Saren  
has forgotten that you were friends as children,  
so I wanted to do some digging.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Doesn't seem like I have the leisure to do that, though.  
Everything here is just barely managing to stay stable.  
Let's stop here for now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Bye, {player}.  
See you in your dreams.  
  

---  
  
**Saren：**  
{player}?  
Heeey! What happened?  
You zoned out all of a sudden.  
  
**Saren：**  
This is my fault.  
I shouldn't have had you carry all those things.  
Did you get worn out from all the hard work?  
  
**Saren：**  
Make sure you get some rest  
once we've unloaded at the Sarendia Orphanage.  
I owe you a cup of tea, at the very least.  
  
**Saren：**  
...{player}?  
Did we go walking together like this some other time recently?  
  
**Saren：**  
Mm.  
No, this is the first time ever, I'm sure.  
It must have been a touch of déjà vu.  
  
**Saren：**  
It's just... peculiar, is all.  
I feel like you and I have always done this.  
Lots of times, walking together, side-by-side.  
  
**Saren：**  
The two of us, walking home at dusk,  
chatting about whatever came to mind. Hmm...  
But there's no way that we could have!  So strange.  
  
**Saren：**  
I only just met you, after all.
