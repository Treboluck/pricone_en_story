**Saren：**  
There, all done!  
The work went beautifully, all thanks to you.  
It's only fair we should share the spoils.  
  
**Saren：**  
Somehow, we ended up spending the whole day working side-by-side.  
It's practically required for us to celebrate together!  
  
**Saren：**  
Ehehehe! ♪  
Goodness! That laugh sounded rather coarse, didn't it?  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, but I can't help but laugh anyway.  
The glow you feel from a job well done is so sublime!  
  
**Saren：**  
Ah, I feel so alive!  
There's nothing as fun as a good day of work.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hey, {player}.  
I helped you take care of your work with no problems, didn't I?  
So you can handle the bill.  
  
**Saren：**  
I hunted down far more bugs than you could've imagined,  
so I'd say I deserve a bonus reward.  
  
**Saren：**  
Juuust kidding!  
We can split the bill. You don't owe me anything.  
  
**Saren：**  
After all, you pulled the wagons for me, and that helped me just as much.  
We helped each other out here.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  No, I'll treat you.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'd rather you treat me, actually.  
`Tag 1`  
**Saren：**  
Ahahah.  
Don't be silly! I know guys feel pressured to foot the bill nowadays...  
  
**Saren：**  
But our relationship is better than that.  
Which is weird, since we hardly just met!  
  
**Saren：**  
I really feel close to you, like we've been friends for decades.  
I wonder why?

`Tag 2`  
**Saren：**  
Hey, now.  
Don't push your luck, cheeky.  
  
**Saren：**  
What's up, are you having money troubles?  
I could always rustle up a job for you if you need one.  
I have a good amount of sway with the shops and guilds, you know!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Saren：**  
Anyway, onto more important things.  
Do you mind if I pick our cuisine today?  
  
**Saren：**  
It might take a while to explain my choice, though.  
You see, the fruits I was transporting are called olives.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm sure you knew that just from looking at them.  
Anyway, this tavern bought up the entire stock I brought.  
  
**Saren：**  
I had to bring lots of stock all the way here from my home,  
deep in the mountains.  
  
**Saren：**  
To make the most of the trip,  
I bought huge quantities at a discount from traveling merchants.

**Saren：**  
Olives aren't especially familiar to people in Landosol.  
In faraway nations, though, they're a staple in everyday cooking.  
  
**Saren：**  
So in certain countries, they're produced on a huge scale.  
You can practically buy them for pennies.  
  
**Saren：**  
Buuut, since they're far less common in Landosol,  
they fetch a higher price as a luxury ingredient.  
You make money by exploiting that gap in value.  
  

---  
  
**Saren：**  
Olives are unfamiliar here, so they're tough to sell.  
Which is why... I took the time to teach the cooks at this tavern  
how to cook with olives, well in advance.  
  
**Saren：**  
And naturally,  
in exchange, I had them agree to buy the olives I sell at a premium.  
  
**Saren：**  
Now this tavern  
can serve recipes that use olives,  
an unusual delicacy in Landosol.  
  
**Saren：**  
I profit from selling the olives, so I can come back here to sell again.  
It doesn't end with a single transaction.  
  
**Saren：**  
Business means you always have to think in the long term.  
If you only think in terms of a single sale's profits, you may as well be gambling.  
  
**Saren：**  
Create a demand before you sell anything.  
Then, once people are willing to buy, you can increase the value as high as you like.  
  
**Saren：**  
That's the basic principle of trading.  
Once the stores have your stock, it's far too late to rethink your sales pitch.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, and of course...  
Ideally, your transactions should leave everyone feeling satisfied.  
  
**Saren：**  
By that I mean myself, the tavern, the tavern's customers...  
We want everyone to end up with a smile on their face.  
  
**Saren：**  
It's not always easy to pull that off, mind you.  
Take today, for instance. Who knows what might have happened if  
I hadn't run into you?  
 There's no telling!  
  
**Saren：**  
Still,  
you can't be too hesitant. You've got to take risks.  
There are people I have to take care of out there.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hehe.  
All the more reason to fill our stomachs now,  
so we can take on tomorrow! ♪  
  
**Saren：**  
Yes, please order as many olive dishes as you can.  
I want to sample lots.  
That's why I brought us here to eat our victory meal!  
  
**Saren：**  
This tavern helped me profit, so I invest money in them in return.  
That way we can build a friendly working relationship.  
I'm sure the tavern will want to work with me again, too.  
  
**Saren：**  
Money is always moving around the public.  
The more it circulates, the more likely I profit.  
  
**Saren：**  
So come on, order already!  
I thought boys were supposed to have huge appetites?  
  
**Saren：**  
Eating a huge feast and then working it off  
is one of the best pleasures in life.  
Trust me, {player}!
