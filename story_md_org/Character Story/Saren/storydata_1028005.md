**Saren：**  
Yeees?  
Sorry, Father,  
could you repeat that?  
  
**Saren：**  
Yes,  
it's hard to hear you.  
I think the transmission magic is cutting out.  
  
**Saren：**  
That's right.  
I know my darling father  
would never say something so cruel.  
  
**Saren：**  
What?  
No, no. Of course I respect you!  
I love you! Sooo much! You know that!  
  
**Saren：**  
So, Father,  
sorry to ask again, but what was it you said to me?  
  
**Saren：**  
Ack! I'm so sorry!  
Could you give me a moment or two?  
  
**Saren：**  
I just heard a friend calling.  
No, really! I'm not stalling for time!  
  
**Saren：**  
Okay.  
What's the matter, {player}?  
I'm quite busy right now, as you can probably tell.  
  
**Saren：**  
Geez.  
Why are you even here?  
How did you get in?  
  
**Saren：**  
*sigh* You heard my voice as you passed by,  
and came in to see what was wrong?  
  
**Saren：**  
I wish I had such a free schedule. Must be nice.  
And no, I'm not being sarcastic.  
  
**Saren：**  
I chose to live my life this way...  
But sometimes I think it might be nice to take things as casually  
as you do.  
  
**Saren：**  
I want to enjoy my youth as much as anyone.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh well.  
That was transmission magic.  
It's a way to communicate over long distances.  
  
**Saren：**  
You mustn't just barge in like that. I was still in a call.  
The connection could be cut if you interrupt the magic.  
  
**Saren：**  
Right,  
the use of transmission magic is regulated by the government.  
  
**Saren：**  
Specifically, by Princess Knight.  
It's run by guilds that are under the Palace's direct control.  
  
**Saren：**  
My guild technically falls  
under Princess Knight's jurisdiction, too.  
  
**Saren：**  
I don't have to pay as much to use it...  
But I do still have to pay, so I'd rather keep my calls short.  
  
**Saren：**  
I wish it wasn't such a pain to deal with.  
You think so too, right, {player}?  
  
**Saren：**  
Stupid transmission magic.  
You have to calculate every last second and coordinate,  
hire a transmission specialist... It takes days!  
  
**Saren：**  
In some circumstances, it's actually faster to use a messenger or a carrier pigeon.  
  
**Saren：**  
I wish we could all carry our own communication devices around with us.  
It'd be so nice to chat over long distances without a care in the world.  
I've seen it in books before!  
  
**Saren：**  
If we can dream it up, we should be able to make it a reality.  
I'm serious.  
Maybe I should invest more in transmission magic research...  
  
**Saren：**  
I think a mage with enough skill could use transmission magic on  
their own.  
 Bring that magic to the public, then help it circulate...  
Ah, I smell a business opportunity!  
  
**Saren：**  
Er,  
but enough of that.  
Did you want something, {player}?  
  
**Saren：**  
I really have to get back to this goose chase of a negotiation  
with my father,  
 so I can't spend too long with you.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Your father?  
**Choice: (2)**  Sorry to interrupt.  
`Tag 1`  
**Saren：**  
Yes, that's who I was talking with.  
He was quite the shrewd businessman once,  
but since he retired, I've taken over a lot of his work.  
  
**Saren：**  
He practically bought his way into his rank in the nobility, picking  
up castles and territories along the way.  
 Now, you'd hardly  
recognize him. He's whiling away his golden years in retirement.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Saren：**  
Don't apologize.  
The break helped me clear my head.  
It's actually a good thing you called out!  
  
**Saren：**  
Ahahah.  
You only ever seem to call on me  
when I'm in trouble!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Saren：**  
Ahem.  
If I keep him on hold much longer, he'll start to suspect something's up...  
So, back I go.  
  
**Saren：**  
Father?  
Hellooo?  
So sorry about that little interruption! ♪  
  
**Saren：**  
Hmm. You're saying you can't invest in something that won't turn a  
profit, right?  
 Well, how about doing it to help your adorable  
little girl? You know, I'm doing very commendable charity work...  
  
**Saren：**  
I know that!  
Yes, even charity comes at a cost to its volunteers, I know.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm not planning to throw money down the drain.  
I make the most of every single rupie.  
  
**Saren：**  
\"Talk is cheap, but actions are expensive?\"  
True! That's absolutely true.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'll send a financial proposal through the mail, so make sure to read it.  
And read it properly, you hear me? This is a solid investment, I swear!  
  
**Saren：**  
Geez. The least you could do is throw me a compliment  
or indulge my requests once in a while, you know?  
How can you say no to your sweet daughter?  
  
**Saren：**  
Yes, yes. I know. You don't need to give me whatever  
I want in order to show me you love me.  
 How am I still being  
treated like a kid when I'm running the business?  
  
**Saren：**  
Right. Well, we've already gone over our allotted transmission time.  
Let's end our negotiations here for today.  
Byeee. Take care.  
  
**Saren：**  
Uuugh!  
That went *terribly!*  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm?  
Why are you staring, {player}?  
  
**Saren：**  
No, no, my father and I get along fine!  
I really look up to him, actually. He's great.  
It's only when we're talking business that he sets my blood boiling.  
  
**Saren：**  
It's because... Well, Sarendia Orphanage isn't doing so well  
on the administrative level.  
  
**Saren：**  
I asked my father for some funds to help out.  
Unfortunately, it looks like he has zero plans to invest in us.  
  
**Saren：**  
We're just a tiny little guild without many achievements, so  
we aren't people's first thought when they want to invest in a guild.  
But why won't HE help us? He's my father!  
  
**Saren：**  
Well, whatever.  
{player}, are you free?  Let's go somewhere.  
  
**Saren：**  
Maybe a café nearby so we can have a tasty dessert.  
Ugh! I feel so stressed out my head might burst!  
I need a sugar boost, stat!  
  
**Saren：**  
While we're there, I can plan out how I'm going to sell this proposal to Father.  
Would you mind giving me some feedback?  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm his daughter,  
so It's hard to stay calm when arguing with him.  
I'd really love to get an outsider's perspective.  
  
**Saren：**  
You understand me, right?  
 All I have on my side is youth and time.  
And time is just as precious as money.  
You have to be efficient in how you use it.  
  
**Saren：**  
Thanks, {player}.  
I always feel much calmer after talking things over with you.
