**Saren：**  
*sigh*  
I haven't been able to relax like that in a long while.  
  
**Saren：**  
Thanks, {player}.  
I would've been bored out of my skull  
without you around.  
  
**Saren：**  
I owe you one.  
I mean it.  
  
**Saren：**  
You know, it's strange...  
Whenever I'm with you,  
I feel just like I'm a kid again.  
  
**Saren：**  
I had so much fun.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'd like to do this again,  
next time I'm free.  
  
**Saren：**  
Just shopping together like we did today,  
and talking about all kinds of silly things.  
  
**Saren：**  
Though I suppose...  
it may not have been as fun for you.  
  
**Saren：**  
I can't imagine it's much fun hanging out with  
a workaholic like me.  
All I ever talk about is business.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm sure there are other girls you'd rather spend time with.  
Cuter, less serious girls.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm fully aware  
I'm not a fun person to be around.  
  
**Saren：**  
That's just how I am, though.  
I've always had to work hard to cut an aristocratic figure  
as my parents' eldest daughter.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm quite obsessed  
with work and managing finances.  
  
**Saren：**  
I wasn't always like this, though.  
I was different whenever I was with him.  
  
**Saren：**  
I felt just like any other girl then.  
  
**Saren：**  
But I think if I met him now...  
I might find I built him up too much in my head.  
  
**Saren：**  
Thinking that  
makes me feel  
kind of sad.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm?  
Hey, {player}?  
What's wrong?! You're glowing again!

**Saren：**  
Hey!  
 {player}, were you the cause of all that racket?  
  
**Saren：**  
Why are you even here?  
Do you have business at Sakuraba Academy?  
  
**Saren：**  
Honestly.  
I thought you'd know better!  
This is a private academy, exclusively for children  
of the rich and well-connected.  
  
**Saren：**  
You'll obviously get caught if you just waltz in.  
They hire top-of-the-line security here.  
  
**Saren：**  
Ugh,  
all the little lords and ladies here are in a huge panic because of you.  
  
**Saren：**  
They're as sheltered and delicate as orchids in a hothouse.  
One glimpse of the unwashed masses sends them into a frenzy.  
  
**Saren：**  
They've been saying \"A creepy person broke in!\"  
\"Is that a stalker?!\" All kinds of things.  
  
**Saren：**  
Never mind security,  
you're lucky that no one called the police.  
What were you even doing, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Nothing, really.  
**Choice: (2)**  Beg Saren for help.  
`Tag 1`  
**Saren：**  
Huh?  
W-wait, you can't be serious.  
Do you understand how much trouble you're in?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Saren：**  
Wha—?!  
H-hey, stop that.  
Don't latch on to me where anyone can see us!  
  
**Saren：**  
F-fine, okay.  
I'll figure something out,  
so calm down!  
  
**Saren：**  
It's all going to be all right.  
There, there.  
  
`Tag 3`

**Saren：**  
Oh, very well.  
Knowing you and your bad luck,  
you probably just wandered in unawares.  
  
**Saren：**  
Here, I'll smooth it over.  
You owe me for this!  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh! Ahem!  
It's all right, everybody.  
  
**Saren：**  
This fellow here is completely harmless.  
He wouldn't hurt a fly!  
  
**Saren：**  
Just leave me to handle him. I am the school council president,  
after all.  
 You may all continue to finish up for the day and  
return home. This is all under control.  
  
**Saren：**  
*sigh*  
Okay, good.  
It looks like they bought it.  
  
**Saren：**  
They're all good kids,  
or at least they've been raised to act that way.  
  
**Saren：**  
Now then, {player}.  
It's no wonder they thought you were suspicious,  
slinking around the way you do.  
  
**Saren：**  
Try to walk  
with a bit more confidence.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm? What was that?  
You came all the way to Sakuraba Academy  
because you wanted my help?  
  
**Saren：**  
Then you weren't just loitering around!  
What did you want my help with, though?  
  
**Saren：**  
Huh?  
You want to take me somewhere we both used to go together?  
  
**Saren：**  
Where do you mean?  
 Wait, do you mean *that* place?  
  
**Saren：**  
Oof.  
Sorry, my chauffeur is here.  
  
**Saren：**  
I've told him I don't need a ride home,  
but he shows up in a limousine every day without fail.  
  
**Saren：**  
What's the point of having working legs  
if I don't use them every now and then?  
  
**Saren：**  
Hello, Sebastian? I'm walking home today, I'm afraid.  
Thank you for coming to pick me up,  
but could you head home without me?  
  
**Saren：**  
Okay.  
Sorry for the inconvenience!  
Bye! ♪  
  
**Saren：**  
All right, let's go, {player}.  
You're taking me somewhere nice,  
aren't you?  
  
**Saren：**  
Wow, I haven't been here in forever!  
I can't believe this tiny candy store is still around!  
  
**Saren：**  
Ahahah, and they're still selling yakisoba buns.  
I don't think I ever took issue as a kid,  
but what was a candy stall doing selling yakisoba buns?  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh well!  
I have to get one, for old times' sake.  
  
**Saren：**  
Excuse me, ma'am!  
Could I get a yakisoba bun?  
  
**Saren：**  
Do you remember me?  
Yes, that's me! Saren Sasaki! I always used to play around here.  
It's lovely to see you again.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hee hee.  
She said I got pretty.  
  
**Saren：**  
I never really  
set out to change anything by myself.  
But everything is a lot different from when I was a kid.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm kind of glad that this one candy stall  
didn't change at all.  
  
**Saren：**  
{player}?  
Are you going to buy some candy, too?  
  
**Saren：**  
We need to support our local businesses!  
Think how sad we'd be if such a nostalgic place closed down.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh, but...  
Why did you want  
to bring me here all of a sudden?  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm not complaining.  
I'm happy to relive all these memories.  
  
**Saren：**  
Ah.  
You wanted to thank me  
for helping you out in Astrum?  
  
**Saren：**  
I relied on you just as much!  
That's really nice of you, though.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm glad.  
Thanks for doing this for me.  
  
**Saren：**  
It's because you're so kind  
that we've managed to stay friends for so long.  
  
**Saren：**  
Even back when I was poor,  
and the butt of everyone's jokes...  
  
**Saren：**  
...You called out to me,  
gave me your yakisoba bun,  
and played with me until we were both filthy with dirt.  
  
**Saren：**  
Thank you, {player}.  
I'm really, really happy that I met you.

**Ameth：**  
Hmmm.  
This time she seemed far more comfortable with you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Looks like you got some of your memories back, too...  
It seems the more coherence you gain,  
the more you resemble your past self.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Even Saren seemed to be enjoying herself.  
I wonder, maybe it was because she didn't need to fret  
about the tiny details for once?  
  
**Ameth：**  
She always looks so serious,  
toiling away at her work.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Here, though, she was giggling and carefree,  
just like a child.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Actually, I think you're the only person who allows her  
to cast off her obligations, like being student council president  
and acting ladylike.  
  
**Ameth：**  
And because you played together as children,  
you can help her relax and connect with her on a deeper level.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Treat her well, {player}.  
Precious bonds like the ones between childhood friends  
are hardly easy to come by, even if you seek them out.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Anyway.  
My apologies for intruding on your pleasant outing  
with the young lady...  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'll take my leave here.  
Bye for now.  
  

---  
  
**Saren：**  
{player}?  
What's the matter?  
Are you stuck in a daydream?  
  
**Saren：**  
Come on, pull yourself together.  
Look! I just bought us some coffee.  
  
**Saren：**  
Drink up.  
Get some caffeine into your bloodstream,  
so you can shake off the drowsiness.  
  
**Saren：**  
I can't have you nodding off on me.  
I know you must be really tired too,  
but still...  
  
**Saren：**  
It'd be pretty lonely  
if you weren't conscious enough to keep me company.  
  
**Saren：**  
*munch munch*  
Hm?  
Oh, right. I felt peckish while picking up the coffee,  
so I bought a snack too.  
  
**Saren：**  
See? A yakisoba bun!  
  
**Saren：**  
I bought one for you, too. Here.  
Think of it as thanks for keeping me company today.  
  
**Saren：**  
Hmm?  
What's wrong? You're making such a strange expression.  
Aren't you a fan of yakisoba buns?  
  
**Saren：**  
Huh?  
Yes. Saren, that's me.  
Why did you sound so... fond when you said it this time?  
  
**Saren：**  
Sorry?  
Did you just say... we've met before?  
  
**Saren：**  
It all came flooding back  
when you bit into the yakisoba bun?  
And you remembered everything... about me?  
  
**Saren：**  
You remembered...?  
Wait, you mean, that boy from my past was you?  
My childhood friend?  
  
**Saren：**  
I see...  
To be honest,  
  
I thought you might be him.  
  
**Saren：**  
Ahahah.  
It's just a feeling  
for you, too?  
  
**Saren：**  
You forgot  
pretty much everything, isn't that right?  
Your amnesia seems like quite a severe case.  
  
**Saren：**  
It's okay, you don't have to rush to remember.  
For now, I'm happy that you  
believe you're him.  
  
**Saren：**  
We're in the same boat  
since my memories are hazy too.  
  
**Saren：**  
Well then.  
How about that?  
I'm really happy.  
  
**Saren：**  
Thank you...  
for remembering me.  
  
**Saren：**  
I mean it.  
I'm really happy we met each other again, {player}.
