**Saren：**  
Eep!  
Oh, drat. It's so windy today!  
  
**Saren：**  
What was I thinking, checking important documents as I walked...?  
As soon as I started, a strong gust blasted them everywhere.  
  
**Saren：**  
Useless, useless, useless.  
The whole idea was to be efficient with my walking time,  
and now look.  
  
**Saren：**  
If they get blown away now, I'll have to write them up anew.  
That's the opposite of efficient!  
I really have no right to scold Suzume for her clumsiness, do I?  
  
**Saren：**  
Those papers contained personal information,  
so I can't very well leave them scattered to the winds...  
I'd better start looking around so I can pick them up.  
  
**Saren：**  
I swear. Look at all this extra work I've given myself.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh?  
Hey, now...  
You, over there! What are you doing?  
What business could you have here of all places?  
  
**Saren：**  
This is the royal palace where the monarch lives, so ordinary citizens can't enter.  
You could easily get arrested by the palace guards if you wander in here.  
  
**Saren：**  
Honestly,  
what is Nightmare thinking?  
Their security needs some tightening up.  
  
**Saren：**  
Maybe they aren't as focused on keeping people out since things are so peaceful lately?  
  
**Saren：**  
Still, think of what a crisis we'd all be in if something did happen.  
And to Her Majesty, at that.  
 Ugh... I may have left Nightmare,  
but I still feel somewhat responsible.  
  
**Saren：**  
No, I can't leave this be.  
Though, that's right... I do have to go pick up those documents...  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm?  
What are you...?  
Are those papers you're holding... my documents?  
  
**Saren：**  
They are!  
Those are mine!  
No wonder I couldn't find them. You picked them all up for me!  
  
**Saren：**  
Thank you.  You just took care of a job on my list.  
Though... did you sneak a look?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  A look at what?  
**Choice: (2)**  I didn't peek under your skirt, no.  
`Tag 1`  
**Saren：**  
Hmm.  
Then I suppose I must've caught you  
right as you picked them up.  
  
**Saren：**  
Sorry to ask this,  
but could you pass them to me now? While they're still blank side up?  
  
**Saren：**  
There's private information written on those pages,  
so I'd rather other people didn't see them.  
  
**Saren：**  
I don't want to have to rough anyone up,  
so your cooperation is appreciated.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Saren：**  
Wh-what?!  
Under my...!  
Where did that come from?! Behave yourself!  
  
**Saren：**  
It doesn't matter how windy it gets;  
a young lady knows never to let her skirt ride up!  
I made sure to cover myself. So you didn't see anything...  
right?  
  
**Saren：**  
Yuck, try to have a little more decorum the first time you meet someone!  
A-anyway...  
Could you hand over the documents?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Saren：**  
Wonderful, thanks.  
Oh, that's right. I forgot they were all in envelopes.  
  
**Saren：**  
Great! The documents inside look good, too.  
Which means I won't have to write any up again!  
  
**Saren：**  
You've really helped me.  
What's your name, sir?  
  
**Saren：**  
I have a lot on my plate right now, but...  
I'll be sure to make it up to you very soon.  
Can I ask which guild you belong to?  
  
**Saren：**  
Ohhh.  
You're {player}?  
And you aren't registered with a guild yet?  
  
**Saren：**  
You must have traveled here from somewhere else,  
since Landosol's tough to navigate without a guild.  
If you aren't sure how to register, I could tell you as thanks.  
  
**Saren：**  
Though, that'll have to be some other time...  
I have work to do, so I have to go now.  
  
**Saren：**  
Just a little advice before I go.  
If you don't want people to think you're up to something,  
I'd avoid loitering around the palace.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oops,  
where are my manners? I need to introduce myself, too.  
  
**Saren：**  
I'm Saren.  
I run a guild called Sarendia Orphanage.  
 With a bit of luck,  
we'll see each other again soon, {player}!
