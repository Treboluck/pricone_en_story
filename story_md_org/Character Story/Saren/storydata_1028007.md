**Saren：**  
Hmmm, what to do? My whole schedule's thrown off now.  
That business meeting was supposed to take almost an hour,  
and now it's canceled.  
  
**Saren：**  
Argh. Give me some advance warning if you're going to cancel on me!  
They probably think they can treat me however they like because I'm  
young.  
 Fine, then. I'll use this time to sharpen up for our next meeting.  
  
**Saren：**  
What to do, what to do?  
I could go check in on the Sarendia Orphanage,  
but by the time I get there it'll be time to leave for my next meeting.  
  
**Saren：**  
It wouldn't be much fun to show up late for that.  
That said, I hardly like the idea of wandering around the plaza  
for the best part of an hour.  
 I never know how to kill time.  
  
**Saren：**  
It's been a long time since I had absolutely nothing to do.  
I guess I could go window shopping?  
  
**Saren：**  
Ah, but I need to save money.  
Once I see something in the store, I'll want to buy it...  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh?  
Hey, that's {player}!  
  
**Saren：**  
Why in the world are you here, of all places?  
And just sitting, staring into space! Is it your stomach? Does it hurt?  
  
**Saren：**  
You don't have anything to do?  
What, no odd jobs today?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Nope, I'm not doing anything.  
**Choice: (2)**  What are YOU doing, young lady?  
`Tag 1`  
**Saren：**  
Well...  
Yes, that much is clear.  
  
**Saren：**  
You might be a bit TOO carefree.  
You only live once, you know. You don't want to fritter your life away.  
Though I suppose everyone feels different about that.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Saren：**  
\"Young lady\"?  
Are you trying to be cute?  
I'll let you off the hook since we're about the same age, though.  
  
**Saren：**  
I've been up to my ears in business meetings with adults,  
so it's kind of refreshing to get called that as a joke.  
  
**Saren：**  
Right now, I'm... No, never mind. I'm not doing anything either.  
The merchant I was supposed to meet canceled,  
and now I'm swimming in free time.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Saren：**  
{player}?  
Would it be okay if we spent this free time together?  
  
**Saren：**  
Since you're not doing anything either.  
But don't feel pressured if you'd rather just sit.  
  
**Saren：**  
You want to hang out?  
Great, I'm glad to hear it.  
  
**Saren：**  
That being said, I have to admit I'm not great at letting time pass idly by.  
I've always filled up every minute with studying or chores since  
I was little, so I'm not much fun...  
  
**Saren：**  
Even now my days are packed full of work.  
Maybe I should've let my hair down more, so I'd know what to do with  
free time when I have it. Gosh, listen to me. How dull can a girl get?  
  
**Saren：**  
When I was really young,  
there was this one guy who would join in  
no matter what silly game I thought up.  
  
**Saren：**  
I wonder where he is now. How is he spending his time?  
  
**Saren：**  
That's right, I mentioned him earlier.  
It's the boy who gave me such a passion  
for yakisoba buns.  
  
**Saren：**  
After we met that day, we would run into each other and play games.  
You could call us childhood friends.  
  
**Saren：**  
I wonder why I can't remember his name, or even his face?  
You'd think I could manage that.  
Especially since we were so close... I was very fond of him.  
  
**Saren：**  
Perhaps I actually...  
made him up since I was so lonely. A perfect playmate.  
  
**Saren：**  
Maybe he was my imaginary friend all along!  
Haha, imagine!  
  
**Saren：**  
Hm?  
What are you doing, {player}?  
  
**Saren：**  
Are you... watching ants? Why?  
You're way too old to be this fascinated.  
Is watching them really that fun?  
  
**Saren：**  
Ahahah. All those other ants are working as hard as they can to carry  
those crumbs back home, but there's one lazy little fellow who isn't  
doing any work at all.  
 There's a slacker in every group, it turns out.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh?  
You want to know what food I brought?  
Why, are you hungry, {player}?  
  
**Saren：**  
You...  
You want to give the slacker ant something to eat, so he'll move around?  
  
**Saren：**  
I remember  
doing something similar with that friend of mine, a long time ago.  
  
**Saren：**  
He was the sort of guy that could make a game out of just  
about anything. Everyday we spent together was so, so fun.  
Enough to make me completely forget about work or study.  
  
**Saren：**  
I don't regret it one bit.  
I was so happy just to be with him, even if we did nothing at all.  
That was a really precious time in my life.  
  
**Saren：**  
{player}...  
You have amnesia, don't you?  
  
**Saren：**  
So...  
There's a chance that, maybe, you could be... *{player}.*  
  
**Saren：**  
No, I mustn't be silly.  
  
Though it would be nice... If you turned out to have been him all along.  
What a lovely coincidence that'd be. Like something out of a storybook.  
  
**Saren：**  
Haha.  
Anyway, I'll go fetch us something to eat from one of the stalls.  
  
**Saren：**  
Wait, actually,  
why don't we walk around and see what's available?  
Come help me kill some time.  
  
**Saren：**  
That way,  
I can treat you to whatever you'd best like to eat.  
But don't go thinking you can get fed for free, now.  
  
**Saren：**  
If you want to eat, you have to work for it.  
Right, {player}?
