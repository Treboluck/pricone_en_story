## Subtitle: Whatever You Like Best!
  
**Narration：**  
Today, {player} has agreed to go shopping with Akari.  
  
**Akari：**  
Wow, {player}, you're here early!  
I didn't keep you waiting, did I?  
  
**Akari：**  
You just got here too?  
Well, isn't that perfect!  
Right then, shall we get going?  
  
**Akari：**  
What are we going to buy, you ask?  
Well, actually...  
 Let's make that a surprise for when we get there!  
The store is over this way.  
  
**Akari：**  
Eheheh...  
This is the first time we've been out on a trip like this, right?  
It's kind of exciting, don't you think?  
  
**Akari：**  
Oh, here's the store I was after.  
This one right here!  
  
**Akari：**  
That's right, it's a lingerie store!  
The other day, my favorite pair of panties got a tear in them...  
So I was hoping to buy a replacement!  
  
**Akari：**  
And if I'm buying a new pair anyway,  
I thought I should get a second opinion on what looks cutest!  
Let me know what you really think, OK?  
  
**Akari：**  
Huh? Well, yes, this store only sells ladies' underwear...  
But don't worry, you'll be fine as long as you're with me!  
  
**Akari：**  
Come on, let's go in! I need to hear your honest opinions,  
so don't get all shy on me!  
  
**Akari：**  
Wowww! Look at all the variety!  
  
**Akari：**  
Look, {player}... These ones are practically see-through!  
Aren't they the cutest?  
  
**Akari：**  
Or how about... these ones tied at the sides with ribbons?  
Are they more your style?  
  
**Akari：**  
How about it, {player}?  
Which do you think is cuter?  
  
**Akari：**  
They're both far too racy...?  
 Oh, don't be so silly!  
They're for special occasions, you know?  
  
**Akari：**  
It's not every day I get to ask your opinion,  
so I want to pick out an extra special pair!  
  
**Akari：**  
C'mon, {player}!  
Which is cutest, the see-through pair,  
or the one with the ribbons?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  The see-through pair.  
**Choice: (2)**  The ribbons.  
`Tag 1`  
**Akari：**  
You want to be able to see through my panties?  
Sheesh, {player}, you're such a perv!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Akari：**  
You like panties that look like they could fall right off, huh?  
Maybe you're wilder than I thought...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Akari：**  
Hee hee, I'm just kidding.  
You were brave enough to pick them for me,  
so I'll go try them on right away!  
  
**Akari：**  
You can never tell how cute they'll really look  
until you've actually worn them, you know?  
After I get changed, I'll ask you what you think!  
  
**Female Customer 1：**  
Eeeek!  
Why's there a *boy* loitering in the store?!  
Could he be a pervert?!  
  
**Female Customer 2：**  
He must be a predator!  
Somebody! Call Caon for help!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Run for it.  
`Tag 4`  
**Akari：**  
Hey, {player}! I finished trying them on!  
I knew I could count on you! They were so...  
  
  
**Akari：**  
H-huh? {player}...?  
{player}, where did you go?  
  
**Narration：**  
But {player} was nowhere to be seen,  
so that was the end of that shopping trip.
