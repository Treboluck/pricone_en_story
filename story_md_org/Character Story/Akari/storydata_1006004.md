## Subtitle: You Teach Me So Much!
  
**Narration：**  
Akari and {player} are just heading out  
when suddenly, they are surrounded by a mysterious light.  
  
**Akari：**  
Wh-what's going on?! It's all shiny!  
  
**Akari：**  
{player}!  
I'm scared... Aaaaahhhhhh!  
  

---  
  
**Akari：**  
*pant*... *pant*... {player}... You're pushing me too hard!  
This is... too much... I can't... breathe!  
  
**Akari：**  
I-I'm so sorry...  
Let me take just a little break...  
  
**Akari：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
{player}... You really know how to wear a girl out...  
  
**Akari：**  
Though I am grateful  
that you're helping me with my sax practice...  
  
**Akari：**  
It's only because you're such a good teacher  
that I managed to do it this well!  
  
**Akari：**  
At this rate, I might even be able to perform okay  
at next week's big march...  
  
**Akari：**  
But... Um...  
I still don't have enough confidence...  
  
**Akari：**  
I mean, I still haven't managed to pull off  
the most exciting part of the song...  
  
**Akari：**  
'Cause in this part... The finger movements are so intense!  
  
**Akari：**  
I don't think I can hold on until the end...  
It's too much for me to take...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You've just gotta power through it!  
**Choice: (2)**  Take it slowly, and you'll get there.  
`Tag 1`  
**Akari：**  
What? Right here, right now?  
In front of you?  
B-but... I'd be too embarrassed...  
  
**Akari：**  
I know I'll just mess it up...  
And besides...  
P-pushing my body that hard... It's kind of scary...  
  
**Akari：**  
...Huh?  
You know I can do it...?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Akari：**  
Are you... sure?  
  
**Akari：**  
...All right, then.  
I shouldn't doubt your words...  
  
**Akari：**  
My heart races so fast when you're watching me,  
I don't know if I'll be able to stay calm, but...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Akari：**  
Okay then!  
I'll see what I can do!  
  
**Akari：**  
...  
  
**Akari：**  
O... Oh, wow!  
When I followed the advice you gave me,  
I made it all the way to the end!  
  
**Akari：**  
I don't think I've ever... felt this way before...  
  
**Akari：**  
If I was on my own, I think I'd still have been scared  
even when the big day arrived...  
  
**Akari：**  
But now, thanks to your help,  
I know I've got it in me to play the whole thing!  
  
**Akari：**  
So... {player}...  
I really am incredibly thankful!  
  
**Akari：**  
But... just saying it with words doesn't really feel like enough  
to express my gratitude...  
If only there was some more special way...  
  
**Akari：**  
I know! Listen, {player}!  
I think I'd like to thank you  
using my body!  
  
**Akari：**  
I'll put everything I've got  
into a performance just for you!  
  
**Akari：**  
Heheh!  
Sit back and relax, and enjoy the song, okay?

**Ameth：**  
How did you like that? A little present from me!  
Was it a nice enough dream?  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just saw was a \"dream\" I created for you and Akari  
using fragments of your memories.  
Did it ring any bells?  
 Well, I suppose you wouldn't know.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But if you manage to collect even more memories,  
I'll show you more dreams like this one.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Dreaming of your memories with all sorts of different girls...  
That's your shortcut to the truth of this world.  
So good luck!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, I'll see you around!

**Akari：**  
H-huh...?  
Was I just... sleeping out here in the open?  
  
**Akari：**  
I feel like I had the most unusual dream...  
  
**Akari：**  
...Huh?  
You just had a dream about helping me with sax practice too?  
  
**Akari：**  
That's just like my dream...  
Coincidences are a crazy thing!  
  
**Akari：**  
You know, you're always teaching me  
all sorts of amazing new things...  
But I never thought you'd even teach me in my dreams...  
  
**Akari：**  
I guess that means you're such a big part of my life  
I can't live without you anymore!  
  
**Akari：**  
Eheheh! I really mean that, you know?  
  
**Akari：**  
I know, {player}!  
Let's go somewhere where you can teach me lots and lots right now!
