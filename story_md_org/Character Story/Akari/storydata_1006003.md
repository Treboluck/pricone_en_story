# Akari Episode 3
As part of her stamina training, Akari attempts to do some tree-climbing. At first she struggles to reach the branches, but with {player}'s help, she manages to reach the top. Of course, then she also needs his help getting back down...
  
## Subtitle: Train Me, Coach!
  
**Akari：**  
{player}... Are we really going to do it?  
I-in a place like this?  
  
**Akari：**  
But this... It's so... So big and thick,  
and rugged too...  
  
**Akari：**  
Ahhh! {player}! Don't push me so suddenly!  
Ahh... I touched it... It's so rough and hard...  
  
**Akari：**  
{player}...  
I really don't think I can climb such a big tree!  
  
**Akari：**  
It's important training? You think?  
But, um... I'm not sure what climbing trees  
has to do with the sax...  
  
**Akari：**  
Tree-climbing doesn't just build stamina,  
it also builds muscles, huh?  
  
**Akari：**  
Th... That makes sense.  
Physical strength is pretty important when playing the sax, too!  
  
**Akari：**  
You're amazing, {player}...  
 No, Coach!  
I swear  
 I'll follow your training as long as I live!  
  
**Akari：**  
...But, um... Climbing trees is still... a bit scary.  
Have you seen how big and tall this tree is?  
If I fell from up there, I could really hurt myself...  
  
**Akari：**  
I won't get hurt, because you'll catch me?  
Well, that is pretty reassuring!  
  
**Akari：**  
All right, let's do this.  
{player}! I hope you're watching closely!  
Here goes!  
  
**Akari：**  
Ahhh!  
I can't hold on!  
Ahh... {player}... I'm no good at this...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Keep it up!  
**Choice: (2)**  You call that an attempt?!  
`Tag 1`  
**Akari：**  
O-okay!  
If that's what it takes to satisfy you,  
I'll do everything I can!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Akari：**  
Ohhh...  
You're such a bully sometimes.  
I really am trying my best, you know...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Akari：**  
Huh?!  
I'm not going home until I reach the top?  
I-I guess I really do need to try harder, then...  
  
**Akari：**  
Well, here goes nothing!  
Haaaahhhh!  
  
**Akari：**  
Ughhh... It's like I just bounce right off...  
Hngh! Hahh! Take that!  
  
**Akari：**  
No matter how I try, it just doesn't seem to work...  
Even the lowest branch is really high up,  
so I can't reach it at all...  
  
**Akari：**  
It's no use, Coach...  
I don't think I'll ever be able to climb this tree on my own...  
  
**Akari：**  
Huh? What am I trying to say?  
W-well, you know, um... You're really going to make me say it?  
You big old teaser, you...  
  
**Akari：**  
Umm... Listen...  
{player}... Please would you do it with me?  
  
**Akari：**  
I feel like if you help me,  
I'll be able to go all the way...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Mission accepted.  
`Tag 4`  
**Akari：**  
You really will?!  
Thank you, {player}!  
  
**Akari：**  
But... How are you going to help me climb?  
Huh? You want me to stand on you?!  
N-no way, I couldn't!  
  
**Akari：**  
There's no other way...?  
A-all right, then.  
Then let's do this carefully.  
  
**Akari：**  
Make sure you tell me if it hurts, okay?  
Up I go... Up I go...

**Akari：**  
Ahhh! Hey, {player}!  
I actually reached the branch!  
  
**Akari：**  
Aaahhh! {player}!  
You mustn't look up right now!  
Honestly, you're so naughty sometimes!  
  
**Akari：**  
Just stay where you are, nice and still, OK?  
Up I go...!  
  
**Akari：**  
I did it! I reached the top!  
  
**Akari：**  
...Wait, huh?  
Actually,  
 if I only did it with your help,  
was there really any point...?  
  
**Akari：**  
Huh? What's that?  
You never said I had to do it alone?  
...Now that you mention it...!  
  
**Akari：**  
Then... does this mean I pass?  
 Yaaaay!  
  
**Akari：**  
You promise you'll keep supporting me  
until I've mastered all the training I need?  
Really truly?!  
  
**Akari：**  
Yaaaay!  
I guess I'll try to count on you a bit more, then!  
  
**Akari：**  
So, umm... Listen... The thing is...  
I might have made it all the way up,  
but now I don't know how to get down...  
  
**Akari：**  
C'mon, Coach, you've gotta help me get down!  
Eheheh... See, I'm counting on you already!
