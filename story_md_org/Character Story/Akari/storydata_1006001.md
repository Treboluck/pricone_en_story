**Akari：**  
Ahhh! Did I manage to fall on top of someone?!  
I-I'm so sorry! Are you all right?  
  
**Akari：**  
Huh? You want to know if I'm okay?  
Well... yes! Thanks to you, I don't have a single scratch!  
  
**Akari：**  
You're glad you made it... in time...?  
You don't mean... you were actually *trying* to catch me?!  
  
**Akari：**  
Ohhh!  
Well, thank you ever so much, mister!  
  
**Akari：**  
But, um... you know...  
It was nice of you to save me and all...  
B-but, well... Your hand is kind of...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  On your butt?! When did that—?!  
**Choice: (3)**  It's a good butt. Very firm.

**Akari：**  
It's been there this whole time...  
You're totally latched right on.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Akari：**  
Ooh, really?  
Eheheh, that's sweet of you!  
  
**Akari：**  
Wait, I wasn't looking for compliments!  
Can you just move your hand already?!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Akari：**  
Honestly! You're such a perv, mister!  
Are you trying to make me mad?  
  
**Akari：**  
...Hee hee! I'm just kidding.  
You're a real gentleman who rushed over to save me,  
so I'm sure you didn't do it on purpose!  
  
**Akari：**  
Oh! I should probably stop weighing you down, too.  
Let me get up now.  
Here we go...  
  
**Akari：**  
...There! I really don't seem to be hurt at all...  
All thanks to you, mister!  
Thank you again for doing that!  
  
**Akari：**  
How about you? Are you OK?  
Looks like...  
 you're not scratched or anything. Well, that's good!  
  
**Akari：**  
You can call me Akari!  
Is it okay if I ask your name, too?  
  
**Akari：**  
{player}...?  
Well, isn't that the cutest name!  
  
**Akari：**  
Why was I up that tree in the first place, you ask?  
Actually, my laundry got blown away by the wind...  
I thought I saw it get caught on those branches, but...  
  
**Akari：**  
Huh? Actually that reminds you?  
You found something lying around?  
  
**Akari：**  
Ohhh! You actually found it!  
You really are my savior!  
  
**Akari：**  
That's my favorite underwear of all,  
so I'm glad I didn't lose it!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  U-underwear?  
`Tag 5`  
**Akari：**  
Hmm? Why are you panicking  
 all of a sudden?  
  
**Akari：**  
Oh, don't tell me you're embarrassed  
about handling my underwear?  
  
**Akari：**  
You didn't have any... naughty thoughts just now, did you?  
Ooh! You really are a pervert!  
  
**Akari：**  
Tee hee hee! You don't need to get so flustered!  
But when you go all red like that, you're even cuter!  
  
**Akari：**  
Well, now that I've found my missing laundry, I guess I should head back!  
See you some other time, {player}!  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} was simply no match for this young minx's teasing.
