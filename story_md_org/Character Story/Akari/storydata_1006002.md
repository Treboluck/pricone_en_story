# Akari Episode 2
Akari is working on improving her saxophone technique, and {player} suggests some stamina training. The two of them race each other, until Akari is so worn out that {player} has to carry her home.
  
## Subtitle: I'm at My Limit...!
  
**Akari：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
{player}... This is too much!  
If we keep this up... It's gonna... it's gonna drive me crazy...!  
  
**Akari：**  
Y-you still want to keep going?  
No way...  
  
**Akari：**  
I know I was the one who asked for this, but...  
My poor little body... can't take much more...!  
  
**Akari：**  
...A-all right then...  
Just one more time though, OK?  
I-I'll do my best...  
  
**Akari：**  
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahhhh!  
{player}!  
 I really can't keep going...!  
  
**Akari：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
H-how was I?  
I thought I was pretty fast that time!  
  
**Akari：**  
Huh? My time's gotten worse?  
Aww... B-but... I've run this track dozens of times already!  
  
**Akari：**  
I know I was the one who came to you  
saying I wanted to improve my sax technique  
and asking you to help...  
  
**Akari：**  
And when you said every sax player needs plenty of stamina,  
I couldn't exactly  
 argue with that logic either...  
  
**Akari：**  
But all this running is more than I can physically take!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You really like the sax, huh?  
`Tag 1`  
**Akari：**  
Yes! I love all kinds of music, actually,  
but jazz music is my favorite!  
My papa used to listen to it a lot, so maybe that's why?  
  
**Akari：**  
So I've been trying to learn to play the sax myself,  
but it's tougher than I thought...  
  
**Akari：**  
But trust me, I'm gonna get really good  
and show you an incredible performance someday!  
  
**Akari：**  
And to do that... I need lots of exercise  
to boost my lung capacity... I know that, but...  
  
**Akari：**  
Huh? Let's go one more time?  
Not again so soon... I can't take it!  
Let me rest a little!  
  
**Akari：**  
I've gotta keep up the pace?  
Ahhhh...  
You're so rough with me, {player}...  
  
**Akari：**  
You'll come along with me this time?  
W-well, I guess...  
It'll definitely be more fun if we do it together...  
  
**Akari：**  
All right then, let's do this!  
Ready... Go!  
  
**Akari：**  
Ahh... Ahh... Ahh...!  
Oohhh! {player}...! Don't go so fast!  
  
**Akari：**  
Ahhhh...  
How am I suppose to get better at this?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Put your hips into it.  
**Choice: (3)**  Try to use your arms.  
`Tag 2`  
**Akari：**  
M-my hips?  
You mean like, really clench my muscles?  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Akari：**  
A-All right...  
I'll gently clench my fists... And try some long, sweeping strokes!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Akari：**  
Ahh! Ahh!  
H-how was that?  
Do you think I was doing it right?  
  
**Akari：**  
I was really good...? Really?  
Eheheh! Thank you!  
Compliments from you make me happy!  
  
**Akari：**  
I'll put in lots and lots more practice!  
Unhh... Unhh...!  
  
**Akari：**  
Unhh... *pant* *pant*  
Ooohhh... {player}...  
I think... I'm at my limit...!  
  
**Akari：**  
You must be getting close to your limit too, right?  
I can see your face is bright red!  
  
**Akari：**  
Let's make this our last spurt, then.  
Go for it as hard as we can!  
Ahh! Ahh! Aaahhhh!  
  
**Akari：**  
*pant*... *pant*... *pant*... *pant*...  
Wow, I... I'm totally spent...  
I can't move a single muscle...  
  
**Akari：**  
What's that? You could still keep going?  
Wowww...  
 You sure are full of energy.  
  
**Akari：**  
Well, I guess we're done for today, right?  
But, um... my legs are too weak to stand up...  
I don't think I can head home without resting for a while...  
  
**Akari：**  
Wahh!  
Uh, {player}...?!  
Why are you lifting me onto your back?!  
  
**Akari：**  
Huh? You're going to carry me home?  
  
**Akari：**  
Wowee! Thank you so much!  
I guess I'll take you up on that offer!  
  
**Akari：**  
Heheh... Your big, sweaty back...  
It's so firm... and so strong... It's lovely...  
  
**Akari：**  
If you're going to carry me like this,  
I might want to do this every day...  
  
**Akari：**  
Let's meet up again and do some more secret training.  
Just the two of us, OK?
