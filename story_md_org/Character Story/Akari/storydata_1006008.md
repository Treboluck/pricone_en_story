## Subtitle: Just the Sight of Your Face
  
**Narration：**  
One day, {player} happens to run into Akari in town,  
when suddenly a strange light envelops them.  
  
**Akari：**  
Aaahh!  
Wh-what's all this?!  
  
**Akari：**  
{player}...  
This is... such a strange feeling...  
I-I-I'm floating awaaay!

**Akari：**  
...*sigh*  
  
**Akari：**  
It's no use...  
At this rate, I'm gonna be doomed for sure...  
  
**Akari：**  
Oh, {player}!  
Hello again. Funny seeing you here!  
Actually, just seeing your face makes me feel a bit better!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Is something wrong?  
`Tag 1`  
**Akari：**  
Huh?!  
...Ahaha...  
You really do see right through me, don't you?  
  
**Akari：**  
Actually... the school marching band I belong to  
is going to perform in a parade at the amusement park...  
  
**Akari：**  
I've been practicing for it for ages now,  
but it hasn't been going so well...  
  
**Akari：**  
Oh, I know!  
If I play a little bit for you now,  
could you tell me what you think?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  All right.  
**Choice: (3)**  I don't really know anything about music...  
`Tag 2`  
**Akari：**  
Ahhh...! Thank you so much!  
You're the best, {player}!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Akari：**  
Just give me your honest impressions.  
I've been practicing on my own so long,  
I can't even tell if I'm doing it right or not anymore...  
  
**Akari：**  
You're the only one I can turn to!  
So... please? Will you do this for me?  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Akari：**  
Right, then... Here goes nothing!  
  
**Akari：**  
H-how was that...?  
Did it sound all right to you?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  It was lovely.  
`Tag 5`  
**Akari：**  
You really mean that?!  
Yay!  
  
**Akari：**  
...Eheheh.  
When I thought about how I was doing it for you,  
somehow it felt much better than usual.  
  
**Akari：**  
O-on the big day, there'll be lots of people watching...  
When I think about doing it in front of all those people,  
my heart starts pounding so fast...  
  
**Akari：**  
I get so nervous,  
I can't concentrate on performing.  
  
**Akari：**  
But... Hearing that you liked it has given me  
a little confidence!  
I'll try to play just like that in the real thing!  
  
**Akari：**  
I'll give it everything I've got,  
so if you don't mind, I'd like you to come watch too!  
It's a promise, okay?  
  
**Akari：**  
Woooow... No way... There's so many people everywhere...  
Am I really going to do it in front of all these people?  
  
**Akari：**  
Oh no, oh no... It's almost time to start, but I'm getting nervous...  
After I promised {player} I'd do my best and everything...  
  
**Akari：**  
Ah!  
Is that...?!  
  
**Akari：**  
{player}...!  
  
**Akari：**  
You really came, just like you promised!  
Thank you so much!  
  
**Akari：**  
I hope you enjoy the performance!  
I'll keep my promise too, and do my best!  
  
**Akari：**  
Oh―it's almost time to start...  
I need to get going!  
Well then, {player}, I'll see you in a bit!

**Akari：**  
I-it's really happening...  
Oh, this is bad... The nerves are getting to me!  
  
**Akari：**  
Ahhh... Look at all those faces...  
If I do it with everyone watching,  
it might drive me crazy!  
  
**Akari：**  
...Ah! Around this corner is where I just...  
Then that means...  
  
**Akari：**  
I knew it! There he is!  
He's really watching over me!  
  
**Akari：**  
...Huh? Suddenly I'm not tensing up as much...?  
I feel so much more relaxed...  
This might actually be all right...!

**Akari：**  
{player}!  
Did you see? I did it!  
Thank you for watching!  
  
**Akari：**  
Umm...  
The truth is, when the big performance started,  
I really did get nervous...  
  
**Akari：**  
But somehow, as soon as I saw your face,  
it made me feel super happy and calm!  
  
**Akari：**  
So, um, I couldn't have performed like that  
without your help, {player}!  
Thank you so much for coming!

**Ameth：**  
How was that, hmm? A little present from me!  
Did you have a nice \"dream\"?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I created that \"dream\" based on your old memories with Akari,  
but the choices you made were all you.  
It was fun watching how you handled things.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then, until next time!  
  

---  
  
**Akari：**  
Unhh... Mnhhh...  
...H-huh...? Was I dreaming?  
  
**Akari：**  
Oh, I guess... The two of us fell asleep  
together again, did we?  
  
**Akari：**  
I had the most wonderful dream, you know.  
You were there, and you came to...  
  
**Akari：**  
...Huh?!  
You were just dreaming about me as well?!  
A marching band...?  
 But that's just like my dream!  
  
**Akari：**  
This is the second time we've shared a dream...  
I guess we must share some kind of special connection!  
  
**Akari：**  
It feels like we've been joined together somehow...  
That makes me so happy, you know!  
  
**Akari：**  
I hope we can share another dream sometime...  
We'll have to try sleeping together again!  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} got some very funny looks  
from passers-by who overheard Akari's words that day...
