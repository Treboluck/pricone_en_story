## Subtitle: The Steamy Taste of Happiness
  
**Narration：**  
One day, at the Gourmet Guild's guildhouse...  
  
**Ram：**  
I heard there's a legendary potato.  
Come on, let's go and dig it up.  
  
**Karyl：**  
...  
  
**Karyl：**  
A legendary... potato?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh? An actual suggestion from you?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
A legendary potato, huh?  
I wonder if it's bigger than a monster's head!  
What could it be like?  
 It's crazy to think about it!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If it is spoken of in legends,  
I assume it must be quite the remarkable specimen.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, does this not seem exciting?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hold it, hold it, hold it!  
Hold your horses for a moment, you guys!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're all going with the flow,  
but isn't anyone gonna question this whole thing?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I mean, a legendary potato?  
Where'd you even hear about a thing like that?  
  
**Ram：**  
A fool's question.  
Do you realize how long we've been in this world now?  
  
**Ram：**  
With all that free time,  
how could we fail to unearth a legendary potato or two?  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're not fooling anyone with that nonsense!  
So what, did you spend all your time here hunting for potatoes?!  
  
**Ram：**  
Tch, thought I had 'em.  
  
**Karyl：**  
We all heard that, you know!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So, um, Ram?  
Is it really true that you heard rumors of a legendary potato?  
  
**Ram：**  
Oh yes, that part's true.  
All my research suggests it's the real deal.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
All your research, you say...?  
Hmm? But I thought you were unable to read this world's books...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Emilia and Miss Rem  
were telling me that your world's writing differs from ours...  
  
**Ram：**  
How long do you think we've been here?  
With all that free time, anyone could learn to read and write.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Off you go again with the nonsense...  
  
**Ram：**  
Anyway, the legends are very real.  
I've narrowed down the location, and it's prime harvesting season.  
  
**Ram：**  
Can you really ignore this?  
As the Gourmet Guild?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are you presenting us with a challenge?  
`Tag 1`  
**Ram：**  
...Well, yes.  
I don't mind at all if you take it that way.  
  
**Ram：**  
My legendary potato and I will test  
whether your passion for food is the real deal.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
This is a trial...  
A trial to overcome, my lord...  
 Ahh!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
M-my lord's gaze is alight with passion!  
So you are determined to pass this test!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh, I see, I see!  
Well then,  
 we can't exactly back down now, can we? ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's a potato of legends!  
We have to find out exactly what it tastes like!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Urgh...  
I get the feeling we're being played like a fiddle...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Still, I don't like to back down either.  
I'd feel like a failure if I did...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Then our next mission  
will be a grand Legendary Potato Hunt!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I'm sure it will be an arduous journey.  
Friends, let us ensure we are well prepared.  
  
**Ram：**  
That's the spirit.  
You'd better not mess this up.  
  
**Ram：**  
Hmm?  
What will I be doing, you ask?  
  
**Ram：**  
Well, of course I'm coming too.  
I was the one who brought this up. What do you expect?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh...  
So you're not being a total lazybones for once.  
  
**Ram：**  
Without my careful oversight,  
you people would probably fail to find the potato.  
  
**Ram：**  
\"The real treasure is the bonds we formed on this journey together...!\"  
  
**Ram：**  
Heck no.  
I won't stand for sappy excuses like that.  
  
**Ram：**  
If it's a legend we're after,  
failing to bring it back would be a disgrace.  
  
**Ram：**  
Could you live with the shame?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Do you have to go that far?!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You really want this potato, huh?  
**Choice: (3)**  You really want to go adventuring with us, huh?  
`Tag 2`  
**Ram：**  
...Yes, I do.  
Other food is one thing, but I can't let this potato slip away.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 3`  
**Ram：**  
Hah! You think I'm enjoying this?  
Don't get any funny ideas.  
Our goals just happen to align, that's all.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Pecorine：**  
All righty!  
Well then, members of the Gourmet Guild!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Everyone feeling ready  
 for a potato hunt?!  
  
**Kokkoro & Karyl：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Narration：**  
Soon enough, the members of the Gourmet Guild  
find themselves in mortal peril.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Wha... No way?!  
This forest is blotting out the sun!  
I can't even tell which way we came from!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, please take care to hold tightly onto my hand...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord?  
My lord! That is not my hand at all!  
It is a tentacle monster!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well then,  
 looks like we've found tonight's dinner!  
  
**Ram：**  
Yes, good luck.  
I'll be cheering you on.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You fight too, dammit!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Around the forest, and up to the top of a mountain...  
Look, my lord, Landosol looks so small from here...  
  
**Karyl：**  
It... it feels like... we've already had enough trouble  
for a whole adventure...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
With all this rocky terrain,  
there aren't even any juicy fruits growing to sustain us!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But it's starting to feel legend-y!  
Like we're approaching a big discovery!  
 How crazy is that?!  
  
**Ram：**  
Come on, we've sat around here for long enough.  
  
**Ram：**  
Once you're done healing {player}'s feet, we need to move.  
  
**Ram：**  
There's still a long way to go.  
  
**Karyl：**  
How come *you're* so full of energy...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wahoooo!  
 This is great!  
Who knew there'd be a labyrinth hidden under that mountain hut?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Its paths must be carved into the mountain itself.  
The air is nice and cool,  
 but I worry about cave-ins.  
  
**Karyl：**  
More importantly, why's it chock full of extra-vicious monsters?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's dark and it's cramped!  
I'm so done! I'm going home!  
  
**Ram：**  
Throwing tantrums is for infants.  
Karyl, you're not a bawling baby, are you?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ugh, the nerve...  
What do you think you are, our mother?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord?  
 I would not advise straying too far—  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahhh!  
 It is an exit!  
Everyone, my lord has discovered an exit to these caverns!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Quick, quick, quick!  
We gotta get outta here!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
W-w-wahhhh!  
Everyone run!  
There are fireballs raining down from above!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Who knew that the labyrinth would lead to an active volcano?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord, are you all right?  
We must be careful, or your hair will be singed by the heat.  
  
**Ram：**  
As long as it's just his hair. But we may not be so lucky.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huhhh?!  
What the heck do you mean by—?!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Yeaaarrrghhhhh!  
More monsters, at a time like this?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh~!  
Their bodies are all glowy and red, too!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Will they even be edible after we beat them?  
I'm a little worried...  
 But here goes nothing!  
  
**Ram：**  
If we survive this, the potato is just one step away...!  
  
**Ram：**  
Hurry forth!  
Members of the Gourmet Guild!  
  
**Karyl：**  
A-at this point...  
 It's do or die!  
  
**Ram：**  
\"One step\" was a lie, by the way.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Why, you little!  
You are just the absolute worst!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
P-please try to calm yourself, Miss Karyl.  
At least we succeeded in escaping the monsters...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Even I wasn't ready for such a gigantic pack of them!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But thanks to {player} finding this handy cave,  
we're all safe now!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If we rest here awhile,  
perhaps we can recover the stamina for our potato hunt.  
  
**Karyl：**  
W-we're still doing that?  
Can't we go home and rest now...?  
  
**Ram：**  
Disgraceful thinking.  
It would be a huge waste to return empty-handed now.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Urgh...!  
I... I can't deny what you're saying makes sense...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I believe that line of thought  
is a mental trap that often befalls gamblers...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Still, I will not turn back either.  
My lord still has his heart set on these potatoes, after all.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Exactly!  
All right, let's get back to our legendary potato hunt!  
  
**Narration：**  
Thus the Gourmet Guild continues  
to navigate a great variety of perilous encounters  
until finally, the moment of truth arrives...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I-it's no use... I can't go on...  
We're all gonna die here before we find the prize...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't give in, Karyl!  
If you let the negative thoughts take hold,  
we really will never find the potato!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Potatoes? We already found tons!  
Ancient potatoes! Golden potatoes! Crystal potatoes!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
They all tasted most unique, yes.  
And yet the legendary potato still eludes us.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It is true that we are fast running out of water.  
At this rate, our adventure may end in failure...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  The real treasure is...  
`Tag 6`  
**Ram：**  
\"...the bonds we formed along the way\"?  
I told you I won't accept those sappy excuses.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ram!  
Can you quit wandering off like that?!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You can't just abandon us here!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
K-Karyl...  
You really are getting desperate...  
  
**Ram：**  
A pitiful sight.  
But... don't worry.  
  
**Ram：**  
I just found it.  
The goal of our entire journey.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
D-do you truly mean that, Miss Ram?  
  
**Ram：**  
Yes, it's no lie this time.  
That glittering glow was the legendary potato for sure.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's amazing!  
Then let's go and grab it right away!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Yes, we must.  
Finally, I can fulfill my lord's wishes.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So, Miss Ram, where exactly is the potato...?  
  
**Ram：**  
That's simple.  
It's heading right this way.  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's... \"heading\"...?  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
A beast the size of a mountain!  
But no, that's not all...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Th-that monster...  
It's like it's part of the terrain, and on top of it...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Is it just me, or do those things on its back  
 look like potatoes?  
  
**Ram：**  
They are. Behold the legend.  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're kidding me!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
So the Gourmet Guild finally comes face to face  
with the legendary potato!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Let's do this, guys!  
We'll beat the monster,  
 grab those taters,  
 and return triumphant!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Haaahhhh!  
Full power!  
  
**Karyl：**  
I-I can't stand potatoooooes!  
  
**Monster：**  
GGRUOOOGGHHHH!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whew~!  
That sure was a grand adventure, huh? ♪  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
We encountered many perils,  
but looking back now, they all seem like good memories.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Y-you think so...?  
Me, I think I've had enough adventures for a while...  
  
**Karyl：**  
{player}, surely you feel the same as...  
...Huh? \"When's our next adventure, then?\"  
Oh, give me a break!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You really don't let anything faze you, huh...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, I can understand why {player}  
would be looking forward to more adventures!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We had so much fun today!  
Still, before planning new adventures,  
we need to complete the main goal of this one!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Our main goal, huh...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Ram has holed herself up in the kitchen  
with the legendary potatoes...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
She was most adamant on handling the cooking herself, but...  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hmm... Can't say I'm not worried...  
I mean, in the first place, can Ram even cook?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
That is the question.  
At the Sarendia Orphanage, I have only ever seen  
her sister, Rem, helping out in the kitchen.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Ram, meanwhile,  
usually just sits around elegantly sipping tea.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, you know,  
 Ram's good at brewing tea, isn't she?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
She gave me some once, and it was absolutely delicious!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Brewing tea's one thing,  
but nobody's tasted her actual cooking, right?  
  
**Karyl：**  
We went through hell for those potatoes.  
They'd better come outta there in a half-decent state...  
  
**Choice: (7)**  It'll be fine.  
`Tag 7`  
**Kokkoro：**  
Well, if you are convinced, my lord,  
then I too will look forward to a happy outcome.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yep yep, that's right!  
I can't wait to see what kind of food's in store!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, to have your blind faith...  
Are you sure someone shouldn't go check on her...?  
  
**Ram：**  
Too late for that.  
I'm afraid the deed is already done.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't make it sound so scary!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Ram, do you mean to say the food is ready?  
  
**Ram：**  
Yes, it's complete.  
Prepare to drop your jaws in amazement.  
  
**Ram：**  
This is the dish I made from the legendary potatoes.  
  
**Ram：**  
I call it...  
Legendary Steamed Taters.  
  
**Karyl：**  
L-legendary steamed taters...?!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ahh...  
 They shine with a golden glow...  
And this savory scent is quite irresistible...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Simplicity at its finest!  
It's the perfect way to bring out the ingredients' flavor!  
  
**Ram：**  
I don't like to brag,  
but I'm a master at cooking steamed taters.

**Ram：**  
Now, Gourmet Guild.  
Stuff yourselves before it goes cold.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't say it like that!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  This is good!  
`Tag 8`  
**Pecorine：**  
Ah! That's not fair~!  
I'd better hurry up and dig in too!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I too will taste a mouthful...  
  
**Pecorine & Kokkoro：**  
...Delicious!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...!  
Wowww... It's like it really melts in the mouth!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
It's so perfectly salted,  
I was actually stunned for a moment...  
  
**Karyl：**  
I-is it really that good?  
Then I guess I'll have a bite...  
  
**Ram：**  
Didn't I hear someone shouting that they hate potatoes earlier?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Ngh...!  
I-I didn't mean that!  
 Let's find out the truth right now!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Mmph!  
*munch munch*... *gulp*  
  
**Karyl：**  
...  
  
**Ram：**  
And the verdict?  
  
**Karyl：**  
...I think... I love... potatoes.  
  
**Ram：**  
Then stuff your face all you like.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Arghhhhh, just kill me!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Ah—Miss Karyl!  
 Try not to consume it so fast, or you may choke...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Let us savor the meal.  
The potatoes are not likely to run away.  
  
**Ram：**  
...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahh, this really is so delicious!  
And it's all thanks to our new friend Ram  
who brought us those rumors  
 of the legendary potatoes!  
  
**Ram：**  
Yes, be thankful.  
I'm thankful to all of you, as well.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Thankful to us?  
For helping you find the potatoes, you mean?  
  
**Ram：**  
No, not that.  
  
**Ram：**  
I'm thankful for how you made us all welcome in this world.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Eheheh...  
Hey Ram, c'mon! You should come eat these with us!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
The Gourmet Guild  
is all about eating the tastiest treats in the tastiest ways.

And everyone knows tasty food always tastes better  
 when you eat it with great friends! ♪  
  
**Ram：**  
...All right.  
  
**Ram：**  
If you're going to be that insistent.  
I suppose I'll play by the Gourmet Guild's rules.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Great! ♪  
  
**Narration：**  
And the steamed taters they ate that day  
tasted like friendship and happiness.
