# Ram Episode 1
In order to determine whether the Gourmet Guild poses a threat, Ram tails them in secret. When her cover is blown, she confesses everything, but far from being offended, the Gourmet Guild members praise her for her kind intentions, and she abandons any suspicions she may have had.
  
## Subtitle: Ram's Suspicions
  
**Narration：**  
A few days have passed  
since Emilia and her companions arrived in Astraea.  
  
**Ram：**  
We still don't know  
nearly enough about this strange other world.  
  
**Ram：**  
Rem and Miss Emilia are treating our hosts as friends,  
but it's hard to say for sure if we can trust the people here.  
  
**Ram：**  
It's cute to see Rem be so trusting.  
As for Miss Emilia, she's never been the type to doubt others.  
  
**Ram：**  
With the way they are,  
I have to be the one to act with proper caution.  
  
**Ram：**  
So here I am today,  
trailing the members of the Gourmet Guild, but...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ooh, look at that, Karyl!  
The meat at that stall  
 looks so big and juicy!  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't shout this stuff at the top of your voice!  
Honestly, I'm embarrassed to be seen with you...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh my. My lord's stomach is rumbling.  
Very well, then. I will purchase some for us.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Oh, Koro... Don't just indulge his every whim!  
  
**Ram：**  
...  
  
**Ram：**  
I've been watching awhile, but they're just walking and snacking...  
  
**Ram：**  
They've been going all morning.  
Just how many meals do these people eat?  
  
**Ram：**  
Even when they stop, they just sit on benches and chat...  
  
**Ram：**  
From what I've managed to overhear,  
they just talk about what to eat next,  
or how tasty their last snack was...  
  
**Ram：**  
It's been nothing but food, food, food this whole time.  
  
**Ram：**  
I need to be cautious of them,  
but I'm starting to feel like a fool for bothering.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hm? Over there, isn't that...  
`Tag 1`  
**Ram：**  
Guh.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hm? {player}, is something wrong?  
...Wait, huh~?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Oh my. If it isn't Miss Ram.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Huh, so it is.  
Hey, what're you doing here on your own?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Where's that twin sister you're always with?  
  
**Ram：**  
Well, ah...  
Fine, then. I guess I'll be frank with you.  
  
**Ram：**  
I was trailing you all in secret.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whaaa?!  
You mean, like, spying on us?  
  
**Karyl：**  
Hold up! I can't let that one slide.  
What the heck were you trailing us for?  
  
**Karyl：**  
It's bad enough that *I* have to do this stuff...!  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Ram, why would you do this?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
If you had some manner of business, you could simply have told us...  
  
**Ram：**  
This isn't business I could tell you about.  
But don't get me wrong.  
  
**Ram：**  
I only did this on my personal judgment.  
Rem and Miss Emilia had nothing to do with it.  
  
**Ram：**  
The others are good friends with these people.  
If they're going to hate anyone, I'll make sure it's me.  
  
**Ram：**  
...What?  
Don't stare at me like that. You lecher.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Are you... looking out for your sister?  
**Choice: (3)**  We're not going to hate you.  
`Tag 2`  
**Ram：**  
Well, what do you expect?  
I am Rem's big sister, after all.  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Ram：**  
...It's like you read my mind.  
For such a blank-faced dolt, you're surprisingly sharp.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Ram：**  
Anyway, don't bother losing your trust in Miss Emilia or Rem.  
No matter what you think of my cold cynicism.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
What's that, my lord?  
...  
Yes. I was thinking the same thing.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
Miss Ram, you must be a very kind-hearted person.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes, exactly! ♪  
I was just thinking you seem like such a good girl!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
After all, since we spotted you,  
you've done nothing but worry about Emilia and Rem!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You care about your family so much! ♪  
  
**Ram：**  
...!  
Don't you dare pat me on the head.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Awww!  
Don't be like that, Ram!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're just way too touchy-feely!  
Still, I guess that's not always a bad thing.  
  
**Karyl：**  
See what goofs these guys are?  
They're not gonna get mad just 'cause you didn't trust them.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Heck, that's the hardest part sometimes...  
Wait, why am I seeing myself in this girl?!  
  
**Ram：**  
...  
  
**Ram：**  
I see. How utterly simple-minded.  
I suppose I'll take advantage of your naivete.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Don't say the quiet part out loud!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Sure!  
Take advantage of us all you like~!  
  
**Ram：**  
If you insist, here's a question you can answer.  
  
**Ram：**  
What exactly were you doing all morning?  
As far as I could see, you've done nothing but eat and chat.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Well, we are the Gourmet Guild.  
`Tag 5`  
**Ram：**  
The Gourmet Guild...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's right!  
A guild devoted to enjoying all this world's tasty flavors!  
  
**Karyl：**  
You're the only one devoted to that!  
I just keep getting dragged along...  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
So you say,  
 but lately you have hardly shown any resistance...  
  
**Ram：**  
Barusu told me about your type.  
This is what they call \"tsundere.\"  
  
**Karyl：**  
Who're you calling tsundere?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
When I'm with Karyl, Kokkoro and {player},  
any food we all eat together  
tastes tons better than if I ate it alone!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That's why we always get together to eat like this!  
  
**Ram：**  
Together, huh...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Hm? Oh, I see...  
Yes, that's a great idea!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Listen, Ram!  
Why don't you come and have a bite with us?  
  
**Ram：**  
Me? Join you in this buffoonery?  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
I would also support this idea.  
Rather than following at a distance,  
it seems far more pleasant to have you join us.  
  
**Kokkoro：**  
My lord would also appreciate your company.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Well, it sure does beat being spied on.  
Besides, an extra person means more flavors to share around...  
  
**Karyl：**  
...Ahh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, Karyl...  
You've come so far as a Gourmet Guild member...  
  
**Karyl：**  
F-forget that! You heard nothing!  
That wasn't what I meant to say at all!  
  
**Ram：**  
...  
  
**Ram：**  
Good grief...  
I don't know how to stay wary of you people.  
  
**Ram：**  
Which reminds me of something else.  
Thanks to spending all day trailing you,  
I didn't have time to eat breakfast.  
  
**Ram：**  
So I suppose I may as well join you.  
  
**Karyl：**  
What a cynical way of putting it...  
  
**Ram：**  
I'm not like you, Karyl.  
You won't be seeing my soft side any time soon.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well then, let's get back to the food!  
It's time to show Ram the fruits of our guild's work!  
  
**Ram：**  
Do your best to keep me entertained, at least.  
  
**Karyl：**  
Why are you so damn full of yourself?!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so the group of five  
gorged happily on snacks until they had no room for lunch.
