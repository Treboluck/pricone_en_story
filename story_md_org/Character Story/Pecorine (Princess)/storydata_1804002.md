## Subtitle: Working Incognito
  
**Narration：**  
A few days after {player}'s unwitting visit to the palace...  
This time Pecorine is visiting the city incognito,  
where she helps a lost little girl reunite with her mother.  
  
**Mother：**  
Thank you so much, thank you so much!  
I'm so sorry for the trouble!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No worries!  
I'm glad we found you in the end.  
Right?  
  
**Girl：**  
Yeah!  
Thanks, nice lady!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You're very welcome! ♪  
Now, be careful not to get lost again, OK?  
  
**Mother：**  
Really, I can't thank you enough!  
I don't know how to repay you...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't worry about it!  
I just happened to be passing by.  
  
**Mother：**  
U-um... Listen...  
I'm sure I must be wrong, but...  
Your name wouldn't happen to be Lady Eus—  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh—actually, I'm looking for someone too!  
I should get going.  
Bye-bye now!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Whew, that was a close one...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I finished up all my royal duties  
so that I'd have time to visit the Gourmet Guild,  
but I can't let people know I'm here.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Actually, will they even be home?  
It's a bit of a gamble to drop in without warning...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'm lost too...  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
W-wahh! One lost child after another?!  
Don't worry, I'll help you find your parents...  
Wait... {player}! It's you again!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Heyas! ☆  
I was just about to go and look for you,  
so I'm glad we didn't miss each other!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But what's this about being lost?  
I'm sure you know how to get back to the guildhouse from here.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I got split up from the others...  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
When that happens, you should wait at the last place you saw them!  
That's a good rule to remember, OK? ♪  
  
**Pecorine：**  
For now, why don't we head to the guildhouse together?  
We can wait for Kokkoro and the others there.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ohhh...  
Has all this walking around made you hungry?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Then let's grab a bite before we go!  
I'm actually feeling a bit peckish myself!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...Wait, huh...?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  What's wrong?  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
It looks like I forgot to bring any money.  
Living at the palace, I don't need cash very often,  
so I've gotten into bad habits...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And I bet your money's with Kokkoro, isn't it?  
Then we've got no choice. Let's just head straight home to—  
  
**Man：**  
Is something wrong, Pecorine?  
Or, uh... should I say \"Princess\"?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
W-wahh?! Someone knows I'm a princess?!  
I'll be in so much trouble if it gets out that I...  
 Huh?  
Did you just say \"Pecorine\"?  
  
**Man：**  
Well, dang.  
I only half believed it, but to think our star part-timer Pecorine  
really was royalty all along!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Ahhh!  
You're the owner of that diner I worked at while I was in hiding?!  
  
**Man：**  
Oh! I'm happy you remember me.  
It sounds like you're in trouble. What's the matter?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
We were going to buy some food,  
but I forgot to bring any money...  
  
**Man：**  
Oh, is that all?  
In that case, here—I'll lend you some.  
It's not every day you get to lend money to the Princess herself!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No, I can't accept that! Put it away!  
Oh—but...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If it would be OK, could I handle a shift at the diner again?  
Just enough to pay for a meal for both of us!  
  
**Man：**  
Huh? You wanna work?  
Y-you, the Princess?  
Heck, I don't mind, but... are you sure?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes!  
Oh, but we shouldn't worry Kokkoro and the others,  
so let's leave a message at the information center first.  
  
**Man：**  
One grilled fish platter, ready to serve!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Coming!

**Pecorine：**  
Here's your grilled fish platter, sir!  
  
**Young Man 1：**  
Th-thank you... very much...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No problem!  
All the fish dishes here are sublime,  
so I really hope you enjoy it!  
  
**Young Man 2：**  
H-hey...  
Doesn't that girl look just like Lady Eustiana...?  
  
**Young Man 1：**  
I thought so too...  
But the Princess wouldn't be working at a common diner, right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It's not nice to call it \"common\", you know!  
Anyway, I'm just an ordinary girl who happens to look like the Princess!  
Plain old perpetually peckish Pecorine!  
  
**Young Man 2：**  
Y-yeah, of course!  
No way you'd be the real Princess, huh?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
It takes me back, working at this place again!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm hiding my identity just like I always was,  
but it feels fun now, like I'm playing a little trick!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...I know I probably shouldn't think like that,  
but a little can't hurt.  
  
**Young Man 1：**  
*sigh*...  
If only the real Princess was like you, huh?  
  
**Young Man 2：**  
Don't be ridiculous.  
Real royals are all uptight and superior.  
  
**Young Man 1：**  
Well, yeah.  
None of the nobles spare a thought for us common folk,  
so the Princess won't be any different.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh dear. So this is how people think of me, huh...?  
As royalty, I don't get much chance to interact with citizens,  
so I guess I can't expect them to know any better, but...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I don't want to let people think their voices aren't being heard.  
They should be able to share their opinions with me!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That said, if I revealed myself here,  
I'd just end up causing a scene...  
 I know!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Everyone—it sounds like you have lots of troubles!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm just a regular girl who looks like the Princess,  
but I'm happy to listen to your worries,  
so why not address them to me instead?  
  
**Young Man 1：**  
Are you sure?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
But of course!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I never thought I'd end up playing my own impostor,  
but this is a great chance to hear some honest feedback!

`image display end`  
**Pecorine：**  
I see... I see...  
Your wife barely lets you spend a penny...  
You're lacking manpower for repairs...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huge mystery monster sightings...  
Your secret stash of money vanished...  
There sure are a lot of troubles to go around!  
  
**Young Man 1：**  
Ain't that the truth! Ah, man. If only a tenth...  
no, a hundredth of this stuff could reach the real Princess's ears...  
  
**Young Man 2：**  
It did feel good to get that off my chest.  
Thanks a bunch, girlie!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
No worries!  
I enjoyed learning so much about you guys, too!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I can't do much for the more personal issues,  
but I'll see what I can do about the rest.  
I want to make everyone's lives happier!  
  
**Noble：**  
If you'll excuse me.  
My, my... it's good to see business here is thriving!  
  
**Man：**  
I-it's you...!  
  
**Noble：**  
Is that how you address a benefactor? I'm this diner's savior, if you recall.  
Well, not that I care what you call me  
as long as you pay up what you owe.  
  
**Noble：**  
So...? Tell me, do you have the money?  
If you do not, of course, then as agreed,  
I'll be taking the ownership rights to this establishment.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Manager, you borrowed money from a guy like that?  
  
**Man：**  
Y-yeah...  
My diner was in ruins after the Kaiser battle, so I did borrow money.  
  
**Man：**  
But listen!  
He completely changed the terms of the contract!  
The one I signed was way more reasonable!  
  
**Noble：**  
I'd like to hear less of this baseless slander.  
Didn't we confirm only the other day that my contract  
is just the same as your original copy?  
  
**Young Man 1：**  
As if! I've heard all the rumors!  
About the noble who switches contracts to seize real estate!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Ehhhh?!  
You tryin' to stand up to nobility?!  
  
**Young Man 1：**  
Urgh...  
  
**Noble：**  
Now, now, that's enough. No need to intimidate the innocent.  
I'm terribly sorry about my bodyguard. Though of course,  
if you cause more of a fuss, I may be forced to... you know?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Umm... Excuse me!  
Could I have a quick look at that contract, please?  
  
**Noble：**  
Hm? And who might you be?  
Its contents will mean little to a common girl like yourself,  
but here—this is the contract. Very official, as I'm sure you can see.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Thank you very much.  
Hmmm... *lick*  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Wha—?!  
Did she just *lick* the contract's seal?!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yep, this thing's a fake! ☆  
  
**Noble：**  
Wh-what did you say?  
I've heard enough baseless slander for one day...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I mean, real government stamps don't smear from a little lick.  
Besides, the ink tastes totally...  
 Wait, um, no.  
The emblem's badly crafted, too! Look at these edges!  
  
**Noble：**  
Wh-whaaaat?!  
H-hold your tongue, common girl!  
I won't hear a word of your deceitful nonsense!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You keep calling me \"common girl,\" but aren't you a noble?  
Shouldn't you have noticed, then?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You're speaking to Eustiana von Astraea, the Princess of this kingdom.  
If you doubt my claims, shall we head over to the palace  
and have a little talk about contract forgery?  
  
**Noble：**  
...  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Why, you! As if anyone's gonna believe—  
  
**Noble：**  
S-stop, please!  
...I only glimpsed her from a distance at a recent banquet,  
so I can't say for sure, but... I believe it's really her...  
  
**Noble：**  
I-I'm not entirely sure what you might be doing here, Lady Eustiana,  
but I... I beg you... P-please, forgive my misdeeds...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
What's this? You owned up very quickly!  
I thought you'd be a bit more stubborn...  
  
**Noble：**  
I-I have no desire to question those with authority!  
W-well then... I shall take my leave!  
  
**Ruffian：**  
Ah! Hold on a minute...!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Don't forget to bring the real contract soon!  
Oh, and give other people the proper contracts too!  
If you don't, you might end up regretting it later!  
  
**Man：**  
...  
  
**Young Man 1：**  
Whoa...  
She actually chased the noble off...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Phew... I'm glad that worked out!  
Though I wasn't planning to reveal my identity like this...  
  
**Young Man 2：**  
What an amazing bluff!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
H-huh?  
Could it be they don't believe me?  
  
**Young Man 1：**  
That felt great!  
Man, you've got some nerve...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Well, um, thank you! ...Is that the right reaction?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Did you really lick the seal?  
`Tag 4`  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes! Real seals actually use pretty tasty ink, you know!  
...  
Ahh!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If Kokkoro hears I told you that, she'll probably get mad at me!  
Forget I said anything.  
Licking ink bad!  
 Don't try it at home!  
  
**Man：**  
Th... thank you...  
 so much.  
I'm in your debt.  
I-I don't know how to repay you...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Wahhh! Please don't go all formal on me!  
It's fine to just talk normally, okay?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Besides, there's no need to thank me.  
I'm just a common girl who's great at bluffing, right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Now, my shift's not finished yet,  
so let's get back to work!  
  
**Man：**  
Lady Eus...  
  
Pecorine...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
That rush of customers has finally died down!  
Whew, non-royal work is fulfilling stuff too!  
I could get used to this!  
  
**Man：**  
Thanks again.  
Here, take this.  
The meal you asked for, and your pay.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Thank you very much!  
...Or so I'd like to say, but I really can't accept this money!  
Didn't we agree this was just for the food?  
  
**Man：**  
No, I must insist.  
This is your fair wage, with the food costs subtracted.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes, but... after hearing all that, I'd hate to take it.  
If I'd done better as Princess, you wouldn't be in this mess...  
  
**Man：**  
When you work a full shift, I've gotta pay you!  
Else I'd be no better than that noble.  
Please, take it.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Oh, Manager...!  
  
**Man：**  
Besides... you're just plain old Pecorine  
who's a dead ringer for the Princess, right?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
...?!  
T-  
true enough!  
I'm just the perpetually peckish common girl,  
 plain old Pecorine!  
  
**Man：**  
If you want to support my diner, drop by as a customer anytime.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
All right, then!  
I'll eat so much you'll be swimming in cash!  
See you around!  
  
**Man：**  
Yeah. Later, Pecorine!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
All I wanted was to grab a meal,  
but it turned into a pretty big deal, huh?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  It was fun, though.  
`Tag 5`  
**Pecorine：**  
Yes!  
I had a great time too!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? Those two over there...  
Is that Kokkoro and Karyl walking this way?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Thank goodness.  
Looks like they must've received my message.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
He~y!  
Kokkoro! Karyl!  
Over here!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so the plain old peckish Pecorine  
enjoyed a relaxing day with friends for the first time in a while.
