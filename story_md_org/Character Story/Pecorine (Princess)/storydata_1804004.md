**Narration：**  
Having filled their bellies with monster grub,  
Pecorine and {player} set off back to Landosol  
with piles of remaining meat in tow.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I'm so glad we managed to beat the monster in the end!  
If that thing had made it to Landosol, it really wouldn't have been pretty.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Rebuilding's important,  
but we need to devote resources to external threats too.  
That's what I've learned today.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
There are still so many things we need to take care of,  
but somehow I think it'll work out in the end!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
'Cause I've got my friends...  
 including you on my side!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
If I'm ever in trouble, I know you'll be ready to help me,  
and if you're ever in trouble, I'll help you no matter what!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I may have a lot to learn as a princess,  
but I want to make everyone happy—to give you a happy life!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Huh? This light...  
It seems kind of familiar...  
 Waaaahhh!

**Pecorine：**  
\"Hello, {player}.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"...Huh? No reaction.  
I don't suppose my translator is acting up again?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Oh—so it is at least working.  
You barely reacted, so I was worried for a moment!\"  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I didn't expect to see you again.  
`Tag 1`  
**Pecorine：**  
\"You saw me on TV and thought I'd left already?  
Actually, there's still a little while before my flight,  
so I was taking a stroll, hoping I might bump into you.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"And what do you know, I really did!  
Must be destiny, huh? ♪  
...Well, that last part's mostly a joke, but...\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Hey, {player}.  
If you wouldn't mind too much,  
could you show me around town before I leave?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"I want to see a little more of the place you live in.\"  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Sure.  
`Tag 2`  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Oh, great!  
Then let's get going, shall we?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"This is one of those local shopping districts, right?  
I know all about them!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"I've never visited one myself,  
but I've seen them in Japanese anime and movies.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"We do have them back home too,  
but I love how each country has its own style and atmosphere!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Oh! Awesome!  
There's a Japanese leek sticking out of that shopping bag!\"  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Is that... strange somehow?  
**Choice: (4)**  Are you a big leek fan?  
`Tag 3`  
**Pecorine：**  
\"No, it's not weird or anything,  
but it's not as common a sight in my country,  
so it always left an impression on me when I saw it in Japanese media.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"It's such an interesting sight to me,  
but in Japan, it's just part of daily life... Isn't that neat?\"  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Yes!  
It's the king of all foods, as a topping or an ingredient!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Oh, but that's not really what I meant.  
It's not as common a sight in my country,  
so it always left an impression on me when I saw it in Japanese media.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"It really is just part of daily life here, huh?  
Something about that feels nice!\"  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Woman 1：**  
Hey...  
Isn't that girl over there the visiting Princess What's-her-name?  
  
**Man：**  
Oh, the one from the \"personal knight\" interview?  
Surely there's no way she'd be...  
—It *is* her!  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Could that boy there be her \"knight,\" then?  
He isn't exactly what I'd call dashing...  
but they do look kind of perfect together!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Um, do you think I've been spotted?  
More people must've seen my interview than I thought!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Which is nice, but I wouldn't want to cause any trouble for you...\"  
  
**Choice: (6)**  It's no trouble.  
`Tag 6`  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Are you sure?  
Well, thank you!  
You're always so kind to me.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"But I think we might be drawing a crowd...  
At this rate, we really will cause trouble for this district.\"  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Let's go somewhere else.  
`Tag 7`  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Wh-whoa! You just grabbed my hand!  
You know, {player}, you're so bold sometimes!  
I think that's one of your good features!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Okay, I'll go wherever you lead me!  
Go ahead and whisk me away by the hand! ♪\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"This area seems quiet enough to avoid notice.\"  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Say, did you hear?  
Princess Eustiana was in the shopping district!  
You know, the one from the interview!  
  
**Woman 3：**  
Oh yes, I heard! Apparently she was even with her knight!  
Just now, a reporter from a magazine asked me if I'd seen her!  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Maybe it's not safe here after all...  
Fame is a tricky thing, huh?\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Hmm, what now?  
Maybe I should head straight to the airport?\"  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Do you still have time?  
`Tag 8`  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Huh? Yes.  
My flight's not for a little while.\"  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Then I'll take you somewhere special.  
`Tag 9`  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Somewhere special?!  
 I like the sound of that!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Ooh, a candy shop?!  
There's so much tasty-looking candy!  
And I don't see anyone here who'll make a fuss.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"So this shop only stocks candy aimed at children, huh?  
I love how exciting all the colorful packages look!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"But, um... this is a shame.  
I don't have any cash on me today...\"  
  
**Choice: (10)**  It's my treat.  
`Tag 10`  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Oh, no! I couldn't...!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"You'd like me to choose some candy for us to eat together?  
In that case, I suppose...\"  
  
**Choice: (11)**  Here's our budget.  
`Tag 11`  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Thank you very much...  
 Wait, just 300 yen?  
I don't want to complain about a kind offer...  
but will this really buy us much at all?\"

**Pecorine：**  
\"Wait... These prices are so low!  
I guess we'll be able to buy plenty!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Sweet treats! Sour treats! Salty treats!  
With all these options, it's hard to choose!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"...Oh!  
Choosing like this is part of the fun, huh?!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Enjoying even the lead-up to eating...  
I'm a little jealous of Japanese children now!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Wait right here.  
I'll prove myself by picking out the perfect combination!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"You'd better look forward to it, {player}!\"

**Pecorine：**  
\"How did you like the selection of treats I picked?\"  
  
**Choice: (12)**  It was all tasty.  
**Choice: (13)**  It made me want to chow down more.  
`Tag 12`  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Eheheh.  
Choosing food is one thing I'm good at!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Next time, I'd like to try a selection of your choosing!  
When we do, you'll have to let me treat you, OK?\"  
  
Jump to tag 14  
`Tag 13`  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Eheheh. I know the feeling.  
When you eat sweet things and salty things  
one after another, it's hard to stop!\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Good call setting a budget at the start! ♪\"  
  
`Tag 14`  
**Pecorine：**  
\"I'd love to stay and do lots more fun things with you,  
but it looks like this is it for today.\"  
  
**Bodyguard：**  
\"Lady Eustiana, it's time.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"I had a feeling you'd be watching me from afar,  
but did you really have to show up *now?*\"  
  
**Bodyguard：**  
\"I'm terribly sorry.  
I had hoped to let you fully enjoy yourself,  
but the time of your flight is approaching...\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Whoa! You're right!  
I'm sorry... I was having so much fun, I totally lost track of time!\"  
  
**Choice: (15)**  Sorry about that.  
`Tag 15`  
**Bodyguard：**  
\"Oh, don't worry.  
We lost track of time a little ourselves  
seeing Lady Eustiana have such fun.\"  
  
**Bodyguard：**  
\"I hope you will continue to be a good friend to Lady Eustiana,  
Mr. {player}.\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Wh-whoa!  
They don't want to let you get away, {player}!\"  
  
**Choice: (16)**  I hope I'll see you again a lot.  
`Tag 16`  
**Pecorine：**  
\"Wh-when you get all serious,  
I feel extra embarrassed for trying to make light of it...\"  
  
**Pecorine：**  
\"But, well...  
 yes!  
I hope I'll see you again soon, {player}!\"  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Uh, hold up.  
Are you really going to end up as Pecorine's personal knight?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, I suppose you'd probably make it work somehow...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Either way, it's not like my words can reach you right now,  
so I'm basically just talking to myself.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel lonely,  
but I'll work hard to see you again,  
so you and Pecorine work hard together too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well then... See you later.  
  

---  
  
**Pecorine：**  
Mnhhh...  
 Huh?  
Was I eating tasty treats just now...?  
  
**Pecorine：**  
And I feel like  
{player} said something that made me really happy...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
{player}, my personal knight...  
  
**Pecorine：**  
I guess you're... still asleep?  
Eheheh. You look so sweet and innocent, sleeping like a baby.  
  
**Pecorine：**  
You may not seem like one right now,  
 but even so...  
To me personally, you'll always be my perfect knight.  
  
**Narration：**  
And Pecorine gazed happily  
at {player}'s sleeping face for a while.
