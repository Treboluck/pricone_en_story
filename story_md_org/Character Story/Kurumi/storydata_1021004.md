**Kurumi：**  
Hi!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehehe...  
Let's go shopping together  
again today! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Though...  
I wasn't asked  
to run any errands today.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
So...  
let's go shopping for things that you want!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You're always helping me  
by carrying my bags...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
The least I can do  
is show you around shops you might like...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Some shops make me  
hesitant to go in by myself...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But I'll be fine if I'm with you...  
You really are a huge help all the time!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehehe...  
It's the start of the month, so I just got my allowance.  
So if I see anything I like, I might want to take a closer look...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I hope I find some  
Magical Girl Bella-Lou merchandise... ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
What?  
You've never heard of  
Bella-Lou?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
She's a character based on a legendary hero from this country,  
who really existed long ago.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Years ago,  
an acting troupe put on a play about Bella-Lou...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
That play was a huge hit,  
so they've continued the story as a series, changing up the characters every so often.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
It's mostly geared toward children,  
so they've made stationery, picture books, and toys of the characters.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
The designs are meant to appeal to children,  
and there's all sorts of other merchandise too!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Collecting those goods is sort of my hobby...  
I've loved Bella-Lou ever since I was little...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I picked out these clothes  
and my bell-shaped hammer  
so I could be just like Bella-Lou... ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehehe,  
maybe it's childish of me...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But I want to be strong and kind,  
just like Bella-Lou...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Eeek!  
Wh-what's happening?!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Your whole body is glowing...  
Just like in a magical girl's transformation scene!  
  

---  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Umm, {player}!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I...!  
I'm, um...!  
I'm so happy! What do I do?!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh?!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ow, ow...  
Please, don't give me a noogie!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Are you trying to calm me down?  
You could've just said so...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
*sniffle*...  
You can be  
kind of mean sometimes...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Don't touch my head so much.  
I'm wearing my favorite ribbon today...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehehe...  
That's right,  
it's the ribbon you picked out for me! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You helped me go shopping  
when I was all flustered...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You came to my rescue,  
remember?  
This ribbon brings back fond memories...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehehe...  
I've calmed down,  
now that I'm talking to you.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um...  
I forget if I told you,  
but I'm in the drama club at my elementary school.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
It's actually a serious club  
where lots of professional actors got their start...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
We have a lot of club members, too...  
But somehow, I...  
got a part in the next play!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Not only that,  
but it's a play about Magical Girl Bella-Lou...  
I-I get to share the stage with Bella-Lou herself.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ohh, this feels like a dream! ♪  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Congrats!  
**Choice: (2)**  What's your part?  
`Tag 1`  
**Kurumi：**  
Thank you!  
Hehehe!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I knew  
you'd share my excitement.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You were worried about my social anxiety  
and helped me overcome it, after all.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
It's all thanks to you  
that I got a part. ♪  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Kurumi：**  
Hahaha.  
I was hoping to get  
the lead role of Bella-Lou, but...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I'm not quite ready for a lead role,  
so I'm a sub-heroine...  
I guess you could call it a supporting role.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But it's a pretty important part,  
so I'm going to give it my all!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
The lead role of Bella-Lou  
has a quick costume change during the transformation scene...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But that seemed too difficult  
for me to do.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kurumi：**  
Ahhh...  
My heart feels so light and fluffy.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
It really hasn't sunk in yet.  
It doesn't feel real.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I've had my head in the clouds all week.  
I even worried my parents.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehehe.  
I can't just keep celebrating,  
though...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I finally got a speaking part.  
I need to practice lots!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I hope you'll help me  
overcome my fears again sometime,  
 {player}! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
It's no problem.  
I'll send you tickets  
for the play.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I want you to see  
my big moment on stage,  
since you taught me so much.  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Haha.  
Kurumi's a lot more energetic  
than usual.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Seeing a child get excited like that  
puts a smile on my face, too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I hope her play is a success.  
I wish I could see it for myself.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She gave you tickets,  
so you went to the show, didn't you?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Maybe I could  
watch your memories to see the play.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oops.  
Sorry, I was just thinking out loud.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You probably don't get what's going on,  
so allow me to briefly explain.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just saw was like a dream.  
You'll forget it as soon as you wake up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'll explain it in detail someday.  
Don't worry too much about it for now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I forgot that Kurumi loves plays,  
and is aspiring to become  
an actress.  
  
**Ameth：**  
She doesn't really show  
that side of herself over \"here\".  
  
**Ameth：**  
If I recall correctly,  
she was encouraged to join the drama club by her parents,  
who were concerned about her social anxiety.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Since her parents are Lost,  
that path no longer exists.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But that will get repaired over time,  
so Kurumi will be able  
to act in plays over \"here\", too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Those who are Lost, not to mention the Shadows...  
All those abnormalities are just some unnatural bugs  
that appeared as a result of the Reconstruction.  
  
**Ameth：**  
If we keep making repairs and remove those bugs,  
Kurumi will be able to return to her regular life.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'll work hard  
to make that happen.  
I hope you will, too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
As if!  
You won't remember any of this later,  
obviously.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Whoops.  
That's enough idle chitchat.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I think I'll be going, now.  
See you!  
  

---  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Are you okay,  
{player}?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You were just lost in thought?  
All right,  
as long as you're not feeling sick...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I don't have any urgent errands today,  
so I'd feel bad if I was making you come with me...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wh-what?  
Oh my gosh...  
Why are you pulling me by the hand?!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh?  
You want me to look over there?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh...  
There's a big crowd  
over there, huh?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Is... Is that...  
What?! It's Bella-Lou!  
Bella-Lou is here!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I think a saleswoman is cosplaying as her  
to promote some new merchandise.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wow, she did a great job on her costume! ♪  
That's Bella-Lou's princess form,  
from season three!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I wanna see her up close!  
But... ahh,  
I don't want to go into that crowd...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ahhh!  
You're putting me  
on your shoulders?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I'm not a little kid. This is embarrassing!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Haha...  
I suppose I am acting like a little kid,  
getting all excited because my favorite magical girl is here... ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Yes...  
I can see Bella-Lou from here.  
Ohh, she's so lovely...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-it looks like they're selling merchandise...  
The line is pretty long,  
but is it okay if we get in line?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Urgh...  
And after I said I wanted to prioritize  
your shopping today...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh?  
You don't mind?  
Are you having fun, too?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I'm relieved to hear you  
say that.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I hope I become strong  
like Bella-Lou one day...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I can't use magic,  
and I still need a lot of help...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But I'll try my best.  
I promise to improve...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
And one day,  
I hope to truly pay you back for all your help!
