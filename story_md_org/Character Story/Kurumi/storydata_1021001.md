**Kurumi：**  
Oh... *whimper*  
Um, uh?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Uh... Um...  
E-excuse me.  
  
**Young Man：**  
Hm?  
What's the matter, little lady?  
Why the tears?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Eek! N-Never mind,  
I... I'm fine. I'm sorry!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
*whimper* Oh...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-I ran away...  
I just can't do this. I'm terrified of strangers...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But I'm... lost.  
I need to ask someone for directions!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
If I'm late getting back,  
everyone at the Sarendia Orphanage will be worried!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I-if I cause problems...  
They might kick me out because they think I'm a pain.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh... Um...  
*whimper* Um...  
 E-excuse me...  
  
**Old Man：**  
Yes, can I help you?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um... Well, I wanted to ask for...  
I... I'm lost...  
  
**Old Man：**  
Sorry, at my age I'm losing my hearing.  
Could you speak a bit louder?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
S-speak... louder?  
Um, I, uh...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
S-sorry!  
It's nothing. I'm sorry, I'm sorry!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh...  
Wh-what should I do?  
I ran away again.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I just can't talk to strangers.  
But I don't know which way to go...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I should've asked someone to come with me.  
Ayane even offered to join me, but...  
I t-turned her down.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
After all, everyone's always helping me.  
I sh-shouldn't ask for even more help.  
And I thought I could at least go buy food on my own...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I wanted to be helpful to everyone...  
But I... I just can't...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I'm such a useless wuss.  
Oh... *sob*

**Kurumi：**  
*sniffle*  
Um, are you lost like me, {player}?  
Is that why you've been looking at a map?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Tee hee.  
I guess grown-ups lose their way too, sometimes. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh, I'm lost too.  
I shouldn't laugh.  
But I guess it's a little funny...  
Ha, hahaha!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Huh? I'm cuter when I smile?  
N-no I'm not...  
Anyway, that's beside the point.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um...  
Can I see your map, please?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
We must be over here...  
The palace is over there, so I'm not turned around.  
Then that means, umm...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh. I figured out how to get back to the Sarendia Orphanage.  
I make a right turn over there, then I keep going straight.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh, thank goodness.  
I'll make it home! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um, have you figured it out, too?  
Do you know where you're going?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Y-you don't?  
Wh-what... What do we do?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
C-can you tell me where you're headed?  
I... I'll help you find your way!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I'll be able to get back to the Orphanage now,  
thanks to you, {player}.  
I'd like to make it up to you.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehe.  
And besides,  
you seem like you could use my help!
