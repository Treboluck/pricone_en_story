# Kurumi Episode 3
Kurumi is about to buy a ribbon, when a little girl throws a tantrum wanting the same ribbon. Believing that her parents might come back if she behaves like a good girl, Kurumi suppresses her desires and lets the little girl have the ribbon.

**Kurumi：**  
Hehehe...  
 Good evening, {player}!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
D-do you wanna go shopping with me again?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Yeah...  
I was asked to run some more errands.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
If you help me carry my bags...  
I'll coach you through  
how to shop properly, {player}.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ohh...  
D-did I sound too bossy?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
It's just, you seemed...  
like maybe you don't know how to buy things yet...  
S-so I thought I'd teach you how...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Thanks, I appreciate it.  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll carry your stuff for you anytime.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh my...  
I-it's not an imposition on you?  
Thank goodness...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehe, it's not your fault...  
 You're a grown-up,  
but you don't know how to shop on your own yet...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Let me teach you how it's done...  
Hehehe! ♪

`Tag 2`  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh...  
Does that mean you don't need a lesson on how to go  
shopping and stuff?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um...  
Do you like carrying bags for people?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Wow, you're really considerate!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Kurumi：**  
So...  
I need to go buy ingredients for dinner...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I don't want the raw items to spoil,  
so let's get your shopping done first...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
If we buy my things afterwards,  
the groceries will stay fresh...  
Hehehe, do you like my idea?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Ahh!  
Why are you patting me on the head?  
Please don't touch me!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
*sniffle* I'm sorry...  
I'm just really shy...  
It's not that I don't like it...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um...  
Anyway, what did you want to buy?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Job listings for a part-time job?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
You live with people who pay  
for your food and lodging...  
so you want to ease their burden by earning your keep?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I know what you mean...  
I live at the Sarendia Orphanage,  
and I feel bad when the others take care of me and I don't pull my weight.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But if you're looking for job listings...  
People give them out for free in the plaza...  
We can stop by there on our way back.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Are you sure you're able to work if you don't even know that?  
Oh, I'm so sorry, I wasn't trying to be a smart aleck...  
I-I didn't mean anything by it. Please forgive me?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Tee hee.  
You really don't know very much, huh?  
I-it's adorable...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Good luck finding a part-time job...  
I'll be cheering for you...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
If I ever, you know, become someone in charge...  
I'll make sure to hire you. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hehehe...  
 Um, if you have nothing else to buy...  
Can we maybe go do my shopping now?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I just spotted a cute ribbon...  
I love ribbons so much. ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Oh, it's this one...  
See? It's so cute and reasonably priced...  
I think I can afford it with my allowance...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Yes... Mama Saren gives me an allowance...  
When I'm older, I want to get a job and pay her back...  
I'd feel bad if I didn't...  
  
**Daughter：**  
I want it, I want it, I waaant it!  
Buy it for me, Mommy!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Eek!  
Huh?  
Does that little girl...want to buy this ribbon?  
  
**Mother：**  
I said no!  
Look, that girl is buying the last one, anyway.  
  
**Mother：**  
It'll be sold out, so you'll have to let it go.  
But I'll make you your favorite hamburg steak for dinner.  
  
**Daughter：**  
No, no, nooo! I want it!  
I really want that ribbon! NOWWWW!  
  
**Mother：**  
Ugh, stop whining!  
I did not raise you to act so spoiled!  
Come along now, or I'll leave you behind!  
  
**Daughter：**  
NOOO!  
I want it, I want it, I WANT IT!  
Get me that ribbon, or I'm not going home!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
That little girl really is spoiled...  
I-I... I lost everything I once had...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
But Mama Saren... and everyone...  
They've  
given me things, bit by bit...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I hardly ever get the things I want...  
And I worked hard to save up my allowance so I could buy this ribbon...  
But is it still... too much of a luxury for me?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Do I just... not deserve anything in this life?  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Little girl...  
You have a mom!  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Excuse me...  
Would you like  
this ribbon?  
  
**Mother：**  
Huh? Oh, are you sure?  
Didn't you want it for yourself?  
  
**Mother：**  
My daughter is throwing a tantrum now, but...  
She'll forget all about it once she gets home and goes to bed.  
  
**Kurumi：**  
I don't mind...  
Please, take it.  
  
**Mother：**  
Thank you.  
You're a good person.  
I bet your parents are really proud of you.  
  
**Mother：**  
You could learn from this nice girl! I'm so embarrassed.  
Go on, she said you can take it.  
  
**Daughter：**  
Huh?  
Yay! Thank you, miss! ♪  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Sure...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Let's go...  
I need to buy ingredients for dinner...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Hey, do you think...  
If I keep on being a good girl, will I...  
  
**Kurumi：**  
Um, never mind...  
Let's get going...
