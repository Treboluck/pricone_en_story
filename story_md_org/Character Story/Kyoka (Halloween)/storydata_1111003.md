Oh! It's already so late!  
The crowds are growing, too.  
  
**Kyoka：**

Let me guess. You don't know what's happening soon?  
Well, let me tell you, then!

**Kyoka：**

You remember? ...Are you suuure?

It's open, with an great view, so plenty of people should come here.

**Kyoka：**  
All right...  
Here you go!  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Oh, wow! This treat looks super cute!  
Thanks, miss!  
  
**Girl 1：**  
It smells so good... *munch*  
*chew, chew*... Ooh, it tastes good too!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Hee hee! ♪  
I'm very glad you like it, little girl.  
  
**Boy 1：**  
Oh, it's that girl from before!  
That girl's got these cupcakes, and they're crazy delicious!  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Really?  
Now I want to try one!  
  
**Boy 2：**  
I want another one too!  
Can I have one more, nice girl?  
  
**Girl 1：**  
Oh... Then I want a second, too!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Now, now! It's only one treat each, you know.  
  
**Boy 1：**  
Awww... But I want one!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Hmm... Oh, all right then.  
Everyone, you can have just one more!  
  
**Children：**  
Yaaaaay!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Whoa?!  
Suddenly I'm practically surrounded by children?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Hold on, everyone!  
There's enough cupcakes to go around!  
Don't push and shove! Try to behave yourselves!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I've never felt like such a proper grown-up!  
I might really be a big girl now!  
  
**Girl 2：**  
Thanks again, miss!  
Bye-bye!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Yes, bye-bye! ♪

**Kyoka：**  
...Phew. They finally all left.  
I'm glad the kids had such a good time!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Now, I suppose next we should try over that way!  
We wouldn't want to leave any children out, now, would we?!  
...Are you listening, {player}?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Huh?  
{player} isn't here...?  
Did we get split up in the confusion?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Actually... where even am I?  
I was so focused on the kids, I don't remember which way we came...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ummm... First, I should look for him.  
B-but... with all these people, how am I ever going to find him...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahhh... This is bad...!  
Everywhere I look, it's just people I've never seen!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I thought I was becoming more grown up...  
But without him here, I feel so much less sure of myself...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...{player}...  
  
**Man：**  
Oww! Dude, what was that for?!  
Don't go shoving people! What's the big rush?!  
  
**Woman：**  
Hey, fella, I dunno what's spooked you,  
but you can't run around in a crowd like this!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
*sniff*...  
What's all the commotion over there...?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Heeeey! Kyokaaaa!  
`Tag 5`  
**Kyoka：**  
Ah... That voice is...!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
He's shouting my name at the top of his voice...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
He must be trying as hard as he can to find me...!  
I-I have to do the same!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Ah... I'm here!  
I'm right over here!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
H-honestly!  
Where did you wander off to?!  
I was worried sick, you know!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Sorry.  
`Tag 6`  
**Kyoka：**  
...Well, it looks like you did try your best to find me again.  
And we're together now, so I guess it's fine...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Really, though, getting lost in the crowd...  
You're such a hopeless kid, {player}.  
You can't do anything without me, can you?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Here, let me take your hand.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
If we don't hold hands, I'm sure you'll just wander off in no time.  
So this makes sense... right?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Works for me.  
`Tag 7`  
**Kyoka：**  
Good! That's what I like to hear!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Hee hee, this is much safer.  
I'll be sure to keep a tight hold on you.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
So don't even think about letting go.  
  
**Narration：**  
And feeling the warmth of his hand in hers,  
Kyoka flashed a satisfied smile.
