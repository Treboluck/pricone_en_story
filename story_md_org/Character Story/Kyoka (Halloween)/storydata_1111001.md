## Subtitle: Costumes and Cupcakes
  
**Narration：**  
As {player} walks through the lively streets of  
central Landosol on Halloween,  
he spots Kyoka carrying some heavy-looking bags.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Heave-ho...  
 heave-ho... There.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I've brought a big supply of cupcakes,  
so I'm all ready!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I must say, even for Halloween, it really is busy here.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Decorations everywhere! Tasty-looking treats!  
And all those costumed children having fun...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh! That girl's costume is so cute.  
I'd love to try one like that...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wait, no no no!  
I didn't come out here to play today!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I came so that I could be the one handing out treats.  
So I need to act like a proper grown-up!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Trick or treat!  
`Tag 1`  
**Kyoka：**  
W-waaahhh!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh... It's just you, {player}.  
Honestly now, don't scare people like that!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Hmm?  
Why are you... reaching out? And wiggling your fingers...?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Y-you're not going to play a trick on me, are you?  
Are you mad?! Do you want to get arrested?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Really! Is it these cakes that you want?  
*sigh*... What will I do with you?  
You're supposed to be older than me...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Still, I suppose this *is* why I brought them.  
I'll get them out now, so hold on just a moment.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wahhh! What now?!  
  
**Boy 1：**  
What's your problem?!  
These are mine!  
Hands off!  
  
**Boy 2：**  
You can't hog them all!  
Give one here!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
What are those little boys doing?  
It looks like they're fighting...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
They really shouldn't get so violent.  
It's a nuisance to the people around them...  
I'll go and tell them off!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll come too!  
**Choice: (3)**  Good luck!  
`Tag 2`  
**Kyoka：**  
No, thank you!  
I can handle a little thing like this on my own.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
But...  
As long as you don't interfere,  
I guess I wouldn't mind having you by my side.

`Tag 3`  
**Kyoka：**  
What are you talking about?  
You're coming too, of course.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
If I leave you here, you'll get lost or something, won't you?  
No need to do anything— just come along and stick with me!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Kyoka：**  
Hey!  
You two boys, stop fighting!  
  
**Boy 1：**  
What the heck?!  
We don't have time for—  
  
**Boy 2：**  
Now's my chance!  
  
**Boy 1：**  
Waghh! I-I said hands off!  
...Ahh! My cup of juice!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh? Eek!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Urghh... I'm all wet...  
  
**Boy 2：**  
H-hey! Look what you've done!  
This is all your fault!  
  
**Boy 1：**  
L-like heck it is!  
This is all 'cause you—  
  
**Kyoka：**  
That's enough fighting, both of you!  
Now, let's hear you explain how this whole thing started, hmm?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Honestly.  
Fighting over a few pieces of candy?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Listen up, you two.  
If you start a fight in the middle of the street,  
you'll cause trouble for all kinds of people.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Halloween only comes once a year,  
so you shouldn't waste it on petty fights.  
Is that clear?  
  
**Boys：**  
Okay...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Well then, it's time you made up like good boys.  
Let's see you both say sorry, and that'll be the end of that!  
  
**Boy 1：**  
Um, I...  
I'm sorry I tried to hog all the candy...  
  
**Boy 2：**  
No, I'm sorry I tried to steal it from you like that...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Good. Very well done.  
Since you managed to make up so nicely...  
I'll give you these.  
  
**Boy 2：**  
Whoa! Awesome!  
This cupcake looks tasty!  
  
**Boy 1：**  
Thanks a bunch, nice girl!  
And, um, I'm really sorry we got your clothes dirty...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Thank you.  
I'm glad you know when to say sorry.  
But I'm a big girl, so I'll be just fine.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Just make sure you both  
behave a bit better from now on!  
It's our little promise, all right?  
  
**Boy 2：**  
Yeah!  
I promise I'll remember!  
  
**Boy 1：**  
Bye-bye now, nice girl!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Phew.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  You were almost like a grown-up there.  
**Choice: (6)**  You worked really hard. Good girl.  
`Tag 5`  
**Kyoka：**  
Th-thank you very much.  
Actually, don't say\"almost\"!  
I really am quite grown up!  
 Hmph!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Do you think a child would have been able  
to stop those boys from fighting?  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Kyoka：**  
H-hey...! Stop that at once!  
Don't treat me like a little child!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I only did what any grown-up would do!  
I wasn't trying to be a \"good girl\"!  
But... thank you anyway.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Kyoka：**  
By the way, are you all right, {player}?  
It looked like that juice splashed all over you...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
As for me...  
I guess I'm not... all that OK.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
What now...? I didn't bring any change of clothes!  
And I can't hand out these cupcakes looking like this...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Let's get you a costume.  
`Tag 8`  
**Kyoka：**  
A... costume?  
I suppose... it *is* Halloween today,  
and there's a costume rental shop right there...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
But... isn't it a bit childish to dress up for Halloween?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Grown-ups can wear costumes too.  
`Tag 9`  
**Kyoka：**  
D-do you think so?  
...Now that you mention it,  
I suppose there are a few costumed grown-ups around...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
W-well, um... All right, then.  
You seem keen to try out the costumes, so I'll go to the shop with you!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Well then, let's get going already, shall we?!  
I wonder what costumes they have! Eheheh...  
  

---  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Um... I tried this one on, but...  
What do you think?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
It doesn't really suit me, does it?  
I must look far too childish...  
  
**Choice: (13)**  No, you just look really cute.  
`Tag 13`  
**Kyoka：**  
Are you sure?! Thank goodness!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Your costume... doesn't look awful either.  
I suppose it looks... slightly cool, even.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
A-anyway!  
Now that we're both changed,  
let's head out into the city!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I have candy to hand out,  
but also, it's Halloween, so we can't miss all the festivities!  
  
**Narration：**  
And as she turned away,  
a deep blush was already spreading across Kyoka's face.
