# Kyoka (Halloween) Episode 2
After drinking too much of a special Halloween concoction, Kyoka finds herself in a somewhat urgent situation. Just as she's about to reach her limit, {player} saves the day. Though slightly taken aback by how big and reliable he feels as he carries her on his back, she thankfully makes it to the bathroom on time.
  
## Subtitle: The Perils of Drinking
  
**Narration：**  
Setting out into the city in their new costumes,  
Kyoka and {player} are ready to enjoy  
all the Halloween festivities.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahhh! It's incredible...  
So many different stalls... How will we visit them all?!  
  
**Man：**  
That's right, come on over, folks!  
This special drink is a Halloween exclusive!  
And the best part is, it's free for anyone in costume!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
A special drink...!  
What could it taste like?  
 I guess pumpkin flavor, maybe?  
I have a costume, so I guess I could go try it...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
No, but... I wouldn't want to seem too childish...  
Besides, I came to hand out treats today.  
I should really restrain myself...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wait, {player}?  
What are you doing?  
  
**Man：**  
Oh! That's a costume all right, young man!  
Well then, here's your drink on the house!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
He went for it without hesitating...  
Honestly, you're always so...  
So honest with yourself, it makes me a little jealous.  
  
**Man：**  
How about you there, little girl in the adorable outfit?  
This drink's so sweet, it'll melt all the frights away!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Urk... \"Little girl\"? He really is treating me like a kid...!  
That's depressing...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
But I am curious what it tastes like...  
 OK.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Hello! Could I have one serving of the special drink?  
  
**Man：**  
Sure thing! Happy Halloween!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
H-Happy Halloween.  
Well then, I'll have a sip.  
*gulp*... *gulp*...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Huh...?  
Oh, wow! It's delicious!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
It's sweet, yes, but refreshing too...  
I could keep drinking it all day!  
  
**Man：**  
Well! You sure know how to pay a compliment, girlie.  
Tell you what—just for that, I'll give you a free second helping!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh? No way...  
Thank you very much...  
 But is this really OK...?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  It tastes really good.  
`Tag 1`  
**Kyoka：**  
I-I know that!  
But you're right. It would be rude to turn down such a kind offer.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I'm not sure I should drink all this, though...  
Oh well, I'll just do it!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Mm... *gulp*...  
 Ahhh!  
Oh, it really is delicious!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
But... it's such an odd flavor...  
What's actually in it, I wonder?  
  
**Man：**  
We make it by mixing up a whole bunch of ingredients.  
There's pumpkin, apple, a few herbs to bring out the flavor...  
  
**Man：**  
Oh, and the secret ingredient is a dash of carrot!  
It creates a subtle sweetness like nothing else can!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
C-carrot?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Aaahhhh...  
I was just drinking carrots...!  
And I drank so much, too...  
  
**Man：**  
Something wrong, little girl?  
Oh, don't tell me... you're not fond of carrots?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
O-of course I can eat carrots!  
I'm perfectly fine!  
  
**Man：**  
Good to hear!  
Oh yeah, girlie.  
While you're here, why don't you buy one more?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
N-no! I think that's enough!  
The drink was very nice! Thank you and goodbye!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Now, {player}!  
We'd better get going!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Whew, what a shock...  
I can't believe it had carrots in it...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
It really was delicious...  
But thinking back, I feel like there *was* a carroty taste too...  
Ohhh... Hm...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I guess I really did drink a bit too much...  
Ummm... Where's the nearest...?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  What are you glancing around for?  
`Tag 2`  
**Kyoka：**  
A-actually... I...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wait!  
If I just tell him I need to go to the bathroom,  
he might laugh at me...!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
He just watched me guzzle all that down, too...  
I can't let him know I was silly enough  
to drink more than I could handle, like some kind of little kid!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I'll change the subject,  
and just find one somewhere as we walk...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I-it's nothing, really.  
Anyway, let's find somewhere with plenty of children.  
I need to hand out these cupcakes!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
U-urghh... This is bad...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I can't see one anywhere...  
At this rate...  
 No, no, I can't let that happen!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Please... I have to find one soon...!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Could it be...?  
`Tag 3`  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh?!  
D-d-d-d-d-don't be so ridiculous!  
I'm not looking for any bathrooms!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wh-what's that look for?! Are you doubting me?!  
Really, you have no delicacy at all!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
It's true I might seem to be fidgeting more than usual...  
But that's... um... it's just...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Right! It's the Curse of the Carrot Ghost!  
It must be that carroty drink's fault!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
So you see, I certainly don't need to go to the bathroom or anything!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Really?  
**Choice: (5)**  I drank it too, though...  
`Tag 4`  
**Kyoka：**  
Y-yes, really! It's not that I thought you'd laugh at me  
if I told you I went and drank too much, or anything like that!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
This is the Carrot Ghost's curse...  
Oh... But that doesn't mean I'm scared of ghosts!  
I'm more grown up than you, so I can handle ghosts easily!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Kyoka：**  
Oh!  
Ummm...  
 Well, the Carrot Ghost only goes after girls, not boys!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
What? Why only girls?  
Don't worry about little details like that!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Kyoka：**  
Mnghh...!  
I'm almost at my limit...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Sorry, {player}!  
I just remembered an important errand!  
I'll be back soon, so wait for me right here!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
That was a bit of a stretch, but it was my only option...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
A bathroom... a bathroom...!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Mm...? Huh...?  
Do I hear footsteps behind me?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Why did you suddenly run off?  
`Tag 7`  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh? Huhhh?!  
Why are you chasing after me?!  
Didn't I tell you to wait right there?!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
This errand has got nothing to do with you!  
Don't even think about following me!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ah! A bathroom sign!  
All right! If I just turn this corner...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
I didn't plan on {player} chasing after me, but...  
I can't hold on any longer, so... I'll just go straight inside!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Thank goodness... Now everything will be...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Wait— Ahhh?!  
So many people! And they're all lined up...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
N-no way... Just when I made it in the nick of time...  
I'll never be able to hold on that long...  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Are you OK?  
`Tag 8`  
**Kyoka：**  
I'm totally... n- not fine...  
I don't think I can... you know, hold on... for much longer...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Aahhh... At this rate, it won't just be you...  
They'll all laugh at me... *sniffle*...  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Pick her up.  
`Tag 9`  
**Kyoka：**  
Huh? Hold on, what are you suddenly doing?!  
\"Leave it to me\"...?  
Don't tell me you're going to find another bathroom?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ahh...! P-please don't shake me so hard...!  
Any more of this, and I might... might... Aaahhhh...!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Everyone's watching us...  
 I-I'm so embarrassed...!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
But... he isn't paying them any attention...  
He just keeps running forward...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Usually he's so childish, but...  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Whenever I'm in trouble, he goes all out to help me...  
How is he always so reliable...?  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Your back really is... very wide.  
It makes you seem grown up.  
 It's almost... cool.  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Ah!  
There's a vacant bathroom over there!  
Thank you so much! I'll be OK now!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
...Wait, let me down!  
Why are you trying to rush into the girls' bathroom as well?!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  I thought I should take you inside...  
`Tag 10`  
**Kyoka：**  
Hmph...!  
Those excuses make you sound  
even more suspicious somehow!  
  
**Kyoka：**  
Honestly! Just when I thought you'd changed!  
You really are an awful, suspicious creep!  
  
**Narration：**  
And after shouting those words,  
Kyoka turned and rushed into the bathroom  
as fast as her legs could carry her.
