**Narration：**  
While investigating the rumors of a new villain in the shadows,  
Tamaki has learned of a secret merchants' meeting to be held in the city.  
Together with {player}, she sets out to uncover more.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I was expecting it to be indoors,  
but they're meeting out here in the open?  
Oh well—it saves us the trouble of snyeaking in! ♪  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...I gotta say, though,  
tracking down these price-fixers was easier than I thought.  
I didn't expect to find them just from a few basic inquiries!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  So... dark...  
`Tag 1`  
**Tamaki：**  
Could this be a trap?  
We'd better nyot let our guards down any time soon...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  So... cramped...  
`Tag 2`  
**Tamaki：**  
Ahhh, geez!  
This alley is really nyarrow, so try to be quiet!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Why are we in this tiny alley?  
**Choice: (4)**  It's hard to talk through this mask...  
`Tag 3`  
**Tamaki：**  
Out in the city, there are only so many places to hide!  
I considered other options, like under benches,  
but this was the only good spot!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Anyway, for nyow, um...  
 I-I'll try nyot to let it bother me,  
so shift this way to make sure you stay hidden!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...Wait, wh-wh-wh-where are you shoving your face?!  
Th-that's going too far...!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Tamaki：**  
Ahh... I did always think that mask seemed a bit too small...  
That's why I made a nyew one...  
 Sorry it's an awkward hand-me-down,  
but it's the only other Phantom Cat mask I've got, so you'll have to cope.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...Hm? Hand-me-down?  
Thinking about it, that means the same mask I used to wear  
is touching {player}'s face...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Th-that thought gets me all embarrassed!  
{player}!  
Give the mask back right nyow!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Merchant 1：**  
Ah, you're right on time.  
I'm sorry to make you meet me in a place like this.  
Normally, I'd prefer to hold discussions like this over a nice dinner, but...  
  
**Merchant 2：**  
Ho ho hoh. Don't worry.  
We're all having financial troubles, so I fully understand.  
Well then, shall we get down to business?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...Ah! The merchants are here!  
Ugh... fine!  
Just stay like that for nyow and be quiet, okay?!  
  
**Merchant 1：**  
This is the contract for the latest deal.  
Please sign once you've confirmed it.  
  
**Merchant 2：**  
A bill this high for these quantities...?  
I'll have to keep charging double just to break even...  
More of the Korruptio Syndicate's handiwork?  
  
**Merchant 1：**  
Yes... They've taken over all the supply chains,  
added extortionate charges, and limited availability too...  
Thanks to them, nobody can do honest business.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
The \"Korruptio Syndicate\"?  
I thought these guys were the villains,  
but could they just be victims of a greater enemy?  
  
**Merchant 2：**  
\"Korruptio\"... The name reminds me of old Krook'd.  
You don't think it could be the same man doing business  
under a new assumed identity?  
  
**Merchant 1：**  
No, Krook'd should still be  
out of the picture thanks to the Phantom Cat.  
There may be some connection, but it seems to be a different group.  
  
**Merchant 2：**  
The Phantom Cat...  
The hero who took out Krook'd and restored our freedom, huh...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ooh, the Phantom Cat seems nyice and popular!  
Keep the compliments coming~! ♪  
  
**Merchant 1：**  
Thanks to her, our lives are worse than ever.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Huh...?  
  
**Merchant 1：**  
Krook'd was an awful man,  
but he was the one keeping all the other crooks under control.  
  
**Merchant 2：**  
And this new syndicate was formed from those crooks banding together.  
In other words, if it weren't for the Phantom Cat, the Korruptio Syndicate  
would never have been born... Some hero she turned out to be.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
The Phantom Cat... caused this...?  
  
**Merchant 1：**  
Now, as for our next deal...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...{player}.  
I've heard enyough. We should leave.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myahaha...  
I nyever expected anything like this.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I thought I was just gonna  
beat up some bad guys and save the day as usual...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Who'd have thought the root cause of all the trouble  
was me... the Phantom Cat all along...?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I always did my thing as the Phantom Cat  
so I could help people in need, but... Myahaha...  
Looking at the results nyow, I don't knyow who's the real villain.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  You're no villain, Tamaki.  
`Tag 6`  
**Tamaki：**  
...That's nyot true at all.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I call myself a hero,  
but in the end, I'm a thieving criminal, you knyow?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Don't forget, I've stolen from the wrong people before,  
and even gotten you captured when you came to save me.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
And nyow I've created the biggest villain yet...  
 Myahaha.  
Looking back on my work, I really am the most hopeless hero.  
  
**Choice: (7)**  I'm the one who got myself captured.  
`Tag 7`  
**Tamaki：**  
...But I got you involved.  
With nyo Phantom Cat... without me in your life...  
none of that would have happened to you.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Maybe I should quit this Phantom thing!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Yep, that's the best choice!  
If being the Phantom Cat hurts people, I should just quit it!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'll quit the guild too...  
 Oh, I knyow!  
Once I'm a free agent, I'll make Akino a proposal  
and start a taiyaki stall that's all my own!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Wanna join me, {player}?  
We work crazy well together,  
so I bet we could expand our chain through all of Landosol!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hm?  
Why's the cat got your tongue?  
Don't worry! I knyow we're an unstoppable team!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh, while we're at it,  
 why don't we do like that customer said,  
really get married, and sell taiyaki as a family business?  
Wouldn't that be tons of fun? ♪  
  
**Choice: (8)**  ...You don't mean that.  
`Tag 8`  
**Tamaki：**  
Wh-why wouldn't I mean it?!  
Cooking taiyaki is way more my style than stealing!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...Besides, being some kind of hero...  
Making people's lives better was too big a dream for me.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I've nyever been an expert merchant like Akino...  
I could nyever adapt to a ton of jobs like Mifuyu...  
I don't have Yukari's good judgment...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
So I should just...!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  The world needs a hero like the Phantom Cat.  
`Tag 9`  
**Tamaki：**  
...?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ahh... *sniff*...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...W-waaaahhhh!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I've calmed down...  
so you can let go of my head nyow.  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Are you sure?  
**Choice: (11)**  If you need to cry, I'm here anytime.  
`Tag 10`  
**Tamaki：**  
Y-yep!  
Um, I'm... sorry I kind of dived into your chest.  
  
Jump to tag 12  
`Tag 11`  
**Tamaki：**  
Anytime...?  
 You'll give people funny ideas, making offers like that...  
*sigh* I don't even have the energy to set you straight.  
  
`Tag 12`  
**Tamaki：**  
You knyow...  
It feels like you just keep seeing me at my worst.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
But that's why I've gotta show you my best face next!  
...Yes, the face of the Phantom Cat!  
  
**Choice: (13)**  You're still doing that, huh?  
`Tag 13`  
**Tamaki：**  
I left my worries over in someone's big snot-covered chest!  
I dunno how much I can really do,  
but right nyow, I just wanna get out there and try!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
After all... the Phantom Cat's a bonya fide hero! ♪  
  
**Choice: (14)**  I'll help too!  
`Tag 14`  
**Tamaki：**  
I've mixed you up in this enough already!  
Or so I'd like to say, but you're nyot gonna listen if I stop you...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...Still, lemme ask you one thing.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
The path I walk lies outside the law.  
If we mess up, we could be thrown in jail,  
or even get ourselves killed by villains out for revenge.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Are you sure... you want to help me with that?  
  
**Choice: (15)**  Of course!  
`Tag 15`  
**Tamaki：**  
...Well, thanks!  
I'm a lucky cat to have met a guy like you!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyow then, I hope you're ready, villains!  
The Phantom Cat is coming to stop your evil deeds!  
  
**Narration：**  
A voice rang out in the outskirts of Landosol.  
To the locals, it sounded like the random yells of a drunkard,  
but to Tamaki, it was a cry of resolve and an oath to her precious bonds.
