**Narration：**  
Tamaki is hard at work at her taiyaki stall.  
With the assistance of {player}, who's helping her out  
part-time, she cooks up one sweet treat after the next.  
  
**Regular Customer 1：**  
Tamaki!  
Gimme one of my usual sweet bean orders!  
  
**Regular Customer 2：**  
And I'll have a white anko one!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Always a pleasure!  
 One sweet bean, one white anko...  
{player}, we're running low on this flavor,  
so prepare anyother batch!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Way ahead of you.  
`Tag 1`  
**Tamaki：**  
Whoa! Nyice work indeed!  
My job's been so much easier with you here to help! ♪  
  
**Regular Customer 1：**  
Huhhh~!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hm? Is something the meow-tter?  
  
**Regular Customer 2：**  
Well, y'know.  
You two run this stall in such perfect sync,  
you're almost like a married couple, so we were impressed.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Y-  
you think so?  
Myahaha! That's a little embarrassing~! ♪  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hey, hey, {player}!  
Why don't the two of us really get meow-rried?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Sure, let's do that.  
`Tag 2`  
**Tamaki：**  
Huh?!  
W-wait a meowment!  
This is clearly way too, umm...  
 D-do you mean it?  
  
**Regular Customer 2：**  
Hahah!  
Life's been tough lately with the rising prices,  
so it's nice to see you two having fun.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Rising prices, you say?  
  
**Regular Customer 1：**  
Yeah.  
Food, clothes... basically everything's getting pricier.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...Come to think of it, cat food's been expensive,  
and the meow-nager was grumbling  
that we might have to charge more for taiyaki.  
  
**Regular Customer 2：**  
...Just between you and me, I heard that all these hikes  
are because a bunch of merchants are conspiring to fix the prices.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I-is that the truth?!  
  
**Regular Customer 2：**  
Well, it's just a rumor. ...  
But if it *is* true,  
I bet they're laughing at us from their piles of cash.  
  
**Regular Customer 1：**  
Dangitall!  
It's always regular folk like us that lose out in the end!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...  
  
**Regular Customer 2：**  
Well, I'd better get back to work.  
  
**Regular Customer 1：**  
I'll get going too.  
See ya later, Tamaki!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh, bye-bye, then!  
Hope to see you again!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
From what those customers were saying...  
There might be another nyasty group like Krook'd & Co. at large.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  A job for the Phantom Cat, then?  
`Tag 3`  
**Tamaki：**  
Purr-cisely!  
If villains are exploiting the innyocent,  
the Phantom Cat will bring them to justice!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
First up, I'll nyeed to investigate the truth behind the rumors.  
Wouldn't want to fall foul of false info again  
like with the Krook'd incident.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'll ask Akino to make use of her merchant connections...  
 Myah?  
What're you doing, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I just finished getting ready to investigate.  
`Tag 4`  
**Tamaki：**  
Th-that's way too fast!  
It hasn't even been thirty seconds yet!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Are you planning to join in with my...  
with the Phantom Cat's investigation?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
O-of course I can't let you do that!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ah...  
 S-sorry, that was a bit harsh.  
But you're just a regular civilian,  
so I don't think you should get involved in this stuff.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Leave the sneaky stuff to the ultimate cat burglar!  
I'm the Phantom Cat—there's nyothing I can't do!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I want to help you, though.  
`Tag 5`  
**Tamaki：**  
T-to help me...? I-is that true?  
Well, in that case...  
 Ahh!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
W-wait, what am I thinking?!  
It's nyot right to put {player} in any more danger!  
I've gotta turn him down...  
 Hm?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Urk... Why does his face look so forlorn...?  
Stop! Don't look at me with those abandoned-kitten eyes!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Still... I need to harden my heart and give him a firm \"nyo\"!  
Yes... I'll tell it like it is!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...{player}!  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Do you not... need my help?  
`Tag 6`  
**Tamaki：**  
...W-well, I guess I could consider it...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myarghhh!  
What the heck am I sayiiiing?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I-it's nyot too late.  
I just need a reason to refuse. Any reason!  
...I knyow!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
However! Being a vigilante is very difficult work.  
So you'll nyeed to pass a test!  
I call it the Phantom Cat Sidekick Exam!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Just so we're clear, this test won't be easy!  
If you're gonna help me, that makes you my partner!  
And a partner nyeeds to have the strength to support me!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Honestly, even considering your meow-sterious ability,  
with such a feeble body, you'll never pass the first—  
  
**Tamaki：**  
H-huh?  
{player}, have you been working out?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
N-nyow that I look closer, he's got plenty of muscles.  
Since he's younger, I've always teased him like a little brother,  
but somewhere along the way, he's gotten pretty reliable...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
L-looking at him is getting me all flustered...  
G-gotta get this test over with and disqualify him!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
First up, then, let's test your physical—  
 Myaaarrghh!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Wh-wh-wh-wh-why did you lift me off the ground?!  
And isn't this th-th-th-the fabled princess carry?!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  See, I can support you.  
**Choice: (8)**  You're pretty light, actually.  
`Tag 7`  
**Tamaki：**  
U-uhhh...! You sound pleased with yourself,  
but I still don't understand why I've been swept off my feet!  
  
Jump to tag 9  
`Tag 8`  
**Tamaki：**  
Huh...?  
 Oh, um...  
Thank you...  
 Wait, nyo!  
Why did you suddenly pick me up?!  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh... Don't tell me...  
you thought I meant you need to *physically* support me?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
When I say \"support,\"  
I don't mean supporting my body weight!  
A-anyway! This is embarrassing, so put me down!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
*huff*... *puff*... Look, {player}.  
I knyow you've got memory issues,  
but if you go around doing stuff like this to girls, you'll get in trouble!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Huh...? \"What's the next test\"...?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
W-well, you've proved you're not feeble.  
Let's forget the physical exam  
 and move on to the final trial!  
  
**Choice: (10)**  We're already at the last part?  
`Tag 10`  
**Tamaki：**  
Th-this is how vigilante tests work, okay?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Honestly, if he keeps doing stuff like that for every test,  
I don't knyow if *I'll* survive it!  
I'd better make him give up quickly!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Just so you knyow, this last test's nearly impossible!  
Nyow, little guys, get over here!  
  
**Cat 1：**  
Meow!  
  
**Cat 2：**  
Mew-mew!  
  
**Cat 3：**  
...Myahhh?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Heh heh heh. A true sidekick of the Phantom Cat  
needs to be loved by all felines!  
Nyow, show me you can charm these kitties!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hahahah...  
These guys never accept anyone but me.  
He doesn't stand a chance!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'm sorry to do this to you...  
But believe me, it's all for your own sake!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyooow then, how are you doing with my kitty friends?  
If it's too tough, you can give up—  
  
**Cat 1：**  
Meow! ♪  
  
**Cat 2：**  
Mew-meeeew!  
  
**Cat 3：**  
...Myaaah! ♪  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Why have they all gone crazy for him?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Wh-what the heck?!  
These little kitties *nyever* listen to anyone but me!  
  
**Choice: (11)**  Well, I have been feeding them on my breaks...  
`Tag 11`  
**Tamaki：**  
N-nyo way...!  
I've been defeated by the power of food...?  
And I need to thank you for taking care of them, too...  
  
**Choice: (12)**  So, how did I do?  
`Tag 12`  
**Tamaki：**  
Ummm... Well, I suppose...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Tell him he's failed, Tamaki!  
At this point, coming up with a reason can wait!  
Just tell him he's failed, and this will all be over!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I-it doesn't matter if his eyes are sparkling with anticipation!  
This is all for {player}'s own sake!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...Nyow, give him the failing grade he needs to hear!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...I-I guess I can let you handle a supporting role.  
  
**Narration：**  
So Tamaki and {player} began their preparations  
to face this new threat as an intrepid duo.
