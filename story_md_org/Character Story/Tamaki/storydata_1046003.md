**Narration：**  
One day, Tamaki calls {player} out to a large mansion  
in the city.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Thanks fur showing up, {player}.  
There's something I'd like to ask you about.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Are you fur-miliar with the Phantom Cat, the mysterious thief  
who's purr-ty active around these parts?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Never heard of her?  
Fur-iend to the weak, op-purr-essor of the mighty...  
the young and beautiful Phantom Cat!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Just who could she paw-sibly be...?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  An old fart?  
**Choice: (2)**  No doubt an astonishingly beautiful young girl.  
`Tag 1`  
**Tamaki：**  
What! Who're you calling an old—  
A-ahem. I'm meow-st certain she's not an old fart.

`Tag 2`  
**Tamaki：**  
An astonishingly beautiful young girl with feline grace  
and a paw-some personality to boot?  
Y-you're raising the bar a little too high...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Tamaki：**  
A-anyway, rumor has it that the Phantom Cat  
is a beautiful young thief.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
By the way, speaking of thieves...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
What do you purr-sonally think about them?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I mean the type who rob the fat cats and give to the poor...  
What if a thief like that was litter-ally standing  
right in front of you...?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I would extort her and take a cut of the profit.  
**Choice: (5)**  A thief is a thief. Let's arrest her.  
`Tag 4`  
**Tamaki：**  
What? Y-you can't do that!  
I mean, that makes you cat-egorically worse!

`Tag 5`  
**Tamaki：**  
What?  
Th-that sounds purr-ty harsh!  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Tamaki：**  
Hmm... Looks like I can't let the cat of the bag just yet...  
Nyot even to {player}...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Well, putting that aside fur now,  
I asked you here today because  
I need your help with something.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
This mansion here is said to belong to the fat cat, Krook'd,  
a loan shark with a-paw-ling interest rates.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
He feeds off wealth stolen from the less fur-tunate...  
Just the type of rat who deserves the Phantom's wrath!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
So... Umm...  
This has nothing to do with that, but...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I want you to casually guard this escape—  
ahem, sorry,  
this purr-fectly innocent route here, and make sure  
nyo one passes through it.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Uh, why, you ask?  
Well...  
Um...  
I'm just gonna be purr-acticing some  
mildly embarrassing magic I pre-fur others not to see.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
All my guildmates have their paws full tonight, so...  
Please! Can you help me out...?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  All right.  
`Tag 7`  
**Tamaki：**  
Fur real?  
You'll take it on?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
You're paw-some, {player}!  
I always knew you had it in you!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I just want you to keep an eye out until I get back.  
I'm counting on you!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Meowzer! What a cat-ch! What a cat-ch! ♪  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Sorry I kept you waiting! Thanks fur standing guard!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  What's with the huge bag you're carrying...?  
`Tag 8`  
**Tamaki：**  
Fur-get it! Don't sweat the small stuff!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Well, we're done here.  
Nyow let's get the heck out of Dodge.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Quit pussyfooting around!  
We've gotta scram or they'll find us—I mean...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
We gotta go home or the nocturnal predators will find us.  
Meowst certainly!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Whoopsie, looks like I'm going this way.  
Well, cat-cha later—  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh, I almost fur-got.  
Thanks fur helping me out today, {player}!  
Here's a little something in return!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I got it from my part-time job.  
It's an assortment of taiyaki!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Real meow-th watering stuff!  
I'm sure you'll like it, too.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Well, cat-cha later!  
Thanks a lot fur today!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so {player} said goodbye to the high-spirited  
Tamaki. The next day, news that the Phantom Cat had  
been spotted spread across Landosol like wildfire.
