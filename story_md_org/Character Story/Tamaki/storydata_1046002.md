**Narration：**  
One day, on the outskirts of Landosol,  
{player} sees Tamaki surrounded by many cats.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh, {player}!  
Thanks fur the other day!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
What am I doing?  
Can you nyot tell? I'm feeding the cats!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'm the one who looks after all the cats around here!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Well?  
Are you im-purr-essed?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Although to be honest, taking care of and feeding  
all of them is claw-fully expensive.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I know you think I'm stingy, but someone's gotta  
paw the bill  
to feed my furry friends. I'm nyot just a miser, you know?

Here you go. Do you pre-fur your belly?

I'll keep stroking you until you're cat-isfied.  
Who's a good little kitty? ♪

**Tamaki：**  
One of my meowst favorite kittens disappeared...  
The one I named after you.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
He's still a baby, so he can't feed himself.  
Where could he have paw-sibly gone...?

It's only been a day since he disappeared.  
I'm nyot giving up until we find him!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
{player}!  
If you can hear my voice, then meow that you're there!  
  
**Kitten：**  
Meow...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
That cry...  
Where's it coming from?  
  
**Kitten：**  
Meow...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh!  
I found him!  
He's on the roof of this house!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
He must've climbed too high and fur-got how to get down.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hold on!

Thanks fur helping me out today, {player}!  
You're a real fur-end to me, just like the cats!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Next time, I'll give you another paw-some discount  
as a thank-you!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Why is it never free?  
Hehe...  
You'll need my unconditional love for that,  
and it comes at a hefty purr-ice.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
After all, I'm a whimsical cat!  
But that also means  
I might just give you something  
for free someday. Purr-haps?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyow then, I'll be taking this little fella home.  
See ya around! Bye-bye!
