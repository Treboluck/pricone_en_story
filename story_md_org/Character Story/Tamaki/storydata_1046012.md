**Narration：**  
The day of the big operation has arrived.  
In the outskirts of Landosol,  
Tamaki and {player} make their final preparations.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...Well then, let's go over the details of  
\"Operation: The Hungry Cat Corners All the Rats\" one last time.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
The plan itself is very simple. We raid every Syndicate member  
in a single nyight and scatter their ill-gotten gains across the city.  
That's all there is to it!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Got it.  
`Tag 1`  
**Tamaki：**  
Don't worry! There may be a lot of targets to cover,  
but aside from that, it's the same as always!  
With the two of us on the case...  
 Ahh!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
M-myahaha...  
I guess I dropped my dagger...  
Honestly—tonyight of all nyights, I've gotta pull myself together! ♪  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Are you nervous?  
`Tag 2`  
**Tamaki：**  
...Nyot much point denying it to you, huh?  
I hate to admit it, but I'm shaking like crazy all over.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Our foes tonyight are nyo small-time crooks.  
The Korruptio Syndicate controls most of Landosol's commerce.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Can one thief... a lone cat like me...  
really be a match for that kind of enemy...?  
It scares me to think about...  
 Mya-myah?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Wh-why did you suddenly grab my hand?!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  We're a team, remember?  
`Tag 3`  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh, {player}...  
 Yeah!  
There's nyothing we can't do together!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It's almost time to start.  
You just stay close behind me and use your ability, okay?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...Just so we're clear, this isn't over till we escape with the treasure!  
We set out together, and we return together!  
To tell each other we were the cat's meow!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  It's a promise.  
`Tag 4`  
**Tamaki：**  
That's the spirit! ♪  
...  
Well then, let's begin the grand adventure  
of the world's greatest cat burglar, the Phantom Cat!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...I see it!  
That's our first target!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Don't you worry!  
All my intel says there'll be no guards or employees home tonyight!  
I'll unlock the door, and then we head straight for the treasure!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Based on the plans I acquired,  
the loot should be...  
 Ah! Yes, right here!  
  

---  
  
**Tamaki：**  
M-myaaahhh!  
Th-this is... an absolutely mewtiful stash!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I-I've seen a lot of treasure troves,  
but this hoard is bigger than any of them!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
W-with all this cash,  
I could feast on premium taiyaki every day  
and feed all the kitties prize tuna for life!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Remember why we're here!  
`Tag 5`  
**Tamaki：**  
Huh?!  
I-I'm so sorry!  
The sheer spectacle made me forget my own identity!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'm the Phantom Cat—a vigilante thief!  
I nyever steal loot for personal gain!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Th-that's my rule...  
 but it can't hurt to dive into this stash  
and bathe in the glow of gold for a meowment...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  ...  
`Tag 6`  
**Tamaki：**  
...Okay.  
Let's stuff it all in a sack and move on to the next target.  
  

---  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Heh heh heh! Even the final target was a cinch! ♪  
Those Korruptio Syndicate villains are penniless!  
All that's left is the final glorious step!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
People of Landosol!  
Do you like gold?!  
'Cause I've brought a gift to blow all your worries away!  
  
**Woman：**  
Wh-what's going on?!  
  
**Man：**  
I know this voice... It's the Phantom Cat!  
The Phantom Cat is on the prowl!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Listen, guys! I knyow life isn't always easy!  
Sometimes everything goes wrong,  
and it can feel like the whole world is blowing up in your face!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...I'm nyo exception to that.  
I've tried to help people out, only to learn that it made things worse  
and put the people I really care about in danger...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Even so, you can't let those bad times get you down!  
If you give up—if you don't pick yourself up and try again—  
you won't be able to do anything when it really counts!  
  
**Woman：**  
...Oh, Phantom Cat!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
And if things still seem too tough, look up into the nyight sky!  
'Cause you might just spot the Phantom Cat with a bag of gold!  
  
**People：**  
Yeaaaahhhh!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Nyow then! I've got a meow-ssive haul for you tonyight  
straight from the Korruptio Syndicate's coffers!  
It's a present from me to you, so catch as much as you can!  
  
**Woman：**  
Thank you so much, Phantom Cat!  
  
**Man：**  
I'd better quit grumbling and work hard too!  
  
**People：**  
Phantom Cat! Phantom Cat!  
Phantom Cat! Phantom Cat!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Whew, that went great! ♪  
I'm so glad that everyone seems thrilled by the results!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  It's great that it worked out.  
`Tag 7`  
**Tamaki：**  
I couldn't have done it without you, {player}!  
Thanks a meow-llion! ♪  
  
**Tamaki：**  
But more importantly...  
Check out what I've got here! ♪  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It's a contract proving their illegal deals!  
I nyabbed it along with tonyight's loot! ♪  
  
**Tamaki：**  
With this, we can get all the bad guys arrested,  
and the whole Korruptio Syndicate will collapse!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Oh? Didn't think I'd thought things through that far, did you?  
Myeheheh... this kitty's potential knows no bounds! ♪  
  
**???：**  
Wonderful!  
Yes, your continued growth is truly wonderful!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...Huh?!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Look out!  
`Tag 8`  
**Ruffian：**  
Tch... Her sidekick got in the way!  
  
**???：**  
Oh, the boy alone will do. He'll make a fine hostage,  
so restrain him tightly.  
 I love peaceful solutions as much  
as I love dogs, so let's keep the violence to a minimum! ♪  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Y-you defended me...?!  
{player}! Wait right there! I'll save you!  
  
**???：**  
Ohhh, not so fast, my dear!  
If you move, my scary minions might harm your little friend!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ngh... Who exactly are you?!  
  
**Korruptio：**  
Dear me! How crude of me not to introduce myself.  
I am the leader of the Korruptio Syndicate.  
My name, shockingly enough, is Korruptio.  
  
**Korruptio：**  
My, my, my. I didn't want to name the Syndicate after myself, you know!  
After all, it amounts to a confession of my underhanded deeds!  
But you see, my Uncle Krook'd is so particular about these things...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Uncle... Krook'd?!  
You're that villain Krook'd's nephew...?!  
  
**Korruptio：**  
Now, now! Let's not jump to hasty conclusions!  
Revenge for my uncle is the very furthest thing from my mind!  
If I had time to waste on such things, I'd use it to further my own profits!  
  
**Korruptio：**  
Then what brings me to this sorry scene?  
Why would I, an insatiable seeker of profit, hunt down a petty thief?!  
Well... I suppose the answer is obvious! ♪  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Y-you don't mean... this contract...?!  
  
**Korruptio：**  
Yes, well deduced!  
I merely wish for you to return that little slip of paper! ♪  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Th-this is the one thing I can't surrender!  
  
**Korruptio：**  
You can have your stolen loot.  
 I'll earn it again from scratch!  
And I'll even stop fixing prices.  
 There are other ways to make cash!  
But you see... I can't replace myself, so getting caught isn't an option.  
  
**Korruptio：**  
Naturally, I'm happy to sweeten the deal.  
Let me offer this in return: the life of your friend!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Ngh...  
 That's depraved!  
  
**Korruptio：**  
Oh, I do appreciate the compliment! ♪  
Well then, well then! Let's begin the negotiation, shall we?  
Will you keep the contract? Or your partner? The choice is all yours! ♪  
  
**Tamaki：**  
This man...  
This twisted man can't be allowed to get away with this!  
But... at this rate, {player} will be...!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
What should I... What am I supposed to do...?!  
  
**???：**  
Meow! ♪  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...?!  
Th... this voice...  
  
**Korruptio：**  
Aaand your time's up! ♪  
Well then, shall we hear your final answer?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Twisted villains...  
Let me give you a word of advice.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
The Phantom Cat never gives up on a target.  
That's why... I'll be taking both!  
  
**Cats：**  
Mew-mew!  
  
**Korruptio：**  
Wh-what is this pack of felines?!  
G-get away!  
I have a horrible cat allergy!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
{player}!  
This is our cue to run!  
  
**Korruptio：**  
Curses!  
Don't let them get away!  
Hurry up and—  
 ...Hm? What's that?  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
This is the area where the suspicious activity was reported.  
Remember, the Phantom Cat is said to lead a pack of furry felines!  
The thief may be lurking nearby, so conduct a thorough search!  
  
**Korruptio：**  
Ahhh, Sir Knight of Nightmare!  
Why, what impeccably fortunate timing!  
  
**Korruptio：**  
I am a humble merchant by the name of Korruptio!  
Just now, the nefarious Phantom Cat appeared,  
stole my precious belongings, and ran off thataway!  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
Is this true?!  
Thank you, good sir!  
We'll pursue the thief at— Hmm?  
  
**Cat：**  
...Meow.  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
What is this cat?  
There's something in its mouth... Wh-why, this is...!  
  
**Korruptio：**  
...Huh?  
Why are you closing in on me?  
Hurry and pursue the Phantom Cat—  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
This cat... It must be a minion of the Phantom's.  
And in its mouth, it held a contract.  
A contract with clearly illegal terms... Proof of illicit dealings.  
  
**Korruptio：**  
Th-that accursed feline...!  
U-um, I mean... Dear me! Whoever would do such awful things?!  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
The contract is made out to the \"Korruptio Syndicate.\"  
And I do believe you introduced yourself as Korruptio  
and claimed to be the Cat's latest victim.  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
...With such conclusive evidence, this can be no coincidence.  
Can we ask you a few questions, my dear Mr. Korruptio?  
  
**Korruptio：**  
B-but, you see...  
  
**Korruptio：**  
This is why  
I didn't want to use my own damn name!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
I think we've come far enyough!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
It actually worked out!  
Korruptio will be arrested by nyow, so that's the end of...  
 Huh?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
He's gone... There's nyo sign of {player}!  
B-but why?!  
I told him to stick right behind me...!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Don't tell me...  
Korruptio's goons took him and...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Why...  
Why do I always screw up like this...?  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I run off wildly... get carried away... mess up when it matters most...  
And yet again, I've gotten him...!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...{player}!  
Please, answer me!  
  
**Choice: (9)**  Hi.  
`Tag 9`  
**Tamaki：**  
...Why are you here?  
  
**Choice: (10)**  I stumbled and fell behind.  
`Tag 10`  
**Tamaki：**  
U... urghhh...  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Myearrrghhhh!  
Lemme scratch your face to ribbons!  
  
**Choice: (11)**  Th-that hurts!  
`Tag 11`  
**Tamaki：**  
So what if it hurts, you dummy?!  
Try to think about how *I* feel for a meowment!  
  
**Choice: (12)**  Are you... crying?  
`Tag 12`  
**Tamaki：**  
I was worried! I was super worried!  
I thought I'd gotten you in horrible trouble yet again...!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Then you have the nerve to show up like nyothing happened...  
And I'm so happy you're okay...  
 Ohhh, myargh!  
Is it that much fun, making me cry all the time?!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
...Myahh?!  
As if a little pat on the head's gonna...  
  
**Choice: (13)**  You were the cat's meow tonight.  
`Tag 13`  
**Tamaki：**  
...Yeah.  
You and me both...  
  
**Narration：**  
The next day, the Landosol papers published a morning extra.  
Naturally, the big headline was the sudden mass arrest  
of a syndicate of merchants who had been fixing prices illegally.  
  
**Narration：**  
And at the end of the article was a rare word of thanks to one individual.  
A brave vigilante who had toppled evil and defended justice...  
The heroic Phantom Cat.
