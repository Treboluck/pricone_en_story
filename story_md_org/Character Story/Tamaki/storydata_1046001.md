**Narration：**  
Walking along a mountain trail,  
{player} hears the sounds of a vicious fight taking place.  
  
**???：**  
Nyo! Scram!  
  
**Monster：**  
Graaarghhh!  
  
**???：**  
Meowzer, I defeated it!  
Nyow you know better than to mess with me—  
  
**Monsters：**  
Grrrghhh!  
  
**???：**  
Nyo,  
impossible!  
I thought I took it out, but it just split in two!  
  
**???：**  
Urghhh. What a pain in the whiskers!  
If I could only attack from behind at the same time,  
this would be a catnyap... I just need someone else to—  
  
**???：**  
Wait! Is that an adventurer I see?  
  
**???：**  
Myahahah! Excellent timing!  
Think you could lend me a paw?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  All right.  
`Tag 1`  
**???：**  
Purrr-fect!  
Then on the count of \"Ready, set,  
 meow!\"  
I want you to attack from behind!  
  
**???：**  
Ready, set, meow!  
  
**Monster 1：**  
Graaarghhh!  
  
**???：**  
Awesome!  
Nyow the other one. Ready, set, meow!  
  
**Monster 2：**  
Graaarghhh!  
  
**???：**  
Meowzer! What a victory!  
And it's all thanks to your help!  
  
**???：**  
Wish I could thank you properly somehow,  
but unfortunately I don't have much on me right nyow.  
  
**???：**  
Still, I'll nyot forget this debt! I swear!  
You can count on it!  
  
**???：**  
Well, you'll have to excuse me nyow.  
Once again, thank you fur the help!  
  
**Narration：**  
After parting ways with the cat-eared girl, {player}  
makes his way across a particularly treacherous mountain trail.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Whoa!  
`Tag 2`  
**???：**  
What was that?  
Sounds like someone just fell off the meown-tain!  
  
**???：**  
Oh! That's the guy who just saved my tail!  
  
**???：**  
What a cat–astrophe!  
Hold on, I'm coming for ya!  
  
**???：**  
Paws away!  
  
**???：**  
Surprised?  
We feline beastfolk are su-purr athletic,  
so I can jump down, sneak around, and all that jazz.  
  
**???：**  
Wait, now isn't time for chitchat!  
You're completely covered in scratches!  
  
**???：**  
Oh! Are you purr-ty badly hurt?  
If you'd like...  
  
**???：**  
As a token my gratitude, I can sell you this healing medicine  
at the modest price of 390 rupies!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You're [i]selling[/i] it to me?  
**Choice: (4)**  It's too expensive.  
`Tag 3`  
**???：**  
What's the matter? You look paw-sitively catatonic!  
This medicine usually costs double the price,  
so you're getting a purr-ty good bargain here.

`Tag 4`  
**???：**  
Nyow, nyow, don't be rude.  
This medicine usually costs double the price,  
so you're getting a purr-ty good bargain here.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**???：**  
Hmm, oh well.  
I guess you did save my tail earlier...  
  
**???：**  
Fine, tell you what.  
Just for today, I'll let you try it out for free.  
  
**???：**  
No, no.  
I'm just repaying my debt,  
so there's nyo need to thank me.  
  
**???：**  
...Wait, nyow that I think about it,  
I said I'd repay you,  
but I forgot to ask for your name.  
  
**???：**  
I see... So you're {player}.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'm Tamaki!  
I work part-time at a taiyaki stall,  
and I'm usually zipping about here and there,  
so I'm paw-sitive we'll run into each other again.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Hope to see you around!  
  
**Tamaki：**  
I'll be off nyow.  
Hey, hold on!  
You've still got a scratch on your cheek.  
  
**Tamaki：**  
Rats! I don't have any healing medicine left...  
In that case—

`Tag 6`  
**Tamaki：**

leaving a bewildered {player} behind in her wake.
