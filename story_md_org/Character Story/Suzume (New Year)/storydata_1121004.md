**Narration：**  
{player} and Suzume have finished working at the shrine for  
the day, and are about to head home.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Sorry, could you please wait a minute  
while I go and get changed?  
  
**Suzume：**  
The sun's already gone down, so I'd better get back to the orphanage...  
Huh? What the—? There's suddenly a bright light...  
Eeeek!

**Narration：**  
One day during the New Year's holidays,  
{player} is called to Saren's house.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ah! Happy New Year!  
Milady Miss Saren, he has arrived!  
  
**Saren：**  
Happy New Year. Sorry for calling you out here so suddenly.  
The truth is, there's something I was hoping you would help me with.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Today, the entire Sasaki family will gather for a New Year's function.  
But we're short on staff because we have so many things to do...  
  
**Saren：**  
Therefore, I was looking for someone to help pound some mochi.  
I hate to ask, but would you mind?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I'd be happy to help.  
`Tag 1`  
**Saren：**  
You're a lifesaver! Thank you!  
I'll have you pound the mochi with Suzume, if that's okay.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'll flatten the mochi with a mallet,  
so I'd like you to chant for me.  
  
**Saren：**  
...Suzume, I know I'm the one who said you should give it a go,  
but maybe you should get him to do the mallet pounding.  
  
**Suzume：**  
No, I'll be fine!  
You tasked me with the job, milady,  
so I'll do my absolute best!  
  
**Saren：**  
O-oh?  
Er...  
It's just that you seemed to be struggling a little earlier,  
so I was a bit worried...  
  
**Maid：**  
Miss Saren! Might we trouble you for a moment?  
  
**Saren：**  
Yes, I'll be right there!  
Well, I'll leave you with Suzume. Let's talk later!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Okay, let's practice a little.  
I'll use all my strength to swing this mallet and—  
Woahwoahwoah!  
  
**Suzume：**  
S-sorry. When I hold it up high, I lose my balance.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Do you wanna switch places?  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzume：**  
I'm glad for the sentiment, but I want you to let me do it!  
I want to be useful to milady Miss Saren in non-cleaning pursuits as well.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I mean, I might mess up at some point...  
But if you're here with me, I think it'll be okay. We've still got some time  
to practice,  
so I'll figure it out before we're done!  
  
**Maid：**  
Next, we shall enjoy mochi that is freshly made  
right in front of your eyes. Now, if you please!  
  
**Suzume：**  
In the end, my practice was a total failure...  
B-but I'll try my best to put on an exciting show!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ready, here I go! Heave-ho! Heave-ho!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Heave-ho! Heave-ho!  
`Tag 3`  
**Suzume：**  
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I-I did it! It went really well!  
But I have to put more effort in to make sure...!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hiya  
aaaahhhh!  
  
**All：**  
Ohhh!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ah! Owieeee...  
S-sorry!  
I lifted the mallet so high that I fell backwards...  
  
**Gentleman：**  
Wow, that was fantastic!  
Never in my life have I seen mochi stick to a mallet and stretch so far!  
  
**Lady：**  
Such tough but supple mochi  
will surely taste divine. I simply cannot wait. ♪  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh? Th-thank you very much...  
  
**Saren：**  
Who would have thought such a miracle would occur due to one of  
Suzume's screwups?  
She really is one of a kind.  
  
**Saren：**  
Thanks to the both of you, we had a really fun day.  
Your tasty mochi was a massive success.  
  
**Suzume：**  
When I fell over backwards, I was a bit worried about  
how things would turn out.  
But I'm glad everyone seemed to have a great time.  
  
**Suzume：**  
It was probably because you were here  
that I was able to go all out like that.  
  
**Saren：**  
To tell you the truth, I didn't ask you here today just so you could help  
with the mochi.  
It was actually because Suzume really seemed like  
she wanted to see you.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Hwha?! Hold on, m-milady!  
D-d-d-d-did I r-really make a face like that?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
B-but the one who wanted to see him was you, wasn't it, milady?!  
When you were on the phone, you were all fidgety, weren't you?!  
  
**Saren：**  
Hey! I-I wasn't that nervous!  
Argh!  
  
**Both：**  
...Eheh, ahah, eheheh!  
  
**Saren：**  
*sigh* Maybe it was just an excuse.  
Yes, that's right.  
Both of us really wanted to see you. That's why I called.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I thought it might be nice  
to enjoy New Year's with you and milady.  
  
**Suzume：**  
So it was a real treat getting to spend New Year's together!  
...Wh-why do I feel embarrassed to say it again?  
  
**Saren：**  
Don't be embarrassed—I feel the same way.  
I'm glad the three of us could enjoy New Year's together.  
  
**Saren：**  
Oh! Since it's a special occasion and all,  
why don't we take a commemorative photo?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Good idea.  
I'll take it,  
so the two of you should—  
  
**Saren：**  
What are you talking about?  
We should take a photo of the two mochi pounders first, shouldn't we?  
You played the lead roles in all the New Year's excitement.  
  
**Saren：**  
Ah, to make it obvious you were making mochi, let's take the photo  
in front of the mortar.  
Suzume, grab the mallet and strike this pose...

**Suzume：**  
Uh,  
l-like this, right?  
  
**Saren：**  
You didn't look so awkward when you were doing it for real, did you?  
Come on, smile a little more!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ah, I'm always like this when my photo's being taken...  
O-okay then...  
Smile.  
  
![112100402.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/112100402.webp)  
**Saren：**  
Yes, yes, just like that.  
Okay, I'm going to take the photo... Say \"cheese\"!  
  
**Saren：**  
Yes, this will make for a nice memory of the mochi-pounding duo.  
Let's all get in the next one...

`image display end`  
**Ameth：**  
And... we're back.  
How was it? I fashioned that dream from bits of your memories.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Even on the other side, you and Suzume did a lot together.  
I think you guys might be a good match.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I don't quite know what Suzume thinks of you,  
but there's no doubt that she idolizes and depends on you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Therefore, make sure you earn that girl's trust.  
Well, I'm sure you can do that naturally, anyway.  
  

---  
  
**Suzume：**  
*yawn*...  
Huh? Were we sleeping...?  
And I had a weird dream...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Even in my dreams I'm having fun on New Year's.  
Could it be some kind of premonition...?  
  
**Suzume：**  
...Ah, I have an idea. When we get back to the orphanage,  
let's make mochi for the children!  
  
**Suzume：**  
The idea came to me in a dream,  
so I'm certain it's special.  
Let's make so much  
that we surprise milady!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Sounds like loads of fun.  
`Tag 4`  
**Suzume：**  
Heheh.  
On the way home, let's buy ingredients for the mochi!  
Seasoning, sweet soy sauce, soy flour, seaweed...  
  
There's a lot of preparation to do!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Let's pound mochi like we did in the dream,  
and make all the children happy!  
  
**Narration：**  
On the way home from the shrine, Suzume smiled happily  
as {player} took her hand, and the two of them went  
shopping for ingredients together.
