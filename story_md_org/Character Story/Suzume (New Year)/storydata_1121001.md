## Subtitle: Pleased to Meet You, Miss Shrine Maiden
  
**Narration：**  
The city of Landosol bustles with activity as the year draws to a close.  
As {player} strolls down the street—  
  
**Suzume：**  
Aaaahhhh!  
  
**Man：**  
Hey, young lady, are you okay?  
You've got to be careful. It's really busy around here.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Y-yes, I'm so sorry...  
Oh, I'm in the way! L-let me gather up all my stuff!  
  
**Man：**  
Hey now, if you get all flustered like that—  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ah! Wah! Yaaahhh!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Are you okay?  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzume：**  
Th-thank y—...  
Wait, what?!  
What are you doing here?  
S-sorry you had to see me make a fool of myself...  
  
**Man：**  
Hey, is this girl with you?  
It's kinda dangerous around here, so you should keep her close.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I have to pick up my stuff...  
Ah, s-sorry for being such a nuisance!  
Thanks for your help.  
  
**Suzume：**  
...This outfit?  
Oh, well I'm working part-time at the shrine.  
It's actually the formal attire of a shrine maiden, so I'm just borrowing it.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I've finished all my shrine errands for the day, so I was on my way back.  
But then I went and fell over again...  
*sob* Maybe it's because I'm dressed differently from usual.  
  
**Suzume：**  
...Huh? I'm always like this?  
W-well, that's...  
true, probably...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll help you carry your stuff.  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzume：**  
No, I don't want to trouble you...  
I can do it!  
There's not so much, so I can manage... Heeeave-  
hooo?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Ahhh, ouch!  
I bonked... myself on the head...  
  
**Suzume：**  
*sigh* I'm still screwing up at the end of the year...  
Even though my resolution for next year is to be less clumsy...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Mr. Priest, I'm back.  
  
**Priest：**  
I'm glad you returned safely, Suzume.  
...Oh, and who's this young fellow?  
  
**Suzume：**  
We live together at the orphanage.  
He, um, he helped me after I fell over on my way back here...  
  
**Priest：**  
That sounds about right.  
Well, we're understaffed and overworked,  
so there's not much that can be done about it.  
  
**Priest：**  
...Young man, I know it's rather sudden to request such a thing,  
but could you perhaps lend Suzume a hand with her work?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh? I'll be okay on my own.  
If we need more staff, then I'll just work harder!  
  
**Priest：**  
It's not a good idea to overstretch yourself  
when we don't have the necessary personnel.  
Besides, having a friend around will help you to feel at ease.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I-I would love to work together,  
but it would just be a bother for him...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Of course I'll help out.  
**Choice: (4)**  I'm happy as along as I'm with Suzume.  
`Tag 3`  
**Priest：**  
Thank you for agreeing to help on such short notice.  
Good news, don't you think, Suzume?  
  
**Suzume：**  
Y-yes!  
Let's do our best for the sake of the shrine!  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Suzume：**  
Huuuuhhh?!  
Ah, I see, you mean you're happy that we can work together, right?  
Y-you  
didn't mean anything weird by it, right? Sorry for overreacting, right?!  
  
**Priest：**  
You're talking in an unusual manner.  
Please calm down, Suzume. When you get flustered,  
you start to make mistakes.  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Priest：**  
It will be enough for you to do Suzume's tasks with her.  
Well then, I should let you get to work.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Let's see, the next task is to sweep the area around the shrine.  
Let's get started!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Whew. All done! Nice and clean.  
It's almost break time,  
so let's have a little rest.  
  
**Suzume：**  
Oh, by the way, I was given this amazake drink.  
It'll warm us up so we can keep worki—  
Ahhh!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Wahhh... I-I spilled all of it...!  
I-I'm so sorry! And after I brought it all the way here...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Boo hoo... I can't believe I'm still like this at the end of the year.  
I really am totally useless...  
  
**Suzume：**  
My resolution for next year is to be less clumsy,  
but at the rate I'm going, it seems hopeless...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Let's check our fortunes.  
`Tag 6`  
**Suzume：**  
Urk... You want us to try our luck with fortune slips?  
But what if I get \"Worst Luck\"? I'm not so sure...  
  
**Suzume：**  
...B-but if it's a good result, everything will be fine, right?!  
A-all right... Let's see what the new year has in store for me!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Mr. Fortune Box, hear my plea...  
Please give me a good fortune slip...!  
  
**Suzume：**  
O-okay, here I go! Hiyaaaa!  
Woah, my balance— Yah, wah, eeeeek!

**Suzume：**  
Urgh... H-how did I manage to run into a snowman?  
I-I guess there's no hope for the coming year after all.  
  
**Suzume：**  
...Oh, but thanks to the snowman, I'm not hurt at all.  
Do I actually have *good* luck...?!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Pull Suzume up off the snowman.  
`Tag 7`  
**Suzume：**  
P-please tell me the result first!  
What does the fortune slip say about my fortune?!  
  
![112100102.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/112100102.webp)  
**Suzume：**  
…\"Great Luck\"?!  
R-really?!  
Yay! I did it!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Then I bet I'll screw up a lot less in the new year,  
and loads of good things will happen!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Achoo!  
I-I'm a bit cold, now that I've relaxed....  
S-sorry, would you mind pulling me up now?

**Suzume：**  
Up we go...!  
Thank you.  
Eheheh. I can't believe I got \"Great Luck.\" It's sure to be a good year.  
I wonder if there are any good premonitions written on here...  
  
**Suzume：**  
My work \"will have many failures, so take extra care\"...  
  
H-how can this be? So I'm still a screwup after all?  
  
**Narration：**  
The joy Suzume felt at seeing \"Great Luck\" was short-lived,  
and the shrine grounds resonated with her lamentations.
