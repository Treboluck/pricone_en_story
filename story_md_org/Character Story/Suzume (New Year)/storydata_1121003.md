## Subtitle: Good Love Charm
  
**Narration：**  
One day, while working at the shrine,  
{player} and Suzume are taking a break.  
  
**Man：**  
Honey, have we run our relationship into the ground?  
  
**Woman：**  
You're scaring me, Darling...  
  
**Suzume：**  
Huh? What's the matter with those two over there?  
Looks like something's really getting them down...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Let's go and ask them.  
`Tag 1`  
**Suzume：**  
Yeah, let's.  
Maybe we can be of some help to them!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Um... Excuse me.  
Is there something troubling you?  
  
**Man：**  
...Well, you see, we pulled a fortune slip earlier.  
You know, to see what our future together will be like.  
  
**Woman：**  
But for our love fortune, we got the absolute worst result!  
What are the chances that we would *both* get it?!  
  
**Man：**  
We've been together for three years!  
And we were going to tie the knot!  
How could our relationship end like this?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I-I can't believe they're getting so worked up about something written  
on a fortune slip...  
Wait, is that how I reacted...?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let's try to calm them down.  
`Tag 2`  
**Suzume：**  
Y-yeah.  
Um... I don't think you need to worry about it too much.  
A fortune slip is a mindset, kind of like a guide.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I've also had the experience of being far too aware of my fortune.  
And honestly, it got me nowhere...  
  
**Woman：**  
Yes, but still...  
Ah, I have an idea!  
Miss shrine maiden, could you please marry us?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Whaaat?! Wh-what makes you think that's a good idea?!  
  
**Woman：**  
How should I put it?  
Right! Even with a terrible fortune slip result,  
I'm certain we can overcome it if we have the power of a shrine maiden!  
  
**Man：**  
You're right! This is a shrine! You're bound to do marriage ceremonies!  
Please help us save our lovey-dovey future!  
  
**Suzume：**  
A-are you sure you want me to do it?  
For a marriage ceremony, it's best to ask the priest—  
  
**Man：**  
No, I think the fact that we met here today is also fate,  
so we would like you to do it!  
Won't you?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
...A-all right, I'll do it. I'm not so sure I can get it all correct,  
but I'll try my very best for you both!  
  
**Couple：**  
Thank you so much!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'll just go and confirm with the priest that we actually do the ceremony.  
Please hold on a moment.  
  
**Suzume：**  
We *don't* do the marriage ceremony?!  
  
**Priest：**  
I'm afraid not. We have good luck charms for marriages, but the only  
rituals we perform at this shrine are for protection, and good health...  
I'm truly sorry.  
  
**Suzume：**  
I-I thought that since we have the good luck charms,  
it was a given...  
I should have checked first. What have I done...?!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I guess all I can do is tell the couple that we can't perform the marriage  
ritual. But it's going to make them sad again...  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Let's do the ceremony your way.  
`Tag 3`  
**Suzume：**  
My way?  
B-but is that really okay?  
  
**Priest：**  
As long as you wish to do something for the sake of others,  
I am certain your marriage ritual will be effective.  
  
**Priest：**  
As a shrine, we cannot hold an official ceremony,  
but if you are honest about the circumstances,  
I do not see a problem.  
  
**Suzume：**  
...Understood!  
Um, can I ask you to lend a hand as well?  
I need help figuring out  
how we should do the ceremony!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Sorry for keeping you waiting.  
First, I have something that I need to tell you both...  
  
**Suzume：**  
I'm so sorry!  
At this shrine, we don't actually perform the marriage ritual!  
  
**Couple：**  
Huuuh?!  
  
**Woman：**  
So is that it? Is our love for each other doomed to failure...?  
  
**Man：**  
So it's true... It's all over...!  
  
**Suzume：**  
B-but listen, instead of that...  
I know a marriage spell, kind of like a good luck charm, that could help! It goes like this!  
  
**Suzume：**  
L-like-like-crazy-looove-looove!  
H-he-he-head-over-heels-happy-joy-joy! Hah! Hah!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Heart-throb-future-happy-happy!  
`Tag 4`  
**Suzume：**  
*pant*... *pant*...  
That's the end of the ritual.  
H-how was it?  
  
**Couple：**  
............  
  
**Suzume：**  
Th-they're not saying anything...!  
Did I make them feel even worse...?!  
  
**Man：**  
Hey, honey, don't you  
feel like we're suddenly luckier in love?!  
  
**Woman：**  
Yes, I do! It must be the power of the shrine maiden and her boyfriend...  
I mean, it feels like they've shared with us the power of their own love!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Love?! N-nooooo waaaaay!  
W-we're close, but not that kind of close!  
  
**Woman：**  
Heheh, there's no need to be so bashful!  
  
**Man：**  
Thank you ever so much! Goodbye!  
  
**Suzume：**  
I-I was really caught off guard when they mentioned  
\"the power of our love\"...  
But I'm so glad we made them happy.  
  
**Suzume：**  
...By the way, the fortune slip that I drew  
said that it was good luck to work together with someone.  
  
**Suzume：**  
It's because I was working together with you  
that I was able to be of some use today. Hee hee.  
  
**Suzume：**  
This year too, I'm sure I'll need your help with lots of different things,  
so I hope we can continue to be great friends.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I hope so too.  
`Tag 5`  
**Suzume：**  
Heheh, it feels strange to talk about this kind of thing again, doesn't it?  
Ah, it's time to get back to work—  
 Wah?!  
Ouch! Obbwah! Waaaaahhh!  
  
**Suzume：**  
Urghhh... I-I can't move...  
Er... I'm sorry to throw this at you, but would you be so kind as to  
help me up...?  
  
**Narration：**  
{player} ended up having to struggle to save Suzume,  
who had somehow managed to bury herself under a large pile of snow.
