## Subtitle: Caught Between the Stars and the Ocean
  
**Narration：**  
Io and {player} safely make it back to shore.  
  
**Io：**  
We finally got back to the beach!  
It's all thanks to you that we didn't go adrift.  
  
**Io：**  
I'm sure you must be exhausted after that, right?  
Then let's take a little break.  
I'll treat you to something refreshing.  
  
**Io：**  
Excuse me!  
  
**Owner：**  
Hi there! Welcome!  
  
**Io：**  
Could we have two of your special tropical juices?  
  
**Owner：**  
Oh. Sorry.  
We're actually all out of fruit, so I can't make enough.  
  
**Io：**  
A-aww...  
  
**Owner：**  
Don't worry, though. There's enough left for one,  
so how about you share it with your boyfriend?  
  
**Io：**  
M-my boyfriend?!  
We're not in that sort of relationship!  
  
**Owner：**  
You not down for it, then?  
How about you, my man?  
You look like you're choking for a drink.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Gulp...!  
`Tag 1`  
**Io：**  
Hey there, you little rascal!  
You promised you'd do what I say!  
  
**Io：**  
You're the one that got us back to the beach, though.  
I'd rather not make us look like a couple, but oh well.  
  
**Owner：**  
That's what I like to hear!  
  
**Owner：**  
Here you go.  
I put two straws in there, so drink away.  
Enjoy!  
  
**Io：**  
Wow!  
This looks lovely!  
  
**Io：**  
Wait. I thought I made it clear that we're not a couple!  
We're just student and teacher!  
Back me up here!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm so thirsty...  
`Tag 2`  
**Io：**  
Oh no! I almost forgot!  
You go first!  
  
**Io：**  
Hey, don't drink it all!  
I know you're thirsty,  
but you'll drink my share at that rate!  
  
**Io：**  
Argh! I'll just have to fight back!  
*siiiiiip*  
  
**Io：**  
Mmm! Delicious!  
What a rich flavor!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Super close...  
**Choice: (4)**  My heart's thumping...  
`Tag 3`  
**Io：**  
I guess you're right. He said it uses fresh fruits,  
so it's probably close to their natural flavor.  
This is the perfect drink for summer.  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Io：**  
It's delicious enough to make your heart thump, right?  
You're making me extra glad  
that I got it for us!  
  
`Tag 5`  
**Io：**  
Wait! We ended up drinking it together!  
But it's so delicious that I can't hold back anymore.  
  
**Io：**  
We've only got one, so let's drink it together.  
I'll get mad if you take another huge sip, though.  
  
**Io：**  
That was great!  
I'm feeling all refreshed now!  
  
**Io：**  
Now then. It's time for round three!  
I need to get some actual swimming practice done!  
  
**Boyfriend：**  
Today was super fun!  
How about we get ready to head home?  
  
**Girlfriend：**  
Yeah, it's getting late.  
We sure played lots!  
  
**Io：**  
Huh?  
Oh no! The sun's starting to set!  
  
**Io：**  
Sad as it,  
today was incredibly satisfying.  
I never did manage to swim oroperly,  
but I got to have a lot of fun together with you!  
  
**Io：**  
Oh. I should return this glass.  
Wait a minute for me, okay?  
  
**Io：**  
When was the last time I had this much fun at the beach?  
It's been a while since I wore a swimsuit, too.  
I even bought this one specifically for today.  
  
**Io：**  
Not that I could tell him that, of course.  
It'd be embarrassing if he knew his teacher got this excited.  
Did I suit it, though?  
  
**Io：**  
Thank you for the juice!  
  
**Owner：**  
Oh, hey there! Thanks for bringing the glass back.  
And sorry for only being able to make one.  
  
**Io：**  
Not at all.  
It was delicious!  
  
**Owner：**  
Ha ha! That's great to hear.  
Did you enjoy your date today?  
  
**Io：**  
Oh, please!  
I keep telling you it's not like that!  
  
**Io：**  
...I did have an incredibly fun day thanks to him, though.  
It felt like I was the only one letting myself go.  
If anything, I want to make it up to him.  
  
**Io：**  
But I can't swim. I don't know much about the ocean, either.  
I'm not really sure what I can do...  
  
**Owner：**  
I've got just the thing for you, miss.  
You'll have to stay a bit longer,  
but it'll be more than worth it.  
  
**Io：**  
...?  
  
**Io：**  
Sorry for the wait!  
I got caught up talking to the owner.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  We should get ready to head home.  
`Tag 6`  
**Io：**  
Um...  
Could we stick around, just for a bit longer?  
Please?  
  
**Io：**  
Yay! Thanks!  
  
**Io：**  
Huh? You look a bit worried.  
Am I not a teacher worth trusting?  
  
**Io：**  
Don't worry. This is a reward for you.  
A special one—  
the sort I can't give you at school.  
You'll be fine.  
  
**Io：**  
Down we go.  
You sit down, too.  
  
**Io：**  
Now, close your eyes...  
  
**Io：**  
...  
  
**Io：**  
...!  
  
**Io：**  
Oh! You can open your eyes now.  
  
**Io：**  
Hehe.  
Well? It's incredibly pretty, isn't it?  
I can see the surprise on your face.  
  
**Io：**  
You spent the whole day with me,  
so I wanted you to see this as thanks.  
  
**Io：**  
This is the first time I've seen it, too.  
I had high hopes, but it went far and above them.  
  
**Io：**  
Do you know why it's glowing like this?  
This won't come up on the curriculum for a good while yet,  
but it's due to sea sparkles in the—  
  
**Io：**  
...No, never mind.  
There's no need to be in teacher mode right now.  
  
**Io：**  
Hey...  
  
**Io：**  
I had a lot of fun today.  
This is the first time I've come to the beach with a boy.  
I've always wanted to do that, ever since I was a student.  
  
**Io：**  
In all honest, being with you is so fun  
that I sometimes forget that we're teacher and student.  
I mean, today's initial plan was to just practice swimming.  
  
**Io：**  
How about you?  
I hope I wasn't the only one that enjoyed today.  
  
**Io：**  
Keep the fact that we came here a secret, okay?  
Between teacher and student...  
No. Between me and you.  
  
**Io：**  
Oh...  
  
**Io：**  
It stopped glowing.  
  
**Io：**  
F-forget what I said just there!  
I wasn't being serious!  
  
**Io：**  
I'm going to be even stricter as a teacher from here on, so I hope you're ready!  
  
**Narration：**  
The horizon comes back into view as the ocean's glow fades out,  
leaving the pair caught between the stars and the ocean.
