## Subtitle: Exhilarating Weekend Antics
  
**Narration：**  
The Marjan Coast returns to darkness as the sea sparkle's glow fades away.  
  
**Io：**  
I might not be fit to be a teacher now that I've made one of my students  
stay out this late with me. As for you, you're naughty, naughty student.  
...  
Hehe. Just kidding.  
  
**Io：**  
Urgh...  
It might be summer, but it can still get chilly at night.  
Let's make our way home, shall we?  
  
**Io：**  
Hm? Did the ocean start glowing again?  
  
**Io：**  
It's a different color this time, though...  
And this light seems so familiar.  
  
**Io：**  
Wait.  
Eeek?!

**Io：**  
Sorry for making you come to school on a weekend.  
  
**Io：**  
I completely forgot that the deadline for cleaning the pool was today,  
and no one else was available to help. It was a real pickle.  
  
**Io：**  
Now then, let's not waste any time!  
I'll go get changed!

**Io：**  
Sorry for the wait!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  A swimsuit?!  
**Choice: (2)**  You look great.  
`Tag 1`  
**Io：**  
Hm?  
I mean, I'd hate to get my clothes all wet.  
And it's easier to clean wearing this.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Io：**  
Here's a suggestion.  
Less talking, more cleaning.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Io：**  
Okay, let's get started!  
  
**Io：**  
Phew. I sure worked up a sweat.  
But look! The pool's sparkling!  
  
**Io：**  
It's started filling up with water, too!  
Nice and cold!  
Time to splash you with it! Hah!  
  
**Io：**  
Ahahaha!  
Now that's what I call an overreaction!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Let's jump in together.  
`Tag 4`  
**Io：**  
Heehee. While that would be fun,  
I'm afraid I'll have to pass.  
I can't swim, alas.  
  
**Io：**  
Why am I the advisor for the swimming club when I can't swim?  
Getting to go in the pool all year round sounds fun, doesn't it?  
That, plus I couldn't find it in me to decline when asked.  
  
**Io：**  
Hey!  
I know what you're thinking!  
Someone who can't swim shouldn't be the advisor, right?  
  
**Io：**  
But that's not true at all!  
Here's what happens to boys that give their teacher lip!  
Take this! *splash*  
  
**Io：**  
Ahahaha!  
Come back in ten years, then maybe you'll stand a chance against me!  
  
**Io：**  
...Wait, n-no way! Is he drowning?!  
Wh-what should I do?!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Got you!  
`Tag 5`  
**Io：**  
Eeeeeek!  
  
**Io：**  
Oh, now you've doen it!  
I'm not holding back now!  
Take this! *splash, splash*

**Ameth：**  
Aaand welcome back.  
Sports swimwear has its own special appeal, doesn't it?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Mind if I ask what's with that grin?  
Didn't realize that you subscribed to the idea of the bigger, the better.  
I guess amnesia can't take away a guy's natural instincts.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Sheesh.  
How does one even begin to look that appealing?  
  
**Ameth：**  
No point in grumbling here, I supposed.  
I'm no match when it comes to appearances,  
but I've got a good chance when it comes to passion and feelings.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Sour grapes? As if.  
Okay, okay. That's enough. Off you go back home.  
  

---  
  
**Io：**  
Mmm... *yawn*  
  
**Io：**  
Goodness. When did I fall asleep?  
Feels like I had a dream where the two of us were having fun...  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Achoo!  
`Tag 6`  
**Io：**  
Hehe.  
I guess the chilly wind got to you.  
  
**Io：**  
The last thing you want is a cold before the summer holidays start,  
so let me warm you up a bit.  
  
**Io：**  
Okay. That should help a bit.  
  
**Io：**  
Hm? Your face is bright red.  
Do you have a fever?  
That would be awful! I need to warm you up more!  
  
**Io：**  
Ahhh! You're getting even redder!  
Whatever should I do?!  
  
**Narration：**  
Sticking close together, the two of them  
make their way home under the bright night sky.
