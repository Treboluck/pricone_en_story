## Subtitle: A Voyage for Two
  
**Narration：**  
Taking a rest on the beach, Io and  
{player} discuss their swimming practice.  
  
**Io：**  
Learning how to swim really is tough.  
I'm always worried I might end up drowning.  
  
**Io：**  
I felt pretty at ease earlier, though. Maybe it's because I'm with you.  
This is the first I haven't felt scared when going into the water.  
  
**Io：**  
If anything, I was actually a little excited!  
  
**Io：**  
Learning how to swim is today's main objective,  
but I'm feeling up for a little more now.  
Taking on the vast ocean, or something along those lines.  
  
**Io：**  
We're here already, so it's okay to have a little fun, right?  
  
**Io：**  
That said, I won't become a pro at swimming so quickly.  
What else does that leave us with?  
  
**Io：**  
Hm?  
What are you looking at?  
Is there something at the beachside cafe?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  They've got something good in stock!  
`Tag 1`  
**Io：**  
A... swim ring for two?  
  
**Io：**  
Oh! We can both set sail if we have that!  
Let's go buy it!  
  
**Io：**  
*blow, blow*  
  
**Io：**  
Phew...  
Getting a two-person swim ring all blown up sure is tough.  
  
**Io：**  
It's almost ready now, so could you finish the job?  
  
**Io：**  
Thank you!  
Give it your best shot, now!  
Take a deep breath and blow in!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  *bloooooow*  
`Tag 2`  
**Io：**  
Very well done!  
Now it's all ready!  
  
**Io：**  
Which means it's time to set sail!  
I'll let you take the lead!  
  
**Io：**  
Ahaha! Off we go!  
We might not be able to swim, but we can still enjoy the ocean like this!  
  
**Io：**  
I bet the sights underwater are really pretty, though.  
There's probably all sorts of fish with all sorts of colors.  
  
**Io：**  
But this is fun in its own way.  
Now I know there's more than one way to enjoy the ocean. ♪  
  
**Io：**  
Hm? What is it?  
Am I getting too excited?  
  
**Io：**  
Sorry. I let myself get carried away a bit.  
That said, you're no better yourself.  
  
**Io：**  
We're still pretty close to the beach,  
plus the swim ring will keep us safe, so there's no need to worry.  
  
**Io：**  
It feels pretty amazing to come out this far when you can't swim, though.  
I never even dreamed that this would happen.  
  
**Io：**  
And we're out here all alone, too.  
It's almost like we're the only people left in the world.  
Quite romantic, isn't it?  
  
**Io：**  
What say we go as far out as we can? Together, of course.  
Hehe. Just kidding.  
  
**Io：**  
The tide might drag us away if we go too far out, though,  
so let's make our way back.  
Going adrift is the last thing—  
  
**Io：**  
...?!  
  
**Io：**  
Hey, is that...  
Is that what I think it is?  
  
**Io：**  
Eeeeeek!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  What's wrong?!  
`Tag 3`  
**Io：**  
That thing up ahead is a monster's fin!  
It's going to gobble us up!  
  
**Io：**  
No, I can't just settle down! I'm terrified!  
  
**Io：**  
Waaahhh! I'm so sorry for being a teacher that can't swim!  
I'll practice as hard as I can to be an example for my students,  
so please don't eat me!  
  
**Io：**  
I already told you that I can't settle down!  
It's impossible!  
  
**Io：**  
How can you be so calm?  
No, I really can't—  
...  
Huh?  
  
**Io：**  
Oh.  
You're right...  
  
**Io：**  
You're right. It's just a rocky area.  
I got so flustered that I mistook it for a monster's fin.  
  
**Io：**  
Ehehe. Not quite becoming of a teacher, was I?  
I keep exposing my embarrassing traits to you today...  
  
**Io：**  
Ahem!  
Let's pull ourselves together and stick to the shore for now.  
  
**Io：**  
Huh?  
  
**Io：**  
Oh no. My legs are all stiff thanks to me panicking,  
plus the effort spent getting here.  
The waves keep pushing us back now.  
  
**Io：**  
We really are going to go adrift at this rate!  
  
**Io：**  
Wow! We're going so fast!  
I can't believe you're doing this on your own!  
Where does all that energy come from?  
  
**Io：**  
Hehe. Boys really can be reliable when it comes to it, can't they?  
  
**Io：**  
I think I might genuinely feel okay if we were left stranded  
alone in the world together.  
Maybe I'm relying on you too much, all things considered.  
  
**Io：**  
No, it's nothing!  
D-don't mind me!  
  
**Io：**  
Come on, keep it up!  
Go! Go! Let's go, {player}!  
  
**Narration：**  
As they always faced one another as student and teacher in the  
classroom, today was the first time Io realized just how reliable  
{player} could appear when leading others.
