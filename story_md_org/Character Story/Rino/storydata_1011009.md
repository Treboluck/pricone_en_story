**Narration：**  
One day, Rino heads over to a park a little way outside of Landosol.  
  
**Rino：**  
Mmm... Whew!  
Ahhh, the air's so fresh here!  
This park's always been such a lovely place.  
  
**Rino：**  
With everything that's happened lately, I'm feeling pretty worn out.  
But our guildmaster's apron's done now,  
so I'll forget about my worries  
 and just relax for today!  
  
**Rino：**  
As for my studies...  
Yeah, I'll work on those... tomorrow!  
  
**Rino：**  
Still, there sure are a lot of kids and families here today.  
Back in the day, I used to come here like that with Big Bro...  
  
**Boy：**  
Yaaay!  
  
**Girl：**  
Ahhh! Wait up! Big Broooo!  
  
**Rino：**  
Yep, yep!  
 We'd always run around just like that...  
  
**Boy：**  
Exploration squad, fall in! Follow after me!  
  
**Girl：**  
Okaaaay!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Okaaaay!  
`Tag 1`  
**Rino：**  
Wait, huh?  
Could that older guy playing with the kids be...  
  
**Rino：**  
Big Bro?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Why are you playing children's games?!  
Huh? Their parents asked you to bring the kids here to play?  
You never do stop helping people out, huh?  
  
**Rino：**  
...What about me?  
Well, I didn't come for any special reason...  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, I know! I can help you look after these kids!  
Coming to a big bro's aid is a little sister's job!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Can this nice girl join our squad?  
`Tag 2`  
**Boy：**  
Ehhh? Well, as long as she follows orders.  
  
**Girl：**  
Yeah, sure!  
  
**Rino：**  
Urk... I'm the lowest rank?  
Well, I'm used to that from my guild, anyway!  
  
**Boy：**  
Then let's get exploring!  
  
**Girl：**  
Yeah!  
  
**Rino：**  
Heheh. Games like this kind of take me back.  
Oh—hold up! If you run like that, you'll...  
  
**Girl：**  
Waahhh!  
  
**Rino：**  
Ah! I knew she was gonna trip!  
A-are you OK?  
  
**Girl：**  
A... aaah... Waaaahh! It huuuurts!  
  
**Boy：**  
Aw, c'mon... What were you thinking?  
  
**Girl：**  
Aaahhh... *sniff*... I'm sorry...  
  
**Rino：**  
Hold on a sec! I'll fix that up for you.  
  
**Rino：**  
Here we go... Pain, pain... go away!  
See? It's all OK now!  
  
**Girl：**  
Ah... aahhh...  
  
**Boy：**  
You're so clumsy.  
This is why I didn't want you to come!  
  
**Rino：**  
Hey. You can't say stuff like that!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  A good big brother protects his little sister.  
`Tag 3`  
**Rino：**  
Oh, Big Bro...!  
  
**Boy：**  
What the heck...?  
W-well, I guess I'm not some lame-o guy.  
  
**Boy：**  
You OK? Here, I'll give you a piggyback ride.  
  
**Girl：**  
M'kay...  
 Thanks, Big Bro...!  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh. All's swell that ends swell!  
You're the best, Big Bro!  
  
**Boy：**  
Bye-bye!  
  
**Girl：**  
See you later!  
  
**Rino：**  
Bye-bye now!  
Take good care of yourselves!  
  
**Rino：**  
So the parents were coming to pick them up, huh?  
At least the scratch wasn't too nasty. It won't even leave a scar!  
  
**Rino：**  
Anyway, what're your plans after this?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  You first!  
`Tag 4`  
**Rino：**  
Me? Well...  
 I'll stay here a bit longer.  
I did bring my textbooks along, so I think I'll get some studying done.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'll study with you, then.  
`Tag 5`  
**Rino：**  
Are you sure?!  
A-all right then! Let's have a study session!  
  
**Rino：**  
Although, it's been a while...  
Let's start from the basics, shall we?  
  
**Rino：**  
Umm, let's see...  
\"Of the flora in Ceres Forest, which of the following plants  
possesses the strongest fibers?\" Got an idea?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  The Creeper.  
**Choice: (7)**  The Twisted Acacia.  
**Choice: (8)**  The Rock Flower.  
`Tag 6`  
**Rino：**  
Correct!  
 Ooh, I'm pretty impressed, Big Bro!  
Makes sense—you've seen them in person  
during your odd jobs and guild activities!  
  
**Rino：**  
I know—you should take me along next time!  
I could use a field trip!

`Tag 7`  
`Tag 8`  
**Rino：**  
Ahh... Apparently not.  
If these are considered basics, I hate to think about the rest...  
  
`Tag 9`  
**Rino：**  
Well, let's try another one!  
This time I'll read an intermediate question.  
  
**Rino：**  
\"Its scales commonly used to make accessories and glitter,  
the Sea Drake has been sighted in which area?\"  
Hm, this one smells like a trick question, if you ask me...  
  
**Choice: (10)**  Loretta Coast.  
**Choice: (11)**  Metis Falls.  
**Choice: (12)**  Vesta Valley.  
`Tag 10`  
`Tag 11`  
**Rino：**  
Apparently not... Urgh, these questions are tough!  
I think I read too much into that one.  
Guess I'm being way too paranormal...  
  
Jump to tag 13  
`Tag 12`  
**Rino：**  
...That's right!  
Wow, Big Bro!  
 How the heck did you know that one?  
  
**Rino：**  
That's my Big Bro for you!  
An able orc hides its talons!  
...Hm? Wait, do orcs even have talons?  
  
`Tag 13`  
**Rino：**  
Wait, huh? It's evening time already?  
That sure did feel quick.  
Guess it's gonna get dark real soon.  
  
**Rino：**  
I had a bunch of worries, but studying with you made them fade away!  
Thanks for everything today, Big Bro.  
  
**Rino：**  
Wait, you're even gonna walk me home?!  
Eheheh, then it's not goodbye just yet, huh?  
Okay, let's head back to Landosol!
