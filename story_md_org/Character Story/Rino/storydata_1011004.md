**Rino：**  
*munch munch munch*  
Ahhhh, this is so gooood!  
  
**Rino：**  
Hey, Big Bro, how did you know this place  
has such tasty desserts?  
  
**Rino：**  
I see, I see...  
So you joined a guild called the \"Gourmet Guild\"?  
And their goal is to try out all sorts of food?  
  
**Rino：**  
That sounds like so much fun!  
Aw man, I'd love to be in a laid-back guild like that!  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh?  
If I want to join up, you'd be happy to have me?  
  
**Rino：**  
Ah, no, I'm already in Laby—  
  
A different guild! I'm in a different guild!  
  
**Rino：**  
I do appreciate the offer, but I'd like to focus on  
the work I'm doing in my current guild right now!  
So I guess I'll have to turn you down!  
  
**Rino：**  
Not that there's any rule against being a member  
of more than one guild at a time...  
  
**Rino：**  
But I don't think I'm really cut out for  
juggling that many responsibilities.  
  
**Rino：**  
So you do your thing, and if you come across any  
super tasty treats,  
 just get in touch, and you can  
introduce me to them once in a while!  
  
**Rino：**  
That would be more than enough to make me happy!  
  
**Rino：**  
I know I shouldn't really,  
 but I'd like to have  
more of these little dates,  
 Big Bro!  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh...  
Seriously though, the food here is just crazy delicious.  
  
**Rino：**  
Landosol is a big place, huh?  
I don't usually venture out too far from home,  
so I had no idea!  
  
**Rino：**  
Aww man, all these little cakes are all-you-can-eat?!  
This place is like a dream!  
They all have such cute, fancy little designs, too!  
  
**Rino：**  
And they taste divine!  
 It's like I've died and gone to heaven!  
  
**Rino：**  
...Like I've... died...  
Those exam results... did make me die a little inside...  
Urghh...  
  
**Rino：**  
*sniff*...!  
Ah—! Don't worry, I'm not crying!  
  
**Rino：**  
You cheered me right up already, so I'm peppier than ever!  
  
**Rino：**  
C-c'mon, you should dig in to your cakes too!  
They're all-you-can-eat, after all!  
You gotta try to eat as much as your stomach can hold!  
  
**Rino：**  
Wait, wha...?!  
Big Bro, did you just start glowing?  
  
**Rino：**  
H-huh? What is this?  
Do you have some weird condition that makes you glow  
when you eat lots of sugar?!  
  

---  
  
**Rino：**  
U-uwahhhhhh!  
  
**Rino：**  
Aahhh... *sniff*  
Uurrhhhh...  
Waaaaaahhhh...!  
  
**Rino：**  
...Unhh...?  
  
Ahh!  
 H-hi there, Big Bro!  
  
**Rino：**  
I feel like we always run into each other at the  
weirdest times, huh?  
  
**Rino：**  
*sniff*...  
Oh, no,  
 I'm totally fine...  
  
**Rino：**  
I might be crying a little bit...  
But it's not like I'm injured or anything!  
  
**Rino：**  
Honestly, you're such a worrysport, Big Bro!  
You'd win a gold medal in worrying!  
  
**Rino：**  
Mm-mmguah?!  
B-Big Bro...!  
I can wipe my face without your help!  
  
**Rino：**  
Urghh...  
I mean, I don't mind, myself...  
But you shouldn't go around touching girls' faces so casually.  
  
**Rino：**  
If they're using heavy makeup,  
you might end up opening a real Pandora's box!  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh...  
But you know, just seeing you here like this  
has calmed me down a bit.  
  
**Rino：**  
Somehow I feel like...  
Whenever I'm crying,  
you always show up like some kind of hero.  
  
**Rino：**  
It's silly, 'cause I'm such a crybaby...  
But thanks to you,  
I haven't been crying much at all lately.  
  
**Rino：**  
I bet nobody even remembers they used to call me  
\"Bawling Baby Blubberino\" anymore.  
  
**Rino：**  
Thanks to you, Big Bro,  
I think I've become a little stronger as a person.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  \"Blubberino\"...?  
**Choice: (2)**  \"Pecorine\"...?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rino：**  
Huh? You don't remember?  
  
**Rino：**  
As a kid, I really was a total crybaby,  
so the other kids would call me \"Blubberino\"  
  
and tease me about it.  
  
**Rino：**  
See, 'cause I was always blubbering,  
and my name's Rino, so... Blubberino...  
 Get it?  
  
**Rino：**  
I can't say it brings back the best of memories, so...  
I hope you'll just call me Rino, like normal.  
  
**Rino：**  
After all, it's not like I cry that much nowadays!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Rino：**  
Huh...?  
No,  
 that's... someone different...  
  
**Rino：**  
I know the name because you always talk about her,  
but she has a funny nickname too, doesn't she?  
  
**Rino：**  
Yeah...  
I mean, that can't be her real name!  
  
**Rino：**  
It does make me feel a bit of a bond with her, though.  
The naming sense is so similar!  
  
**Rino：**  
I'd like to meet her sometime.  
...There are things I'd like to ask her, too.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rino：**  
Hmm?  
Why was I crying today, you ask?  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, well... My mock exam results were kind of awful.  
So I was in a bit of a funk.  
  
**Rino：**  
I studied pretty hard for them, too...  
  
**Rino：**  
I mean, as long as I work harder for the real thing  
and get a passing grade, it'll all be fine!  
But right now, I'm feeling just a bit down in the dumps...  
  
**Rino：**  
Big Bro...  
If you wouldn't mind, could you help me out a bit  
with my studies again?  
  
**Rino：**  
It would make me feel bad to end up failing  
after all the help you gave me...  
But you'll see, I'll come out on top in the end for sure!  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh...  
I hope you'll keep cheering me on, Big Bro!  
  

---  
  
**Ameth：**  
Exams, huh...?  
Not an issue I can easily sympathize with.  
I mean, I've never been to school.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Looks like those gaps have been filled in,  
and everyone's brought these mundane worries along with them.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Good luck with all that, Rino!  
I'm rooting for you!  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh, right.  
Sorry, sorry, {player}.  
I guess I owe you an explanation, don't I?  
  
**Ameth：**  
The things you saw just now were something like a dream.  
I'm basically replaying your memories of people you were  
close to, so you can experience them a second time.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You and I are separate people,  
so this kind of roundabout method is the only way  
I can get the contents of your head in order.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I expect for a little while, I'll have to show you  
quite a few more dreams of this nature.  
  
**Ameth：**  
If you were to regain all your original memories in one go,  
your brain wouldn't be able to keep up.  
  
**Ameth：**  
But hey, you probably don't understand any of this.  
Just trust me for now, and I'll sort it all out.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Don't worry, {player}.  
I'll do my best... for you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You've done as much for me as you have for Rino,  
or maybe even more.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So I'll do whatever I can to repay what I owe you.

**Rino：**  
Big Bro...?  
  
**Rino：**  
What's wrong?  
I think you spaced out for a bit there.  
  
**Rino：**  
As far as that mysterious light goes,  
I asked Big Sis, and she filled me in on the basics...  
  
**Rino：**  
So I left you there  
 and waited to see what happened,  
like she told me to...  
  
**Rino：**  
It didn't make you feel sick or anything, did it?  
D'you want some tea?  
  
**Rino：**  
Hm?  
\"Sorry\"...?  
What're you apologizing to me for?  
  
**Rino：**  
You were trying to cheer me up,  
but now it looks like you made me worry instead...?  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahaha!  
C'mon, Big Bro, you don't need to worry about  
little things like that!  
  
**Rino：**  
Besides, you're always the one  
doing all sorts of sweet things for me.  
  
**Rino：**  
Once in a while, you need to let me do sweet things for you!  
  
**Rino：**  
Sweeter than all these cakes!  
I'll shower you with the whipped cream of affection,  
and make you feel all better! ☆  
  
**Rino：**  
...Yes, I'm all right.  
The exam results weren't everything I hoped for,  
but there's time to make up for that.  
  
**Rino：**  
And I'm starting to feel  
like things might work out with you now, too!  
  
**Rino：**  
Plus these cakes are beyond heavenly,  
and the weather outside is lovely!  
  
**Rino：**  
What reason could I find to cry on a day like this?!  
Ahaha!
