**Rino：**  
Hmm hmhmm~♪  
Thrifty thrifty thrifty store, thrifty-whifty store~! ♪  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahhhh, this store I found sure has some great deals!  
Good job, me!  
  
**Rino：**  
I guess the world's repaying my good deeds!  
What grows around clumps around, as they say!  
  
**Rino：**  
My mom never does give me much of an allowance...  
And Labyrinth isn't exactly a rich guild. Our guildmaster  
runs that crepe stand like she doesn't even care about profit...  
  
**Rino：**  
It's a nightmare for a fashion-conscious girl my age! My youth  
is going to waste! I want to dress up in cute accessories!  
Colorful and wonderful and full of flair and style! You know?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Heheheh! Good thing I've spent time honing my sewing skills!  
If I buy cheap second-hand clothes and spruce them up  
into the height of fashion myself, that's top value!  
  
**Rino：**  
I may not have cash, but I do have time!  
And like they say, time is honey!  
  
**Rino：**  
Ooh, this woolly sweater looks really nice too!  
And it's so cheap! Just 100 rupies?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Did the previous owner meet with an unfortunate demise  
or something?!  
 That's a buy for sure!  
  
**Rino：**  
If I unravel the wool, it'd make some cute gloves or a scarf...  
The possibilities are endless!  
  
**Rino：**  
Although, the area around Landosol has such a stable climate,  
there's not much call for cold-weather wear.  
Maybe that's why it's going so cheap? Hmmm...  
  
**Rino：**  
Ah, what's this tattered old cloth here?!  
Hmm... I guess if I patched it up with colored thread,  
it could be usable? Let's see the price...  
  
**Rino：**  
Guehh?!  
 Oh, I'm so sorry!  
I thought this was on sale!  
I didn't mean to grab you!  
  
**Rino：**  
...Wait, huh? ...Big Bro?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hello.  
**Choice: (2)**  \"Big Bro\"?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rino：**  
Um, right! Good afternoon!  
Wh-why am I getting flustered from a simple greeting?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Sorry I grabbed your clothes... I was so in the shopping zone,  
I wasn't paying attention!  
As an archer, I should keep  
a sharper eye on my surroundings, shouldn't I?!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Rino：**  
Ah! That was, um, y-you know...  
A-actually! I have this habit of calling people  
\"Big Bro\" or \"Big Sis\", no matter who they are!  
  
**Rino：**  
That's totally normal, isn't it?  
It's not?  
I'm so sorry!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rino：**  
Urghh... What now...?  
Our guildmaster specifically instructed me to avoid  
any contact with Big Bro...  
  
**Rino：**  
But now that I've grabbed him and said hello,  
it would be super rude if I just walked away!  
Not to mention embarrassing!  
  
**Rino：**  
He'd be all, \"What's that girl's deal?\"  
and think I'm a total jerk...  
  
**Rino：**  
Umm... Ahhh...?  
Big Bro, were you looking to buy something?  
  
**Rino：**  
Actually, your clothes... They're falling apart at the seams!  
What even happened there?  
Did your house blow up with you in it?!  
  
**Rino：**  
I see... You got mauled by monsters while out for a stroll?  
Like, inside the city?  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahh... Actually, a few monsters *have* been getting inside  
the city walls lately.  
 What an awful state of affairs, right?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahh... Why am I making small talk now?!  
Curse my naturally friendly and outgoing personality!  
But it's so much fun talking to Big Bro! ☆  
  
**Rino：**  
This is exactly what I've been wanting to do all along.  
But I resisted... Forced myself to stay away.  
It's been so lonely without you, Big Bro...  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh. At any rate...  
 I guess since your clothes got ruined,  
you came to buy some new ones, huh?  
Shall I help you pick out something good?  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh? Why am I being so nice to you?  
Ummm... My big bro always used to tell me  
I ought to be kind to strangers!  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh? He sounds like a real swell guy?  
That's right! I love my big bro more than anything!  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, but... This store only stocks ladieswear...  
You know, clothes designed for women, not men.  
So you'd look pretty weird in them. It'd spoil your good looks!  
  
**Rino：**  
You know, I do have my sewing kit with me...  
Would you like me to fix those clothes up for you?  
I don't know how great they'd turn out...  
  
**Rino：**  
But it's better than walking around in torn-up rags, right?  
I'll try to patch up the worst of the damage,  
then you can go find a shop that stocks men's clothing!  
  
**Rino：**  
Uwahh?!  
Why are you patting my head?  
Are you praising my quick thinking?  
  
**Rino：**  
That's very nice of you...  
I appreciate it, but it's pretty embarrassing out here in public!  
  
**Rino：**  
Sheesh, you're such a weird guy!  
That kind of affection is only for lovers or family, you know?  
  
**Rino：**  
Hmm?  
Oh! I guess I didn't tell you my name yet, did I?  
  
**Rino：**  
You can call me Rino!  
Somehow it doesn't feel like you're a stranger,  
so it's kind of weird introducing myself...  
  
**Rino：**  
But hey, it's a pleasure to meet you!  
I hope you'll remember my name and stuff,  
and not forget me any time soon, Big Bro!
