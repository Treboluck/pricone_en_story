**Narration：**  
Rino and {player} are on the way to visit their usual park.  
  
**Rino：**  
Th-  
the weather's nice, huh, Big Bro?  
  
**Rino：**  
Urgh... Why do I feel so awkward lately?  
Big Bro's the same as always...  
I've gotta snap out of this funk!  
  
**Rino：**  
I'm his sister.  
I love my big bro like any sister should,  
but that's all these feelings are. It has to be.  
  
**Rino：**  
Gr-great day for studying, so let's get...  
Huh? What's going on here?  
Something weird seems to be up.  
  
**Rino：**  
Let's check it out!  
  
**Narration：**  
As they arrive at the park, there is an unmistakable tension in the air.  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh? What's all this...?  
  
**Boy：**  
This way! Hurry!  
  
**Girl：**  
Waaahhh! Big Broooo!  
  
**Rino：**  
Are they... the kids we met before?  
Hey! It's not safe to run so fast!  
  
**Boy：**  
There's no time for that!  
We've gotta get away!  
  
**Rino：**  
Get away...? Wh-what's that?!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Boy：**  
We were playing in the park when those things appeared!  
I grabbed my sis and ran for it, but...  
  
**Girl：**  
Big Bro... I'm scared...  
  
**Boy：**  
I-it's gonna be OK! Your big bro will handle this!  
  
**Rino：**  
I see... You protected your little sister, huh.  
Good boy.  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  We have to stop the monsters.  
`Tag 1`  
**Rino：**  
Y-you're right!  
Hey, kids, can you get home on your own?  
  
**Boy：**  
Yeah... We can handle that, but...  
  
**Girl：**  
Aren't you guys gonna run too?  
  
**Rino：**  
Don't worry!  
We've got this!  
 Right, Big Bro?  
  
**Rino：**  
We'll hold the monsters' attention here...  
So you two head straight home!  
  
**Boy：**  
All right...  
 But be careful!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Rino：**  
Ah! Big Bro, the monsters...!  
...Huh? They're not actually attacking us...?  
  
**Rino：**  
Something's not quite right about them.  
They're barely even looking this way...  
  
**Rino：**  
And they're gathering under that big tree over there...  
Big Bro, do you have any idea what's going on?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Isn't there someone over there?  
`Tag 2`  
**Rino：**  
Ah! You're right! Right by the tree with the monsters!  
They could be in serious danger.  
We should go and warn them to run...  
  
**Rino：**  
Raising our voices could agitate the monsters, though.  
Let's take it slow and get a little closer.  
  
**Rino：**  
Carefully... Carefully...  
  
**Crook 1：**  
Ahahah!  
That's the idea!  
If you don't wanna get hurt, then get lost!  
  
**Crook 2：**  
Heheheh... Man, that was too easy.  
With all these monsters, nobody'll come near this place!  
  
**Crook 1：**  
Then we can...  
 Uh, what were we gonna do?  
  
**Crook 2：**  
Ya big dummy! I told you, didn't I?!  
 A fancy noble will claim this land as his own to build a resort,  
and then he'll be paying us a fat cash reward!  
  
**Crook 2：**  
I mean, who's gonna call a danger zone like this a public park?!  
Best of all, it's all the monsters' fault! Nobody can blame us for a thing!  
  
**Crook 1：**  
Aw heck, bro! You're such a genius!  
  
**Crook 2：**  
Who, me? I couldn't've set up the monster bait at the top of that tree  
without your acrobatics to help me, could I?!  
Just for that, I'll up your share from 80/20 all the way to 70/30!  
  
**Crook 1：**  
Aw heck, bro! You're such a penny-pincher!  
  
**Crook 2：**  
Don't sweat the details. What's pennies to a noble is a fortune to us!  
This place was wasted on those kids who can't make a single rupie!  
  
**Rino：**  
...!  
 How can you say that...?!  
  
**Crook 1：**  
Whoaaa!  
 And who the hell are you?!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  We heard everything.  
`Tag 3`  
**Crook 2：**  
Sounds like you heard too much.  
You've seen us for the geniuses we are!  
  
**Rino：**  
This is a precious place...  
We shared treasured memories here,  
and you think you can waltz in and ruin it?!  
  
**Rino：**  
There are some things that no amount of money can buy!  
You won't get away with this!  
  
**Crook 1：**  
Heheheh... What're you gonna do, then?!  
Climb this tree and snatch the bait with all those monsters in the way?!  
  
**Crook 2：**  
I'll tell you now, we didn't stop at one piece of bait!  
We bought a whole pile of the stuff to make sure this doesn't fail!  
  
**Rino：**  
Then what were you two planning to do?  
This land won't fetch much of a price with monsters around, you know!  
  
**Crook 1：**  
Well, obviously...!  
...What *were* we gonna do, bro?  
  
**Crook 2：**  
The plan? Well, we'll, uh... figure something out. I guess.  
  
**Rino：**  
They didn't think this through at all!  
Ruining the park and then just abandoning it? You're the worst!  
  
**Rino：**  
Yaaahhh!  
  
**Rino：**  
Urgh... At this distance, I can't get a clean shot at all...  
But if I fire off volleys, I'll run out of arrows in no time...  
  
**Rino：**  
At this rate, the park... My special place with Big Bro will be...  
Ahhhh... What can I do?!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Big Bro is here for you!  
**Choice: (5)**  You can do it, Rino!  
`Tag 4`  
**Rino：**  
...! That's right.  
I'm not on my own today...  
 I have Big Bro right by my side!  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh. Guess this isn't the time to be playing Blubberino...!  
Leave this to me, Big Bro!  
  
`Tag 6`  

---  
  
**Rino：**  
Ah...! This strength...  
 It's rushing through my body!  
Thank you so much, Big Bro!  
  
**Rino：**  
This enormous, warm power...  
It feels like you're even closer to me than usual...  
  
**Rino：**  
It's not like me to worry about measly little details, is it?  
I just need to keep firing with all my might!  
  
**Rino：**  
Yes, I'm fine now!  
When she's with her big bro, a little sister is invincible!  
  
**Rino：**  
Bullseye sniping? Wild volleys? I'll combine them both!  
Hit two birds in the bush with one stone in the hand!  
  
**Rino：**  
Take this... Solar Rain!  
  

---  
  
**Crook 1：**  
Hah! Those wild shots'll just hit the branches and...  
Wait, what's this power?! They're blasting the branches aside!  
  
**Crook 2：**  
Guahhh! D'you know how much that monster bait cost?!  
Don't let it fall! We gotta catch it!  
  
**Crook 1：**  
Aye-aye! Wait—  
uh...  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRRAAAAGHHH!  
  
**Crook 2：**  
Oh, shoooot!  
The monsters are turning to follow the scent!  
  
**Crook 1：**  
Eek! W-wait for me, bro!  
  
**Crook 2：**  
You moron! Stay away from me!  
 Arghhh!  
Why's this happening to me?!  
  
**Rino：**  
Looks like the monsters all ran off after those two.  
So, um, all's swell that ends swell... I guess?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  You were amazing.  
`Tag 7`  
**Rino：**  
Yep! You and me together can't lose!  
Thanks so much, Big Bro.  
  
**Rino：**  
You were right... It wasn't like me to get indecisive.  
If I really want them,  
 I should go ahead and take both!  
  
**Rino：**  
As a little sister... and as a lover...  
I won't let go of my feelings for Big Bro!  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Something wrong?  
`Tag 8`  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh. Nope, nothing at all!  
Let's clean this place up, shall we?  
Just you and me, together as always!  
  
**Narration：**  
With new resolve in her heart, Rino felt stronger than ever before,  
and her smile lit up the park like the sun in the sky above.
