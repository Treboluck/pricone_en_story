# Rino Episode 11
While studying with {player}, Rino finds herself engulfed in a blinding glow. In a dream, the two of them are out shopping together when Rino almost gets swept away in the crowd and {player} comes to her rescue. The physical closeness makes her so embarrassed that she is bashful even after they wake up.

**Narration：**  
Today, Rino and {player} are once more visiting  
the park where they used to play as children.  
  
**Rino：**  
Mmm, what great weather!  
It's a perfect day for...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Studying!  
**Choice: (2)**  Napping!  
`Tag 1`  
**Rino：**  
That's right!  
You were kind enough to spend the day with me,  
so I can't go and waste it!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Rino：**  
You're right... I could just close my eyes and...  
Wait, no, I can't!  
A lapse like that could cost me the exam!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rino：**  
C'mon, let's get to work!  
Question number one! \"Name the following monster species.\"  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh? I didn't even finish reading the question.  
Do you already know the answer?  
No need to glow so brightly. You can just...  
  
**Rino：**  
Wait! Ahhhhh, Big Bro!  
You're glowing again!  
Ummm, at times like this...  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh? Don't tell me I'm glowing too this time?  
Aaahhhhh!

**Rino：**  
Oh, there he is!  
Heeey! Big Broooo!  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh.  
 What a coincidence, meeting you here!  
What're you up to?  
  
**Rino：**  
...I sneakily ask, though I already know.  
My mom told me all about it this morning!  
Your mom and dad are away, leaving you home alone!  
  
**Rino：**  
So if I happen to come over and make dinner myself,  
I'll leave an awesome impression!  
  
**Rino：**  
Ohhh? So you're shopping for dinner ingredients?  
But Big Bro, can you really cook all by yourself?  
  
**Rino：**  
Aw, you poor thing!  
Guess I'll have to help you out!  
  
**Rino：**  
With that decided, I'd better join you on your shopping trip!  
Let's get moving!  
  
**Rino：**  
No parents to tell you what to eat...  
 It's tempting to let yourself go,  
but it's times like this that you need to eat responsibly!  
Don't worry, I'll whip up a nutritious dish full of love!  
  
**Rino：**  
Leave it to me!  
Believe it or not, I've had plenty of practice in the kitchen!  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, you'll hold the basket for me?  
Eheheh. I'll let you handle that, then!  
  
**Rino：**  
Feels almost like we're a newlywed couple or something...  
So, Big Bro, anything you specially want to eat?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Anything's good!  
`Tag 4`  
**Rino：**  
Oh, there it is. \"Anything's good\"...  
You do know that's the least helpful answer of them all?  
  
**Rino：**  
Use it too much and you'll ruin your marriage in no time flat!  
You'd better remember that, Big Bro!  
  
**Rino：**  
Still, it's no biggie.  
I know your tastes like the back of my own hand.  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheh.  
 I haven't spent years as your little sis for nothing!  
I can guess what you're craving  
 without any trouble!  
  
**Rino：**  
So tell me!  
 Is the food you're thinking of... a solid?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Yes.  
**Choice: (6)**  No.  
**Choice: (7)**  Hard to say.  
`Tag 5`  
`Tag 6`  
`Tag 7`  
**Rino：**  
I see, I see!  
OK, next... Is it an occasional dinnertime treat?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Yes.  
**Choice: (9)**  No.  
**Choice: (10)**  Hard to say.  
`Tag 8`  
`Tag 9`  
`Tag 10`  
**Rino：**  
Now we're getting there!  
Final question! Is it one of your favorites?  
  
**Choice: (11)**  Yes.  
**Choice: (12)**  No.  
**Choice: (13)**  Hard to say.  
`Tag 11`  
`Tag 12`  
`Tag 13`  
**Rino：**  
I've got it!  
The answer... is curry!  
How's that? I'm right, aren't I?  
  
**Choice: (14)**  Yes.  
**Choice: (15)**  No.  
**Choice: (16)**  Hard to say.  
`Tag 14`  
`Tag 15`  
`Tag 16`  
**Rino：**  
Yep! I knew it the whole time!  
I'm your sister, after all!  
  
**Rino：**  
At times like this,  
 \"betting your hedges\"  
 is the wisest move!  
Potato stew works too, but you can't get more classic than curry!  
  
**Rino：**  
With that settled, let's go grab some veggies!  
C'mon, this way!  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh? Why'd you stop?  
Oh...  
 I think I smell something tasty!  
  
**Woman：**  
Free samples! Who wants a free sample?  
  
**Rino：**  
Ooh, don't mind if we do!  
Mini hamburg steaks... So that's what caught your eye!  
  
**Rino：**  
Wait, your hands are full with the groceries.  
I'll grab one for you! Here you go. Say \"ah\"...  
  
**Rino：**  
And I'll have one too.  
 Mm, they're tasty!  
Would they make a good curry topping, I wonder?  
  
**Woman：**  
You can even stew them into the curry if you like!  
  
**Rino：**  
Hmm, we're well within budget...  
 Yep, let's go for it!  
  
**Woman：**  
Here—pleasure doing business with you.  
You've got a good eye, miss. You'll make him a fine wife!  
  
**Rino：**  
Uwehh?! A-a fine wife? Me?!  
Th-th-th-th-that's not exactly, ummmm...!  
  
**Rino：**  
Ummm... The thing is, we're... ahhh...  
  
**Choice: (17)**  We're brother and sister.  
`Tag 17`  
**Rino：**  
Right! That's right!  
Wh-what a shocker that was, huh, Big Bro?!  
  
**Woman：**  
Oh... I'm very sorry, then.  
You two seemed so close, I just assumed!  
  
**Rino：**  
W-we're very close siblings!  
Thank you for the meat!  
 N-now then, we need onions and carrots...  
  
**Woman：**  
Oh—it's almost time for the sale to start, so do be careful...  
  
**Rino：**  
Ooh, a sale?! We should hurry, Big Bro!  
But why did she say to be careful?  
  
**Announcement：**  
We will now begin a special limited-time sale!

**Rino：**  
Waaahhh! Wh-what a crowd!  
I-I'm gonna get crushed...  
  
**Rino：**  
B-Big Bro?!  
You shielded me from the crowd... Thank you for that.  
  
**Rino：**  
Hrnghh...  
 Now if we can just make our escape somehow...  
Huh? Big Bro, where are you going?  
That's the wrong way...  
 You're going deeper into the crowd!  
  
**Rino：**  
At this point, it's faster to keep going?  
O-oh, I see... And that way we can even grab the sale item.  
All right, then!  
 \"No adventures, no video games,\"  
 like they say!  
  
**Rino：**  
But with this many people...  
 Eurghh..  
S-squeezing us from every side...  
  
**Rino：**  
No, I don't mean it hurts!  
 It's just, you're so close, I can feel... your  
warmth, and smell your scent, and all that...  
 N-not that you smell bad!  
It's just, um, ahhh...  
 You know, it makes my heart go a little...  
  
**Rino：**  
Ohhhh... What am I supposed to do in a situation like this?!

`image display end`  
**Ameth：**  
And that's a wrap.  
You probably understand by now, but all that was a dream.  
  
**Ameth：**  
A dream of bygone possibilities between you and Rino.  
I see, I see, so that's how it went this time...  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'll give you points for the way you protected her.  
It looked like she enjoyed it too, didn't it?  
Yes, that was one of my better ideas...  
  
**Ameth：**  
Hm? Did I do something, you ask?  
Whatever could you mean? Heheheh.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Ah well, I doubt you'll remember much of this anyway.  
Just keep taking good care of your sister, \"Big Bro.\"  
Well, bye-bye now!  
  

---  
  
**Rino：**  
Uwehh...?  
Was I totally asleep just now?  
And that dream... Was that what our guildmaster...?  
  
**Rino：**  
Wait—Big Bro?! Whoa, I'm so sorry...  
My head,  
 i-it's in your lap, huh...  
Wait... but weren't you asleep too?  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh, I see... You woke up first and tried to make me comfortable.  
Eheheh... Thank you for that.  
  
**Choice: (18)**  I just did what any big brother would do.  
`Tag 18`  
**Rino：**  
Oh!  
 O-of course. I am... your little sister, after all...  
  
**Rino：**  
Lately Big Bro's started treating me more like a little sister,  
even hanging out with me like this. But...  
  
**Rino：**  
What is this...?  
This weird, unsatisfied feeling deep inside my chest...  
  
**Rino：**  
Urghh... The more I think, the less I understand!  
Ahaha...  
 Guess this isn't the best time to study.  
Shall we just head home now?  
  
**Narration：**  
Feeling somehow unsure about her little sister position,  
Rino set off homeward with {player} by her side.
