# Rino Episode 5
Rino tries to retrieve a rare plant that produces a valuable dye, but struggles to reach its precarious location. With the help of {player} who happens to wander by, she tries to retrieve it with an arrow, but messes up. But by a lucky coincidence, the arrow hooks onto the plant, and the operation is a success.

**Rino：**  
Nghhh...!  
Pull the bowstring as far as it'll go... And release! ☆  
  
  
**Rino：**  
Urghhh... With my arm strength and this bow, it won't quite  
reach...  
 This is awful! After coming all this way to find this  
rare plant!  
 Do I have to give up and look somewhere else...?  
  
**Rino：**  
But you know... I had to scour Brisa Canyon for a whole day  
to finally spot this single sprig.  
If I don't retrieve it, I feel like I'll never find another one...  
  
**Rino：**  
Only that rare plant will do to make the dye I need.  
It only grows here in Brisa Canyon,  
and it costs a small fortune to buy in the shops...  
  
**Rino：**  
Actually, it's because it fetches such a high price  
that lots of merchants have been gathering it like crazy...  
  
**Rino：**  
So any specimens in easy-to-reach locations  
will have been snatched up already for sure.  
  
**Rino：**  
That one was only left out there in the middle of the cliff  
because nobody could retrieve it.  
  
**Rino：**  
So I should probably assume I'm not going to find  
any options easier than that one.  
  
**Rino：**  
The idea was to fire a hooked arrow with a rope tied to  
the end, snag the plant with it, and pull it in!  
But in the end...  
 *sigh*... I guess that's just not happening.  
  
**Rino：**  
If I missed the mark and shot *through* the plant,  
it'd be ruined. The whole thing's just too tricky.  
  
**Rino：**  
When I thought up the plan,  
 I was ready to cry out \"Eureka!\"  
But reality is too cruel...  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh well, new plan. I'll give up on that plant for now,  
shoot down a few monsters instead, and sell their hides.  
Then I can buy a stronger bow, training my skills all the while!  
  
**Rino：**  
Let's play the long game!  
Haste makes paste, but slow and speedy wins the case!  
That's what they say!  
  
**Rino：**  
Of course, if I take it *too* slowly, the plant might  
shrivel away to nothing...  
  
**Rino：**  
But hey... Can't hurt to give it one last try for good luck!  
Pull the bowstring real tight, and...  
Nggghhh! Unleash this single arrow with all my might!  
  
**Rino：**  
Nguahh?! What the heck?!  
Don't leap out in front of me like that!  
I could've skewered you just now! Talk about a closed cave!  
  
**Rino：**  
...Wait, huh?  
Big Bro!  
What are you doing in a place like this?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I was out for a walk.  
**Choice: (2)**  What are [i]you[/i] doing here?  
`Tag 1`  
**Rino：**  
Huh?  
There are lots of monsters around here,  
so I don't think it's the best place for a stroll...  
  
**Rino：**  
I mean, you're not all that strong, are you?  
You should think before you act!  
I don't want you getting injured! You'll make me worry!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Rino：**  
Oh, I was just trying to do a bit of pointyshooting...  
Huh? That's not a word?  
  
**Rino：**  
Umm... Spikyshooting?  
Sharp... Something sharp?  
You've gotta know what I'm talking about, right?!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rino：**  
At any rate, Big Bro!  
Do you see that funny-looking plant growing over there?  
I don't suppose you've seen any others that look like it?  
  
**Rino：**  
I really want to get my hands on that plant.  
To make a dye.  
  
**Rino：**  
You know, I'm not what you'd call rich...  
So when I'm making clothes,  
I try to gather the materials myself.  
  
**Rino：**  
When you don't have cash, you gotta put in effort!  
That's right, that's right!  
 That's the only plant  
that can make the color of dye I need!  
  
**Rino：**  
I was actually asked by my, um, superior...  
Like, an important person at my guild, to make this outfit.  
So I want to do it right! But she's so particular about the color!  
  
**Rino：**  
So, well, I wanted to get that plant and make the perfect dye.  
But it looks like my current skills aren't up to the task.  
If only my arrow would reach, I think I could manage it...  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh! I just had a great idea!  
Let me fix this bow to the ground...

**Rino：**  
Now Big Bro, you come over here!  
Let's work together and pull the string back extra hard!  
  
**Rino：**  
With our strength combined, the arrow  
might reach its mark!  
 I'll take care of the aiming,  
so you just focus on pulling as hard as you possibly can!  
  
**Rino：**  
You'll do it?  
Thank you so much, Big Bro!  
  
**Rino：**  
Well then, let's focus our sibling power, and... Nggghhh!  
When I say \"Fire!\" you just need to let go, OK?  
But we have to do it at the same time!  
  
**Rino：**  
Nnnggghhh...!  
All right, now! Ready, and... Fire! ☆

**Rino：**  
Whoaaa?!  
  
**Rino：**  
I-I'm so sorry, Big Bro!  
The bowstring snapped, and we took a massive tumble!  
You're not hurt, are you?  
  
**Rino：**  
Urghh... What a huge failure!  
I really thought this idea might work, too...  
  
**Rino：**  
Ahhh...  
I-I'm sorry, am I too close?!  
I didn't mean to! It was an accident!  
  
**Rino：**  
...  
  
**Rino：**  
Big Bro...  
When we were little,  
we used to snuggle up like this a lot, didn't we...?  
  
**Rino：**  
Um... Wait, no, sorry.  
You don't remember any of that right now, do you?  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh...  
For the moment, let's pull the arrow back in.  
  
**Rino：**  
I've got this wire tied around it, see,  
so if I wind it up, the arrow comes straight back!  
Heave-ho, heave-ho!  
  
**Rino：**  
If only your memories could be reeled in like this!  
Wouldn't that make things nice and simple?  
But things are never that easy in real life...  
  
**Rino：**  
Ohh...? No way! The arrow somehow landed on the plant  
I was aiming for, and hooked around it at the perfect angle!  
I actually managed to get the materials I was after!  
  
**Rino：**  
This is great!  
Coincidences are crazy, huh? Talk about a lucky quake!  
  
**Rino：**  
Hmm... I guess if you keep trying hard enough,  
sometimes fate is willing to lend a helping hand!  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh!  
Thanks for all your help, Big Bro.  
I feel like you gave me all sorts of great things today.
