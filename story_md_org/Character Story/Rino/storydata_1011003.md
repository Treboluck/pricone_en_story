**Rino：**  
Ah—Big Bro! Big Broooo!  
Talk about a sight for four eyes!  
  
**Rino：**  
You've gotta comfort me!  
I worked so hard for that exam, but I totally flunked it!  
A-all because I forgot to write my name on the answer sheet!  
  
**Rino：**  
When I self-scored the test, I was pretty sure  
I'd scraped together enough points for a passing grade...!  
  
**Rino：**  
Arghh, I'm so frustrated!  
The shock has blown everything I studied right out of my head!  
Urghh... I'm such an idiot!  
  
**Rino：**  
Ever since that day we ran into each other in town,  
you did all those study sessions with me too...  
After all the help you gave me... I'm so sorry!  
  
**Rino：**  
Urghh... I'm so stupid and hopeless. I'm always like this...  
I spend hours working on an outfit, only for the whole thing  
to fall apart because I forgot the most important thread...  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Cheer up, Rino.  
**Choice: (2)**  I got a passing grade!  
`Tag 1`  
**Rino：**  
Ughhh... I know my high spirits are my strongest feature,  
but I can't even find the energy for that today!  
I'm a total mess! Though I do appreciate you trying to help...  
  
**Rino：**  
Arghhh, I'm so angry with myself right now!  
I want to crawl into a bowl and cry!

`Tag 2`  
**Rino：**  
Whaaa?! Since when were you taking the exam too?!  
Huh?! I never noticed! Were you there in the hall with me?!  
C-congratulations on getting in...?  
  
**Rino：**  
Ohhh...  
 You didn't mean the entrance exam—  
you passed the interview for a part-time job?  
  
**Rino：**  
Sheesh, don't say it in such a misleading way!  
I'm pretty sensitive to words like \"passing grade\" right now!  
You should be more considerate, Big Bro!  
  
**Rino：**  
At any rate though, congratulations!  
 When you get paid,  
you should treat me to something! Like tasty desserts!  
Sugar is the only antidote for this kind of sadness!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh...  
All this shouting is making me feel a little better.  
  
**Rino：**  
Let's try to think positive!  
These exams are held pretty regularly!  
 So maybe I messed up  
this time,  
 but if I keep trying, I'm sure I'll pass eventually!  
  
**Rino：**  
In fact, now that I have time to study more,  
I might get a good enough score to qualify for the scholarship!  
Then you could say I was lucky to fail this time around!  
  
**Rino：**  
Urgh... Just saying the word \"fail\" is kind of painful.  
Aaahhh... Sorry for bothering you like this, Big Bro.  
I should head home. Gotta tell my parents about the results...  
  
**Rino：**  
Muehh?!  
Hey—don't pull on my hair loops like that!  
  
**Rino：**  
Since I always tie them up,  
those hairs are strained at the roots...  
I need to be gentle with them, or they fall out!  
  
**Rino：**  
Huh? They look like train straps, so you want to grab them?  
What's a \"train strap\"?  
  
**Rino：**  
You know, Big Bro, you do say some weird things sometimes!  
Not that I'm one to talk, with all the sayings I get wrong...  
  
**Rino：**  
Oh...?  
You just got your first paycheck,  
so you'll treat me to something?!  
  
**Rino：**  
It was thanks to your study sessions with me  
that you managed to get the job?  
So you want to thank me?  
  
**Rino：**  
Aw, man... I really didn't do anything!  
You earned yourself that job with your own ability!  
You're an amazing guy, Big Bro!  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh!  
 I knew all along, you know?  
You can do just about anything!  
Even things that would be impossible for me!  
  
**Rino：**  
I really look up to you. You're my hero!  
  
**Rino：**  
Hmm... All right, I'll take you up on your offer!  
Let's go buy some sweet treats! I want to binge a little!  
We'll blast away all this frustration before the day is out!  
  
**Rino：**  
Really, I shouldn't be spending this much time with you...  
But I don't care who gets mad at me today!  
I deserve a little treat once in a while!  
  
**Rino：**  
I'm sure you probably don't remember...  
But you always find me when I'm feeling down,  
or I've had a rough day. You always seem to know.  
  
**Rino：**  
Then you sympathize, cheer me up, and give me little treats.  
So I can never stay feeling down for long!  
 ...That must be  
why I grew up into such a bright and energetic girl! ☆  
  
**Rino：**  
Eheheh... You probably don't get it at all...  
So I'll just say: thank you, Big Bro!
