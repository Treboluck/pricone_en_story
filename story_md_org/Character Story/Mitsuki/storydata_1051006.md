## Subtitle: Mitsuki's Special Lesson
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is helping Mitsuki  
with another of her experiments.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Let's stop here for today, shall we?  
Great work.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Heheh, you look really worn out.  
But alas, I still have so many spells to test.  
I need you to stay strong for me, okay?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Come to think of it, can't you use magic yourself?  
You're not devoid of magical energy like Ruka, are you?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  I never thought to try.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mitsuki：**  
I could teach you a few spells!  
As thanks for sticking with me until you were so tired out,  
I'd be happy to give you a very thorough lesson.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'll give it a try.  
`Tag 2`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Then it's decided!  
With a few special lessons from Professor Mitsuki,  
you'll be a mage in no time!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
What spell should we learn first?  
Maybe a fire spell. Those are always useful.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
First, you'll need to know the incantation.  
It's, \"O blazing flames, spring forth from my hands!\"  
...Got it?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
The other key point is to regulate your own magical energy.  
If you can't control it, you can't feed it through the  
incantation to produce the effect.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
It might be difficult to grasp at first, but go ahead  
and give it a try.  
First, steady your breathing...  
Spread your consciousness across your entire body...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Find where your power is naturally gathering...  
It should be around here.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
What's wrong? It's here, around your belly button.  
Focus on bringing your power lower.  
Now now, don't lose concentration.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Do you really have to, um, touch...  
`Tag 3`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Are you ticklish? Still, try to focus.  
You have a fine belly. Pleasant to the touch... It's soft, yes, but very masculine, too...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Come on, you're losing focus again.  
Here, I'll inject my own energy  
to coerce yours into awakening from its slumber...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Heheh... Did you feel that? That's magical energy.  
Once you recognize it, you'll never forget the sensation.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Let's move on to the next step.  
Time to try the incantation.  
I'll whisper it in your ear, so repeat after me.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
O blazing flames, spring forth from my hands...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
What's wrong? Your breathing is shaky.  
Try to calm your mind again...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  But your breath on my ear...  
`Tag 4`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Are your ears that sensitive? Ooh, I found a sweet spot! ♪  
*blow*  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Hehe, I'm just teasing you.  
Now, recite the spell.  
Let the energies in your abdomen rise up through your core,  
and out through your fingertips.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
What a healthy heart you have. I can feel your heartbeat,  
even from over your clothes. It's a little fast, though...  
It might be hard to concentrate on the incantation like this.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I know. Why don't we try linking our senses together?  
Try to feel the beating of my heart, just like I did with you.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Here, put your hand on my chest.  
Just like this...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Well, do you feel it? You can press harder if you like.  
Try to feel it as clearly as possible...  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I can feel... a racing heartbeat...  
**Choice: (6)**  I feel dizzy.  
`Tag 5`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Heheh. But is that my heart racing? Or is it yours?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Don't be embarrassed. You need to focus on that sensation.  
  
Jump to tag 7  
`Tag 6`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Oh dear, are you getting too nervous?  
Just from this? My, you're cute.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
But it's all right. That's a sign your senses are heightened.  
That feeling will improve the chances of your magic working.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Yes, that's it...  
Try it now. Recite the spell one more time!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
A misfire... I guess it didn't work this time.  
But I think you have the right idea.  
Do you want to keep going?  
  
**Choice: (8)**  Please, have mercy!  
`Tag 8`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Well, that's a shame. But no matter.  
I really enjoyed teasing—  
I mean, teaching you.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
In fact, I just had an idea for a brand-new spell.  
I'm going to develop a spell that two mages can cast together.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
When you're around, it sparks so much creativity within me.  
You're almost like... my magical muse, in a way.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
As for your magic, let's try a different approach next time.  
Heheh, yet another experiment! I can hardly wait.  
  
**Narration：**  
Mitsuki's grin was filled with childlike enthusiasm,  
but {player} couldn't help but feel  
that there was a bewitching quality lurking just behind it.
