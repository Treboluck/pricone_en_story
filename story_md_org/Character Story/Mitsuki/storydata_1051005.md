**Narration：**  
{player} runs into Mitsuki while out in town.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Hello there...  
Oh my, you're looking quite pale.  
Are you all right?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
You're losing sleep because of work?  
I see... That's too bad.  
But remember, your body is also a valuable test subject,  
so I can't have you wantonly abusing it. I kid, I kid.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I'm actually working on a magic spell right now.  
Let me use it to fix you up.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
What's wrong?  
Oh, don't worry. No need to be afraid.  
This magic is safe. The first test subject is standing  
right in front of you.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I haven't felt well-rested in a while lately,  
so I've been researching a new spell to help me  
feel more refreshed.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
It promotes healing in your body and suppresses  
the causes of fatigue.  
It took me quite a while to get  
the technique just right!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Oh look, I think the spell is already doing its job.  
Try moving around.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
See? It worked, didn't it?  
Sounds like this experiment was a great success.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Thank you!  
`Tag 1`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Heheh, it's nice to hear some genuine gratitude.  
Well then, while we're here, shall I throw in a little bonus?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Don't panic, don't panic. It's not going to kill you.  
If anything, you might even feel extra recharged!  
Well then, here goes!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Energies mine, make this man the object of all desire!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
That was a spell to boost pheromone secretion and efficacy.  
Now, women will find you irresistible.  
You won't be able to keep them off of you!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
What's wrong? Wondering why I'm not behaving differently?  
Well, of course it wouldn't work on me. After all...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I'm already utterly infatuated with you.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Kidding, kidding!  
I'm wearing some special magical accessories  
to negate the effects.  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Um, um... Excuse me, good sir!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
There, you see? It's working already.  
  
**Woman 1：**  
I think I've fallen in love with you at first sight!  
Please go out with me!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
What do you think? Isn't my magic incredible?  
Looks like this experiment was a great success as well.  
  
**Man 1：**  
Hold it!  
I saw him before you did. He's mine!  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Who are you?! Actually, it doesn't matter.  
I know I'm the one he's going to fall in love with!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Heheh, what a pretty sight.  
How does it feel to be so popular all of a sudden?  
  
**Man 2：**  
That young man's heart will be mine alone!  
I won't let anyone else have him!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Who'd have thought it? That's three suitors already!  
And it looks like there are more where they came from...  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Don't go! Please be my boyfriend!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Get out of my way, all of you!  
My darling and I are meant to be together!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
All of you are in my way! Scram already!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Just look at them all! This spell is more effective  
than I thought.  
Even men are feeling the effects.  
I'll have some interesting data to look over later!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Don't just stand there—help me!  
**Choice: (3)**  Please reverse the spell!  
`Tag 2`  
**Mitsuki：**  
I think not.  
I'm having far too much fun watching this play out.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
You can handle a little romantic trouble, right?  
I want to soak in this sight a little while longer!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Heavens, no! Then I wouldn't be able to collect any data!  
Let's keep this going a while longer.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
It'll be fine. I know you have the stamina to handle this.  
Go on, you can do this for me!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Woman 1：**  
Hold on, where are you going? Wait for me!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Come back at once! I can't let you get away!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I want to see how long the spell's effects last,  
so you keep running like a good boy!  
You're doing great! ♪  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Please waaait!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Aaaahhh! Why must you run so fast?!  
  
**Man 1：**  
Where are you running to? Come, leap into my arms!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
*wheeze*... *pant*...  
The more you run, the more I want you!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Welcome back! Looks like you got away unscathed.  
And the magic's effects still haven't worn off.  
What truly excellent results! Thank you for your sacrifice!  
  
**Man 2：**  
YOU'RE MINE NOW!  
  
**Man 2：**  
I've finally caught up to you, my darling! ♪  
Now, hurry up and press your lips to mine, you fool!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Please, no more!  
`Tag 5`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Well, okay. As much as I'm enjoying this, it's outside  
the scope of this experiment.  
Let me help you out.  
May the chains of passion be shattered forthwith!  
  
**Man 2：**  
Oh my. What's going on? Where am I...?  
And you! Who might you be?!  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Oh no, look at the time! I need to finish my shopping!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Looks like they've all come to their senses. If it had gone on  
much longer, I'd have feared for your innocence.  
Guess we stopped it just in time.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
It's funny, though...  
Whenever one of them tried to kiss you, I had the strangest  
urge to reverse the spell, no matter who they were...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Could it be? I know I said it was a joke before, but...  
Perhaps I really am in love with...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
...Just kidding.  
Good work out there today. Let's go home.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Was that really a joke?  
`Tag 6`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Maybe... Why don't you tell me?  
Try to work it out!  
If you guess right,  
I'll give you something really special...  
  
**Narration：**  
And so saying, with a subtle smile on her face,  
Mitsuki turned and walked away.
