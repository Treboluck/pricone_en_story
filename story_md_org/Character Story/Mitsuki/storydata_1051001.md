## Subtitle: Poisonous Flowers
  
**Narration：**  
{player} makes his way to the town outskirts  
to complete a quest he accepted in Landosol.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Oh, are you the person who answered my request?  
I'm your client, Mitsuki. Pleased to meet you.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I want to pick some of the flowers that bloom in this area.  
Will you give me a hand with gathering them?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
You probably won't know which ones they are,  
so I picked one as an example.  
This is the flower I'm looking for.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Smell the flower.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Oh, don't do that. You shouldn't approach things so carelessly.  
Some flowers can be dangerous, you know.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
This pollen of this flower is poisonous.  
More accurately speaking, it has poisonous effects on humans.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
And look here, at the stem. Do you see the little thorns?  
There's poison in there, as well.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
If you were to prick yourself or inhale any pollen,  
the results wouldn't be pretty.  
You want to be very, very careful.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
But you know, this poison is special. It has medicinal  
properties as well. Even deadly poisons can save lives  
in the right hands. Isn't that just wonderful?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
You must be wondering how I know all this.  
You see, I'm a scientist, and I specialize in botanical research.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
When I say science, I mean...  
  
Actually, let's save that for some other time.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Even a trace amount of pollen can be dangerous,  
so we'll contain them in this glass case, one flower at a time.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
All right, then let's get started, shall we?  
I'll warn you once more: be very, very careful.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
What's wrong? Oh dear, did you prick yourself?  
Are you all right? Let me see your hand.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Don't worry. From time to time, I like to play doctor as well.  
I know first aid well enough.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
It's not a deep wound. Not much poison will have  
entered your bloodstream,  
so it should heal by itself.  
No need for an antidote this time.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Goodness though, your hands... Your arms and  
shoulders, too... You're quite muscular, aren't you?  
Oh, this? I'm just giving you a quick once-over.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
You look thin, but you're actually rather toned.  
What a truly ideal, healthy body...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Listen... Would you like to become my test subject?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I have so many medicines to test and experiments to run.  
I think you can give me the results I want.  
What do you say?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  That sounds sketchy.  
**Choice: (3)**  Er, let me think about it.  
`Tag 2`  
**Mitsuki：**  
It's not sketchy at all!.  
Lending your body to science  
is good, honorable work, you know!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Mitsuki：**  
So you're considering it?  
That sounds like a yes to me. Oh, how wonderful!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Hey, you dumb quack doctor!  
We finally found you!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
And who's this? Just when things were getting good,  
someone had to interrupt. What a pity...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Um, I'm sorry to ask, but... Who are you?  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Don't you act like you don't know us!  
We're some of the patients you treated recently!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Now that you mention it, you do look somewhat familiar.  
So? How can I help you today?  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
It's about your medical bill! You gotta be kiddin' me!  
No way in hell I'm payin' that much! You filthy fraud!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I may not be a licensed doctor,  
but I helped you when you needed it most.  
Are you honestly in any position to complain?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
If all you were going to do was whine,  
maybe I shouldn't have treated you.  
That would have saved you from paying any bills.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
You should be thankful that you're alive and well enough  
to come and find me at all.  
With a little good, honest work,  
you'll be able to pay that bill in no time.  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Cut the crap! I thought maybe we could talk it out,  
but if you're gonna be like that,  
we're gonna have to settle this by force!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
And here I helped you when no one else would.  
It sounds like you boys need to learn a little gratitude.  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Tch...  
So we're doin' this then?!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I don't think anything I said would have changed that.  
Prepare yourselves!  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Hurgh! What's up with this wind?!  
I can barely stay standing!  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Don't let it get to you! It's just wind!  
A little wind never hurt nobody!  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
Yeah, you're right...  
Heh, nice try, lady.  
Now it's our turn!  
  
**Ruffian 1：**  
Yeah! ...  
Wh-what the? The hell?!  
I can't move my legs!  
  
**Ruffian 2：**  
I-I can't either! And m-my body's... going numb!  
I can't breathe...! *cough* *gasp*  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Heheheh! I knew it would kick in soon.  
These flowers have a paralyzing agent  
in their thorns and pollen.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
And the wind you felt just now was actually full to bursting  
with pollen from these flowers. It's so fine that you can  
hardly see it, but trust me, there was a lot.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Since you inhaled it all, of course you can't breathe!  
But don't you worry!  
  
I'll make sure you never have to breathe again.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Stop her.  
`Tag 5`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Oh, what's this?  
Why are you interfering?  
I can't finish them off with you standing there.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  They won't be able to pay you.  
`Tag 6`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Haha... I suppose you're right about that.  
They have to be alive in order to pay their bill.  
  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Very well, then. I'll let you boys go this time.  
You can thank this young man.  
Of course, I will make sure that bill gets paid.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Now that we're done picking flowers, let's head back to town.  
Don't worry about those guys. The poison will wear off in a  
little while. Let's go.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Excellent work today. I'm glad this went by quickly.  
Here. It's your pay for today's work.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Oh, what's the matter?  
...I see. You must have inhaled some of that pollen yourself, didn't you?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
You pricked yourself earlier,  
and now there's pollen in your lungs too.  
You could be in serious danger.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Without immediate treatment, it could easily prove fatal.  
Now, I do have the skills to treat you, but...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
How about this?  
If you agree to help me with my experiments  
from time to time, I'll treat you right away.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
A healthy young man like yourself as a test subject  
could really advance my research.  
Do we have a deal?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Fine.  
`Tag 7`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Heheheh. Then the contract is sealed.  
Now let me heal you. Hold still...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
You should be all right now.  
See? You can move again, can't you?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I'm glad I got to you in time.  
Now don't forget your promise, okay?  
Heheheh.  
I can't wait for our experiments together!  
  
**Narration：**  
Seeing Mitsuki's bewitching smile,  
{player} felt sure that in the whole wide city,  
there was nowhere for him to run...
