## Subtitle: Feelings Forgotten
  
**Narration：**  
Once again, {player} is allowing Mitsuki  
to experiment on him.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Ahhh, I got some very interesting data from you today.  
You really are a most wonderful test subject!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I'm a little concerned, though. Lately, I've found myself  
growing bored with any experiments that don't involve you.  
It's just dreadful.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
At this rate, I won't want to send you home for the evening  
anymore.  
It might be easier if we just lived together.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You want to... get married?  
`Tag 1`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Married? Marriage, huh...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I take no interest in such meaningless social conventions.  
You don't need to get married just to be together, now,  
do you?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Ahh! What's this light?  
I didn't plan any more experiments today...  
Wait... Didn't something like this... happen to us before?  
  

---  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
─Ah, hello?  
Yes, it's me!  
We haven't spoken in ages!  
How've you been?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Don't you worry, I'm alive and well!  
Today's my first day off in a while.  
How about you? Still doing good?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Really? Well, that's nice then.  
Is that all you wanted?  
We should grab dinner sometime─  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
A boyfriend? Who has time for all that?!  
I've been swamped with my research and experiments...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
...Wait, seriously?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Congratulations! You'd better invite me to the wedding!  
I'll be there even if I have to pull three all-nighters!  
Let me know the date when you can. Bye-bye now!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
*sigh* A wedding, huh...

**Mitsuki：**  
Uh-oh. It's finally happening...  
I, of all people, am looking at wedding magazines!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I didn't think my old friend getting married would hit me  
so hard. Urghh... My heart hurts just thinking about it.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Rushing into these things never did anyone any good.  
I know that, but...  
 Oh well, I'd better pay for these.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Hi there.  
`Tag 2`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Wh-wha—?!  
Y-you?! What are you doing here?!  
Actually, more to the point...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
D-did you... see it?  
  
**Choice: (3)**  Are you getting married?  
`Tag 3`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Nguahh! O-  
of course not! These magazines aren't for  
people who are getting married, they're for people who  
*want* to get married! Don't make me say it out loud...!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I'm at that age where most of my friends have tied the knot  
already...And I mean, it's not like I really *want* to, I just...  
had a bit of a weak moment...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Do you not have a boyfriend?  
**Choice: (5)**  So you're just curious?  
`Tag 4`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Really? *You're* asking me that?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
What do I mean...?  
You're a real heart-breaker, you know that?  
Though you might be too dense to see it.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
But no... I shouldn't let this get to me so much.  
I may have panicked a bit.  
  
Jump to tag 6  
`Tag 5`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Th-that's right, yes, of course... Why do you ask?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Well, sure, I would like to get married someday.  
But there's so much I want to accomplish first.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Thinking of it that way...  
Maybe I was just feeling pressured by everyone around me.  
I didn't need to panic like this.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Even so... I think... I might just... buy this one magazine.  
You wait right here!

`image display end`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Thank you for earlier.  
Somehow talking to you made me feel a lot better.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
So! Care to join me for a meal?  
It'll be my treat. For helping me feel better.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
You helped me get through this little incident.  
But if I wind up single until I'm forty,  
I'll be asking you to take the fall for it.

**Ameth：**  
Aaaand... welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just saw was basically a dream.  
Once you wake up, you'll probably forget everything that  
happened. So don't worry too much about it.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Never would have thought Mitsuki would want to get married.  
I suppose at her age, she's feeling the pressure.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I really thought all she cared about were her experiments.  
I mean, that's pretty much how she comes off.  
  
**Ameth：**  
You don't think maybe... Mitsuki started thinking about  
marriage  
because of a certain someone?  
  
**Ameth：**  
I'm just teasing. That's enough for today.  
See you later!  
  

---  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Mmnh...  
Oh my goodness.  
What am I doing sleeping here of all places?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
The same thing happened before, didn't it?  
That's right! We fell asleep together, and then we had  
the same dream, remember?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
What? You dreamed of me buying wedding magazines?  
B-but that's the same dream that I had!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
W-wait... Why'd you have to have THAT dream too?!  
You saw nothing! Tell me you saw nothing!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I mean, it's pathetic, isn't it?!  
Here I was, telling you I had no interest in marriage,  
but then you find out I really do?!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
It was just a dream! I'm not interested in marriage in the  
slightest!  
So forget you saw anything, you hear me?!  
If you don't wipe it from your brain, I'll MAKE you forget!  
  
**Narration：**  
As Mitsuki descended on him with red-faced wrath,  
{player} wasted no time  
in excusing himself very, very quickly.
