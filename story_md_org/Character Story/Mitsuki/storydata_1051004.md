# Mitsuki Episode 4
Mitsuki and {player} have a strange dream together, in which Mitsuki seems less than thrilled about collecting data from animals at a zoo. When a monkey touches her, she panics and asks for help, confessing that she doesn't really like animals.
  
## Subtitle: Trouble in Paradise
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is accompanying Mitsuki  
on a visit to see one of her patients.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Sorry about this.  
I know you were hoping for another experiment.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You couldn't be more wrong if you tried.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Oh please, don't be like that.  
What's the problem? Rare experiences are a valuable thing!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
My patient today is overseeing the mining work in this area.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
He has a reputation for being difficult, but I've never gotten  
that impression.  
Maybe he plays nice for his doctor,  
because he's only ever seemed chatty to me.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Is there anything you can't handle?  
`Tag 2`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Well, I suppose there is.  
But I'm not in the habit of sharing my weaknesses.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Oh my...?  
What's all this light?  
Why do I  
suddenly feel so sleepy...?  
  

---  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Why am I here at a zoo of all places?  
*sigh* I can't stand this.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Yes, I know I'm the one who said we need  
animal data for this experiment,  
but I thought  
I asked you to collect the data in my place!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
You think it's more effective if I do it myself?  
Well... I suppose you do have a point.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Fine. I've already come this far.  
I'll have to suck it up and get to work.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Hehe... I was dreading this, but it's actually kind of fun.  
I liked seeing the bears and the elephants.  
Oh, and the tigers were lovely too.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Large animals are so neat to observe.  
I like thinking about how I could defeat them  
if I had to fight them.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Where are we going next?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
What... The petting zoo?!  
N-no, I absolutely refuse! It's far too dangerous!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Oh, but I do need to collect the data...  
Ugh... Fine, then.  
Let's get this over with already!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Wow... There are so many animals here...  
Yes, um... Bouncy little bunnies... They're definitely cute.  
As long as I'm just looking...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
P-pet one?!  
You think I'm crazy?! No way!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You wanna feed one?  
**Choice: (4)**  You wanna hold one?  
`Tag 3`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Feed one?!  
B-but I wouldn't want to make it choke or anything...  
  
Jump to tag 5  
`Tag 4`  
**Mitsuki：**  
M-maybe another time...  
I don't know how it likes to be held.  
I wouldn't want to make it mad...  
  
`Tag 5`

**Mitsuki：**  
Eek! A-a monkey! It jumped on me!  
Help! Get it off of me!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Yeah, so... I'm actually, um... not great with animals...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I don't hate them, and I'm not scared or anything!  
I just... don't know how to approach them.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I don't mind watching them from afar, but...  
It's not easy being this close, let alone *touching* them!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I... I can't do this anymore!  
Can we please leave now?!

**Ameth：**  
Aaaand... welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What you just saw was basically a dream.  
Once you wake up, you'll probably forget all about it.  
So don't worry yourself too much.  
  
**Ameth：**  
So Mitsuki's not good with animals, huh?  
I'm a bit surprised by that.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Getting all panicked over a little furry friend...  
She's got a real cute side to her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I mean, usually she's all, experiments this, experiments that.  
She hardly ever shows a softer side.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Seeing a grown woman show weakness has... a certain appeal.  
Makes you wanna take care of them, y'know?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oops, I suppose we're getting off topic.  
That's enough for today.  
See you later!  
  

---  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Mmm? Was I... sleeping?  
Was I so tired that I fell asleep right here?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
And what's worse, I had a horrible dream...  
Why on earth would I dream about touching animals...?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Was one of them a monkey?  
`Tag 6`  
**Mitsuki：**  
What? Yes,  
it was. It was a small breed...  
Wait, did you have the same dream?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Well, well... How incredibly mysterious.  
Very, very interesting.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Perhaps we should do some tests  
to see if we can recreate the phenomenon!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Say now, after this, why don't you come to my place?  
I have all sorts of things I want to try on you.  
  
**Narration：**  
Having a very bad feeling about this,  
{player} ran away from Mitsuki  
as fast as his legs would carry him.
