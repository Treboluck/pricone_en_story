## Subtitle: An Antidote for Weariness
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is strolling through the city  
when he spots Mitsuki carrying several bags.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Oh, hello. What a coincidence.  
Are you out shopping, too?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I see, you're going for a walk.  
I'm, well...  
As you can see, I've been shopping for some things.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Lately, I've had so many patients coming to see me,  
I'm constantly running low on medical supplies and equipment!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
It was difficult enough just making time in my schedule  
for this shopping trip...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Of course, keeping busy is a good thing, really.  
It gives me plenty of subjects to try out new medicines on...  
Heheh.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  That's not very doctorly of you!  
**Choice: (2)**  Please don't experiment on your patients.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Oh, don't worry! I do treat their actual symptoms eventually.  
If I didn't, I wouldn't have so many people  
clamoring to see me.

`Tag 2`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Oh, don't worry! I'm always prepared for negative outcomes.  
If things go wrong, I just dissipate the medicine with  
my magic and nobody notices!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Mitsuki：**  
And the latest medicine I tested  
worked exactly  
as I hoped it would!  
...Don't you worry.  
I would never make a medicine that would kill my patients.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Medicines in testing are usually kept away from patients,  
even if they're effective, right?  
To avoid any accidents.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
But somebody has to give them a thorough testing,  
or the field of medicine will never advance.  
And that's where people like me come in.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Criminals or other patients in desperate circumstances  
come to me for things that ordinary doctors can't handle.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
When I tell them about my new medicines,  
they beg me to administer them right away,  
even knowing the risks involved.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
So our interests clearly align.  
I get to test my medicines,  
and they get relieved of their ailments.  
Nobody comes out of this with a bad deal.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Once I've tested a medicine enough to determine  
that it's completely safe for use,  
I share the details with the other doctors.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
The more effective medicines we create, the sooner the day will  
come  
when even those who are unable to use magic can easily  
cure their own maladies.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
See? It's actually quite honorable work I'm doing.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I was wrong about you.  
`Tag 4`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Well, thank you.  
Wait, what did you think of me before?!  
...Just kidding! I'm not mad.  
I'm used to people being suspicious of my work.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  They're probably right to be.  
`Tag 5`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Ohhh...? You're really going to regret making that comment.  
...Kidding, kidding, I'm just being silly.  
Let's both stop teasing each other now, shall we?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
This is quite refreshing.  
I haven't had a nice conversation like this ins a while.  
I ought to thank you.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
There's no greater joy than helping people be happier and  
healthier, however small the improvements may be.  
That's why I  
get so sucked into my work.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
That being said... I'm not used to being *this* busy. *sigh*  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I'm still young, you know,  
so I didn't think a little extra work would tire me out this much.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Are you okay?  
`Tag 6`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Why, are you worried about me?  
Well, that's very sweet. Thank you.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
But it's hard to really say...  
Hmm. Am I okay?  
No, I suppose I can't say I am entirely.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I know. Why don't you let me rest on your shoulder?  
You never know. It might be just what the doctor ordered.  
See, aren't I funny?  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Offer your shoulder.  
`Tag 7`  
**Mitsuki：**  
What? Y-you're really going to do it?  
I was just making a joke...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I was just trying to tease him, so he'd stutter and blush,  
but now I'm the one blushing instead...!  
I didn't think he had it in him.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Really, though... I must say...  
Shouldn't you be a little more embarrassed about touching a girl?  
A little blush wouldn't hurt.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
You couldn't let that get in the way of your worry for me?  
Wow... That's awfully considerate of you.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
You know, you're much more of a gentleman  
than I gave you credit for.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
All right, if you're offering,  
then I guess I can take you up on it.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I've really been so busy, lately...  
I haven't had a moment to pause,  
let alone get any sleep...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
So I could use... a little... rest...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Zzz... Zzz...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
...Mmm...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
What...? Where am I...?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
It's you...  
Oh, I see...  
I must have fallen asleep on you.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Were you holding me up this whole time?  
You really should've woken me up...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I seemed really tired, though?  
Oh...  
You're so kind.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
You certainly helped me get a good rest.  
My head feels much clearer now,  
so I should be able to work through the next few nights.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
As thanks for your help,  
come visit me next time you need a doctor.  
I'll take good care of you.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
And in exchange... I hope you'll let me...  
borrow your shoulder again sometime.  
  
**Narration：**  
Having witnessed a different side of Mitsuki today,  
{player} found himself silently wishing  
she could be like that a little more often.
