## Subtitle: A Hypnosis Test
  
**Narration：**  
{player} arrives at Lucent Academy  
to make a delivery.  
But in one of the classrooms, he spots a familiar face.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Oh?  
I never thought I'd see you here.  
Are you working? I came here for work, too.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
From time to time, I teach lessons to the students here.  
In exchange, they let me borrow a classroom for my  
experiments.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I was actually just setting up an experiment now.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Oh, I know! Why don't you be my test subject for this one?  
You do remember our little agreement, don't you?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Don't worry. This experiment shouldn't be a dangerous one.  
...As far as I know.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Run away.  
`Tag 1`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Leaving so soon? That's a shame.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
What's the matter? Could it be... you can't open the door?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Just between you and me, I cast a little barrier  
on this classroom.  
As long as it's active, no one  
can enter or leave without my say-so.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Are you surprised?  
  
Normally I use it to keep my animal test subjects from fleeing.  
Good to see it works as intended.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
There's nowhere to run now.  
So just sit back and cooperate, mm?

**Mitsuki：**  
Lately, I've been selectively breeding roses to give off a  
specific fragrance. This is the result...  
Look at this rose.  
Doesn't it have the most beautiful colors?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Now... Why don't you sample its scent?  
  
Once you do, you should feel willing to do anything I say.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Hold your breath.  
**Choice: (3)**  Back away.  
`Tag 2`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Heheheh... How long do you think you can keep that up?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
It's getting difficult, isn't it?  
Just take a deep breath in.  
That's right... Don't fight it...  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Oh my, did you think you could get away from it?  
Sorry to say,  
but my barrier doesn't have any ventilation.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I took an antidote in advance, so I'll be fine.  
But you...  
Smell that? The fragrance is growing stronger and stronger.  
  
`Tag 4`  
![105100202.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/105100202.webp)  
**Mitsuki：**  
Ahah... You just breathed it in, didn't you?  
  
You'll start feeling the effects right away.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Do you feel yourself getting sleepy?  
Here, come have a seat.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
All right, let's make sure you're properly hypnotized.  
What is your name?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  ...{player}.  
`Tag 5`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Heheheh, very good.  
You've fallen completely into a trance.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Now, on to the next question.  
Tell me the most embarrassing memory of your entire life.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
...What? You don't have any? That's very odd...  
They're supposed to be easy to recall.  
Can you tell me why you don't have any embarrassing memories?  
  
**Choice: (6)**  I have no memories at all.  
`Tag 6`  
![105100202.webp](https://redive.estertion.win/card/story/105100202.webp)  
**Mitsuki：**  
Amnesia, huh...  
I had no idea.  
I suppose a simple hypnosis like this won't help you  
recover lost memories...  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Well then, why don't you tell me  
everything you know about yourself?  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Oh...? How intriguing... Then what?  
Hmmmm...  
That's very interesting.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
A Princess Knight? Strange powers to make women stronger?  
Is that really possible?  
How very remarkable!  
Please, tell me about this in greater detail!  
  
`image display end`  
**Mitsuki：**  
On the count of three, you'll awaken from my spell.  
One... two... three!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Good morning. How do you feel?  
You just told me quite a bit about yourself.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
Amnesia, special powers...  
You've really piqued my interest,  
not just as a test subject, but as a person!  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I'll have to do some much more thorough examinations of you!  
Heheheh...  
I love it when my research takes an interesting turn!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Swiftly excuse yourself.  
`Tag 7`  
**Mitsuki：**  
Hey, where are you going? I removed the magic barrier,  
but why don't you let me examine you awhile?  
It won't hurt a bit. I promise.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I have so many more experiments I want to do with you,  
so I want to get acquainted with  
each and every inch of your body.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
I wouldn't want to give you any medicine that might hurt you.  
That's why I need to do an extra thorough examination,  
right to the depths of your body.  
  
**Mitsuki：**  
There's a good boy.  
  
While I'm here, there are some other things I'd like to check...  
Now, let the fun begin!  
  
**Narration：**  
Unable to resist Mitsuki's cajoling,  
{player} allowed her to thoroughly examine  
everything but his most intimate areas...
