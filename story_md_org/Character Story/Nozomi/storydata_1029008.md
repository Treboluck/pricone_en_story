## Subtitle: A Birthday for Two
  
**Narration：**  
{player} and Nozomi are out having tea together.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
This place is famous for its delicious cakes!  
I can't wait for ours to come!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? Wh-what's with this light?  
Eeeeeek!

**Nozomi：**  
Oh, {player}, you really came!  
And you're right on time.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Sorry, but  
can you wait just a little longer?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I'm still in the middle of a shoot.  
These are gonna be featured in next month's fashion magazines.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Don't look so surprised!  
You haven't forgotten I'm an idol, have you?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Well, I like it when you treat me the way you always do,  
so I don't really mind if you forget...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Anyway!  
That's what's going on here, so just wait a little longer!  
  
**Cameraman：**  
Nozomi, that was great.  
Good job.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Thank you very much!

**Nozomi：**  
Sorry to keep you waiting, {player}.  
The photo shoot ran a little overtime.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Thanks for coming here today.  
I wanted to see you, even if we don't have much time.  
You know, I've been so busy, we hardly meet these days.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I just happened to be doing this shoot in Tsubakigaoka,  
so I thought I'd call you and see if you could come over.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I was really happy when you walked through the door!  
I bet my final shots turned out great thanks to you!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, this cake?  
Yeah, we used it for the shoot.  
They said we can eat it now that we're done.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Cake, cake! ♪  
Hey, when you think of cakes,  
don't you think of birthday cakes?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
D-don't read too much into this...  
but when's your birthday?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Soon.  
**Choice: (2)**  It already passed.  
`Tag 1`  
**Nozomi：**  
Hmm... Um, when exactly?  
Oh, that day, huh.  
I've already got work scheduled then.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Nozomi：**  
What! Really?  
I should've asked you sooner...  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Nozomi：**  
I guess I won't be able to celebrate your birthday with you...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Fine!  
Then let's celebrate  
your birthday today instead!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
We'll turn this cake into a birthday cake  
and eat it together.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Let me cut you a piece...  
...Ahh! Oh no!  
The fruit and cream fell off!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Aughh... It's so hard to cut straight.  
The whole cake is becoming a mess.

**Nozomi：**  
Huh? {player}?  
Wh-what's the matter?  
Why are you taking my hand?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You'll help me cut it?  
Okay... Then let's cut it together.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wow, you're good at this!  
What a clean cut.  
Yeah, that's perfect!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Okay, then. Happy birthday, {player}!  
Open wide...! ♪  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Eheh! What're you blushing about?  
Normally, you couldn't care less.  
Don't tell me you're starting to fall for me?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ah, that's right.  
Speaking of cakes, it's not just birthday cakes.  
There are wedding cakes as well.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Two people together, cutting a lavish cake...  
It's like something out of dream.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  We just cut the cake together.  
`Tag 4`  
**Nozomi：**  
Now that you mention it...  
It kinda was like cutting a wedding cake.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...H-hey! Don't be silly!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
We're still students, so...  
I-it's too early to talk about things like marriage!

**Ameth：**  
Hello. Welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I wish I could eat cake with Nozomi, too.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Even if it wasn't your actual birthday,  
do you realize how amazing it is to have a famous girl like her  
celebrating it with you?  
  
**Ameth：**  
You're a real lucky guy,  
so don't take that for granted.  
  
**Ameth：**  
What I'm saying is that  
you should treasure your time with Nozomi more.  
  
**Ameth：**  
If you continue with your nonchalant attitude,  
she might get tired of you.  
So be careful.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well anyway, that's enough chitchat for now.  
Bye-bye! ♪

**Nozomi：**  
*yawn* Huh?  
Did I fall asleep?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Was it because we were waiting for our cake?  
I dreamed you and I were in a cafe together...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
What? We were celebrating your birthday?  
How did you know that?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hmm.  So we dreamed the same thing.  
This is just like that other time.  
  
**Waitress：**  
Sorry for the wait.  
Here is your cake.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, look... This is just like the cake we had in the dream!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Y-yeah... That's right.  
The one we cut together...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wait, don't try to remember it!  
It's embarrassing, so just forget about it!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so they ate the cake together—Nozomi's face remained bright red the entire time.
