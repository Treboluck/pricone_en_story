**Narration：**  
Out for a stroll,  
{player} witnesses a girl being chased by a crowd of men.  
  
**???：**  
*huff, huff*  
What? They're still on my tail?  
Geez! Leave me alone already!  
  
**Men：**  
Nozomi!  
Wait up!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
*huff, huff*  
I... I've got nowhere left to run... Now what do I do?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Step in to help.  
`Tag 1`  
**Nozomi：**  
Eeek!  
Wh-who the heck are you?  
...  
You want me to hide behind you?  
Hold on, this is all a little too sudden...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wha—wait! Why are you taking out your weapon?  
Are you going to fight them?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
No, you can't! They're good people—don't harm them!  
Sure, they're chasing me, but they aren't villains.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  You're being chased... by good people?  
**Choice: (3)**  Are [i]you[/i] the villain?!  
`Tag 2`  
**Nozomi：**  
They're good people, but, you know, love can be a double-edged sword and...  
Wait, I am *not* having this conversation right now!

**Nozomi：**  
What? No! Why would you even think that?  
Look, not everything in life is so black and white—  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Royal Knight：**  
Hey, what's going on here?  
Hold it—you there!  
What do you think you're doing with your weapon out in a place like this?  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
Well, well, you must be the culprits responsible for this ruckus.  
Come with me! I'm taking you in for questioning!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
What? You gotta be kidding me!  
If the royal knights get a hold of us,  
who knows how many hours we'll be detained for questioning?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Agh, fine! This makes things simpler!  
You. Get over here! We're gonna make a run for it!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
*huff, huff* Phew!  
Um... Looks like we somehow managed to escape them.  
Now I can finally take it easy and...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
No way! It's nighttime already!  
I gotta get home to sleep. Well, there goes my precious day off.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Seriously... That was the *worst*!  
And it's all your fault!  
Who pulls out their weapon in the middle of the city?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You know what?  
I should've just given them autographs like they wanted me to.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hm? What's with the weird look?  
I mean, you'd be happy to have my signature too, wouldn't you?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Humm, you still look super confused.  
Wait, hold on.  
Do... Do you even know who I am?  
  
**Choice: (5)**  We've never met before, have we?  
**Choice: (6)**  Errr...  
`Tag 5`  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, um...  
Yeah, I'm sure this is our first time meeting in person.  
But that's not what I meant.

`Tag 6`  
**Nozomi：**  
You're hesitating. I guess that means you don't know.  
  
`Tag 7`  
**Nozomi：**  
Right, so you really don't know who I am.  
Ahaha! Sorry!  
Guess I've still got a long way to go!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Then... You helped me even though I was a complete stranger.  
You're a good person, aren't you?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I'm Nozomi.  
What's your name?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, I see... Got it!  
Sorry I said it was all your fault earlier.  
Thank you for helping me, {player}.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It was my fault you got mixed up in all of this.  
I wish there was some way to thank you, but...  
Oh, that's it!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Do you know what a Sound Record is?  
It's when magic is used to fuse music into a magical crystal.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
This here is my Sound Record.  
Would you be kind enough to accept it?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
See, the thing is, I'm actually an idol!  
The people you saw this afternoon were my fans.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But, yeah, you didn't know who I was.  
My goal is to become a top idol, but I've still got a long way to go.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Your support would mean so much to me!  
Well, let's hang out again soon!  
Thanks a lot for today!  
  
**Narration：**  
And so, through a strange turn of events,  
{player} came to be acquainted with an idol.
