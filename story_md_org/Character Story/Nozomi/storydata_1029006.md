## Subtitle: To See You Smile
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ah!  
There you are, {player}!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
We've decided on the date for my next concert!  
And, look, I brought a ticket for you!  
You've gotta come and watch!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? You've got work that day?  
I-I see... That's too bad...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
O-oh well, work is work. Yeah!  
Don't worry about it!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...  
  
**Narration：**  
A few days later, on the day of the concert—  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Morning, {player}.  
You're off to work now, right?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
About that work... I want to help out!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Why? Well...  
If you finish up early, then you can come to my concert, right?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
So please don't worry about it.  
What should we start with?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
First is carrying these boxes?  
So, we just need to transport them to the store?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Got it!  
With two of us, we'll get this done in no time at all!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
All right, let's get started!  
Up we go!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Come on, {player}, hurry up!  
We've gotta get this done quickly!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? I'm going too fast?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Well, being an idol involves a lot of singing and dancing.  
I've built up quite a bit of strength, you know?  
Physical labor is no biggy!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
So, next up is cleaning.  
Since there's two of us, we can finish in half the time.  
Let's do it!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
We're done! What's next?  
...Another cleaning job, huh?  
Leave it to me!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
W-we're cleaning *here*?  
This entire castle?! J-just the two of us?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ughhh! Let's get it done!  
Whatever it takes, I'm getting you to that concert!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
So, the last job is picking up trash?  
Once we fill our bags with trash, we're done?  
*sigh* I guess there's no easy way around this one.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But this bag is huge. This is gonna take some time...  
I've still got rehearsals, makeup, and meetings to get through.  
Wonder if we can make it in time.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  How about I stay and do the rest?  
**Choice: (2)**  How about I finish it after the concert?  
`Tag 1`  
**Nozomi：**  
That would be pointless.  
You're coming to the concert, too!  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Nozomi：**  
You can't do that!  
You'll lose the trust of the folks you're working for!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Nozomi：**  
We'll finish the job, and then we'll *both* go to the concert!  
Got it?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...What?  
You're worried I'll be late for my own concert?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Don't worry, I'm a pro. There's no way I'll be late.  
We're getting this done on time!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? Why am I getting so worked up?  
Well...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I really want you to be there.  
I really want you to watch today's concert!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
We're done!  
Just need to deliver the trash bag, and that's it.  
I'll leave that to you.  
I've gotta rush to the concert venue!  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Thank you.  
`Tag 4`  
**Nozomi：**  
It's you who's always helping me out.  
I'm the one who should thank you.  
Glad I could do a little something today to return the favor!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...Don't be late for the concert, okay?  
Promise!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Whew... I'm glad I made it on time.  
He's watching from the audience, right?  
All right, let's do this!

**Nozomi：**  
Hi, everyone!  
Thanks for coming today!  
  
**Fans：**  
Nozomin!  
Looking good!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
First, I have a new song I want all of you to hear!  
It's my first love song... I wrote it myself!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...While thinking of you.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
That's why I wanted to sing it here first.  
\"Just to See You Smile\"  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...  
Now do you get why I wanted you here at *this* concert?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Heheh.  
Given how oblivious you are, probably not.  
  
**Narration：**  
Nozomi reflected on this with a happy smile.
