# Nozomi Episode 7
The two go out together, but Nozomi is again the subject of unwanted attention. Once they are alone, she tries to convey her feelings, but—believing {player} wants her to stay an idol—she hesitates.

**Narration：**  
The day after the concert,  
Nozomi pays a visit to {player}.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
After being so busy preparing for the concert  
and writing my new song,  
I finally got a day off today.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Hey, how about the two of us go somewhere to celebrate?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh? Why just the two of us...? Well...  
You know, we worked together before the concert too, right?  
So, it'll be a sort of reward for both of us!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Well,  
let's go!  
There's a great place to eat nearby. Let's have lunch!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
This place is one of my favorites.  
I'm sure you'll like it as well—  
  
**Male Fan：**  
Huh? Nozomin?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh shoot!  
Looks like a group of fans!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Quick, let's go!  
I don't want to stir up trouble for the owner!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
*huff, huff*  It looks like we shook them off.  
Sorry I made you run like that.  
Right, let's have lunch somewhere else.  
  
**Child Fan：**  
Ooh, it's Nozomin!  
She's so pretty!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
More fans here, too?  
Sorry, it's my day off today!  
  
**Old Man Fan：**  
Hohoh... Why if it isn't Nozomin...  
You're the spitting image of my late wife...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
H-here, too?  
{player}, let's run!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
We're outside the city...  
But at least here there won't be any—  
  
**Little Ruffian：**  
Wh-hoa! I-if it ain't Nozomin!  
I'm a huge fan!  
  
**Royal Knight：**  
As am I! I will arrest you two later!  
Nozomin, can I get your autograph?  
  
**Big Ruffian：**  
Yup, call off the fight for now!  
Nozomin, shake my hand!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Th-they're even out here!  
Just today... Please, just for today, leave me alone!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
*sigh* It's finally just the two of us.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
It's already evening...  
*sigh* There goes my day off.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Sorry.  
I've also wasted your day off again...  
Come to think of it, this reminds me of when we first met.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  You have even more fans now than back then.  
**Choice: (2)**  You've gained more female fans as well.  
`Tag 1`  
**Nozomi：**  
True.  
Until recently, we could still go on a date...  
I-I mean, a practice date.

`Tag 2`  
**Nozomi：**  
Yeah. Women, kids, and even that grandpa...  
I'm really lucky to have so many people rooting for me.  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Nozomi：**  
But my goal is to become a top idol.  
I'm still not there yet,  
so I've got to work even harder at it.  
  

---  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Well, let's have our celebration here!  
We don't have any food or drinks...  
But come sit with me!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
If we don't head back soon, it'll get late?  
T-true, but...  
We still haven't celebrated yet...  
  
**Choice: (4)**  I had fun.  
**Choice: (5)**  We can do it next time.  
`Tag 4`  
**Nozomi：**  
Y-you did? I feel better hearing that.

`Tag 5`  
**Nozomi：**  
Yeah. You're right.  
  
`Tag 6`  
**Nozomi：**  
Things didn't work out today, but next time...  
Or is that  
wishful thinking? I'm happy to have so many fans, but it  
also means not having any privacy...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
*sigh* If I can't hang out with you...  
Maybe I should just quit being an idol...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I-I'm joking, of course! It's a joke...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...Hey, {player}?  
Do you want me to keep being an idol?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You know... If you were the one  
who told me to quit, I just might.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Heheh.  
But you would never tell me to quit.  
You've always been there, rooting for me.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Being an idol can be really tough.  
There are plenty of unpleasant things about it,  
and you lose all sense of privacy...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Still, I can keep going because I met you.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Because even after you found out I was an idol,  
you didn't treat me any differently.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
In front of you and only you,  
I can just be... a normal girl.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
That's why I'm able to give my all as an idol.  
The time I spend with you, just like this,  
gives me all the strength I need.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You know...  
There was something I wanted to tell you today.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
{player}, I...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...I want to thank you, for everything.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I really do trust you.  
So, until I become a top idol, you'll be there for me, won't you?  
Ahahah! I'm counting on you!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
And that's everything I wanted to say!  
Let's head home!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
If I told you my true feelings,  
I couldn't go on being an idol...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
That would defeat everything you've done to support me...  
So, I'll keep these words buried inside my heart...
