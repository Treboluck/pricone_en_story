**Narration：**  
Invited by Nozomi to meet up,  
{player} arrives at the meeting place.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
{player}, sorry for the wait!  
You got here early. Did you wait long?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...Also, what's with the smug look?  
Did something happen?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
What? Ever since we last met, you've been studying up on idols?  
And now you know all about what we do?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Then you must've learned all sorts of things about me!  
Ahaha! Makes me kinda happy. Thanks!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You know more than any of my other fans?  
 Isn't that a bit of a stretch?  
Sounds like you're real confident about it.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Well then, try guessing what I'm doing next.  
If you know more than anyone, it should be easy, right?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
So you *don't* know!  
The answer is... acting!  
I'm gonna act in a stage play.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
And, well... about the play,  
there's something I need your help with.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I don't have much experience acting,  
and I'm not all that confident.  
So, could you help me rehearse?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You will?  
Yay, thank you!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
First, let's read through the script.  
Here, {player}, this is your copy.  
I only just got these, so I haven't got a clue what's inside.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
The play we're doing is \"Little Red Riding Hood.\"  
It's a famous fairy tale, so you know it too, right?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
What?! You've never heard of it?  
I see...  
Well, since we have the scripts, we should be fine.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I'm playing the lead role of Little Red Riding Hood.  
You'll be playing the Big Bad Wolf.  
All right, let's give this a try.  
  
**Narration：**  
A few minutes later—  
  
**Nozomi：**  
{player}, for someone who's never done this before,  
you're surprisingly good.  
Right then, here comes the climax of the play.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
My, what big ears you have!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  The better to hear you with, my dear.  
`Tag 1`  
**Nozomi：**  
My, what big eyes you have!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  The better to see you with, my dear.  
`Tag 2`  
**Nozomi：**  
My, what a big mouth you have!  
  
**Choice: (3)**  The better to kiss you with, my dear.  
`Tag 3`  
**Nozomi：**  
Oh, Mr. Wolf, I feel the same for you...  
Wait, whaaat?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
When did \"Red Riding Hood\" become a seamy love story?  
There's something off about this script.  
It felt weird the whole time we were reading it!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
\"The wolf rescues the lost Red Riding Hood. She nurses him  
back to health after he's accidentally shot by a huntsman...\"  
This isn't \"Little Red Riding Hood\"!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Then what happens...?  
\"As their friendship blossoms into love, Red Riding Hood's kiss  
lifts the curse from the wolf, who regains his human form...\"  
  
**Nozomi：**  
K-kiss!?  
This play has a kiss scene?!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Th-that means...  
if we keep rehearsing, {player} and I will...!  
But, th-that's... well...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wait, hold on.  
Won't a different actor be playing the wolf on stage?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
So, that means I'll have to kiss my co-star?  
Nuh-uh! Absolutely not!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
...Huh? What?  
Wh-why does this script have someone else's name on it?  
Wait, that means...  
this isn't even mine!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I must've taken someone else's script by accident.  
What a relief.  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Sorry, {player}.  
These aren't the right scripts—  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Huh...?  
U-um, why are you taking notes?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
You're keeping up with your idol research...?  
So... What did you just write down?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Let's see.  
\"Idols kiss on stage when acting\"?  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Of course we don't!  
Stop scribbling down weird notes!  
  
**Nozomi：**  
I'm not allowed to take on roles like this!  
You don't need to worry—  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Wait, why would I tell you not to worry?!  
It's not like you and I are in that kind of relationship—  
  
**Nozomi：**  
But, um... well...  
not that I wouldn't mind that...  
  
**Nozomi：**  
Ahhh! Why can't I keep my mouth shut?!  
Ohhh... Calm down, Nozomi.  
  
**Narration：**  
Nozomi tried to pull herself together,  
but she couldn't get the kiss scene out of her head.
