The Head of Academic Affairs from Chloe's school visits the restaurant where she's working. Certain that she'll be expelled if her part-time work is uncovered, Chloe begins to panic, but {player} and her classmates save her in the nick of time.
  
## Subtitle: Chloe's Part-Time Pursuits: The Restaurant
  
**Narration：**  
Ever the hardworking part-timer,  
Chloe could never be satisfied with just her job at the clothing store,  
so she's started waitressing after school on weekdays as well.  
  
**Chloe：**  
And with that course, you've got the whole shebang.  
Enjoy your meal.  
  
**Customer 1：**  
My, my, what a feast!  
Will we be able to finish it all, I wonder? Ohoho!  
  
**Chloe：**  
There, that's it for now.  
We don't get many customers at this hour,  
so I'm basically gonna be free till evening.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Wheeeew...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, actually...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Guess I haven't seen Lost Boy today...  
Wonder what he's up to.  
  
**Chloe：**  
I mean... whatever. Not like I care...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ah.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Whoa, whoa.  
Where you off to, {player}?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hi there.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chloe：**  
Don't you \"Hi there\" me.  
What's a lost guy like you doing strolling straight by our entrance?  
  
**Chloe：**  
If you're lost, act like it,  
and come inside to ask directions, why don'tcha.  
  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm not actually lost today.  
`Tag 2`  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, really.  
That's actually a new one.  
So you don't just spend every day wandering the streets in a haze.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh...  
Wait, so what, you're not dropping by?  
I'm working at this restaurant today, you know.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  You want me to come in?  
`Tag 3`  
**Chloe：**  
Uh. I mean... If you don't want to, that's fine.  
  
**Chloe：**  
It's fine, but...  
If you do come in, I'll treat you to something.  
We're not exactly busy, see.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  It looks like there's lots of people inside.  
`Tag 4`  
**Chloe：**  
Eh?  
Oh... Well...  
 It might look like that,  
but each group's just one order, see?  
  
**Chloe：**  
To be honest,  
this place mainly serves full-course meals.  
So most of the customers come in big groups.  
  
**Chloe：**  
By the way, the flavor's top-notch. Whaddaya say.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I guess I'll drop in, then.  
`Tag 5`  
**Chloe：**  
Mm. You do that.  
  
**Customer 1：**  
Oh, excuse me!  
Can we get an additional order?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Sure, on my way.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Sorry, {player}, looks like I've got work.  
You go ahead and sit wherever.  
  
**Customer 2：**  
Please come in, my dear teachers!  
You simply must try the seafood hotpot here!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeesh, another new group.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Come on in.  
Lemme show you to a tabl—  
 Guehhh!  
  
**Teacher：**  
Oh? Aren't you one of our...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Crap... The Head of Academic Affairs?!  
  
**Teacher：**  
Wait one moment. Are you not Miss Chloe?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uerghhh... No way. This is literally the worst.  
  
**Customer 2：**  
Is something wrong, Mother Hilda?  
  
**Teacher：**  
You can all go on ahead.  
I need to have a word with this young lady.  
  
**Chloe：**  
What now...?  
If she finds out I'm breaking school rules,  
there's no coming back from that.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ugh, can't get expelled... Gotta find some kind of excuse...  
  
**Teacher：**  
Young miss, could you be...  
 working at this establishment?  
  
**Chloe：**  
'C-course not.  
 I'm just a customer.  
  
**Teacher：**  
You say that, but were you not about to show us to a table?  
  
**Chloe：**  
W-well, yeah, I was, but...  
That's 'cause, uh...  
 I was kinda, y'know...  
volunteering myself?  
 Like, just randomly helping out.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Helping out?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeah. I came here just as an ordinary customer,  
but I noticed they were kinda short on staff.  
Couldn't bear to watch,  
 and I'm used to this stuff, so...  
  
**Teacher：**  
\"Used to\" what?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ahhhhh, not like that! I don't mean waitressing!  
Just like, cooking and setting tables?  
Y'know, I always help with the housework at home.  
  
**Teacher：**  
You do housework regularly?  
That's a difficult notion to believe.  
  
**Chloe：**  
No, that part's just straight-up true.  
  
**Customer 1：**  
Excuse me!  
Waitress, is my order not ready yet?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Sorry, be right with ya!  
Ummm... Teach?  
  
**Teacher：**  
Very well. If this is volunteer work,  
neither I nor the academy have reason to stop you.  
  
**Chloe：**  
For real?  
Then I can carry on?  
  
**Teacher：**  
In fact, it is most commendable.  
Despite being no more than an ordinary customer like ourselves, you...  
  
**Teacher：**  
...Hmm?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Wh-what now?  
  
**Teacher：**  
Miss Chloe.  
You claimed to be a customer, yes?  
Then who did you come here with?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh? Wh-why would you...  
  
**Teacher：**  
It seems to me  
that this restaurant caters largely to groups  
rather than lone customers.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, come on! What is this lady, a master detective?  
  
**Teacher：**  
If you do not have any friends here,  
I find it rather difficult to clear my suspicions.  
I may have to ask some questions of the restaurant's proprietor.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, this is bad. This is really, really bad.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Nothing for it...  
Hate to put him on the spot,  
but I guess I'll turn to {player}...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, no, of course I'm not on my own.  
I came with a friend. Lessee, where'd he go...  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Huh?  
  
**Chloe：**  
No way... He just walked out the door...  
 B-but why...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well... Dumb question. Yeah, figures.  
Who'd actually choose to get themselves mixed up  
in someone else's ugly mess...?  
  
**Chloe：**  
I was an idiot to assume he'd just come to my rescue here.  
Remember, Chloe. The world's not that kind a place.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Miss Chloe...?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Whew... Checkmate. I'm done for.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Is something wrong?  
Do you not have any friends here after all?  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Nope.  
Not a soul.  
  
**Chloe：**  
I'm sorry, Mom...  
You got me into a good school, and I just...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Teach... sorry.  
Truth is, I'm actually...  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Oh, Chloe!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh? Wait, you guys are...  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Well, dear me, Chloe! How early you are!  
We're terribly sorry to keep you waiting!  
  
**Teacher：**  
Why, you're... students from our academy!  
Visiting a restaurant while still in your uniforms?  
Where are your manners?  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Good day, Mother Hilda.  
We were planning to hold a social gathering over supper.  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Well, everyone, shall we begin the party?  
You too, Chloe! No need for the blank stares!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh?  
Uh, but I... I was kinda busy with...  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Please don't be like that.  
There's no time to waste!  
Mother, may we borrow Miss Chloe?  
  
**Teacher：**  
...As you wish.  
I suppose I will trust in your bonds of friendship for now.  
  
**Teacher：**  
Miss Chloe, keep up the admirable volunteer work.  
Well then, good day.  
  
**Chloe：**  
And she's gone... What the heck.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uhhh...?  
I dunno if I really get what just happened...  
  
**Chloe：**  
But I gotta say you saved my hide.  
Thanks, you guys.  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Heavens!  
Surely you will find it is we who should be thanking you!  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Chloe...  
We owe you our eternal gratitude  
for saving our lives the other day.  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
At the time, we were too shocked to say anything... I'm so sorry.  
  

---  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ohhh, you mean that time...  
  

---  
  
**Chloe：**  
I mean, that wasn't really...  
I just happened to be passing by, so you don't gotta...  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Ahh, so cool...!  
You are as humble as you are mighty...  
No less from the great Chloe!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh?  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Y-you see, the truth is!  
We have both secretly admired you from afar  
ever since we first laid eyes on you!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Wha...? Come again?  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
We have always lived our lives  
in a sealed-off world, following the instructions of our elders...  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
But delinquents like yourself,  
wild and unfettered, true to your own ineffable principles...  
You shine like the sun in our eyes!  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
To exchange words with a delinquent  
required more courage than we were able to muster,  
but we have always longed to become friends with you someday!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Friends...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh...  
 Haha.  
Really. That's what this is about.  
Uh, it's not like I'd... mind that, or anything...  
  
**Chloe：**  
I don't mind, but I gotta say. I'm not a delinquent.  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
S-so it is true!  
They say a true delinquent  
never deigns to acknowledge her own status!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, you've got it wrong.  
I'm a law-abiding citizen.  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
How unspeakably cool...  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Such an inspiration...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uhh...? Are these girls hearing a word I say?  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Ahhh... We so longed to prove  
that we could rebel against social norms like you, Chloe,  
that we ventured into a region with an active monster warning...  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
But we were too weak to pull it off dashingly like you do...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Whoa, hold up. Are you telling me  
it's actually my fault you were in that forest?  
The hell. This is low-key blowing my mind right now.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Listen. Can you like, not do that stuff?  
Your families are gonna hate my guts.  
You can't just shirk safety regulations.  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Oh!  
That reminds me.  
 Putting that topic aside...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Don't put safety aside.  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
We were hoping to give some proper thanks  
to that nice flunky of yours as well, but...  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
What a shame! He seems to have left already.  
I'm quite sure he was watching from the window until just now...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Flunky? Wait, who?  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
You know—  
the young man who aided you  
when you saved our lives that day in the forest.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ohhh, {player}.  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Yes.  
It was he who noticed us passing by this restaurant  
and urgently called out to us.  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Begging that we come to your aid at once.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh...? For real?  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
Yes, for real.  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Yes, for serious.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh... 'S that right...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Huh... He did that, did he.  
That's why he was rushing out the door...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Oh, right...  
Guess I did kinda mention to him  
about my school situation that one time...  
  
**Chloe：**  
That's why he figured these girls  
would be a better choice to help me outta this mess...  
  
**Chloe：**  
Well, dang.  
He really is a good guy after all.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Heck, he's just plain cool.  
At least stick around and let me thank you, dammit.  
  
**Narration：**  
Though the words she muttered were tinged with venom,  
Chloe's heart was filled with the sweetest of sensations.  
  
**Chloe：**  
By the way, he's seriously not my flunky.  
And I'm not a delinquent, got that?  
  
**Female Student 1：**  
S-so cool...  
  
**Female Student 2：**  
Delinquents really are the coolest...
