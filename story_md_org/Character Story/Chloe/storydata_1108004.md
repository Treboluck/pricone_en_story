## Subtitle: Chloe's Part-Time Pursuits: Interlude
  
**Narration：**  
After school one day,  
Chloe visits the noticeboard in the city plaza  
in search of some honest part-time work.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ueergh, talk about lousy pay.  
  
**Chloe：**  
...But no, I guess this is normal.  
I've gotten so used to crazy rewards, my standards are way off.  
Ugh, lame. Gotta be more careful.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Besides, the cash should be the least of my worries.  
Part-timing's still against school rules,  
so I can't work anywhere that'd ask too many questions.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Same goes for location.  
If it's close to the school, teachers might see me.  
But if it's too far away, how'll I get there after school...?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ugh, kill me.  
I'm never gonna make this work, am I?  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Hi there.  
`Tag 1`  
**Chloe：**  
Eeeek!  
  
**Chloe：**  
Eh?  
Oh, it's just you, {player}.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Seriously though, dude.  
What did I tell you about sneaking up behind me.  
God, that squeal. What am I, a little princess?  
  
**Choice: (2)**  What job are you working today?  
`Tag 2`  
**Chloe：**  
Not working any job—yet. I'm trying to find one.  
  
**Choice: (3)**  More shady work?  
`Tag 3`  
**Chloe：**  
Nuh-uh. Nothing like that.  
  
**Chloe：**  
More like, I dunno, retail or whatever?  
It'd be nice if I could find a job that matches,  
like, my interests and stuff. I'm pretty into fashion.  
  
**Chloe：**  
And technically, I do have experience serving customers.  
Smiles and politeness might not be my strong points,  
but just talking to people, like, I don't hate it, see?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Although, uh...  
I guess that might not be the impression other people get.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Like, when I'm at school and stuff,  
I feel like most people kinda keep me at arm's length.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Almost like they're scared of me or whatever?  
Like, how rude is that?  
Imagine being scared of a squealing little princess.  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Eh?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Uh, hold up, {player}.  
I'm trying to hold a serious conversation here.  
Why're you getting all shiny and stuff? This some kinda joke?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Really though, what *is* this light.  
Now it's shining all over me, too.  
 Ew, gross...

**Hanako：**  
Sorry, looks like I'm late.  
  
**Cafe Owner：**  
Oh, Hanako!  
You're usually so punctual. Something happen at school?  
  
**Hanako：**  
Uh, kinda... Just some boring, uh, council stuff...  
I'm real sorry.  
Gimme two secs to change and I'll get to waiting tables.  
  
**Cafe Owner：**  
Oh, hold on!  
That group sitting at Table 2,  
aren't they students from the same school as you?  
  
**Hanako：**  
Huh?  
Ohh... Yeah, guess they are.  
I mean, they're actually in my class.  
  
**Cafe Owner：**  
We're kind of busy here, so I didn't manage to take their order yet.  
Before you get changed, could you take care of that for me?  
  
**Hanako：**  
Huh? Who, me?  
  
**Hanako：**  
Uhh. Well. I guess I could...  
  
**Hanako：**  
Yeeeeesh.  
  
**Hanako：**  
'Sup, guys. Hit me with your order.  
  
**Female Student：**  
Oh, thank you!  
We'll have two black coffees to—  
  
**Female Student：**  
Huh?! Miss Kuroe?! What are you, ah, doing here?  
  
**Hanako：**  
Why so formal?  
I just work here, see. Waitressing part-time.  
  
**Hanako：**  
Oh, uh, could you not mention it at school, though.  
I kinda didn't bother with the parental permission form stuff.  
  
**Female Student：**  
Oh, of course!  
We're perfectly capable of keeping secrets, are we not?!  
  
**Hanako：**  
No, really, why so formal. Yeesh.  
  
**Female Student：**  
Ahaha...  
  
**Hanako：**  
Haha...  
  
**Hanako：**  
Uh, so... Sorry, I'm on the clock, so yeah.  
Two coffees, right? Comin' right up.  
  
**Hanako：**  
Pff... Hanging at a cafe after school, huh?  
  
**Hanako：**  
Sounds like fun. Not that I'd know.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Hi there.  
`Tag 4`  
**Hanako：**  
Eeeek!  
  
**Hanako：**  
Wha... You scared me. Wait, who even are you.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  I'm {player}, your short-term colleague.  
`Tag 5`  
**Hanako：**  
Eh?  
Ohhh, right.  
The manager did say she'd hired some help just for this week.  
  
**Hanako：**  
Well, uh, I'm Hanako Kuroe, in charge of the tables.  
If you've got any questions, you can always read the manual. Good luck.  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Nice weather we're having today.  
**Choice: (7)**  This seems like a nice cafe.  
`Tag 6`  
**Hanako：**  
Eh? What's all this?  
  
**Hanako：**  
I mean, not to be an ass,  
but have you *seen* today's weather.  
It's gloomy clouds far as the eye can see.  
  
Jump to tag 8  
`Tag 7`  
**Hanako：**  
Uhh. Well, sure. No doubt.  
  
**Hanako：**  
...  
  
**Hanako：**  
...So?  
  
`Tag 8`  
**Hanako：**  
Like, what gives?  
Why the second-cousins-at-a-family-reunion conversation starter?  
This how you talk to everyone you just met?  
  
**Choice: (9)**  What's your favorite food?  
**Choice: (10)**  What's your favorite drink?  
`Tag 9`  
**Hanako：**  
Fried bread crusts.  
  
Jump to tag 11  
`Tag 10`  
**Hanako：**  
Soba broth.  
  
`Tag 11`  
**Hanako：**  
But like, who cares?  
Is this some awkward Q&A? What's your game here?  
Going for a world record in boring the socks off a random stranger?  
  
**Hanako：**  
Honestly, you're kinda scaring me.  
I don't need random interrogations from some guy I don't know.  
  
**Choice: (12)**  I just thought we could be friends.  
`Tag 12`  
**Hanako：**  
Eh?  
  
**Hanako：**  
Ohhh...  
So what, then... Is it like that?  
You overheard me talking to those girls just now?  
  
**Hanako：**  
Huh... All right, that figures.  
You're taking pity on me, huh?  
  
**Hanako：**  
...Uh, wait.  
So what, was I really giving off that many  
awkward-loner vibes just now? Oh, god.  
  
**Hanako：**  
Look, I'm not...  
I mean, I've got friends back home.  
And it's not like those girls hate me or whatever. I'm fine.  
  
**Hanako：**  
But, uh. Thanks, I guess.  
  
**Hanako：**  
You seem like a good guy.  
Even if you suck at small talk.

**Ameth：**  
Aaaand welcome back.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Everything you just saw was basically a dream.  
You'll forget it when you wake up,  
so don't worry about it too much right now.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Still, I have to say...  
Chloe's got a pretty thorny attitude in both worlds, hasn't she?  
  
**Ameth：**  
Call it socially awkward, or call it affected...  
She's like a stray cat who never quite lets her guard down.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, that's the way she is, so she might be a tricky case.  
But you've always been the accepting type,  
so I'm sure you can find a way to make it work, right?  
  
**Ameth：**  
There's no denying she's a tough, reliable girl at heart,  
but I can't help worrying about her sometimes, too.  
I hope you'll keep a friendly eye on her.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Well, that's all from me.  
I'll see you later!  
  

---  
  
**Chloe：**  
Mmnhh...  
  
**Chloe：**  
...H-huh?  
What the... Oh crap. How'd I wind up zonking out?  
  
**Chloe：**  
Yeesh, you too, {player}?  
C'mon, wake up now. You'll catch a cold.  
  
**Chloe：**  
Ugh, how'd this happen.  
Snoozing out in public...  
Have I been wearing myself out more than I realized?  
  
**Chloe：**  
I guess between school and work lately,  
I haven't been getting a whole lot of sleep...  
  
**Choice: (13)**  Glad you managed to get a little rest here, then.  
`Tag 13`  
**Chloe：**  
Huh? Is that the issue here?  
  
**Chloe：**  
As cities go, this one's well on the safe side, but even so,  
you can't go encouraging girls to take catnaps in public, right?  
Just how trusting are you?  
  
**Chloe：**  
...Well, guess it's no biggie.  
  
**Chloe：**  
You really are a pretty stand-up guy.  
Even if you've got no conversation skills.  
  
**Narration：**  
Without even realizing it, Chloe found herself  
giving {player} a warm and gentle smile.
