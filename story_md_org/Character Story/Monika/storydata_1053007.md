## Subtitle: Closed Eyes On Me
  
**Narration：**  
{player} and Monika have made plans to eat together.  
  
**Monika：**  
Where is he?  
I asked him to get us a table,  
but it's a little hard to spot him when it's this crowded.  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Come on, don't be shy.  
Just follow us for a good time.  
  
**Monika：**  
Hmm? What's going on here?  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Aww, you're so cute.  
Don't worry, though. We won't bite. Maybe.  
  
**Monika：**  
What's with them?  
Trying to hit on someone here doesn't seem ve—  
  
**Monika：**  
Wait, that's {player} they're aiming for!  
  
**Monika：**  
Your salacious misdeeds end here, I'm afraid!  
By which I mean, I have prior arrangements with him already.  
I'd rather you not drag him off on some misadventure.  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Uhh... What's with this kid?  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Skedaddle off home, brat.  
Let the adults have some fun.  
  
**Monika：**  
Brat?!  
How dare you?!  
  
**Monika：**  
Ignore them, {player}!  
They're just silly, overgrown.  
No need to pay them any attention!  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Oh?  
Might want to explain yourself  
before we take that the wrong way.  
  
**Woman 2：**  
You might think we'll let you off because you're a kid,  
but I'm afraid not. No one gets away with slandering us.  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Then again. I guess it makes sense that  
a snot-nosed brat wouldn't understand our appeal.  
  
**Monika：**  
I've told you once already. Stop treating me like a child!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
I mean. Just look at you.  
You're the definition of one.  
  
**Monika：**  
U-urgh...  
I'm much more of an adult than either of you!  
I'm... I'm even in a r-  
relationship with {player} here!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Since when?!  
`Tag 1`  
**Monika：**  
Shh!  
You stay quiet!  
  
**Woman 2：**  
Are you now?  
Sorry,  
but I find that hard to believe.  
  
**Monika：**  
W-well you'll just have to!  
{player} and I are the greatest lovers of all time!  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Lovely.  
How about you prove that with a kiss, then?  
  
**Monika：**  
A-a kiss?!  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Yup.  
A nice, big smooch. Easy, right?  
  
**Woman 1：**  
Come on. Chop chop.  
Give him it to him right on the lips.  
  
**Monika：**  
U-urgh... This is bad.  
I can't k-kiss him.  
It's too embarrassing!  
  
**Monika：**  
I don't have much of a choice, though.  
My honor is at stake here!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Let the smooching commence.  
**Choice: (3)**  You should probably apologize.  
`Tag 2`  
**Monika：**  
Don't commence anything!  
Why are you so okay with it?!  
B-but I can't back down, either...  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Monika：**  
N-not in a million years!  
Sorry, but I'm afraid you're going to have to deal with this.  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Monika：**  
I have my pride as a soldier. I can't let them trample on that!  
  
We have to... We must k-  
kiss. At all costs!  
  
**Monika：**  
Close your eyes, {player}.  
And keep them closed. Understood?  
  
**Monika：**  
C-calm down, me.  
I'm not doing this because I want to.  
This is just a mission. A mission to protect my honor!  
  
**Male Customer 1：**  
Hmm? What's the deal here?  
Is something going down?  
  
**Male Customer 2：**  
Looks like that couple over there's  
gonna lay a big fat kiss on each other.  
  
**Male Customer 1：**  
Whoa, nice!  
Get in there!  
  
**Monika：**  
W-what the?!  
Why do we have an audience all of a sudden?!  
  
**Onlookers：**  
Give the people what they want!  
Kiss! Kiss!  
  
**Monika：**  
Ahhh... Urgh...  
  
**Monika：**  
Waaaaahhhhh!  
Get your eyes off us!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus {player} was knocked  
right out of the stratosphere.
