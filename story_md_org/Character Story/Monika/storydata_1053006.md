**Narration：**  
{player} and Monika are about to begin their daily drills,  
when suddenly—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH!  
  
**Monika：**  
Monsters?!  
How did they get into town?!  
  
**Monika：**  
It's not just one or two, either.  
We need to take care of them, qui—  
  
**Child：**  
Waaahhh!  
Mommy! Daddy!  
  
**Father：**  
Wait!  
Give them back!  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH!  
  
**Monika：**  
They're kidnapping children?!  
But why...?  
  
**Monika：**  
Urgh. I can't believe I let this happen.  
What good is a soldier if they can't protect anyone?!  
I need to act quick!  
  
**Monika：**  
Hold on just a little longer.  
I'll be there to save you soon...!  
  
**Monika：**  
{player}?!  
Why are you here?  
  
**Monika：**  
Ahh...  
You knew what I was thinking, didn't you?  
  
**Monika：**  
And you'd be right.  
If anyone can save those children,  
it's me.  
  
**Monika：**  
I'm well aware of the danger.  
My friends are among those kidnapped, though.  
I can't just sit around and twiddle my thumbs!  
  
**Monika：**  
Rescue requests have already gone out to various guilds?  
Yes, I'm aware of that as well.  
  
**Monika：**  
You saw how many monsters we're dealing with, though.  
There's no guarantee every guild would be willing to tackle that.  
  
**Monika：**  
And then there's the issue that comes with multiple guilds  
working together in the first place. We don't have time to wait for  
their negotiations.  
Not when the children are in danger!  
  
**Monika：**  
There's no stopping me. I'm going in, no matter what.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Then we'll join you.  
**Choice: (2)**  We should regroup in town first.  
`Tag 1`  
**Monika：**  
N-no you absolutely won't!  
I appreciate the sentiment,  
but this is far too dangerous for you!  
  
**Monika：**  
Wait. You just said \"we,\"  
didn't you?  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Monika：**  
I told you. Don't try and stop me!  
I'll do this alo—  
  
**Monika：**  
Wait.  
\"Regroup\" in town?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Monika：**  
You have a plan, don't you?  
Then let me hear it.  
  
**Resident 1：**  
What's the deal here?  
We've got way more important things  
to worry about than whatever this is.  
  
**Resident 2：**  
Hey. Looks like that girl's gonna give a speech or something.  
  
**Monika：**  
Hear me out, everyone!  
I plan on carrying out a rescue mission right after this!  
But I need your help as well!  
  
**Monika：**  
Guilds would certainly be reliable allies here,  
but there's no telling when they'll act.  
We don't have the luxury of waiting!  
  
**Monika：**  
If we band together, though, I'm sure we'll succeed!  
So let's go save the children!  
  
**Resident 2：**  
Sh-  
she's got a point.  
Yeah! Let's do it!  
  
**Resident 1：**  
Hell yeah! I'm in!  
If anyone's gonna save our kids, it's us!  
  
**Monika：**  
Thank you, everyone!  
  
The time to march has come!  
Follow my lead!  
  
**Residents：**  
Woooooooo!  
  
**Resident 1：**  
Hey! Over here!  
I found the kids!  
  
**Father：**  
Are you okay?!  
Dont worry.  
We'll take those monsters down and get you out of here!  
  
**Child：**  
Daddy, wait! You gotta hear this!  
  
**Narration：**  
Behind the children is a large, gaping hole.  
The rescue party hears a weak cry coming from within.  
  
**Narration：**  
Peeking over the edge, they realize said cry belongs to  
a baby monster that had fallen into the hole. Unsurprisingly, they  
feel no hostility coming from it either.  
  
**Resident 1：**  
H-hey. Who's the genius that dug a hole here?  
  
**Resident 2：**  
I, uh, was gonna use it to get rid of materials we don't need anymore...  
Anyway. Let's get that thing out of there!  
  
**Narration：**  
Monika works together with the townsfolk to pull the baby out of the hole.  
Satisfied with this, the rest of the monsters disappear into the night.  
  
**Resident 1：**  
Is... is it over?  
  
**Monika：**  
It should be...  
We assumed those monsters came to wreak havoc,  
but I'm sure they just wanted to tell us about this.  
  
**Father：**  
Either way. I'm glad everything worked out!  
And it's all thanks to you rallying us together!  
  
**Monika：**  
Th-that's not true. I only made a suggestion...  
  
**Children：**  
You heard us out and saved that monster, too!  
Thanks a lot!  
  
**Monika：**  
Y-you're welcome.  
I have to admit, getting praised this much is rather embarrassing.  
  
**Monika：**  
I owe you some thanks too, {player}.  
  
**Monika：**  
This wouldn't have gone so smoothly if it wasn't for you.  
I was ready to rush right in without a second thought,  
but then you suggested banding together with the townsfolk.  
  
**Monika：**  
You were a tremendous help, as usual.  
Thank you.  
  
**Monika：**  
I wouldn't mind if you were always by my side,  
helping me along the way.  
In fact, it would make me very happy.  
  
**Narration：**  
Seeing Monika's gentle smile, {player} couldn't help but respond in kind.
