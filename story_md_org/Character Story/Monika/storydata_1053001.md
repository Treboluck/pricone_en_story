# Monika Episode 1
{player}, mistaking Monika for a child, tries to stop her from going out of town on her own. She refutes his accusation before being attacked by a monster, which she fights off alongside him.
  
## Subtitle: A Tiny, Tiny, Dignified Commander
  
**Narration：**  
{player} is on one of his usual walks when he  
notices a girl nearby who seems troubled.  
  
**???：**  
Hmm...  
Making the guild itself was a simple task, but everything afterwards  
has proven to be troublesome. Monster slaying in particular.  
  
**???：**  
Alas, though. The fault falls on me as commander.  
There wouldn't be any issue were my instructions more precise.  
  
**???：**  
And with that said, it's time to address that issue!  
The stronger I get, the more I can pull up the rest of the guild as well.  
  
**???：**  
I'd hate to train in such a crowded place, though.  
Perhaps it's best if I go a little bit out of town.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Stop her.  
`Tag 1`  
**???：**  
Hmm? And who might you be?  
What business do you have with me?  
  
**???：**  
It's dangerous out of town?  
Of course I'm aware.  
Why else would I be leaving, if not for that?  
  
**???：**  
Children shouldn't leave town on their own...  
Children?  
  
**???：**  
I-I'm no child!  
  
**Monika：**  
My name is Monika Weisswind!  
I'm a noble soldier belonging to the esteemed guild, Weissflügel!  
  
**Choice: (2)**  Playing military's always fun.  
**Choice: (3)**  Ah, yes. A soldier.  
`Tag 2`  
**Monika：**  
I'm not playing anything!  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Monika：**  
Don't sound so sarcastic!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Monika：**  
You don't believe me, do you?  
But I assure you, it's no lie!  
  
**Monika：**  
Hmm? Where are my parents? Where do I live?  
Those are dangerous questions to ask.  
  
**Monika：**  
You want to help get me home?  
Don't make me repeat myself. I'm no child!  
  
**Monika：**  
Grr...  
You seem awfully intent on making me angry, don't you?  
  
**Monika：**  
But that ends here!  
My training's more important than dealing with you. So don't try and stop me!  
  
**Choice: (5)**  Follow her.  
`Tag 5`  
**Monika：**  
Hmm...  
This seems ideal. A nice, open area with no one else around.  
  
**Monika：**  
...Except for you.  
Why did you follow me?  
We're not that far out of town.  
Monsters won't be appearing anytime soo—  
  
**Monster：**  
GRRRAAAAAGGGHHHH!  
  
**Monika：**  
S-speak of the devil!  
Looks like my assumption was off.  
  
**Monika：**  
Run, you say?  
Feel free. I'll be staying here.  
  
**Monika：**  
I'm a proud soldier.  
And a soldier never runs, not even in the face of monsters.  
I'll slay this beast myself.  
  
**Monika：**  
You look awfully exasperated.  
And what's this about \"not having a choice?\"  
  
**Choice: (6)**  Power Monika up.  
`Tag 6`  
**Monika：**  
Hmm?!  
What's going on here?!  
I feel power like I never have before!  
  
**Monika：**  
No mere monster can stand in my way now!  
Take this!  
  
**Monster：**  
Rrrrghhhhh!  
  
**Monika：**  
Heh. Now you've witnessed my strength firsthand.  
Impressive, isn't it?  
  
**Monika：**  
Hah! I knew you'd agree!  
Now you have no doubt that I'm a soldi—  
  
**Monika：**  
What's that? You don't know many children as strong as me?  
H-how many times must I say it? I'm no child!  
  
**Monika：**  
W-wait a minute! Let go of my hand!  
Who gave you permission to touch me?!  
  
**Monika：**  
Excuse me?  
It's still dangerous here, so you want to escort me home?  
  
**Monika：**  
U-urgh...  
One last time. I. Am. Not. A. Child!  
  
**Monika：**  
Is this a sick hobby of yours, perhaps?  
Because I'm considerably upset right now!  
  
**Choice: (7)**  Sorry. Here, have this.  
`Tag 7`  
**Monika：**  
Hmph. You won't be able to win me over with—  
  
**Monika：**  
Is this... candy?  
W-well. If you insist on giving it to me,  
then it would be rude not to accept it.  
  
**Monika：**  
*pop*  
Not bad. Not bad at all!  
  
**Monika：**  
Tell me your name.  
{player}, is it?  
  
**Monika：**  
Very well.  
Your actions from earlier have been pardoned.  
  
**Monika：**  
As for training, I'd say today's been bountiful enough.  
Let's make our way back, {player}!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus one single candy was all it took to get on Monika's good side.
