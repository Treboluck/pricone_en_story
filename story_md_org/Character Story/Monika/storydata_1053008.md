## Subtitle: Sweet, Sweet Gratitude
  
**Narration：**  
{player} and Monika are on their  
way to do some shopping together.  
  
**Monika：**  
No detours today. Understood?  
We don't have the luxury to be spending frugally.  
  
**Monika：**  
We absolutely don't. And yet...  
And yet! A candy store has shown itself before me!  
  
**Monika：**  
Not that the candy itself interests me, of course!  
It's just, well, quite a coincidence.  
One worth maybe spending a little bit extra on...  
  
**Monika：**  
Whoa?! It's so bright!  
But wait! This has happened before!  
  
**Monika：**  
Waaahhh!

**Monika：**  
Hmm? Oh.  
Hello there.  
Are you out shopping?  
  
**Monika：**  
Me? I'm here on some... personal business.  
  
**Kid：**  
Captain! Check this out!  
  
**Monika：**  
Ohhh! What kind of candy is that?  
It looks delicious.  
  
**Kid：**  
It is! You gotta try it!  
  
**Monika：**  
Well then.  
I'll buy some later, then.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Got yourself some lackeys, have you?  
**Choice: (2)**  Are the kids hanging out with you?  
`Tag 1`  
**Monika：**  
As if!  
They're the ones that started calling me that.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Monika：**  
Why did you phrase it like that?!  
Common sense dictates that it'd be the opposite way about!  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Monika：**  
They're...  
I guess \"friends\" is appropriate at this point.  
They ask me to play with them often,  
and I don't have it in me to say no.  
  
**Monika：**  
Today they wanted to go buy candy,  
so here I am with them.  
  
**Monika：**  
Hmm? I might complain,  
but the fact that I go along with them makes me kind?  
  
**Monika：**  
O-of course!  
That's exactly it! I'm only here because I'm kindhearted.  
Not because of the good company. Certainly not the candy, either.  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Thanks. I mean it.  
`Tag 4`  
**Monika：**  
Wha—?!  
Where did that come from?!  
  
**Monika：**  
You felt it was only right to say since I'm always helping out?  
Please. That's an exaggeration.  
Our motives are often aligned. That's all there is to it.  
  
**Monika：**  
You still want to make it up to me, though?  
Hmm. Then we can call it even with some candy.  
  
**Choice: (5)**  No problem.  
`Tag 5`  
**Monika：**  
Good to hear.  
For starters, you can get me one of each type.  
I've been wanting to try them for a while now.  
  
**Monika：**  
Hmm? Why are you panicking now?  
I don't think I asked much of you.  
  
**Kid：**  
Oh, are you buying stuff?  
Cool! Get me something too!  
  
**Kids：**  
Me too, me too!  
  
**Monika：**  
I can see the tears in your eyes. What's the issue?  
You're crying for your wallet, you say?  
Alas. You're the one that offered, my friend.  
  
**Monika：**  
That said. I owe you one myself, if I'm being honest.  
  
**Monika：**  
You've been just as helpful to me, if not even more.  
S-so yeah. I appreciate it.

**Ameth：**  
So, how'd you like that little present?  
Bet it was a nice little dream for you.  
  
**Ameth：**  
I whipped it up based on your and Monika's old memories.  
Gotta admit, though. She really does look the part when she  
gets that excited over candy and stuff.  
  
**Ameth：**  
Oh well.  
We're all different. That's what makes the world so fun.  
Enough chat for today, though. Catch you later. ♪

**Monika：**  
Looks like you're awake now.  
I just woke up there, myself.  
Seems like we both fell asleep in the middle of the road.  
  
**Monika：**  
I specifically remember this happening before, too.  
You didn't happen to have a candy-related dream, did you?  
  
**Monika：**  
Well then. That's the second time we've shared a dream.  
And it felt just as nostalgic this time, too.  
I assume it was the same for you?  
How odd...  
  
**Monika：**  
Well, there's no sense in mulling over it right now.  
Not until we get some concrete information.  
  
**Monika：**  
I doubt many people share the same dream  
more than once, though.  
Maybe that's proof  
that we're growing much closer...?  
  
**Monika：**  
Wait, what am I thinking?!  
Phew. I dodged a bullet by not saying that out loud.  
I might have died of embarrassment if he'd heard it.  
  
**Monika：**  
A-anyway.  
What I said in that dream was no lie.  
I really am grateful to you.  
  
**Monika：**  
So yeah.  
It'll be a pleasure to share more experiences with you from here on.
