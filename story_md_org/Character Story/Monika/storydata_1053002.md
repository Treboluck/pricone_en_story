# Monika Episode 2
Monika asks {player} to help her train for an upcoming tournament. Knowing she has little range, he proposes employing aerial attacks to make up for it, leading them to go running to build her core strength.

**Narration：**  
{player}, having been called out by Monika,  
makes his way over to meet her.  
  
**Monika：**  
There you are.  
I have a favor to ask of you.  
  
**Monika：**  
You're aware of the tournament in a few weeks, I assume.  
They've been advertising it rather heavily recently.  
  
**Monika：**  
Truth is, I plan on entering as a participant.  
There should be plenty of eyes on it, which makes it  
an ideal venue to advertise the existence of Weissflügel.  
  
**Monika：**  
Tournaments and training come hand in hand.  
Which is why I called you here. To request help with the latter.  
  
**Monika：**  
You won't make for much of a sparring partner,  
but there's no denying that I feel much stronger when with you.  
  
**Monika：**  
You have a surprisingly keen eye, too.  
So if there's anything you can point out, then I'd appreciate it.  
I won't force you to, of course.  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Is there anything in it for me?  
**Choice: (2)**  I'm not sure I'd be much help...  
`Tag 1`  
**Monika：**  
That's a fair point.  
If anything, I'd feel a lot less guilty knowing  
you're getting something out of it as well.  
  
**Monika：**  
How does this sound, then?  
If I come out victorious, then I'll split the reward with you.  
  
Jump to tag 3  
`Tag 2`  
**Monika：**  
Th-that's not true!  
Your input is more than valuable.  
  
**Monika：**  
To be honest, I don't have anyone else I can ask.  
So how about it? Are you in?  
  
`Tag 3`  
**Monika：**  
You are? Fantastic!  
  
**Monika：**  
Now then. Let's not waste any time.  
We'll only get in other people's way here, so let's go somewhere else.  
  
**Monika：**  
Here should be good, I'd say.  
So let's get to i—  
  
**Monika：**  
Hmm? What's that?  
There's something you need to tell me first?  
  
**Monika：**  
About my major defining weakness, you say?!  
Do tell!  
  
**Monika：**  
It'll be obvious if we try fighting?  
Very well. Then let's get started!  
  
**Monika：**  
Hmm? I assumed you would draw your sword,  
so why are you picking up a stick?

**Monika：**  
Whoa! What are you doing?!  
Don't point it at me!  
And definitely don't poke me with it!  
  
**Monika：**  
Wah!  
Stop it! I-I mean it!  
Grr... My sword's too short to reach you!  
  
**Monika：**  
No! Not my sides!  
A-  
are you trying to tickle me to death?!  
  
**Monika：**  
H-How cowardly of you. That stick is far too long—  
Hmm?  
Ohh. Now I see what you meant.  
  
**Monika：**  
My height itself is my weakness, isn't it? Particularly against  
foes using longer range weapons. And there's little  
that can be done about that just by moving sideways.  
  
**Monika：**  
Hmm...  
This is rather troubling.

`image display end`  
**Monika：**  
You have a way around it, you say?  
Wh-what would that be?  
  
**Monika：**  
The sky...?  
Ohh. If attacking from both the front and sides isn't an option,  
then I should just come from above instead.  
  
**Monika：**  
That makes sense. Plus, they wouldn't expect it.  
It'd be a good way to catch them off guard.  
  
**Monika：**  
What's more, \"Weissflügel\" translates to white wings.  
The image of me soaring through the sky to attack fits perfectly  
with that imagery.  
Keen insight as always, my friend.  
  
**Monika：**  
Of course, this is all much easier said than done.  
It won't be possible without sufficient training and practice.  
  
**Monika：**  
{player}...  
Would you be willing to help me with that?  
  
**Choice: (4)**  Of course.  
`Tag 4`  
**Monika：**  
R-Really? That's a relief...  
How about we get started, then?  
  
**Monika：**  
{player}! Now's not the time for a break!  
We're only halfway through today's drills!  
If anything, we're just getting started!  
  
**Monika：**  
Lower body and core strength are important!  
Which means more running! Let's do an extra ten kilometers!  
  
**Narration：**  
And thus {player} was fated to even more hours of intense drills.
