**Narration：**  
The day of the tournament finally arrives.  
  
**Monika：**  
I-It's finally time!  
  
**Monika：**  
I'm confident in how strong I've become.  
All thanks to your help, of course.  
Now it's just a matter of showing that off here.  
  
**Monika：**  
Or so I thought, but...  
  
**Monika：**  
Oh, no. It's nothing!  
I-I still need to get my entry sorted, so I'll be off now.  
You'll be speaking to the champion when we next meet. Bye!  
  
**Monika：**  
Urgh... This isn't good.  
I couldn't bring myself to tell him the truth.  
  
**Monika：**  
Who would have thought they'd impose a height limit?  
One that I can't clear, to boot...  
  
**Monika：**  
I-It's not exactly easy to bring up, though.  
Not after all the help he gave me.  
  
**Monika：**  
This is a tricky situation.  
I... slightly exaggerated my height on the entry form,  
but even then...  
  
**Monika：**  
No. Don't give up just yet, Monika.  
It's entirely possible that I had a sudden growth spurt overnight!  
  
**Monika：**  
There's also no guarantee that they're scrutinizing  
each and every entry.  
It's worth a try at the very least!  
  
**Staff：**  
Line up, everyone! We'll measure your heights in order!  
  
**Monika：**  
It's over...  
I can't believe they're actually measuring everyone...  
  
**Staff：**  
Next!  
That's you, young lady.  
Please make your way over here.  
  
**Monika：**  
S-sorry. Do you mind if I use the bathroom first?  
  
**Staff：**  
Don't worry. This won't take long at all.  
Come on over.  
  
**Monika：**  
O-okay... My fate is sealed.  
  
**Staff：**  
Let's see here...  
Hmm. 138 centimeters, it seems.  
  
**Staff：**  
I'm very sorry, but we have a rule in place that all participants  
must be at least 140 centimeters tall.  
Just to avoid any possible accidents.  
  
**Monika：**  
Figures...  
I-I may not meet the height requirements,  
but I'm more than capable of holding my own in combat!  
  
**Monika：**  
That's not all. A comrade of mine also  
gave up much of their time to help me train for this!  
Please! Don't make their efforts go to waste!  
  
**Monika：**  
I'm begging you!  
Please let me participate!  
  
**Staff：**  
I'd love to help,  
but these regulations are in place for a reason...  
  
**Monika：**  
Then make me an exception!  
  
**Participant 1：**  
What's going on?  
Is someone getting kicked out?  
  
**Participant 2：**  
Come on, my dude.  
I get that you've got rules, but she's practically begging you here.  
Just let her join.  
  
**Monika：**  
Allies in dark times!  
  
**Staff：**  
I'm sorry, but no.  
Rules are rules. We can't make exceptions.  
  
**Participant 1：**  
Man, now you're just bullying a kid.  
If you're gonna go this far,  
then at least make a kids' division or something!  
  
**Participant 2：**  
Yeah!  
How come there ain't one in the first place?  
Then this wouldn't be an issue!  
  
**Monika：**  
Err, uh...  
You *do* realize I'm not a child—  
  
**Participants：**  
Kids' division! Kids' division!  
  
**Monika：**  
No, really. I'm not—  
  
**Participants：**  
Kids' division! Kids' division!  
  
**Staff：**  
F-Fine, okay!  
I was in the wrong!  
So please, be quiet!  
  
**Monika：**  
Really?!  
Does that mean I can participate now?!  
  
**Staff：**  
Oh, no. I meant that we'll make a kids' division next time.  
So be a good little girl for us until then, okay?  
  
**Monika：**  
Urkkk... Grr...!  
Kids this, kids that! Shut up! Every single one of you, *shut up!*  
I'm not a child! I'll prove that to you right here and now!  
  
**Participant 1：**  
W-whoa!  
She's off the hook!  
Someone stop her!  
  
**Choice: (1)**  Intervene.  
`Tag 1`  
**Monika：**  
Don't tell me you saw all of that?!  
If so, then don't stop me!  
I won't be satisfied until they all get what's coming to them!  
  
**Staff：**  
Y-you're disqualified!  
Someone call the guards!  
Kick her out!  
  
**Monika：**  
I-I'm sorry you had to see that...  
You spent all that time helping me out,  
only for it to all go to waste...  
  
**Choice: (2)**  No need to apologize.  
**Choice: (3)**  Were you that desperate to participate?  
`Tag 2`  
**Monika：**  
Y-you're willing to forgive me?  
Even after disappointing you that much?  
  
Jump to tag 4  
`Tag 3`  
**Monika：**  
Of course I was!  
That's what all the effort was for!  
  
`Tag 4`  
**Monika：**  
What's that?  
My goal for participating in the first place?.  
Surely I told you that alre—  
  
**Monika：**  
I see. You still remember. I'm the one that forgot, aren't I?  
  
**Monika：**  
My original goal was to become a splendid soldier.  
To show that I'm fit enough to represent Weissflügel!  
  
**Monika：**  
I almost lost sight of that.  
Thank you for helping me see the light, {player}.  
  
**Monika：**  
Now then. With that important fact in mind,  
let's set our sights on the future.  
Come, {player}! We're going home!  
  
**Narration：**  
Newly invigorated by {player}'s words, Monika was able to look past the day's incident.
